11
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:00,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's a thing.

12
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:04,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those commercials where they would sing the blues and it was the 501 blues.

13
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:08,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remember the Saturday Night Live commercials that were bad idea jeans.

14
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have those classic clips on YouTube or did NBC pull them all?

15
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

16
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,488
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a bunch of them on Hulu.

17
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You could watch a lot of the goth talks and fluffy talk.

18
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:24,270
[SPEAKER_08]: That was back when all the funny people were on Saturday Night Live.

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,571
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny people were on Saturday Night Live my senior year of high school.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,439
[SPEAKER_08]: or I mean to be fair before somebody snaps at us if you're not talking about the originals from 75

22
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:07,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I've watched it off and on.

23
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:15,559
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a time where there was a lot of people in there that I thought were funny and then I stopped watching after a while because I'm like, eh, they're not funny anymore.

24
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I came back and they're like, oh, okay, you're funny again.

25
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're kind of at that, oh, they're not funny anymore.

26
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't really watch it anymore.

27
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:25,866
[SPEAKER_08]: If really funny things happen, the internet blows up about it and there's clips on Hulu.

28
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:32,371
[SPEAKER_08]: But I remember back in the day when I was in junior high school, that was the thing, was staying up late on Saturday night to watch Saturday Night Live and like,

29
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you get all the way?

30
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you stay up late enough to make it to the end of the show?

31
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you fall asleep after weekend update?

32
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:38,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You had that much problem?

33
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

34
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, my Friday night going into Saturday morning was a pot of... In junior high, yes, I had that problem.

35
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this was high school, okay?

36
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:46,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

37
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:52,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Was a pot of coffee, probably two, and it was Saturday Night Live followed by Headbangers Ball.

38
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Followed by 120 Minutes.

39
00:02:57,504 --> 00:03:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like listen to like Pantera and all that all night and then go into The Cure.

40
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:03,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah.

41
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:04,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of my prog rock.

42
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:05,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

43
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to have a Kate Bush revival tonight.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to my senior year.

47
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:16,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember there were some video games based off Saturday Night Live.

48
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:18,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Wayne's World game, which was awful.

49
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Wayne's World game was awful.

50
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:21,775
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awful.

51
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Bringing it back to video games, which the show is about.

52
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:31,101
[SPEAKER_08]: With you guys live in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, live.vognetwork.com in our chat room if you want to join us here.

55
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:42,751
[SPEAKER_08]: So tying it back to games, Saturday Night Live games, there was a Blues Brothers game, I'm pretty sure, too.

56
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

57
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:47,736
[SPEAKER_08]: When they had that movie, when they had the Blues Brothers 2000 or whatever, there was that.

58
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:51,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there other Saturday Night Live movies that might have been, or...

59
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm just imagining what if there was an It's Pat game.

60
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever see the movie, though?

61
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:57,561
[SPEAKER_08]: It was weird.

62
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched part of it, and I was like, the hell is this crap?

63
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Wayne's World movies were great, but not a good game.

64

[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, fifth dream in our chat says, Kier cross Pokemon.

00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:44,734
[SPEAKER_08]: The Samurai Taylor.

71
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:45,375
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it, right?

72
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was also the Samurai Butcher and the Deli.

73
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a thing.

74
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,479
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always him in different things, yeah.

75
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:57,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I also liked the one of Dana Carvey as... God, no, who was it he was being... Brian Adams, was it?

[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

77
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

78
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:20,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.

79
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:22,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

80
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:26,146
[SPEAKER_08]: From old school SNL people to video games.

81
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:28,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick before we get into our gaming week, so I'll make this quick.

82
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:33,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a big show last week, so this week might be a little easier.

83
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking it easy.

84
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:35,953
[SPEAKER_08]: They had an Austin Powers game.

85
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:37,874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of... Oh, they did!

86
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,815
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of Saturday Night Live.

87
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:40,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for looking that up.

88
00:05:41,476 --> 00:06:10,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to throw this out there real quick technically this was the other show that I do under the OLR Studios banner which is Horde House but I just wanted to give this a shout out because I thought this was great this morning was that multiple sclerosis walk and I've talked about it on this show a couple times that finally happened this morning and great turnout and great participation from some folks here locally and the internet and the WoW community and the gaming community in general raised over $1,600 if you can believe it for multiple sclerosis research

89
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:11,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,520
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

91
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So now the goal next year is to outdo that.

92
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,784
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to push 2K next year.

93
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:18,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So watch yourselves.

94
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:20,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it next year.

95
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:27,371
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I'm thinking, you know, I had so much fun doing that that we need to think of something OLR charity related like six months from now.

96
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:30,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, you know, Horde House, OLR, Horde House.

97
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,755
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're going to have to think of something to get involved with.

98
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do one of the autism charities that is not Autism Speaks because they're assholes.

99
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:47,955
[SPEAKER_08]: controversy but whatever we'll find a charity that's near and dear to our causes we need to have a car wash

100
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: The OLR Car Wash The OLR Car Wash

101
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I like meeting OLR fans, and sometimes I meet them in very random places.

102
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Evan that just friended me on Facebook yesterday?

103
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:23,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

104
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he have a Liara pic?

105
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, he has an MS pic now.

106
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he had a Liara pic, and now it's a... I don't know, but whoever that is, you're nice.

107
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:31,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's nice.

108
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:31,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you're very nice.

109
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him.

110
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:32,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have come out today.

111
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:33,558
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have met him.

112
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:34,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's going to have to come back.

113
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was busy sleeping.

114
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:45,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, my goal was to get up this morning, but I think I still have, like, how much booze did I drink on my birthday?

115
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,419
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.

116
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,360
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.

117
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it.

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you for the beer, by the way.

119
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:50,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.

120
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:51,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

121
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,142
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your birthday?

122
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy late birthday to DarkSakura, by the way.

123
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

124
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,204
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday was gamey.

125
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,686
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, you did not sing any Atlantis at my party, Rob.

126
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, we only made a cameo and I didn't get around to singing Alanis, I'm sorry.

127
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But Becky sang Alone for me.

128
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up singing in the background, I think, because I was drunk.

129
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:11,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I played keyboards for that.

130
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,000
[SPEAKER_02]: You played keyboards.

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good.

132
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:17,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded the song just so that Becky would sing it, our resident, very good soprano.

133
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:18,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

134
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,351
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think I sang Band on the Run once.

135
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:25,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this was the funniest part.

136
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: This happened after you left.

137
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:33,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Julian, Becky's son, who's going to be six in like a week or so, he wanted me to sing.

138
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that Dan's little cousin?

139
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's cousin's daughter.

140
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Hannah's daughter, Sophia.

141
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:40,941
[SPEAKER_08]: They were cute, being cute kids.

142
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:41,562
[SPEAKER_02]: They were adorable.

143
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:41,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

144
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But Julian was like, sing the Pink Robot song!

145
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.

146
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:53,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So, about a third through the song, Julian has the chorus memorized.

147
00:08:54,428 --> 00:09:00,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's singing along to the song with me, and it's like my second favorite song ever in the universe.

148
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:06,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're sitting here swaying back and forth, and I've got a good three beers and a shot of vodka in me.

149
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So we won't be able to get an encore now?

150
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:08,015
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

151
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: and Julian is singing along with me and it is seriously the cutest thing that has ever happened in my entire life.

152
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Midna decided to come out and be Little Miss Social, which I thought she was going to go hide in the back room, but no, she's like, oh my god, people pet me.

153
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: She hates Gary.

154
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

155
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda?

156
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she said she couldn't do it this night.

157
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,372
[SPEAKER_02]: She had to do it later tonight because she has something Depeche Mode-y going on.

158
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You know she does a lot of blogging for Depeche Mode.

159
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:00,856
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

160
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:02,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to like seven of their shows.

161
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

162
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:03,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

163
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:07,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she went to like a series of 12 shows in Germany last year.

164
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tequila that I don't hate.

166
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It still kicked my ass.

167
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:33,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost got you Patron.

168
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:35,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

169
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you this for future reference.

170
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:39,719
[SPEAKER_02]: No tequila.

171
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,560
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought you liked Patron.

172
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Patron OK, but do you know how long it took me to drink the last bottle you got me?

173
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:45,496
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

174
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:48,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished it for my birthday last year and you got it for me when I turned 30.

175
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then I must have had a psychic moment because I was going to get it and then I was like, you know what, maybe I should just bring beer.

176
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:59,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob brought me Guinness and Guinness is the best gift ever and I'm going to cook steak with it.

177
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,611
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

178
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:08,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, apparently the theme of my birthday was booze, which is pretty much the theme of every birthday every year, if I'm not at Disneyland.

179
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:17,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And they busted out, George brought his Wii U, and that Injustice game, whatever that DC game is, you know how I feel about DC.

180
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:25,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was actually kind of neat, except I thought that the character models were supremely bizarre.

181
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:33,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of good things about Injustice, but not on the Wii U. It's interesting to me that that was the platform you got exposed to it on, because I've heard the Wii U one is a little weak compared to the others.

182
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:45,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had no basis of comparison, and I'm sitting here like... And I'm just copy-pasting internet hearsay, so... I'm catching the end of the game when, like, three of my friends are passed out from booze.

183
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:49,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sitting there sobering, because you know how quickly that happens for me.

184
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like...

185
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:10,815
[SPEAKER_02]: watching this game and going what the hell is up with Wonder Woman's hair that's the only thing I could focus on was Wonder Woman's hair and that there were two Batmans when I was playing Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe I was a little fixated on how weird Wonder Woman was too and then like Joker looked bizarre but it was the right Batman it was Kevin Conroy oh nice

186
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:13,051
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cure and Depeche Mode in one podcast.

187
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like goth lounge radio.

188
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.

189
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We're progressive.

190
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:36,876
[SPEAKER_02]: We're progressive.

191
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to attack the darkness.

192
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:39,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

193
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw in our chat saying Injustice is pretty awesome.

194
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:42,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat the story mode.

195
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:46,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you see, Gary was playing it, but I didn't care because I was watching it.

196
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:47,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And so...

197
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing I remember is Amanda waking up in time to go, that's where Depeche Mode is in this game, and going back to sleep.

198
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:01,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I remember that the end song was done by Depeche Mode, and it was actually a really neat song.

199
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:13,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, it was mostly a lot of us hanging out in the kitchen, in the dining room, staring at the evil bell pepper pizza that, oh my god, it was so gross.

200
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:14,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to pick all the bell peppers off because I'm allergic.

201
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just drinking and then children running all over the place.

202
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But cute children who don't piss me off, so it was good.

203
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:26,929
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my birthday.

204
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to ask about your gaming week, but you did a lot of it.

205
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:32,431
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

206
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then why not?

207
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just do our gaming weeks.

208
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Catastrophic Moggy gave me that Sam & Max game on Steam and Resonance.

209
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other game, I forgot what it was, but I downloaded everything.

210
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:48,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played some of the game I'm not supposed to talk about, Trademark.

211
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:57,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I'm in love, I'm quitting well So, um, I, uh, what else did I play?

212
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:14,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I live streamed Mass Effect 2 And so what I'm gonna do since we don't have anybody on Thursday We don't have any shows on Thursday Is that I'm just gonna play through Mass Effect 2 on the stream So that people can hear me talk shit about the characters Which is, basically, well Shane was there for that

213
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:23,813
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically all I do now when I play any of the Mass Effect games is that I talk back to the characters and I'm pretty rude to most of them.

214
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like, what is my Shepard's Inner Monologue?

215
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:32,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So if people want to see a playthrough where they're not talking back, don't look at your channel because you're a talker.

216
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's like, I'll play it mostly quiet, but sometimes somebody will say something, and it's like, because you know how I feel about a good portion of the writing, and I will just go, what?

217
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:48,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Or go, no one cares what you have to say, Jacob, you know, and move on, and it's that type of commentary.

218
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:48,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

219
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sort of MST3K-ing it as I play.

220
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:51,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

221
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:52,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

222
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:53,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

223
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:54,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the DarkSakura experience.

224
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had pink berry and coffee, and I'm very hyper, so excuse me.

225
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:00,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't tell.

226
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:00,925
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

227
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello as well to Loki, and how was your gaming week?

228
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:06,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

229
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:10,029
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week, I played Defiance.

230
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I played lots of Defiance, actually, and I'm up to 340 now.

231
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,132
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't really have levels.

232
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like power levels.

233
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:21,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I should maybe get this game.

234
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:23,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fun.

235
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they don't have, like I said, levels.

236
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:28,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like your power level, I guess.

237
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:29,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Ball Z-ish.

238
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:40,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can do stuff... I mean, you do level up and your power goes up by so much, but you can do other things that raise your power level as well.

239
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,800
[SPEAKER_06]: They have side stuff, like...

240
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:43,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much like Borderlands.

241
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the whole game is very similar to Borderlands as far as, you know, the whole style of the game.

242
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:56,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can do, like, these time-challenged, you know, okay, this is a rampage and you have to kill, you know, this many people in this amount of time.

243
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's kind of its own instance thing.

244
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's also, like, races and stuff.

245
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:10,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Which sucks because when I first attempted some of these races, I was actually doing pretty well on them, but there was some sort of lag in it.

246
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:14,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd finish the race in the correct amount of time, but it would add two seconds to the clock every time.

247
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like I was missing a pylon or something like that.

248
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:18,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just...

249
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it was weird.

250
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:32,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully I did manage to hit silver on those, which is what you have to do to get your extra experience and levels and stuff.

251
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,153
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's pretty fun.

252
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:45,418
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I don't really like about it, because I have some guns that I find that are really fun to use and stuff, but once you've maxed out the level on those guns, you stop gaining experience on that weapon class.

253
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to switch to a different saw now to...

254
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

255
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

256
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:50,102
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's, I don't know, it's alright but I wish they had a little bit more variety to it maybe that will come out later on I did notice though, one of the things that they are doing is they have, I think I mentioned it last week they have specific challenges for the entire season and then specific challenges for each episode so as the episodes play on TV you get different stuff that I guess ties in with the episodes on TV like they have certain challenges that you have to do and stuff so I thought that was kind of cool

257
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

258
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:21,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo You're a loner

259
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:37,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not that.

260
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:58,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be fine joining clans and talking with them and stuff, but my wife reads or plays on the computer, and she hates it when I talk over the headset while I'm playing games because I have my noise-canceling headphones on, and so I tend to be loud because I think I'm talking on normal volume, but I can't hear myself because I have a headset on or headphones on.

261
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's been pretty fun.

262
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been playing that.

263
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a little bit of more Modern Warfare 3 just because I've been having trouble finding... Well, I wanted to play Defiance during work, like on lunch, but our internet sucks where we're located right now.

264
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:25,107
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the wireless hubs is over there that is not working, so I can't get internet on my Xbox 360 over there.

265
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:42,678
[SPEAKER_06]: so I've been doing kind of like the survival modes in Modern Warfare 3 and that's been kind of fun and you know multiplayer deathmatch when we can get enough people over there and really I think that was it this week it's been pretty much just Defiance just playing that

266
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Those MMO type of games will, you know, take up a bit of time.

267
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm having fun, even though it is very bland looking.

268
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:56,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's not a whole lot of variety to it, but it's entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.

269
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

270
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:57,511
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

271
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff.

272
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:02,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I revisited a few old things.

273
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:06,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I played World of Warcraft, of course, because I do that a lot.

274
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Still doing PvP and having fun with it.

275
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I did cancel Final Fantasy XI which I talked a little more about on Horde House but Shane was very upset but he's coping and I'm waiting for Civ V to go on sale so he can do his half of the bargain that'll be fun other old games I revisited random, super random, started playing Dota 2 because I hadn't really ever played it I've had the game viewer for a while but hadn't played it myself and the nice thing is in Dota 2 you can set up a bot game because I'm too afraid to play with real people because I have no idea what I'm doing and playing with the bots just reinforced that

276
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,890
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

277
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,420
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that's not very good.

278
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,783
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Guardians of Middle-Earth.

279
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,685
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not very good.

280
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:17,349
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really a genre I play.

281
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I played some more of Harmonite this week.

282
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:26,496
[SPEAKER_08]: There is another new game I played this week, but you'll have to wait for my review at vognitwork.com on Tuesday.

283
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:28,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Look for that on the site on Tuesday.

284
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:29,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

285
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really about it.

286
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Since there's the Tuesday game and then WOW took up most of my time, honestly.

287
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I was busy with out-of-town guests and so forth.

288
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you at all interested in the Star Trek game coming out next week?

289
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:47,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I would like to actually check that out.

290
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:48,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Trek game.

291
00:21:48,650 --> 00:22:13,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's based in the movie universe, it kind of bridges the first two games together Yeah, I've read some stuff about it, I'm interested in it Some of the Star Trek games for home have been pretty bad though It's supposed to have been in development for at least three years Well, it was supposed to come out with the first movie, and it didn't So they held it back to make it better or whatever, so let's hope it worked Some of the Star Trek games have been real stinkers But I remember the Next Generation game on Super Nintendo was awesome

292
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I actually did like Star Trek Online until they went free-to-play and ruined the skill system.

293
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see, you know, a game that plays like that but on a single player, you know?

294
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:28,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

295
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:36,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Sile, I can never say that name.

296
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:37,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry, guy.

297
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Sile says, I can't MOBA to save my ass.

298
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:43,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

299
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:46,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Queen Simia says, now I don't really get Dota 2.

300
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,311
[SPEAKER_08]: How did they work that out legally?

301
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:49,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Team Fortress Quake Mod

302
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:34,534
[SPEAKER_08]: so they hired them to make Dota 2 obviously Blizzard was not a fan of that but they worked at they settled as these legal things usually go Blizzard is going to call their game Blizzard All-Stars now is is their MOBA game and League of Legends was never called anything in the same category but I believe someone else involved with the original Dota mod is with the League of Legends team and Riot Games but I mean Riot Games is doing very well with League of Legends so you know

303
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:49,949
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of room at the table for all of them, apparently PrinceBrightStar in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says If you want a free-to-play that isn't pay-to-win, PSO2 is a great game I'm dying to play PSO2, but you must be playing the Japanese version, right?

304
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's not out here yet, right?

305
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,574
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think they're remotely doing betas yet I signed up for the beta ages ago, but I don't think that we're even close to US beta

306
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:00,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I am thinking that's an E3 thing.

307
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:01,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking Sega's sitting on it until E3.

308
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:02,675
[SPEAKER_06]: They have nothing.

309
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:05,156
[SPEAKER_06]: There's literally nothing on the table for them coming out.

310
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I tell you what, there's nothing on the table for them coming out right now except for a couple of PC titles in June.

311
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:13,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's nothing.

312
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no announcements so far.

313
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing pending.

314
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:37,414
[SPEAKER_08]: uh i speaking of sega i did overlook an ios game i played a little bit this week sonic dash it's free on ios it is temple run sonic that is all it is with if you want your temple run with sonic rings there you go i actually find it to be i mean the pros of sonic dash is that oh sonic

315
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:42,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty, bright, vibrant compared to Temple Run, which is a little bit drab.

316
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:45,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but it's kind of a drab palette in those games.

317
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic is very bright, vibrant.

318
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:48,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Characters you know.

319
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,840
[SPEAKER_08]: The ring sound is always refreshing to use that.

320
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I do find it as a game and so forth to be underpolished compared to Temple Run.

321
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:04,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Pitfall was really well done for a Temple Run ripoff.

322
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:11,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very interesting to see all these established franchises kind of ripping on what's going on now that's popular.

323
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,248
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fascinating to me how that kind of comes full circle.

324
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:18,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually indirectly reminded me of another game that I started.

325
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:21,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Dimensions for iOS.

326
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:22,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a good one.

327
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I only just started it, but it's cute.

328
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very old school.

329
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,193
[SPEAKER_08]: The control's interesting.

330
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:28,894
[SPEAKER_08]: The good news about that one is that it's free.

331
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

332
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you like that one, that's very similar to what... I'll get five.

333
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what five looks like.

334
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:33,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

335
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But five is... But I don't want to pay 17 bucks for it yet.

336
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:35,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

337
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:36,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

338
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:44,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mention it in my week because I haven't gotten it yet, but my Ouya has shipped, apparently, via DHL.

339
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,018
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'm so sorry.

340
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:47,858
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a chance that I may get it.

341
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:48,598
[SPEAKER_06]: You should get it next year.

342
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:49,898
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get it eventually.

343
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:51,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe in time for Christmas.

344
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:54,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

345
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:55,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said enough.

346
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:56,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So, just quick housekeeping.

347
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:57,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot.

348
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,886
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any off shows coming up soon.

349
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe gone Memorial Day weekend, though.

350
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be out of town.

351
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,353
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not until the end of May, so we'll keep you posted.

352
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you go to Disneyland, take me.

353
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:10,694
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not going to.

354
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:11,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a pass anymore.

355
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:12,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So?

356
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: If I go to Disneyland, the next time I will probably go is in E3.

357
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:20,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have to figure all that out, which, you know, I've been a bad boy.

358
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:21,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do Discon.

359
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:23,317
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two parts to registration.

360
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:27,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done the first part, but not the second part, because I need to get off my ass and do it, but I keep getting distracted with all this other stuff.

361
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:34,560
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless of whether I go to E3 or not, Bobby's going to represent VOG, and...

362
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,881
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

363
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:24,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR Please follow us in our fan communities And next week on the show If all goes according to plan Which I don't see why it won't Two long time friends of mine Who I've been trying to get on the show for years Are finally going to be here next week And I'm really excited about it And one of them hosts another podcast That you all ought to be listening to And I'll tell you more about that next week We should all do lunch

364
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,412
[SPEAKER_08]: We will try to work it out.

365
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:28,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Twerk it.

366
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:29,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

367
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us get into the gaming news this week.

368
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:36,200
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of news out of Nintendo this week, right, Loki?

369
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:38,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, a lot of stuff.

370
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,861
[SPEAKER_06]: They had their special Nintendo Direct thing that was all 3DS.

371
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly 3DS, I suppose.

372
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,144
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS-centric, I guess.

373
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:56,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the big announcements there is, hey, we're doing a new 3DS game for the Legend of Zelda series on the 3DS.

374
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:57,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

375
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,370
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sequel to Link of the Past.

376
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we just took the best game we made and we made a sequel.

377
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very, very happy.

378
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm most happy it's not another freaking remake.

379
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:11,236
[SPEAKER_08]: That they're doing something different with it.

380
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really would urge you guys, if you are a 3DS owner, check out the trailer.

381
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the trailer, YouTube doesn't do it justice.

382
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:19,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Like seeing it on 3DS is pretty rad.

383
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:23,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Even better than the trailer, they actually have some leaked gameplay of it.

384
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:24,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And check that out.

385
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:28,491
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like, I think at least like five minutes of gameplay and it looks pretty awesome.

386
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:49,632
[SPEAKER_06]: but it takes place in the same world as Link to the Past in fact actually they had there's some people on NeoGAF I think that actually took some of the screenshots from the video and lined it up with like some of the stuff that's in game and yes it does there are a few minor changes but yes it's the map is pretty much the same or at least it appears that's gonna be what happened

387
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:52,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty awesome.

388
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a whole lot of other stuff.

389
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:57,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So first off, you've got Pikmin 3.

390
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,476
[SPEAKER_06]: We were wondering when the hell this was supposed to come out.

391
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:04,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be a near launch window title for the...

392
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:09,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still not sure if it's launch window because it is now August 4th.

393
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:14,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Game & Warrior now coming out June 23rd.

394
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:25,307
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a brand new system update for the Wii U, I guess, pretty soon this coming week.

395
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to add some stuff that they were teasing about before on some of the other Nintendo Directs.

396
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:59,004
[SPEAKER_06]: one of those being the ability to install updates while playing other games so you're going to be able to install software and updates and that kind of stuff it's also improved load times from starting new apps up to switching between stuff and returning back to the Wii U menu also if you hold the B button when you start the system up it'll go into Wii mode in case you want to play a Wii game you don't have to take all those extra steps I guess so you can play with your Wii easier

397
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:05,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and you'll be able to transfer data between USB drives and some other stuff.

398
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:06,419
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's kind of neat.

399
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:09,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

400
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:21,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, to kind of coincide with the whole Legend of Zelda announcement, they're going to be putting up Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on the 3DS eShop.

401
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: That's May 30th.

402
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:28,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U Virtual Console is coming out next week as well.

403
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,548
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be...

404
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Which game are they launching with here?

405
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:48,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say what the brand new game is, but basically the launch lineup, Excitebike, Super Mario World, Mario Bros., Punch-Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, F-Zero, and GBA games and Nintendo 64 games planned later on.

406
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:50,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

407
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,948
[SPEAKER_06]: New Yoshi Island game coming to the 3DS.

408
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:02,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that's going to tie in with that new Yoshi Yarn type game that they have coming out later on.

409
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:07,034
[SPEAKER_06]: But they showed a little bit of footage of it and it looks just like Yoshi Island.

410
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:11,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario and Donkey Kong Minis on the move coming to the eShop on May 9th.

411
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:16,961
[SPEAKER_06]: New Super Luigi U DLC coming to New Super Mario Bros.

412
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,963
[SPEAKER_06]: U later in the summer.

413
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:22,425
[SPEAKER_06]: New Mario Party is supposed to be coming out this fall.

414
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:31,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario and Luigi Dream Team coming out in Europe July 12th and North America August 11th.

415
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:33,386
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

416
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:54,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm changing between, you know, the different softwares.

417
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:55,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's super slow right now.

418
00:31:55,868 --> 00:31:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not that great right now.

419
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other little features you might not have known about.

420
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:07,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the one everybody's waiting for, but also you're going to be able to transfer data between the USB drives, and you can install background downloaded software while playing other games.

421
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize you couldn't do that now.

422
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:15,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you could do, like, remember, because remember the system updates, you can kind of install those while you're playing...

423
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, regardless, that whole thing is going to get better, so that's good.

424
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:29,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Wii U will continue to download and install software while the system is powered down, which you don't have to go set yourself on that screen and wait for it to do it.

425
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:33,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these are all things that seem very logical in this day and age, so thankfully they're catching up there.

426
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:39,692
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also, this is pretty cool, hold the B button at the startup to go right into the Wii mode.

427
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:47,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you just got Pandora's Tower or something and you're playing it on your Wii U, it's a great way for you to just bypass all the crap and go right into the Wii if you want.

428
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:52,438
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid that you just put in a Wii game into your system and have it just boot up.

429
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:54,739
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it has to go into the Wii shell.

430
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,060
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so dumb.

431
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,323
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think the way the console's built is that you have a Wii in there to do all that.

432
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's still really dumb.

433
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:11,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird, but if they're using different graphics processors and all that, then I get it.

434
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,936
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird, but it might just not be technically possible.

435
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:20,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Loki touched on this a little bit, talking about some of those virtual console releases, but just to confirm...

436
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:23,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console happens on Wii U next week.

437
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:31,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Launch lineup, Excitebike, Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch-Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, and F-Zero.

438
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those games have already come out through the 30 Cent program.

439
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:38,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I know F-Zero is one of those, Balloon Fight, Punch-Out.

440
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these haven't happened yet, though.

441
00:33:40,642 --> 00:33:43,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario World isn't one of them, and I don't think it's in the lineup.

442
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I think... Is the next game Super Metroid?

443
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,087
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the next game is like a Yoshi game, I think.

444
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:49,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say Super Mario World.

445
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,488
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like 30 cents.

446
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

447
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:55,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But GBA games are part of this, which is cool because that wasn't on Wii.

448
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,891
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't have GBA games on Wii.

449
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You had them on DS, 3DS.

450
00:33:59,232 --> 00:33:59,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

451
00:33:59,472 --> 00:33:59,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But not we.

452
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:04,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you only got advanced games through the Ambassador Program.

453
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Have they done advanced games?

454
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:06,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.

455
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:07,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they have.

456
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:09,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So this could be interesting, what'll happen there.

457
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:10,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know why they wouldn't.

458
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

459
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo 64 games coming out in the future as well.

460
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:24,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Which were on the Wii, so, you know, for most people it'll be an upgrade, I suppose And then, DarkSakura, I think you have a Whopper bin of news for us too, right?

461
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do, if Bobby will stop spoiling Seriously, stop telling about the future You know what happens, you watch Doctor Who, don't you?

462
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway

463
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthbound is going to be coming out in North America and Europe as in Mother 2, as it was in Japan.

464
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be on the Wii U Virtual Console towards the end of the year.

465
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see that there is an actual release date on it yet, but I'm expecting them to have a date out before E3.

466
00:34:57,937 --> 00:35:01,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless they're saving that date for E3 or whatever the hell they're doing.

467
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,822
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably be a bullet point, E3, that's about it.

468
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:07,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that could be one of those things where it's like, oh yeah, remember how we said EarthBound was coming out?

469
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get it, it's up now, right now.

470
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,932
[SPEAKER_02]: No, why don't we get Mother 3?

471
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:17,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know the fan translators offered to give it to Nintendo for free, but legally I don't think that can happen.

472
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:20,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

473
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:21,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Why if they agree to it?

474
00:35:21,664 --> 00:35:33,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see what... I think it's just weird territory because they had to do things that Nintendo doesn't endorse per the terms of license in order to mod the game.

475
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:38,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Like dumping a cartridge to your computer is not something you're supposed to do to begin with.

476
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:42,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not in your user agreement that is that fine print in the manual.

477
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:46,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think if Nintendo were to legally acknowledge that, it puts them in a really weird place.

478
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but people do a lot of stuff they're not supposed to do all the time.

479
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:54,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

480
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:59,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they would find a way around it if they wanted to find a way around it.

481
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their property.

482
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:02,305
[SPEAKER_02]: They can give the permission.

483
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: But, leaving it there.

484
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:08,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm excited even though I already have it.

485
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:23,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm excited about Earthbound 2 just because it's a much, you know, for those of us that don't have a cartridge lying around, which I don't anymore, now I'm kicking myself for selling this shit years ago, but it's a nice way to pick it up again.

486
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Wii U Virtual Console is pretty good.

487
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:29,627
[SPEAKER_08]: They pulled it off very well.

488
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,650
[SPEAKER_08]: The sound sounds great out of the four speakers between your TV and the gamepad.

489
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to come over and actually just sit and play the Wii U for a while.

490
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're probably holding out for the PS4 ourselves.

491
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,379
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, that's where we're landing at home.

492
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

493
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

494
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:53,935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, so we're curious.

495
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,596
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of Nintendo news.

496
00:36:56,136 --> 00:37:01,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious in here in the room, what were you guys most jazzed about from the Nintendo Direct?

497
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:08,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, I should take a big step back because, Loki, you're the biggest critic of Nintendo on this show.

498
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:11,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you moved at all by this Nintendo Direct?

499
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:12,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you like, meh?

500
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the biggest critic of everybody.

501
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:16,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fair enough.

502
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

503
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,427
[SPEAKER_06]: None of the news... I mean, once again, I'm not going to go buy a system.

504
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:26,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go get a 3DS again just for Legend of Zelda.

505
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:29,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's cool that they're doing that game.

506
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,899
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the other announcements I couldn't really care about.

507
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like Yoshi's Island.

508
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:35,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, whatever.

509
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:36,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool.

510
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:38,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a sequel, I guess.

511
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:46,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just... I mean, at the same time, I like that they're doing sequels to their old titles, but I kind of wish there was something new.

512
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:50,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just something new from Nintendo.

513
00:37:50,928 --> 00:37:54,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of it seems to be going back to, like, rehashes of old things.

514
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know everybody loves nostalgia, but I just want something new.

515
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:03,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a brand new property from Nintendo that doesn't resemble Wii Sports.

516
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't resemble Nintendo Land.

517
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:05,951
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a...

518
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:09,633
[SPEAKER_06]: 2D Mario remake or something like that.

519
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:11,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Galaxy was a good example of something.

520
00:38:12,015 --> 00:38:12,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of like Mario 64.

521
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:16,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it was so different.

522
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:17,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

523
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,060
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Mario, but it's really not.

524
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want something like that.

525
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:27,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if they put Mario or Link's face on it, you're okay.

526
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You just want some new ideas.

527
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:31,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just want something new.

528
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because a lot of...

529
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:45,247
[SPEAKER_06]: and don't don't get me wrong I think that the whole you know new Zelda game is pretty awesome but I mean I guess it is a little bit different it's a different approach to it in the same world and stuff and it's all 3D now but

530
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:47,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

531
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:49,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of want something new from them, I guess.

532
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Something innovative.

533
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:54,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross Steel UT in our chatroom says, I wasn't really jazzed about anything.

534
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:55,976
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3DS is doing fine.

535
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:58,939
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Wii U news and not fucking Earthbound.

536
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a reason this is happening now and not at E3.

537
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:07,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of people are saying, shouldn't they have announced the link to the past sequel at E3?

538
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems very weird that they would just on a random day of the week for no reason announce a Zelda sequel.

539
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,193
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a pretty big deal.

540
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping that means they are clearing space.

541
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's what they did last time.

542
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, they had three Nintendo Directs and their stupid press conference.

543
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:23,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

544
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:27,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, also keep in mind, Nintendo can only really speak to a lot of Nintendo stuff.

545
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:29,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't always get into third-party stuff.

546
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:30,562
[SPEAKER_08]: They do, obviously.

547
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:41,004
[SPEAKER_08]: They do sometimes, but sometimes a lot more third-party information comes out at E3, which, considering the Wii U could really use a boost from third parties, that would be a great thing.

548
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:46,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think maybe Bayonetta 2, this E3, do you think they've been able to push it out this fast, or maybe not?

549
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:46,385
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

550
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,346
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't think so?

551
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:48,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be on stuff other than the Wii U.

552
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:50,026
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't.

553
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:51,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but it needs to be.

554
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't.

555
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Never say never.

556
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, never say never.

557
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:56,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Never say never.

558
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:56,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's why.

559
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:57,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's why.

560
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Because... Don't stop believing.

561
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Tecmo Koei developed Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge for the Wii U. It was published by Nintendo.

562
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Came out in other systems later on, published by Tecmo Koei.

563
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:13,475
[SPEAKER_06]: They could easily, if it flops, and I'm sure...

564
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd hope that they have something in there that says, okay, this game flops so we can put it on other systems.

565
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll come out later.

566
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be like a time delay.

567
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:26,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're going to have a window or something and then it'll come out later on.

568
00:40:26,364 --> 00:40:28,205
[SPEAKER_02]: All five of you who bought a Wii U, here.

569
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:28,885
[SPEAKER_02]: A month later.

570
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:29,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, everybody else.

571
00:40:29,986 --> 00:40:31,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think they're going to price drop at E3.

572
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's just the inevitable thing that's going to happen.

573
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:38,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they might sneak out the Wii backwards compatibility if my hunch is correct.

574
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think a price drop is going to help.

575
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:41,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it'll help, but it's not going to be enough.

576
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:42,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

577
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: because the excuses right now, I think there's nothing I can say on it.

578
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:49,440
[SPEAKER_08]: All they have to do is exactly what they did with the 3DS.

579
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,445
[SPEAKER_08]: If they do exactly what they did with the 3DS at this E3, if Reggie comes out on stage and says, you want some fucking games?

580
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:57,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some fucking games.

581
00:40:58,087 --> 00:40:59,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And then bam, bam, bam.

582
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:01,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to fix everything.

583
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:10,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy to sit here now and say no, but when he comes out and says... If he goes F-Zero is fucking happening on the Wii U, like...

584
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:11,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.

585
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:13,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo is saved.

586
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:13,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurrah.

587
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're going to have time because, okay.

588
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But they pulled Mario Kart 7 out of thin air.

589
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,591
[SPEAKER_08]: They pulled the, what was the other game that came out?

590
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just say it was being worked on behind the scenes.

591
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:23,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

592
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:25,536
[SPEAKER_08]: They could still be working on stuff that we don't know about.

593
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:28,018
[SPEAKER_02]: There's such things as NDAs and people who don't break them.

594
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:35,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think, though, that, but right now we know that there's no EA, for example, there's no EA Sports titles for the Wii U at all.

595
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:35,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

596
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:38,147
[SPEAKER_06]: No Madden, no FIFA, nothing.

597
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:39,367
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

598
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:42,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, no NBA 2K either.

599
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:47,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I understand if you're thinking about purchasing a new system.

600
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:52,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's say a lot of mainstream people that buy games do play Madden or do play a sports title.

601
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not everybody.

602
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

603
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,291
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people do.

604
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of disappointing.

605
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of makes you think, do I really want to get a Wii U or do I want to pick up another system that's going to actually have the games I want on it?

606
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:12,839
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's also a photo of lack of confidence from these publishers and EA being a big publisher, I don't know.

607
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:24,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision's supporting them with garbage right now but they're supporting the Wii U. They have their Walking Dead game which is absolute shit and then followed by the...

608
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:31,331
[SPEAKER_06]: The Fast and the Furious Showdown, which I'm sure is going to be awesome and not total shit.

609
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:35,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty will be coming out, I'm sure.

610
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:37,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

611
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

612
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Strudels89 says, Rob's such the optimist.

613
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:44,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe a little bit.

614
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:49,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think they're going to roll over and let all their critics get the best of them.

615
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:51,359
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't do it with the 3DS.

616
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:51,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm just...

617
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that, but what is... Let me say this too, because this is an important follow-up comment.

618
00:42:56,924 --> 00:43:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Flaco Jones says, another third place finish like the GameCube, but they'll be fine.

619
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:11,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could see that happening, that maybe the Wii U is not going to shatter whatever this next Xbox, although if some of these rumors about the next Xbox come to play, I don't know if Nintendo would necessarily be third.

620
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:15,243
[SPEAKER_08]: But Sony's looking pretty good right now out of them all.

621
00:43:15,683 --> 00:43:23,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, even if they did finish third, and another comment, WhatUpG says Nintendo will be fine because their handheld is doing well.

622
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

623
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:30,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does put Nintendo in an interesting position where if they do decide to just, you know, okay, Wii U went all Virtual Boy, we're going to write it off.

624
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:35,674
[SPEAKER_08]: They might be in an interesting position where they could do another console and

625
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:44,179
[SPEAKER_08]: After whatever Microsoft and Sony does, it's going to put them in a very interesting position if they fix their mistakes.

626
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The history has shown they are not going to fix their mistakes.

627
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:52,305
[SPEAKER_06]: How long has it taken them to understand how to do online?

628
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:55,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's been around for a decade now.

629
00:43:55,907 --> 00:43:57,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to disagree with you there.

630
00:43:57,288 --> 00:44:00,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can't get online right, they're doomed.

631
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to disagree with you there.

632
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:06,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think that no matter what, Nintendo's going to be fine.

633
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,402
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making plenty of money with their handhelds.

634
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically, they could just put out a console for shits and say, hey, look, we have a console.

635
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the LOL U. LOL at you for buying it.

636
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:19,993
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL at you for buying it.

637
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:20,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

638
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:21,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

639
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:41,719
[SPEAKER_02]: but either way I mean it's and I've seen people draw comparisons between them and Sega with the Dreamcast which I actually think that that's completely not even close to the same part because what Sega was dealing with they were coming off the fallout of the Saturn and the very very awful marketing in the US they also didn't have oodles of money in the bank like Nintendo does exactly

640
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget all that Wii money.

641
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,443
[SPEAKER_08]: They made a lot of money on the Wii.

642
00:44:46,523 --> 00:44:50,907
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii turned a nice little profit because it wasn't the most powerful piece of hardware in the world.

643
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,168
[SPEAKER_08]: That money's in the bank.

644
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

645
00:44:55,691 --> 00:45:04,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll admit, I was standing in line for my Wii at Target, but we also bribed our way into the line with Donuts and Coffee, me and Kristen.

646
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's...

647
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:36,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is coming off a series of successes of near failures that they've turned around they don't have that problem with the marketing that Sega came out of I don't really see where the comparison really is except that okay so yeah white systems don't really do very well in the US but look at the Wii I don't know what that was because in Japan it was the Saturn was a silver box and over here it was a black box and it's just marketing is weird stuff

648
00:45:37,188 --> 00:45:51,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, before we move on to our next story, since this Nintendo Direct was one of the biggest news stories in gaming this week, we do want to take this opportunity to use our new feature on the website and go to a live listener poll.

649
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the live listener poll at VOGnetwork.com.

650
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:02,862
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are at live.vognetwork.com right now, you can participate in our live poll.

651
00:46:03,382 --> 00:46:07,024
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

652
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:08,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are the answers.

653
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:14,729
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG Earthbound, OMG Zelda Link to the Past sequel, OMG Yoshi's Island,

654
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:43,911
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG Super Luigi U or meh Nintendo vote now live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate in the poll live.vognetwork.com you'll see it right underneath the chat box I agree with Bob Coffee Sega, he said Sega was dealing with ship management and no Sega Tatsunoshiro we would have been okay I don't know if anyone other than like three of us knows about Sega Tatsunoshiro was the mascot of the Saturn in Japan

655
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy with floofy hair wearing a gi going around punching the hell out of everything.

656
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:54,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a commercial for him for the Dreamcast.

657
00:46:55,034 --> 00:46:58,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was even a Segata Sanshiro game that came out on Saturn.

658
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:02,656
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had Segata Sanshiro, still, the Dreamcast would have lived.

659
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting watching the live results of our poll coming in right now.

660
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:10,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Mad Nintendo is winning with half the vote right now.

661
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

662
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch this as it develops.

663
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:22,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Live.vognetwork.com You do have to be registered at VOG Network in order to be able to vote in the poll because, you know, there might be some little incentives on the site tied to participating.

664
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should check that out.

665
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:25,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

666
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:29,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, why don't we move on with more news besides just what's going on with Nintendo, right, Loki?

667
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:30,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

668
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:41,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so there was a series that was on TV that I was really hopeful for and then the writer's strike happened and the writing went downhill.

669
00:47:42,368 --> 00:47:43,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Heroes.

670
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:48,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the rumor is that Microsoft wants to bring back Heroes, reboot the whole series.

671
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:52,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously with new people because a lot of the cast has moved on to other things.

672
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of did this with heroes on the web.

673
00:47:55,179 --> 00:48:04,184
[SPEAKER_06]: They had their webisodes or something like that with some different hero characters that the fans designed, which were crap.

674
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:12,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'd be kind of cool to see a new series kick off.

675
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:18,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it just didn't fall into what I like to call the Matrix problem, where you give...

676
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:28,460
[SPEAKER_06]: A character like Neo, way too much power, too fast, and you're like, fuck, how do I deal with this the next movie or next season?

677
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap.

678
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:33,885
[SPEAKER_06]: You just need to ramp it up slowly.

679
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:42,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently they're saying that this is going to be part of the whole TV focus and might be some of their original Xbox programming.

680
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:54,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can see this happening, especially since you have Netflix and Amazon doing reboots and brand new exclusive series for those content streamers.

681
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:57,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes sense that they could do that.

682
00:48:57,446 --> 00:49:03,594
[SPEAKER_08]: This certainly leads to the other interesting discussion that goes with this of what other series could be revived?

683
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure a lot of us go, Firefly?

684
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we have Firefly?

685
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we have more Firefly?

686
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:11,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's not going to happen because then Joss is just going to kill everybody else.

687
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Fox would never...

688
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:16,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So Fox will just not let it happen just to spite.

689
00:49:17,328 --> 00:49:18,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I think I saw that horse twitch.

690
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:21,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kick it in its face again.

691
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:23,870
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's very interesting.

692
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll get into this a little more with our Fugo question of the week later on.

693
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's very interesting with all these content delivery services coming up with their own programming.

694
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: You see Netflix doing it too with Arrested Development.

695
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:34,852
[SPEAKER_08]: They brought Back from the Dead.

696
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:38,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Whose Line coming back.

697
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:40,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's a CW show, isn't it?

698
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but still, I'm saying, you know, there are these series of revivals going on.

699
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:52,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, Whose Line is a game show, so it follows, I mean, I know it's kind of not, but I think it actually follows the rules of a game show when it comes to TV.

700
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:56,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a weird, you know, game shows come and go all the time.

701
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I am very disappointed that they didn't try to go all meta with, you know, Whose Line and have Bob Barker host it.

702
00:50:02,615 --> 00:50:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been hilarious.

703
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did she just have him guest host one episode?

704
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:06,280
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

705
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Aisha Tyler's a great choice.

706
00:50:07,822 --> 00:50:08,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is.

707
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:09,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's one of us.

708
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,046
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a total gamer, you know.

709
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:12,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's funny.

710
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:12,909
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really funny.

711
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:14,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm looking forward to seeing...

712
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:17,723
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I get my Greg Proops on there from time to time, I'll be happy.

713
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:20,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Drew Carey was a great host, but he's got another gig.

714
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:23,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is weird, because Aisha Tyler does that talk show.

715
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:28,369
[SPEAKER_08]: They tape a whole three months worth of shows in a day.

716
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:33,413
[SPEAKER_08]: They figure it out.

717
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:34,653
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do I want to say with this?

718
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:40,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we talk about what kind of potential extra cost could be?

719
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're going to save a show like Heroes, that's not going to come for free, right?

720
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:47,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that be Xbox Gold?

721
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Would maybe I get that as an Xbox Gold member?

722
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:53,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe this is part of a new Xbox Platinum or something?

723
00:50:53,948 --> 00:50:55,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what happens?

724
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they'll charge any...

725
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:58,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.

726
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Platinum was that crappy little card that did nothing.

727
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:04,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say they ignored it like I did and did it again.

728
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they would do that per se.

729
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:14,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they could do more advertising, but who's to say that they're not going to be fucking greedy and still want more money on top of it?

730
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:30,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it's going to be a hard sell if, like, say, the PlayStation 4 still has the same type of scheme where it's, you know, regular PlayStation, you get online multiplayer, and plus you get, you know, extra stuff.

731
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I gotta be honest, I mean, I do a lot of gaming on the 360, but...

732
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I am jealous of the deal that you get with PlayStation Plus.

733
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's pretty nice with that instant game collection stuff.

734
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, a lot of my friends are on Xbox Live.

735
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:53,920
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

736
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, before we get into the next story, I want to go to the results of the live poll that we took earlier.

737
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:01,825
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

738
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:06,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to say, I'm a little surprised with these answers, but this is why we do this, because sometimes we learn things.

739
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:09,871
[SPEAKER_08]: The winner of the poll, Meh Nintendo, 50% of the vote.

740
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:12,113
[SPEAKER_08]: 50% don't care.

741
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:13,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

742
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:23,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was kind of looking in the chat room, and just so you know, among the non-Meh crowd, 25% of the vote for the Zelda Link to the Past sequel, 18.75% for Earthbound, and 6.25% for Super Luigi U.

743
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So, interesting.

744
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:31,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that 6% Ranma?

745
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:33,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be.

746
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:33,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be.

747
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:34,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

748
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I could look at the results, but I'm not going to look at who voted for what.

749
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:46,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at chat to try to figure out why people are voting the way they are, and it seems like a lot of people are just like, you know...

750
00:52:47,256 --> 00:52:53,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been convinced that I need to pick up these Nintendo consoles, so this news doesn't really get me excited.

751
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:54,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my thing.

752
00:52:54,859 --> 00:53:02,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that they have certain strategy with announcing titles because they don't know development cycles and how far... They don't want to announce a title...

753
00:53:02,821 --> 00:53:04,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

754
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:24,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, you can wait until E3 and do it and make a little bit of a splash and stuff like that.

755
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would think it would be in your best interest to help your console now instead of later.

756
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:32,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the more time you wait, the worse it's going to get for you.

757
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:37,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Because say you have someone that's waiting for a Wii U. I really want a good title to come out.

758
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:38,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's just like nothing.

759
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:40,766
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't hear about anything for a long time.

760
00:53:40,786 --> 00:53:41,447
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, you know what?

761
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to get an Xbox.

762
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:44,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Money's already spent.

763
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:45,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, crap.

764
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:47,030
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced a good title already.

765
00:53:48,650 --> 00:54:00,655
[SPEAKER_08]: What also surprised me about some of the reaction I'm seeing in the chat room as to why people voted that way is that a big reason why they do these Nintendo Directs is to get out there on the internet why you should own a 3DS because you don't already.

766
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:04,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And a Zelda Link to the Past sequel didn't sell that for people yet?

767
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:12,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, to be fair, I totally know that people are like, I'm not going to buy a freaking system based off a two-minute trailer.

768
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:15,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Show me the game, and then we'll see.

769
00:54:15,945 --> 00:54:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I can respect that.

770
00:54:16,645 --> 00:54:21,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The 3DS, I don't think it has any problems whatsoever saying reasons you need to buy a 3DS.

771
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:23,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's plenty of games out there.

772
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a lot of really good games, and I think there's plenty of reasons to own it.

773
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the Wii U. That isn't there.

774
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:40,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But this Nintendo Direct wasn't about Wii U. I don't care if it's about the Wii U. The Wii U is hurting and they haven't had a Nintendo Direct about the Wii U. Except for the stupid what?

775
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:42,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 30 years of Luigi.

776
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's announce all these Luigi things.

777
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest thing they had to announce was DLC for a game that they already put out.

778
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:49,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you need...

779
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:57,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I put this Super Luigi U DLC next to some of the DLC that other companies put out.

780
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say the Saints Row DLC, Loki.

781
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:02,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yes, I'll give you that.

782
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:03,809
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's put it this way.

783
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:05,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it sold any systems?

784
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we see a big jump in numbers after they made that announcement?

785
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:09,112
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

786
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:16,176
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because DLC will keep it afloat and keep people having their Wii U's plugged in, but it's not going to move the system.

787
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:21,159
[SPEAKER_06]: All that's going to happen is when it gets dropped in price, they'll bundle it with New Super Mario Bros.

788
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,360
[SPEAKER_06]: U Game of the Year Edition or some garbage like that.

789
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,323
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll have the new Luigi U DLC bundled in there.

790
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:28,323
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that's going to happen.

791
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:33,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see E3, hopefully a game changer.

792
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,678
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, going to be very interesting next year for Nintendo.

793
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:37,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Falco just made a good point.

794
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:44,187
[SPEAKER_02]: If the best thing about your next-gen system is the release of a nearly 20-year-old game, your next-gen console sucks.

795
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's relying on...

796
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:55,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo needs to get more people excited about the Wii U, they need to pull the curtain back a little bit on what they're working on, and E3 is the deadline for that to happen.

797
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:58,240
[SPEAKER_08]: But is it just me, or is there a lot of developers now just sort of banking in on that nostalgia?

798
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:14,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why not?

799
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: We run up to the trough and hit the feeder bar.

800
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:21,427
[SPEAKER_08]: How much did we all squee about Earthbound Link to the Past?

801
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:23,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently not the listenership.

802
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:24,888
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know I did.

803
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:27,408
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I'm not super excited either.

804
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:30,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, I really don't play... I don't have a 3DS.

805
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get one because it gives me a headache.

806
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean...

807
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:38,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard for me to put this into words.

808
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see something new and exciting and that's why my attention has been on the indie developers because they're doing the new and exciting.

809
00:56:46,407 --> 00:56:50,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross Steel UT in the chat room saying why isn't the Link to the Past sequel on the Wii U?

810
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:52,570
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd help if they didn't ass it up with gimmicks.

811
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:54,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

812
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:56,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not this game that gets people really excited on the Wii U?

813
00:56:57,272 --> 00:57:01,214
[SPEAKER_08]: My assumption is because we're going to get a Zelda trailer this year.

814
00:57:01,274 --> 00:57:07,577
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't get the new Zelda this year but you're going to get that trailer that gets you just enough fan wank to get people excited.

815
00:57:07,597 --> 00:57:09,138
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Wind Waker thing.

816
00:57:10,499 --> 00:57:11,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, the Wind Waker.

817
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:12,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I meant like you know

818
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:14,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wake me when the wank is over.

819
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, it makes perfect sense, and the setup is so perfect that I would be shocked if, maybe not this year, because they are a little slow to adopt, I mean, fuck, virtual consoles now just coming out.

820
00:57:30,758 --> 00:57:31,819
[SPEAKER_06]: How many months later?

821
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:32,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Six months later?

822
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:50,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so they're a little slow to adopt things, but I would be shocked that we do not see a way to play 3DS games on the Wii U. Or, let's just say that they're not going to do that, seeing some HD remakes of 3DS games coming to the Wii U. It only makes sense that they're going to do that.

823
00:57:53,426 --> 00:58:07,183
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura brought up indie developers, and this could be a place where Nintendo could, and it seems like something could be happening there, who knows, but this would be the group you would want to get in bed with if you were a game developer.

824
00:58:07,203 --> 00:58:08,905
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like they're in bed with Microsoft, though.

825
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:09,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it sexy times?

826
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:21,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but Mojang, Marcus Pearson, of course Notch, and Jens Bergensten, they have made Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2013.

827
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:23,361
[SPEAKER_08]: For pixel blocks!

828
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:27,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Time's 100 list kind of gets some, you know...

829
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:35,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Lady Gaga won or came in second place in an online poll of who's... So, you know, take some of this stuff with a grain of salt.

830
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:39,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is nice to see gaming represented and indie gaming at that.

831
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:55,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cool thing is is that Will Wright, you know, SimCity before it was, you know, this last one, actually wrote the introduction talking that Minecraft was, quote, a wonderful combination of accessibility and depth allowing for complex output with simple input.

832
00:58:57,274 --> 00:58:58,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Minecraft...

833
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:02,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft was an amazing thing for gaming.

834
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:05,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm glad this is getting acknowledged.

835
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:13,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I went from hater to tolerator to digging holes in the ground prairie dogger.

836
00:59:15,162 --> 00:59:18,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make it a point this week because I've been really bad at not going to the server.

837
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to play every single day this week.

838
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:24,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I live streamed it last week.

839
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:26,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to play every single day.

840
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,189
[SPEAKER_02]: My prairie dog house.

841
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:36,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess apparently Time did that poll online and this is saying that Notch ranked second in the poll.

842
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,021
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was Notch or it was Lady Gaga.

843
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, what's the difference, right?

844
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:44,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Lady Notch.

845
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:46,444
[SPEAKER_08]: They're essentially the same person.

846
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,107
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so congrats to them.

847
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:51,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious.

848
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:53,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the question is, what's next?

849
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:58,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they had that, what, the Universe game was their next big project, right?

850
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:00,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember the name of it.

851
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:02,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have Scrolls that they're doing right now.

852
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:02,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, Scrolls.

853
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,424
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got the, I don't even know what the fuck the game's called.

854
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:07,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 0x00.

855
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:09,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one I'm thinking of, yeah.

856
01:00:12,048 --> 01:00:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah so although that one he's claiming that he's running into kind of like a writer's block almost with it so he's working on other things right now until he figures out what to do with it gotcha all right let's move on um we're still a little ways from the classic game of the week some more news for you first

857
01:00:29,494 --> 01:00:38,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now this is something I'm excited about, even though, yeah, it's kind of me biting myself because of the nostalgia thing, but I was super happy.

858
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:44,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Castle of Illusion is getting remade for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and PC.

859
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:50,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It is being developed by Sega Studios Australia, and it will be, I guess, a 2.5D kind of game.

860
01:00:52,312 --> 01:01:18,216
[SPEAKER_02]: um well it says a 2D 3D hybrid and it is basically based off of the uh Genesis slash Mega Drive game with the original director working with the developer now so um there's a trailer out for it I totally recommend everybody watch it because it looks super good but I do not see a date on it yeah I don't think they have a date for it yet yeah

861
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I mean, I played the shit out of this game.

862
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:34,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I even, when I graduated high school, I traded my Super Nintendo for my friend's Genesis and sat playing this game for just the whole night.

863
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:39,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found his Master System converter and then was playing Alex Kidd and Shinobi World and that was pretty awesome too.

864
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Castle of Illusion is one of my top Disney games.

865
01:01:45,713 --> 01:01:48,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was a great game, so it's exciting to hear about this.

866
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:51,115
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures are absolutely gorgeous, but seriously, watch the trailer.

867
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It is maybe not as orgasm-inducing as DuckTales, but, you know, there's lots of wank.

868
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:01,678
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll still get you going down there a little bit?

869
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:03,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make one moist.

870
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:03,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

871
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:07,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a fun word.

872
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Moist?

873
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Moist.

874
01:02:09,668 --> 01:02:14,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to bring it up here in studio real quick just to be able to see some of this here in action.

875
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:19,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get to the actual gameplay part of the trailer.

876
01:02:21,057 --> 01:02:22,298
[SPEAKER_08]: It does look really good.

877
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:24,920
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics.

878
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is more, there's not much of the gameplay.

879
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:28,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Maleficent!

880
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Maleficent?

881
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:34,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Her face looks a little weird, though.

882
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have any gameplay in that, but they actually have some screenshots that look pretty sweet.

883
01:02:42,645 --> 01:02:43,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Codeman, I'm sorry.

884
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:44,426
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

885
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:45,986
[SPEAKER_02]: This is you.

886

[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a friend, our friend Beanie.

887
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:51,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You say the word moist around her.

888
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:52,508
[SPEAKER_02]: She full body shudders.

889
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:53,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

890
01:02:53,288 --> 01:02:54,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that the mom in Dead Like Me?

891
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:56,370

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

951
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:21,749
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of crap.

952
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:24,632
[SPEAKER_08]: A few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

953
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:29,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we've already talked about how the Wii U isn't selling very well.

954
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:40,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And technically we don't have the MPD numbers out for hardware because Nintendo's not going to come out bragging that, hey, we only sold like 67,000 units.

955
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:40,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

956
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:54,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but apparently, according to a leak on NeoGAF, they have the console numbers, which is possible because I get email updates occasionally of MPD numbers.

957
01:08:56,178 --> 01:09:00,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, the Wii U apparently only sold 67,000 units in the U.S.

958
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:02,863
[SPEAKER_06]: during the five weeks from March 3rd to April 6th.

959
01:09:03,604 --> 01:09:06,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, I guess, roughly...

960
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the Vita didn't do much better.

961
01:09:13,852 --> 01:09:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, let's see here.

962
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:20,178
[SPEAKER_06]: They did only 33,000 units during March.

963
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there any Vita games during March?

964
01:09:25,732 --> 01:09:28,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, name me games on the Vita to get excited about right now.

965
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:33,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking the Persona 4 release, but that already happened.

966
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:36,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like... Tear away if you're into... Project D.Va.

967
01:09:36,098 --> 01:09:37,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

968
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Tear away if you're into Media Molecule.

969
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,902
[SPEAKER_06]: There is Killzone, if you like Killzone.

970
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:46,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So, here's a question for you all.

971
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:54,166
[SPEAKER_08]: We sit here and we've razzed Nintendo about, you know, well, you know, they're just not getting those titles out there, but look at the frickin' Vita.

972
01:09:54,766 --> 01:09:55,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, I think, with the Vita.

973
01:09:56,467 --> 01:10:01,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, Nintendo, we recognize the potentials there that they could be doing much better.

974
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:08,411
[SPEAKER_06]: The Vita, I don't think we have much expectations for them other than, hey, it's a nice piece of hardware, but for some reason all the games that come out on it aren't very good.

975
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:11,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, dude, they had Call of Duty...

976
01:10:12,413 --> 01:10:25,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Ops come out on the Vita that should have been System Accelerate there but no instead they just had a quick rush of a game come out by someone that did Resistance and it sucked ass it's

977
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:33,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully they're taking all that stuff first party now and they're going to be developing instead of having third parties develop their games for them.

978
01:10:34,423 --> 01:10:38,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So Killzone hopefully will be much better but I don't know.

979
01:10:39,307 --> 01:10:42,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Tearaway is not going to save that system.

980
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:47,594
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to save that system I think a little bit is the fact that the PlayStation Network is a really good place right now for indies.

981
01:10:47,694 --> 01:10:51,337
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of indie games coming out in there so I think we'll see some interesting stuff from there.

982
01:10:51,357 --> 01:10:53,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe what develops with the PlayStation 4 because

983
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:58,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I get accused of being a Nintendo fanboy and always defending them here on this show.

984
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:01,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I like to think of myself as devil's advocate against gamers hate everything.

985
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:06,544
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the PlayStation 4 is in a good place.

986
01:11:06,644 --> 01:11:08,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it has a lot of good buzz around it.

987
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:13,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, PlayStation 4 is going to be a real contender for the Wii U, which doesn't...

988
01:11:13,887 --> 01:11:39,630
[SPEAKER_08]: you know unless they really knock our socks off at E3 you definitely are going to have PlayStation 4 on another level come out with something absolutely amazing and it could be interesting with how the Vita could tie into that I mean we've already seen a little bit of that early press conference you know so I'm I'm really curious to see how that enriches as we as time goes on here so Akuma JP mentioned a game called Obura Muramasa I guess does that have to do with the sword?

989
01:11:41,027 --> 01:11:42,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he linked us to the game there in our chat room.

990
01:11:42,769 --> 01:11:43,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's take a look.

991
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Muramasa Rebirth, yes.

992
01:11:45,553 --> 01:11:48,276
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can bring it up without destroying our feed again.

993
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Muramasa Rebirth.

994
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:55,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the HD, well, not really HD, but like a remake of Muramasa the Demon Blade.

995
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:55,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, neat.

996
01:11:55,385 --> 01:11:56,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, it's just Muramasa the Demon Blade.

997
01:11:57,608 --> 01:11:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

998
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that looks pretty fun.

999
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:01,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Screenshots are taking forever to load.

1000
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:02,438
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

1001
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:05,799
[SPEAKER_08]: The Vita does have such a pretty screen.

1002
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a great piece of tech.

1003
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,240
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have some good Japanese games coming out.

1004
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got the Persona stuff.

1005
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:16,362
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got Muramasa Rebirth.

1006
01:12:16,562 --> 01:12:18,762
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Odin's... Well, not Odin's Sphere.

1007
01:12:18,782 --> 01:12:21,223
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Dragonblade.

1008
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that chick naked?

1009
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:23,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at her.

1010
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:25,284
[SPEAKER_08]: They're skinny dipping or something.

1011
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:26,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

1012
01:12:27,044 --> 01:12:28,365
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a perverse game.

1013
01:12:28,785 --> 01:12:29,345
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1014
01:12:31,536 --> 01:12:33,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to stop being so white boy about it.

1015
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:36,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, boobs.

1016
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:37,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

1017
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:48,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only here that people have a big stick up their ass, a big rough sandpapery stick up their ass about boobs.

1018
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:48,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1019
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that we should have more boobs on TV.

1020
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:52,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I fully support this.

1021
01:12:52,405 --> 01:12:54,326
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, are you saying I have a stick up my ass?

1022
01:12:58,783 --> 01:13:11,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I like boobs too boobs are great but I mean people in general it's we're fine with violence and blood and gore and you know saw and everything I like boobs covered in blood but show a tit and everyone loses their shit hey that rhymed

1023
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be my new motto about America.

1024
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Show a tit, lose your shit.

1025
01:13:17,412 --> 01:13:27,283
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't come to that part of the show yet, but we do have a story later on about the evil within, which did have a four-armed demon chick with boobs and blood on her boobs.

1026
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:28,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1027
01:13:28,564 --> 01:13:29,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1028
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:30,726
[SPEAKER_06]: The violence boob quota.

1029
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Blood orgy, yay!

1030
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:33,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Organ orgy.

1031
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like organs launched at the screen.

1032
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:36,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

1033
01:13:37,742 --> 01:13:57,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright Let's see, did you do the other sales story about Yeah, NPD I don't want to repeat what you just said again No problem The March NPD stuff, Bioshock Infinite obviously the top selling game The utter disappointment of a game, sequel Tomb Raider, only placed 2nd

1034
01:13:58,644 --> 01:13:59,605
[SPEAKER_06]: heads will roll.

1035
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:02,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what a disappointment.

1036
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:09,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, Gears of War Judgment on 360 and then God of War Ascension on PS3 were 3 and 4.

1037
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:10,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1038
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1039
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say this.

1040
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,145
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be so wrong and I apologize in advance, but

1041
01:14:17,014 --> 01:14:22,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Only an Asian company like Square Enix would be like, why can you only be the second best-selling game?

1042
01:14:25,237 --> 01:14:25,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I right?

1043
01:14:26,097 --> 01:14:26,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I right?

1044
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:33,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Only the parent company in Asia would be like, why weren't you the number one game?

1045
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:36,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Why you get an A-?

1046
01:14:37,161 --> 01:14:38,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You came out in the beginning of the month.

1047
01:14:38,602 --> 01:14:39,402
[SPEAKER_06]: You should study harder.

1048
01:14:41,054 --> 01:15:04,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon actually on their number 6, MLB 13 The Show on number 7, NBA 2K13 8, Walking Dead Survival Instinct just again proving that Walking Dead the franchise will actually sell anything whether it be a good game or absolute shit so that was number 9, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3

1049
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:06,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 10.

1050
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:08,605
[SPEAKER_06]: What's not on this list?

1051
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:12,849
[SPEAKER_06]: The two big titles for the Wii U. Lego City Undercover and Monster Hunter 3.

1052
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:14,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even the top 10.

1053
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta hurt.

1054
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:20,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Laura should have been a doctor.

1055
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:29,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to fighting game news, or maybe a little change going on or another perspective.

1056
01:15:30,274 --> 01:15:40,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Christian Svensson over at Capcom has made a remark about a fan-submitted question on the Ask Capcom forums.

1057
01:15:40,777 --> 01:15:43,138
[SPEAKER_08]: This was about stories in fighting games.

1058
01:15:43,178 --> 01:15:48,660
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know how many people really play fighting games for the story, although some of them do have good stories, I guess.

1059
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you raising your hand over there?

1060
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, why, okay, if I don't play fighting games for the stories, I would have never touched any of the Tekken games.

1061
01:15:55,544 --> 01:15:56,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

1062
01:15:56,185 --> 01:16:01,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume the people that play the fighting games for the stories are the same people that read Playboy for their articles.

1063
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyhow, here's the interesting comment about story mode and fighting games.

1064
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:18,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, the strategic marketing group here has for quite a while been pushing for our fighting franchises to have more and more better single player content of which full-fledged story modes are one component.

1065
01:16:18,522 --> 01:16:18,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I...

1066
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:57,459
[SPEAKER_08]: but then again you know you look at a franchise like Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat's done really well with their story modes in their recent releases especially this last one so Tiger Claw mentions that the story in Injustice is really good and is getting Capcom thinking about making better stories in their fighting games

1067
01:16:58,849 --> 01:17:03,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Injustice is just NetherRealm Studios that just did the Mortal Kombat game, right?

1068
01:17:03,313 --> 01:17:04,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So, same, same.

1069
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:08,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, one other thing to mention about Capcom.

1070
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:16,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, more DLC in Capcom's future, which isn't really unexpected.

1071
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:18,636
[SPEAKER_08]: But just not on disc.

1072
01:17:18,736 --> 01:17:22,077
[SPEAKER_08]: This is talking about Capcom's recent strategy.

1073
01:17:23,178 --> 01:17:31,161
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of very interesting revelations here in Capcom's forecast about where the company's going, saying that...

1074
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:36,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, they don't want to outsource games to Western developers as much anymore.

1075
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:39,565
[SPEAKER_08]: That it has caused a drop in quality.

1076
01:17:40,346 --> 01:17:43,248
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to promote DLC in the consumer business.

1077
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:49,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Aim for growth, surpassing the market by reinforcing the online and mobile contents business.

1078
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:52,033
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone games, Android games.

1079
01:17:53,254 --> 01:17:57,897
[SPEAKER_08]: And strengthen earnings base by expanding the title lineup in the P&S business.

1080
01:17:59,298 --> 01:17:59,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1081
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,020
[SPEAKER_08]: More DLC, just hopefully not included on the disc.

1082
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:08,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just announce the Mega Man rebirth already.

1083
01:18:09,825 --> 01:18:10,725
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know it's coming.

1084
01:18:11,706 --> 01:18:12,767
[SPEAKER_08]: A Mega Man reboot.

1085
01:18:15,054 --> 01:18:15,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1086
01:18:17,517 --> 01:18:24,244
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase Banned.

1087
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:35,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That just about brings us to the end of the first half of our show, but we have to take a trip down memory lane first off with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1088
01:18:40,463 --> 01:18:42,384
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have reboots back in the day.

1089
01:18:42,704 --> 01:18:44,885
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't reboot a gaming franchise.

1090
01:18:45,405 --> 01:18:49,526
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you just put out some crappy sequels and then tried to make people forgive you with the third one.

1091
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:50,226
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1092
01:18:50,286 --> 01:18:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see if that is the case with tonight's Classic Game of the Week.

1093
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1094
01:18:54,247 --> 01:18:56,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week tonight?

1095
01:18:56,928 --> 01:18:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic the Hedgehog 3!

1096
01:18:58,528 --> 01:19:04,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I couldn't find anything else and I've been haunted by the Ice Cap music.

1097
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly enough, for some reason.

1098
01:19:07,751 --> 01:19:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what's in the background.

1099
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:10,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1100
01:19:28,749 --> 01:19:30,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog.

1101
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really liked the first one.

1102
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the second one.

1103
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:38,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But three for me just, like, lit everything up.

1104
01:19:38,452 --> 01:19:40,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the last real... Actually, no, I take that back.

1105
01:19:40,633 --> 01:19:44,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic CD was the last really good Sonic game, as far as platforming goes.

1106
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:49,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually even put Sonic 3 above Sonic CD.

1107
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby, the Japanese music was better.

1108
01:19:53,183 --> 01:19:54,364
[SPEAKER_02]: For Sonic CD, just saying.

1109
01:19:55,345 --> 01:19:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sonic 3 also had some interesting things going on with it too.

1110
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:04,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically could pick between Sonic or Tails as you could in Sonic 2.

1111
01:20:05,335 --> 01:20:31,850
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was basically the same type of gameplay you had all the same usual stuff you had your six levels with two parts you had a boss at the end of the very full thing you could keep going back to the level you have new abilities like you could hold the jump button while in mid-air and do like a quick shield for protection you tails could fly or swim underwater for a short time before getting tired and going back down and

1112
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tails could actually go to places that Sonic could not.

1113
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:39,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And his tail could actually be used to attack enemies.

1114
01:20:39,611 --> 01:20:44,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a second player controlling Tails, then he can carry Sonic while flying.

1115
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it opened up to all kinds of exploration.

1116
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:50,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were the different shields in the game.

1117
01:20:50,173 --> 01:20:51,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was the fire shield.

1118
01:20:51,774 --> 01:20:56,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And my favorite was the lightning shield that attracted coins.

1119
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Not coins, rings.

1120
01:20:58,855 --> 01:20:59,595
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my favorite.

1121
01:20:59,736 --> 01:21:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hit a checkpoint while holding 50 or more rings, you got a bonus stage, which was the bumper stage.

1122
01:21:05,058 --> 01:21:09,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I'm sorry, the bumper stage pissed me off.

1123
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:17,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Of any bonus stage ever in any game, for some reason it was that sort of semi-isometric point of view.

1124
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:20,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just give me a headache and I couldn't do it at all.

1125
01:21:20,246 --> 01:21:21,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I make Dan do it.

1126
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:24,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how you earn your Chaos Emeralds.

1127
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:31,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, someone even took the time to chart out how the various bonus stages were.

1128
01:21:31,735 --> 01:21:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a thing you could do with Sonic & Knuckles where if you attached an older cartridge to it, like, you could play Sonic 2 with Sonic & Knuckles.

1129
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you did another one, if you hold, like, a certain button press, then you could go on.

1130
01:21:45,829 --> 01:21:48,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to talk about music for a minute.

1131
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:48,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1132
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1133
01:21:50,553 --> 01:21:59,938
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a big thing going around with the music saying that Michael Jackson had done a lot of the music and then he removed himself from the Padres or something.

1134
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:11,345
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a series of clips on YouTube where people have compared music in Sonic 3 to Michael Jackson songs.

1135
01:22:11,405 --> 01:22:13,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's pretty obvious.

1136
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:15,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Ice Cap Zone sounds like Smooth Criminal.

1137
01:22:16,368 --> 01:22:18,269
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually my second favorite music in the game.

1138
01:22:23,027 --> 01:22:24,408
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Lava Reef Zone.

1139
01:22:24,868 --> 01:22:25,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good music.

1140
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:41,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so basically, you know, you can, if you got all of the Chaos Emeralds, you can turn into Supersonic and then Knuckles punches the crap out of him and takes the Chaos Emeralds and you have to go to the Death Egg.

1141
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:42,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

1142
01:22:43,977 --> 01:22:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, which I always like... Yeah, they called him Robotnik, but it really did make a lot more sense to call him Eggman because dude looked like a freaking egg.

1143
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And, hey, he was in Wreck-It Ralph.

1144
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:56,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, um...

1145
01:22:58,627 --> 01:23:01,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically there have been a bajillion different releases of this game.

1146
01:23:01,169 --> 01:23:07,053
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Sonic and Jam in 1997 for the Saturn, Sonic and Knuckles Collection and the Sonic and Garfield Pack.

1147
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:07,733
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?

1148
01:23:07,753 --> 01:23:08,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic and Garfield Pack?

1149
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:09,615
[SPEAKER_02]: For PC.

1150
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:16,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PS2, Xbox, and PC.

1151
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP.

1152
01:23:19,381 --> 01:23:34,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 and Sonic Classic Collection for Nintendo DS plus you can get like these various packs on Steam I'll be honest the only one of those I've ever bought was Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because hello it's P.O.P.O.

1153
01:23:36,080 --> 01:24:03,335
[SPEAKER_02]: there have been like I said the digital releases for Steam there's been the Wii Virtual Console one in 2007 Xbox Live Arcade in 2009 and it even has a split screen multiplayer on Xbox Live so it was given when it was released EGM gave it a 9.5 out of 10 and honestly I think it was well deserved it's one of the best games to ever come out so

1154
01:24:05,236 --> 01:24:10,620
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be back after a quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio Don't go anywhere guys, we'll be right back

1155
01:24:37,662 --> 01:24:38,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Blame me!

1156
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:53,529
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1157
01:25:39,704 --> 01:25:40,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hungry.

1158
01:25:40,365 --> 01:25:40,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that sausage.

1159
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:02,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they're ripping out organs of this patient, what?

1160
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:04,185
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even go earlier than that.

1161
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:05,966
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the funny Swedish guy.

1162
01:26:07,347 --> 01:26:10,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Perform a double kidney transplant.

1163
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:11,871
[SPEAKER_06]: In an ambulance.

1164
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:12,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ambulance is moving.

1165
01:26:12,932 --> 01:26:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh great, the ambulance is moving.

1166
01:26:15,734 --> 01:26:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guts.

1167
01:26:15,954 --> 01:26:18,696
[SPEAKER_00]: The kidney's just floating around in the back.

1168
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:19,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

1169
01:26:29,626 --> 01:26:30,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh lordy.

1170
01:26:31,248 --> 01:26:33,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I am buying this when I get home.

1171
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to wait and don't play it until you can live stream it.

1172
01:26:37,112 --> 01:26:37,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, Bob.

1173
01:26:39,013 --> 01:26:42,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do it tonight.

1174
01:26:42,696 --> 01:26:43,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put that in our chat.

1175
01:26:44,057 --> 01:26:48,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to the podcast folks, but just look it up on YouTube.

1176
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a ton of them.

1177
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:50,222
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great about the game.

1178
01:26:50,382 --> 01:26:51,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Surgeon Simulator 2013.

1179
01:26:51,823 --> 01:26:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: They have records.

1180
01:26:52,924 --> 01:26:58,648
[SPEAKER_06]: They have people doing record surgery, the times, how quickly you can do surgery, and murder times.

1181
01:26:59,028 --> 01:27:01,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So how quickly you can kill your patient.

1182
01:27:02,429 --> 01:27:09,212
[SPEAKER_08]: SJ100Matt says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Hey, I remember playing the original surgery game, Life and Death 2.

1183
01:27:09,532 --> 01:27:10,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1184
01:27:11,193 --> 01:27:12,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Those games were scary shit.

1185
01:27:13,674 --> 01:27:15,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, for me it was Trauma Center.

1186
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:19,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got Trauma Center on Wii when it came out.

1187
01:27:19,136 --> 01:27:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, me too.

1188
01:27:19,616 --> 01:27:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember...

1189
01:27:21,557 --> 01:27:42,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was drunk on something no no no it was the Vicodin when I'm sitting here leaning back in my chair I was on Vicodin it was right after um I think I was playing it right after my surgery so I'm sitting here with my hand in a cast trying to hold the Wiimote going can't hold it and then like I ended up like using my left hand and so I was slicing people to bits it was hilarious

1190
01:27:43,022 --> 01:27:48,184
[SPEAKER_08]: S2100 Matt though, I was playing the original surgery game Operation by Milton Bradley.

1191
01:27:49,825 --> 01:28:05,831
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing about Life and Death 1 that kind of sucked was that from what I remember at least we can only get to the first surgery which was it was removing an appendix and unfortunately they do not allow you to play tic-tac-toe using the scalpel.

1192
01:28:06,331 --> 01:28:07,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That will kill the patient apparently.

1193
01:28:09,893 --> 01:28:10,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1194
01:28:11,575 --> 01:28:11,935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1195
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

1196
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:14,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Do some rapid fire news.

1197
01:28:14,858 --> 01:28:18,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickly covering some of the other things going on in the gaming world this week.

1198
01:28:18,061 --> 01:28:19,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll get to the FUGO question of the week.

1199
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, rapid fire news.

1200
01:28:21,324 --> 01:28:21,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1201
01:28:21,985 --> 01:28:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Deadpool.

1202
01:28:23,146 --> 01:28:25,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposed to be coming out June 25th.

1203
01:28:26,129 --> 01:28:27,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all you need to know.

1204
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:28,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Deadpool's awesome.

1205
01:28:29,292 --> 01:28:31,014
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1206
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: June 25th.

1207
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:39,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The OUYA has got a firmware update that's allowing people to change their credit card information.

1208
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:42,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently you can change this at any time.

1209
01:28:42,702 --> 01:28:49,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And also they're going to be adding some different payment options as well later on.

1210
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:52,769
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now you can change your credit card information.

1211
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:53,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

1212
01:28:53,570 --> 01:29:00,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've signed up 10,000 registered developers because technically everybody within OUYA could be a registered developer at some point.

1213
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:01,876
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1214
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:35,394
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but not least Bethesda was teasing all week long and finally released the trailer for The Evil Within which is the brand new game from Shinji Mikami known for the Resident Evil series

1215
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:43,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gotta say, after watching the trailer, other than the fact that there is a lot of organs and stuff, it looks very Silent Hill-ish.

1216
01:29:43,438 --> 01:29:44,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, good Silent Hill-ish.

1217
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:46,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little bit scared.

1218
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:47,921
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1219
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:49,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little bit scared just watching the trailer.

1220
01:29:50,642 --> 01:29:51,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.

1221
01:29:51,503 --> 01:29:52,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me bring this up here in studio.

1222
01:29:52,643 --> 01:29:52,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I like brains.

1223
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought there was a YouTube here.

1224
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look it up when I get home.

1225
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I like anything that's Silent Hill in a good way.

1226
01:30:03,921 --> 01:30:05,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to get Shane's review of it.

1227
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I trust Shane in all things remotely Silent Hill looking.

1228
01:30:11,562 --> 01:30:13,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, don't inflate his ego like that.

1229
01:30:15,883 --> 01:30:16,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here.

1230
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:17,984
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a two-minute trailer, though.

1231
01:30:18,684 --> 01:30:19,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's ads on it.

1232
01:30:19,704 --> 01:30:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

1233
01:30:21,265 --> 01:30:22,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's come back to this in a minute.

1234
01:30:22,605 --> 01:30:23,065
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we'll do.

1235
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1236
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:26,576
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, I will read a few stories here.

1237
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,737
[SPEAKER_08]: The bonus games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet revealed.

1238
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:36,420
[SPEAKER_08]: If you bought all the games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, all the download stuff, you will get two free games.

1239
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And the bonus games were 1943 Kai.

1240
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,541
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the laser 1943.

1241
01:30:44,303 --> 01:30:50,187
[SPEAKER_08]: and Volgus, which was the very first Capcom game in arcades.

1242
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:56,270
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, just so you know, the other pack of games came out for Capcom that rounds out this pack.

1243
01:30:56,631 --> 01:31:00,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Sun Sun 1942 and Pirate Ship Higemaru, which I love that game.

1244
01:31:00,993 --> 01:31:02,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Higemaru is a pretty neat game.

1245
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:06,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, if you want just classic shooter, you can't get any better than 1942.

1246
01:31:06,917 --> 01:31:09,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for vertical shooters.

1247
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1248
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:13,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad Dog McCree 2 The Lost Gold Move Control

1249
01:31:29,435 --> 01:31:36,158
[SPEAKER_08]: HD Scrubdown New Difficulty Modes and Online Leaderboards Also, a rating has shown up on a Korean rating site for Metal Gear Solid The Legacy Collection

1250
01:31:49,364 --> 01:31:49,664
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1251
01:32:20,523 --> 01:32:23,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.

1252
01:32:23,525 --> 01:32:28,548
[SPEAKER_06]: All the good stuff's towards the end anyway.

1253
01:32:30,789 --> 01:32:33,391
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really realistic right there.

1254
01:32:33,471 --> 01:32:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1255
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:39,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go a little further.

1256
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:40,196
Ooh, blood!

1257
01:32:40,236 --> 01:32:41,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I wanna play this.

1258
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:55,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1259
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:56,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I like organs.

1260
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:58,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew!

1261
01:32:58,433 --> 01:32:58,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob!

1262
01:32:59,493 --> 01:33:00,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you showing me that, Rob?

1263
01:33:01,393 --> 01:33:03,474
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of those games to get my mom to watch me play.

1264
01:33:06,794 --> 01:33:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get your mom watching you play one of those games and we need to stream it.

1265
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:16,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was thinking a great one to have my mom react to would be Bioshock Infinite, so I'll work on that.

1266
01:33:16,456 --> 01:33:19,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do, like, Rob's mom, the series.

1267
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:21,072
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1268
01:33:47,277 --> 01:33:52,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Did a ROM hack that basically installs it in place of the original game chips on the motherboard.

1269
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a YouTube video going around of the arcade version.

1270
01:33:58,304 --> 01:34:04,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And a site called This Old Game is doing the artwork for the Pauline edition.

1271
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:12,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will be like $100 and has a marquee, monitor glass, control panel, side art, and instruction stickers.

1272
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:17,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I even have Mario being held by Donkey Kong and stuff.

1273
01:34:17,927 --> 01:34:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome, because that's like... I mean, it's even in the right style, too.

1274
01:34:22,235 --> 01:34:22,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1275
01:34:24,943 --> 01:34:30,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, the 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is finally in North America.

1276
01:34:30,468 --> 01:34:31,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1277
01:34:31,408 --> 01:34:31,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And it costs $20.

1278
01:34:32,169 --> 01:34:33,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo.

1279
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:38,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can order it on Nintendo's official online store.

1280
01:34:38,334 --> 01:34:40,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only place that you can find it.

1281
01:34:40,495 --> 01:34:41,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But not too many games use it.

1282
01:34:42,157 --> 01:34:47,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly Monster Hunter 3 and Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.

1283
01:34:49,144 --> 01:34:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Godmode

1284
01:35:06,307 --> 01:35:08,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Party Hats Party Hats Party Hats

1285
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: and then basically it's just lots of fun.

1286
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:34,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of crazy fun.

1287
01:35:35,413 --> 01:35:44,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And it costs 10 bucks on Steam or 800 Microsoft points or 6 pounds 99 pence for our friends in the UK.

1288
01:35:44,818 --> 01:35:45,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.

1289
01:35:46,338 --> 01:35:51,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Prince Brightstar asking a question about one of the stories you just did, DarkSakura.

1290
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:56,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Can arcades legally earn money from the Donkey Kong Pauline game?

1291
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:00,977
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.

1292
01:36:01,577 --> 01:36:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

1293
01:36:02,718 --> 01:36:04,038
[SPEAKER_08]: In all honesty, probably not.

1294
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:13,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think this is more of a novelty that shows up at trade shows and private owners, not something you put down at a miniature golf place or at a bowling alley to actually make money.

1295
01:36:13,762 --> 01:36:15,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That would probably get you in some hot water.

1296
01:36:15,463 --> 01:36:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

1297
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:19,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a ROM hack, so it's not necessarily that they're selling pirated stuff.

1298
01:36:19,825 --> 01:36:21,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically modifying your system.

1299
01:36:21,966 --> 01:36:25,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It also wouldn't be the first pirated game to ever show up in an arcade.

1300
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at Classic Gaming Expo, someone had done a Donkey Kong 2.

1301
01:36:29,801 --> 01:36:36,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically just a rehack of Donkey Kong where you found unused sprites and basically redid levels.

1302
01:36:36,586 --> 01:36:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it plays exactly Donkey Kong style, but he put up his dump and everything.

1303
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:42,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounded awful.

1304
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:43,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1305
01:36:44,752 --> 01:36:46,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He put the ROM dump up.

1306
01:36:47,374 --> 01:36:48,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, Rob!

1307
01:36:51,237 --> 01:36:52,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You're five.

1308
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:52,918
[SPEAKER_02]: You just served it up.

1309
01:36:53,388 --> 01:36:55,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years old, Rab.

1310
01:36:56,392 --> 01:36:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1311
01:36:56,732 --> 01:36:57,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my dump, y'all.

1312
01:36:58,655 --> 01:37:02,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it wasn't my dump, it was his dump, and I just happened to be there for it.

1313
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:04,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It was number two.

1314
01:37:07,273 --> 01:37:07,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.

1315
01:37:07,773 --> 01:37:08,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1316
01:37:08,133 --> 01:37:08,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going home.

1317
01:37:10,654 --> 01:37:11,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done with y'all.

1318
01:37:11,594 --> 01:37:14,334
[SPEAKER_02]: This is... Three words.

1319
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this shit.

1320
01:37:16,055 --> 01:37:16,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1321
01:37:17,575 --> 01:37:18,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the pinkberry.

1322
01:37:18,495 --> 01:37:18,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1323
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:20,575
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1324
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:26,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remembered that he had distributed it to some arcades.

1325
01:37:27,617 --> 01:37:28,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still red in the face.

1326
01:37:28,837 --> 01:37:30,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's funny.

1327
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:32,758
[SPEAKER_08]: His little comment about what it was, number two.

1328
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:33,598
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

1329
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't Prince Brightstar so happy that his question led to that?

1330
01:37:41,744 --> 01:37:44,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a serious, a really good serious question led to, yeah, poop.

1331
01:37:49,587 --> 01:37:52,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we supposedly have a mature rating because we're not.

1332
01:37:53,888 --> 01:37:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

1333
01:37:55,608 --> 01:37:58,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's class it up a little bit here with some listener feedback.

1334
01:37:58,989 --> 01:37:59,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fucking luck.

1335
01:38:05,697 --> 01:38:07,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook, and Google+.

1336
01:38:07,497 --> 01:38:08,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw them together, you get Foogle.

1337
01:38:09,618 --> 01:38:10,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Foogle+.

1338
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:13,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And we ask a question of the week every week on Foogle.

1339
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:18,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And this week has to do with the Heroes show reboot rumors.

1340
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:25,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor is that Heroes, a TV show that used to be on NBC, could get a second chance as a television show on the next Xbox.

1341
01:38:25,542 --> 01:38:27,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you watch something like this via Xbox?

1342
01:38:27,663 --> 01:38:33,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think this type of content delivery poses a threat to cable television as we know it now?

1343
01:38:33,684 --> 01:38:34,605
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts?

1344
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:36,928
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start on Facebook tonight with Critical Myth.

1345
01:38:37,248 --> 01:38:38,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Love this answer by the way.

1346
01:38:39,153 --> 01:38:48,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting aside the fan perception that the show quickly went downhill after the first season and thus bringing it back doesn't make a lot of sense, I don't think this alone is a threat to network or cable television.

1347
01:38:49,019 --> 01:38:55,002
[SPEAKER_08]: It would only be the combined success of these alternative outlets like Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV, and so on.

1348
01:38:55,602 --> 01:39:03,647
[SPEAKER_08]: What it does say, along with some of the other outlets, is that a cancelled show may have many other options than might have been the case just a few short years ago.

1349
01:39:04,327 --> 01:39:12,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Add to that the crowdsourcing possibilities, Veronica Mars, and the initial end of a show might not be the final end after all.

1350
01:39:12,814 --> 01:39:24,923
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a show on ABC that I really like, I think it's really funny, called Happy Endings, but it's supposedly kind of done because the ratings haven't been very good, but everybody's already talking about, like, can it be on cable or something like that?

1351
01:39:25,264 --> 01:39:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1352
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:26,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.

1353
01:39:28,126 --> 01:39:32,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm going to Red the Haze.

1354
01:39:33,969 --> 01:39:35,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you support Heroes or what have you?

1355
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:41,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, I haven't paid for a live subscription in ages and I'm satisfied everywhere else with my gaming and entertainment needs.

1356
01:39:42,293 --> 01:39:45,536
[SPEAKER_08]: My internet connection isn't fast enough, and a large percentage of the U.S.

1357
01:39:45,576 --> 01:39:46,456
[SPEAKER_08]: has the same issue.

1358
01:39:46,857 --> 01:39:57,024
[SPEAKER_08]: This won't threaten cable TV, but other reliable services that are catching on, like Netflix and Hulu, are more of a threat because of the low barrier of entry with Rokus and smart TVs.

1359
01:39:57,565 --> 01:40:02,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Rebooting a canceled TV show that nobody remembers fondly isn't a good gamble.

1360
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:06,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, somebody else jumped in there and said, hey, wait a minute, nobody remembers fondly.

1361
01:40:07,212 --> 01:40:09,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So, remember fondly?

1362
01:40:09,614 --> 01:40:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the dude's name?

1363
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:10,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Hiro?

1364
01:40:11,135 --> 01:40:11,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know.

1365
01:40:12,176 --> 01:40:13,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked him and I liked his buddy.

1366
01:40:14,237 --> 01:40:19,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, he's not probably... I would say that most of the cast would not be back because you have them all doing their own things.

1367
01:40:19,941 --> 01:40:21,122
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all in other shows now.

1368
01:40:21,142 --> 01:40:25,305
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on Hawaii Five-0 right now and the one chick's on Dallas.

1369
01:40:25,325 --> 01:40:25,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Nashville.

1370
01:40:26,366 --> 01:40:27,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Nashville, yeah.

1371
01:40:28,107 --> 01:40:31,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but there's always the possibility that they could do cameos or what have you.

1372
01:40:31,732 --> 01:40:37,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But Heroes wasn't necessarily... The idea was the Heroes were going to get all killed off in the first season anyway.

1373
01:40:37,179 --> 01:40:38,381
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to always be new people.

1374
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:40,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just didn't work out that way.

1375
01:40:42,226 --> 01:40:44,689
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am with... I thought Heroes was...

1376
01:40:45,089 --> 01:40:46,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched it if there's George Takei

1377
01:41:01,525 --> 01:41:01,926
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1378
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:03,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, he's my gay daddy.

1379
01:41:03,566 --> 01:41:10,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm of the mindset that then, you know, when they started introducing all these other characters in season two, it really went downhill.

1380
01:41:11,391 --> 01:41:12,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped watching season three.

1381
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:13,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't take it anymore.

1382
01:41:13,952 --> 01:41:19,095
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard the show started to get back to its roots and got a lot better season four and maybe ended a little bit.

1383
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:20,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I never saw.

1384
01:41:20,075 --> 01:41:20,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I never.

1385
01:41:20,435 --> 01:41:21,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I never gave it that second chance.

1386
01:41:22,236 --> 01:41:24,477
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would be down with a reboot.

1387
01:41:24,617 --> 01:41:27,039
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're going to ask me to pay a lot of extra money for it.

1388
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:33,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's part of a service that's something else with it, I might be open to it.

1389
01:41:33,581 --> 01:41:39,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried actually watching the first season, but all I would do is just watch the Hiro and Nando scenes.

1390
01:41:40,304 --> 01:41:42,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to like Cheerleader Wolverine.

1391
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Could not get into it.

1392
01:41:46,606 --> 01:41:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of my friends was on that show.

1393
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:51,446
[SPEAKER_08]: This is supposed to be about the listeners, so let me read the rest of the answers here.

1394
01:41:51,986 --> 01:41:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkCharger says, if the writing and acting is good, I will watch it.

1395
01:41:55,428 --> 01:41:59,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I already pay for Xbox Live, as do millions of subscribers, and this just adds much needed value.

1396
01:42:00,272 --> 01:42:03,955
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't a single show or channel that will usurp cable.

1397
01:42:04,295 --> 01:42:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I believe consumers are willing to dump on an...

1398
01:42:07,417 --> 01:42:13,220
[SPEAKER_08]: to stomp on an antiquated business model if an IPTV model is perceived as an equivalent or superior.

1399
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:15,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember this whole thing?

1400
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:24,784
[SPEAKER_06]: The theory was that cable providers could then offer their cable channels over the internet to other people that would be out of the area.

1401
01:42:24,864 --> 01:42:30,047
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have Comcast in your area, thank God, and you wanted to get Comcast channels, although...

1402
01:42:31,087 --> 01:42:37,510
[SPEAKER_06]: They all kind of have the same channels anyways, but that was supposed to be a way to do it, was with this box.

1403
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:43,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember HBO's talking about doing just internet only.

1404
01:42:44,353 --> 01:42:48,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be kind of neat, although I just don't want to pay like $8 for each channel.

1405
01:42:52,076 --> 01:42:57,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr replies and says, never cared for Heroes, but I would gladly watch a show on my Xbox if it was good.

1406
01:42:57,581 --> 01:43:05,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's a threat to the whole system, but it's yet another step towards the a la carte delivery consumers have been clamoring for, much to the cable company's chagrin.

1407
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:10,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Picaruno says, if it ain't one versus a hundred, dot, dot, dot.

1408
01:43:10,693 --> 01:43:12,134
[SPEAKER_08]: High five, sir.

1409
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:13,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.

1410
01:43:13,215 --> 01:43:13,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Preach.

1411
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:22,252
[SPEAKER_08]: If they say the next Xbox is bringing back 1 vs. 100, I would have to give it serious consideration on that merit alone.

1412
01:43:23,372 --> 01:43:25,813
[SPEAKER_08]: But they need to guarantee me it'll be up for at least a couple years.

1413
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:28,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Nikki E replied and said,

1414
01:43:39,096 --> 01:44:03,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I pay for Netflix to be able to watch what I want when I want if some other service has an exclusive thing I would either not care buy it on DVD later or maybe end up downloading it I think too much competition via exclusive deals and making content only for your own streaming service would just lead to more piracy just when the streaming services were beginning to compete with the convenience of the internet thanks for a great show thank you that's a good point I don't want to have to give every

1415
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:05,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Content Publisher $10 a month to watch their show.

1416
01:44:05,971 --> 01:44:10,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that dilution is going to lead to a lose-lose situation.

1417
01:44:10,053 --> 01:44:10,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Piracy, yeah.

1418
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:11,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, piracy.

1419
01:44:12,114 --> 01:44:13,715
[SPEAKER_08]: People get what they want to see.

1420
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:17,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, people do get what they want to see.

1421
01:44:18,213 --> 01:44:44,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Degenerate Johnny says I don't particularly think this service will pose a threat yes interactive entertainment has played a role in the steep decline of ratings within cable television through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other various services which is why you see cable news upholding the interest of those networks by focusing on the negative pertaining to interactive entertainment ooh interesting do you think maybe it's a whole little that's why cable news has it out for games is that it's competition that's awfully little no

1422
01:44:44,913 --> 01:44:55,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just the same reason why certain people on cable news that have very racist comments, I just think they're very short-minded.

1423
01:44:57,115 --> 01:45:01,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Andy R says, depends what kind of pricing is involved, but I would like something like this.

1424
01:45:01,436 --> 01:45:08,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't pay for cable because I don't watch much TV, which makes it difficult on the few occasions when there is a show I want to watch, like Game of Thrones.

1425
01:45:08,537 --> 01:45:12,338
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can watch it in a manner where I'm not paying for a ton of services I don't want, I'm all for it.

1426
01:45:13,038 --> 01:45:15,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike B says cables should be trying to keep up with the times.

1427
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:17,782
[SPEAKER_08]: The future is a la carte programming.

1428
01:45:18,123 --> 01:45:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not the first one to use that term.

1429
01:45:19,864 --> 01:45:21,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Commercial free shows and movies via the internet.

1430
01:45:22,006 --> 01:45:22,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I already do this now.

1431
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:24,588
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little pricey but no commercials.

1432
01:45:26,009 --> 01:45:28,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go over to Google Plus and Redertainment.

1433
01:45:29,352 --> 01:45:29,752
[SPEAKER_08]: who said,

1434
01:46:00,353 --> 01:46:02,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that comment from Red Entertainment on Google+.

1435
01:46:02,914 --> 01:46:05,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the comparison to Web TV is very interesting.

1436
01:46:05,896 --> 01:46:07,437
[SPEAKER_08]: If at first you don't succeed, try again.

1437
01:46:09,018 --> 01:46:09,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

1438
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:17,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I apologize I didn't get to all the comments, but do check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google+.

1439
01:46:17,343 --> 01:46:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Just search for Orange Lounge Radio to read all of the great comments in their entirety.

1440
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:24,449
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime... Yeah, because there's some wink going on.

1441
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:25,309
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1442
01:46:25,389 --> 01:46:26,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the chatter's mad at you.

1443
01:46:26,269 --> 01:46:27,190
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't read mine, Rob.

1444
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:34,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe because I read a lot of your other stuff, and you guys call in pretty regularly, so I wanted to read people that don't get to participate as much with the show.

1445
01:46:34,432 --> 01:46:36,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So just throw that out there.

1446
01:46:36,633 --> 01:46:40,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but you know, I have to give... You have to fan the flames.

1447
01:46:41,415 --> 01:46:42,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to fan them.

1448
01:46:43,556 --> 01:46:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1449
01:46:44,744 --> 01:46:48,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like Karl Lagerfeld and his fan.

1450
01:46:48,286 --> 01:46:50,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Without being an asshole.

1451
01:46:50,527 --> 01:46:56,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate all of the comments and encourage everybody to go read them in their entirety on Facebook and Google+.

1452
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:58,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, more news.

1453
01:46:58,491 --> 01:46:58,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1454
01:46:59,571 --> 01:47:04,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So the second round of THQ auctions are happening.

1455
01:47:04,774 --> 01:47:10,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently the news will be out Monday afternoon on to who has what.

1456
01:47:11,577 --> 01:47:22,168
[SPEAKER_06]: This included back catalog rights and also kind of different lots, including the Darksiders franchise, Red Faction and Homeworld franchise.

1457
01:47:23,069 --> 01:47:27,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know, the original auctions, you know, sold off the other stuff like Saints Row and that kind of thing.

1458
01:47:30,035 --> 01:47:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying they're going to make six to seven million dollars from those sales.

1459
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:45,948
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing, though, that we do know that's going to happen, the whole crowdfunded movement to buy the rights to Homeworld failed.

1460
01:47:46,828 --> 01:47:49,671
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have enough money to win the bid there, so...

1461
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:53,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, they are refunding everyone's money.

1462
01:47:53,293 --> 01:47:54,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice.

1463
01:47:54,614 --> 01:47:55,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have that going on.

1464
01:47:55,975 --> 01:47:58,236
[SPEAKER_08]: That means somebody put up a lot of money for it.

1465
01:47:58,296 --> 01:47:59,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So somebody recognized the value in it.

1466
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:01,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Then somebody outbid those guys.

1467
01:48:02,018 --> 01:48:07,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So they had, I guess, it looks like they had around 80 million dollars.

1468
01:48:10,863 --> 01:48:11,984
[SPEAKER_06]: 80 million?

1469
01:48:12,184 --> 01:48:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not 80 million.

1470
01:48:14,184 --> 01:48:14,164
80,000.

1471
01:48:14,204 --> 01:48:15,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1472
01:48:15,605 --> 01:48:16,765
[SPEAKER_06]: 75 to $80,000.

1473
01:48:18,145 --> 01:48:18,425
[SPEAKER_06]: $80 million.

1474
01:48:18,505 --> 01:48:21,246
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the most successful Kickstarter ever.

1475
01:48:21,266 --> 01:48:23,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Saints Row went for that much.

1476
01:48:23,467 --> 01:48:25,988
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1477
01:48:26,008 --> 01:48:30,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So $80,000 is what they had between their Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.

1478
01:48:31,509 --> 01:48:33,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, they were not able to get it for that.

1479
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:37,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sold for the price is right rules.

1480
01:48:54,733 --> 01:48:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: and this belonged to Tim Langdell who is the founder of Edge Games.

1481
01:48:59,236 --> 01:49:03,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a court order has stripped him of that trademark.

1482
01:49:03,459 --> 01:49:07,881
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because of a petition by Dice and EA who made Mirrors Edge.

1483
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:08,262
[SPEAKER_08]: The U.S.

1484
01:49:08,302 --> 01:49:13,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of the canceled registration on April 17th.

1485
01:49:13,385 --> 01:49:15,106
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole thing has been going on since 2010.

1486
01:49:15,146 --> 01:49:15,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1487
01:49:18,849 --> 01:49:25,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Moby Game made a game called Edge and they've discounted all versions of the game by 50% in celebration.

1488
01:49:26,054 --> 01:49:30,518
[SPEAKER_08]: The game had been taken down from the App Store previously due to issues with this trademark.

1489
01:49:30,918 --> 01:49:34,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, anything that had the word Edge in it, this guy was coming for you.

1490
01:49:35,321 --> 01:49:36,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Hide your wife, hide your edge.

1491
01:49:36,983 --> 01:49:39,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, that sort of sounds like Ville.

1492
01:49:40,145 --> 01:49:44,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so maybe this will set a very interesting precedent and send a message.

1493
01:49:45,459 --> 01:49:48,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to create a game called Ville.

1494
01:49:48,402 --> 01:49:49,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Ville.

1495
01:49:50,143 --> 01:49:52,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this guy is welcome to call his company Edge Games.

1496
01:49:52,705 --> 01:49:56,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a problem with that, but Edge Games and Mirror's Edge?

1497
01:49:57,469 --> 01:49:57,709
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1498
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,351
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no similarity there.

1499
01:49:59,371 --> 01:50:01,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like Monster Cable.

1500
01:50:01,312 --> 01:50:02,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for this.

1501
01:50:02,173 --> 01:50:04,135
[SPEAKER_08]: They should kill off more stupid trademarks.

1502
01:50:04,155 --> 01:50:07,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I can think of a few we've come across in gaming that need to be cancelled as well.

1503
01:50:07,878 --> 01:50:09,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyhow.

1504
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:12,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to some more news.

1505
01:50:13,479 --> 01:50:19,683
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, now the original link, by the way, didn't work, so I had to hunt it down.

1506
01:50:20,804 --> 01:50:21,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

1507
01:50:21,524 --> 01:50:22,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, it's okay.

1508
01:50:22,905 --> 01:50:28,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a prototype of a Sega machine that was called the Pluto, I believe.

1509
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:35,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guy's posting on Assembler Games forums with pictures of one of the second prototypes.

1510
01:50:35,233 --> 01:50:36,054
[SPEAKER_02]: There were only two of them.

1511
01:50:36,954 --> 01:50:38,635
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically says it's super heavy.

1512
01:50:38,815 --> 01:50:46,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It had two controller ports, a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a power button and the reset button.

1513
01:50:46,797 --> 01:50:56,020
[SPEAKER_02]: It still says Saturn on it, but this was apparently they were going to brand whatever this Pluto system was with the Saturn name.

1514
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: When you plug it in, it actually has the Saturn logo

1515
01:51:01,501 --> 01:51:03,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Loading screen, the drive empty screen.

1516
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:09,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just looking this over, it apparently works.

1517
01:51:09,683 --> 01:51:16,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I'm sorry if I'm having to go through this because unfortunately the original thing didn't work for me.

1518
01:51:17,085 --> 01:51:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It is region locked, but it is a USA NTSC Saturn.

1519
01:51:21,367 --> 01:51:22,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

1520
01:51:22,287 --> 01:51:25,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it had the networking capability.

1521
01:51:26,488 --> 01:51:30,369
[SPEAKER_06]: They bought this for a dollar at a Stockton flea market.

1522
01:51:32,736 --> 01:51:39,860
[SPEAKER_06]: $1.

1523
01:51:33,457 --> 01:51:39,860
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, turning around and selling it on eBay right now, already up to like $6,700.

1524
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,000
[SPEAKER_08]: For real?

1525
01:51:42,081 --> 01:51:43,281
[SPEAKER_08]: That was at a flea market?

1526
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:44,121
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy.

1527
01:51:44,262 --> 01:51:45,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one was at a garage sale.

1528
01:51:46,983 --> 01:51:47,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1529
01:51:47,503 --> 01:51:49,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the Stockton area as well.

1530
01:51:49,324 --> 01:51:51,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, it's a Saturn with a netlink built in.

1531
01:51:53,568 --> 01:51:55,349
[SPEAKER_02]: This needs to be in my collection, damn it.

1532
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a few thousand dollars to pony up?

1533
01:51:58,091 --> 01:52:00,233
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have a desire to buy a house.

1534
01:52:00,593 --> 01:52:01,914
[SPEAKER_08]: If only you'd been at that flea market.

1535
01:52:01,954 --> 01:52:04,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't live in a Sega Pluto.

1536
01:52:05,777 --> 01:52:06,337
[SPEAKER_08]: You can try.

1537
01:52:06,857 --> 01:52:07,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It is pretty big.

1538
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:11,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, looking at it, it is pretty burly, but you know what?

1539
01:52:12,241 --> 01:52:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Saturn and I'm happy with it.

1540
01:52:16,144 --> 01:52:16,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1541
01:52:17,318 --> 01:52:18,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, that is a monster, though.

1542
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to read a quick comment on the Edge thing, because people in chat are still talking about the Edge story, and I think this insight from Dungeon Buster is pretty good in chat.

1543
01:52:27,067 --> 01:52:32,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Langdell picked a fight with EA, and EA decided to litigate his trademark into oblivion and won.

1544
01:52:32,371 --> 01:52:33,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy was nuts.

1545
01:52:33,532 --> 01:52:36,315
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd sue over anything that he thought infringed on his trademark.

1546
01:52:36,575 --> 01:52:39,858
[SPEAKER_08]: He made up proof that others were using it, which the courts didn't appreciate.

1547
01:52:39,938 --> 01:52:40,598
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hilarious.

1548
01:52:40,618 --> 01:52:43,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that's from Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1549
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:47,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I also do want to repost the forum link just because people need to see photos of this.

1550
01:52:47,064 --> 01:52:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting.

1551
01:52:48,525 --> 01:52:49,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, of the Pluto?

1552
01:52:49,325 --> 01:52:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the Pluto.

1553
01:52:49,886 --> 01:52:54,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I've seen the Neptune one because they have it at Classic Gaming Expo every year.

1554
01:52:54,950 --> 01:53:00,734
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is huge and it looks like a Saturn and a Sega CD had an ugly baby.

1555
01:53:01,095 --> 01:53:02,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Pluto keeps getting shit on.

1556
01:53:02,956 --> 01:53:04,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a real planet.

1557
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:05,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a real system.

1558
01:53:06,699 --> 01:53:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1559
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:22,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Good thing we didn't name this show Pluto Lounge Radio or we might have been in trouble Good thing we weren't Pluto Edge Radio You see what I did there Loki, were you going to get into something?

1560
01:53:22,814 --> 01:53:23,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I think I cut you off

1561
01:53:24,082 --> 01:53:27,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to talk about how successful Microsoft is.

1562
01:53:27,664 --> 01:53:33,287
[SPEAKER_06]: They turned a profit in their third quarter, which just ended March 31st.

1563
01:53:34,128 --> 01:53:42,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, I guess, $2.53 billion, a 56% increase over last year.

1564
01:53:43,433 --> 01:53:45,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, citing that, you know,

1565
01:53:47,483 --> 01:53:51,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, Halo 4 is a big part of that.

1566
01:53:52,985 --> 01:54:07,389
[SPEAKER_06]: They were saying that, I guess, overall, though, they said the operating income of $342 million was up from a $242 million loss last year.

1567
01:54:08,189 --> 01:54:12,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, they're up, but some of their costs went up as well.

1568
01:54:12,771 --> 01:54:13,391
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying right now,

1569
01:54:13,991 --> 01:54:41,498
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically Xbox Live memberships grew 18% now 46 million members and they're saying that the console I guess it shipped 8.9 million units in the first 9 months of fiscal 2013 down 3 million units from the same time last year but it's to be expected it's been out for 8 years now you expect there's going to be a little decline no price drop or anything recently to motivate it yeah

1570
01:54:43,038 --> 01:54:43,358
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1571
01:55:08,733 --> 01:55:35,004
[SPEAKER_08]: the games that supports right now Animal Crossing New Leaf and Tomodachi Collection New Life which isn't something we have here but those are the games that are going to work with the service and you can even see in a little screenshot here you see the games and I guess you take the screenshot and you just put them right up on Twitter and Tumblr which I find interesting that those are the two that are picked not like Facebook or something but again it's Japan Facebook might not be in Japan what it is here and honestly do you want more of that shit on your Facebook?

1572
01:55:36,464 --> 01:55:37,045
[SPEAKER_08]: click block

1573
01:55:40,086 --> 01:55:41,908
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right, I don't want more of that shit on Facebook.

1574
01:55:41,928 --> 01:55:44,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is actually on my shit list for a big reason.

1575
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:47,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been talking bad about it for a long time.

1576
01:55:47,212 --> 01:55:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the party.

1577
01:55:48,433 --> 01:55:48,713
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1578
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:54,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, no word, however, if this is something that's coming to our side of the pond, we'll see.

1579
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:58,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine it's one of those things that might surprise us in a future Nintendo Direct.

1580
01:55:58,942 --> 01:56:03,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine maybe they are trying to incorporate some other services that are big here.

1581
01:56:03,145 --> 01:56:05,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine they wouldn't try to do Facebook.

1582
01:56:06,188 --> 01:56:06,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think what other...

1583
01:56:07,748 --> 01:56:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I just hit Tom Nook with a bug catching net.

1584
01:56:11,851 --> 01:56:12,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1585
01:56:14,753 --> 01:56:15,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great.

1586
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I just made somebody fall into a hole.

1587
01:56:17,215 --> 01:56:18,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they incorporate more of this stuff.

1588
01:56:19,036 --> 01:56:22,479
[SPEAKER_08]: They should do this type of instant screenshotting for virtual console games.

1589
01:56:22,499 --> 01:56:28,643
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I would have loved something like this when I was playing the first, well, technically the second Animal Crossing on GameCube and had my town lesbian.

1590
01:56:30,172 --> 01:56:54,361
[SPEAKER_02]: or like look what crazy shit I got this guy to say I know like well we had what one character because I think we brought over your card to have our our town people meet and now like half of my town members started saying pussy and then we brought it over to Adam's house and with his and on his wife's game and then half of her town started saying it too

1591
01:56:55,615 --> 01:56:57,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I caused an outbreak.

1592
01:56:57,956 --> 01:56:58,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a virus.

1593
01:56:59,117 --> 01:56:59,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I was.

1594
01:56:59,838 --> 01:57:00,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob caused an outbreak.

1595
01:57:00,818 --> 01:57:11,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one that said a really, really nasty word, and there was a certain friend at the time that really did not like that word, and it ended up moving to her village.

1596
01:57:11,324 --> 01:57:18,869
[SPEAKER_08]: She worked for months, from what I hear, to get rid of it, so...

1597
01:57:19,529 --> 01:57:20,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.

1598
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:21,230
[SPEAKER_08]: In retrospect, I feel bad.

1599
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:22,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Memories.

1600
01:57:22,451 --> 01:57:23,132
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah.

1601
01:57:23,412 --> 01:57:23,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Memory.

1602
01:57:23,992 --> 01:57:25,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing ruining lives left and right.

1603
01:57:26,574 --> 01:57:26,874
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1604
01:57:28,275 --> 01:57:30,736
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the part of the show where we would do the mailbag.

1605
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:34,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1606
01:57:34,359 --> 01:57:35,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Lol, nope.

1607
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But no emails tonight?

1608
01:57:38,782 --> 01:57:39,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Freeze Pop emailed us.

1609
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: They're selling merchandise to benefit the folks in Boston.

1610
01:57:44,116 --> 01:57:44,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, that's cool.

1611
01:57:44,756 --> 01:57:45,356
[SPEAKER_08]: They are from VOD.

1612
01:57:45,376 --> 01:57:45,796
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1613
01:57:45,957 --> 01:57:48,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so go check out Freeze Pop's merchandise.

1614
01:57:48,097 --> 01:57:48,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We love Freeze Pop.

1615
01:57:49,417 --> 01:57:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost sang Sprode last night, and then I was too drunk.

1616
01:57:53,379 --> 01:57:58,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason why I kind of snickered in the beginning is because we get a lot of stuff from them all the time about what's going on.

1617
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is definitely a cause worth plugging.

1618
01:58:01,221 --> 01:58:04,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to give it one more refresh just to see.

1619
01:58:04,142 --> 01:58:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case?

1620
01:58:05,002 --> 01:58:08,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody sent me an asshole email in the interim, then you're banned.

1621
01:58:10,244 --> 01:58:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope!

1622
01:58:10,884 --> 01:58:11,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us one for next week.

1623
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:14,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Send me something funny.

1624
01:58:34,404 --> 01:58:35,225
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

1625
01:58:35,305 --> 01:58:38,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay because if I'd played it tonight, I wouldn't have had anything for next week.

1626
01:58:38,426 --> 01:58:43,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't forget to send in bumpers and more details are available at thevognetwork.com forums.

1627
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:45,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Use your gaming voices to tell people stuff.

1628
01:58:46,831 --> 01:58:48,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what are you... Something coming up.

1629
01:58:49,212 --> 01:58:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Mewing out over there.

1630
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:50,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1631
01:58:50,653 --> 01:58:51,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Something looks hideous.

1632
01:58:51,734 --> 01:58:53,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well let's do the FUs of the week.

1633
01:58:53,494 --> 01:58:57,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of hideous and wrong... And horrible.

1634
01:59:13,752 --> 01:59:15,973
[SPEAKER_02]: to the girl who is at Panda Express.

1635
01:59:17,334 --> 01:59:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one working there.

1636
01:59:18,714 --> 01:59:23,517
[SPEAKER_02]: She walks up, this girl walks up to my car and says, Hi, can you please buy us dinner?

1637
01:59:23,577 --> 01:59:25,157
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom just lost her job.

1638
01:59:25,978 --> 01:59:27,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, she was totally lying.

1639
01:59:28,459 --> 01:59:34,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was, she was there with her friends hanging out and drinking cups of water from inside the... Not an Oscar winner.

1640
01:59:34,782 --> 01:59:35,002
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1641
01:59:35,482 --> 01:59:37,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, and so I just looked at her and said, No.

1642
01:59:39,324 --> 01:59:41,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, but we need food.

1643
01:59:41,585 --> 01:59:44,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, there's assistance programs.

1644
01:59:44,466 --> 01:59:46,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going in Panda Express.

1645
01:59:46,266 --> 01:59:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went into the Rite Aid because it's like right next door because I wanted to buy cheap crappy sunglasses to wear over my regular glasses.

1646
01:59:55,433 --> 02:00:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, um, so I walked back, um, in, um, to go find my food and I'm sorry I didn't get you any hot and sour.

1647
02:00:03,303 --> 02:00:03,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1648
02:00:03,763 --> 02:00:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually ended up having Panda earlier today by coincidence.

1649
02:00:06,507 --> 02:00:07,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So it works out.

1650
02:00:07,988 --> 02:00:14,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, so anyway, um, by the way, the guy who talked about my hair a couple of weeks ago was there and he said, you did your hair that way again.

1651
02:00:15,237 --> 02:00:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, the girls were sitting out there just being completely stupid and harassing customers, but they didn't have, like, any kind of security going on.

1652
02:00:22,844 --> 02:00:24,605
[SPEAKER_02]: They had no way to ask them to leave.

1653
02:00:25,546 --> 02:00:28,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was like, oh, I am so sorry, your customers are being harassed right now.

1654
02:00:29,690 --> 02:00:34,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, to the Audi, the person driving the Audi who kept trying to pass me, no.

1655
02:00:35,855 --> 02:00:36,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

1656
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:36,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1657
02:00:37,159 --> 02:00:37,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1658
02:00:38,881 --> 02:00:45,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go all Seinfeld, but seriously, what's up with bicycles built for two?

1659
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:50,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I saw on the way here, there's a lot of bikers out right now.

1660
02:00:50,676 --> 02:00:51,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a tandem?

1661
02:00:52,972 --> 02:00:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, it's a bike with two seats and people both pedal.

1662
02:00:57,873 --> 02:00:58,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1663
02:00:58,373 --> 02:00:58,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

1664
02:00:59,113 --> 02:01:04,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you meant like the one in back, like the classic tandem bicycle or if it had a buggy or something.

1665
02:01:04,675 --> 02:01:08,696
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, the classic, like you see it in cartoons where it's a bicycle built for two.

1666
02:01:09,136 --> 02:01:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Riding through the park together.

1667
02:01:10,676 --> 02:01:11,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Muppet movie.

1668
02:01:11,576 --> 02:01:14,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, I understand, you know, if you're on vacation or something like that.

1669
02:01:14,437 --> 02:01:16,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's get a bicycle built for two.

1670
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:20,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But these were people that were, you know, the bikers that you see out on the road that dress up.

1671
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:23,600
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that, like, have their team sponsored.

1672
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,401
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not sponsored by any fucking person, okay?

1673
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:28,021
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have this stupid biker thing.

1674
02:01:28,521 --> 02:01:29,902
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks ridiculous.

1675
02:01:30,482 --> 02:01:33,883
[SPEAKER_06]: You look ridiculous in a bicycle built for two.

1676
02:01:34,183 --> 02:01:40,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm supposed to be, you know, convinced that you're training for your bicycle built for two marathon race that you're gonna be in?

1677
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:42,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on, it's just... Now that song is stuck in my head.

1678
02:01:43,797 --> 02:01:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just weird.

1679
02:01:45,338 --> 02:01:45,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1680
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:47,860
[SPEAKER_06]: It just annoys me extra.

1681
02:01:50,201 --> 02:01:50,922
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week.

1682
02:01:50,942 --> 02:01:52,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll keep it short and sweet.

1683
02:01:53,684 --> 02:01:57,246
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to those bastards that set the bombs off in Boston.

1684
02:01:58,066 --> 02:02:01,369
[SPEAKER_08]: That was some straight up fucked up crap.

1685
02:02:01,809 --> 02:02:02,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the MIT shooter.

1686
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all the same guys.

1687
02:02:06,872 --> 02:02:07,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

1688
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the same people?

1689
02:02:08,253 --> 02:02:10,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you not see the fuckery that blew up everywhere?

1690
02:02:10,754 --> 02:02:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw that it was somebody.

1691
02:02:11,894 --> 02:02:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see that it was the same people.

1692
02:02:13,895 --> 02:02:17,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fucked up, but you know what?

1693
02:02:17,337 --> 02:02:24,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Props to the city for banding together to stay safe and find the guy.

1694
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:31,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they killed one and arrested the other guy who's like half alive right now, so maybe they'll be able to get some answers.

1695
02:02:31,923 --> 02:02:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be the hardy boys.

1696
02:03:00,563 --> 02:03:05,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby had an interview with a very nice developer who's making crime games.

1697
02:03:05,128 --> 02:03:07,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to go solve crimes, go play her games.

1698
02:03:08,552 --> 02:03:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have to agree, though, that major kudos to the Boston Police.

1699
02:03:14,799 --> 02:03:15,080
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1700
02:03:17,202 --> 02:03:18,743
[SPEAKER_08]: But also F you to CNN.

1701
02:03:18,843 --> 02:03:20,325
[SPEAKER_08]: God, they fucked up this week.

1702
02:03:20,866 --> 02:03:21,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1703
02:03:22,207 --> 02:03:25,571
[SPEAKER_02]: CNN earns fuck up of the year already for me.

1704
02:03:26,251 --> 02:03:28,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of how shitty their coverage is.

1705
02:03:28,994 --> 02:03:30,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to BBC for my news.

1706
02:03:32,498 --> 02:03:35,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wait for the official press conferences.

1707
02:03:35,861 --> 02:03:37,263
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing I cannot stand.

1708
02:03:37,663 --> 02:03:57,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot stand about situations like this is when there's a lull in actual news it's let's talk about the why let's theorize on all this crap we don't know about why did they do it or make up these theories that's the stuff that drives me bonkers when it comes to news I think you played video games

1709
02:03:57,836 --> 02:04:00,077
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1710
02:04:18,407 --> 02:04:21,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really, oh god, I got into it with my mother today too.

1711
02:04:21,229 --> 02:04:28,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super disgusted over that sort of closed-minded mentality that, oh, they ain't white, they must be in trouble.

1712
02:04:28,994 --> 02:04:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

1713
02:04:29,694 --> 02:04:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

1714
02:04:30,535 --> 02:04:36,439
[SPEAKER_08]: When you literally cannot get, literally cannot get more Caucasian than these guys.

1715
02:04:36,459 --> 02:04:38,880
[SPEAKER_08]: They were from the Caucasus Mountains.

1716
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:39,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi!

1717
02:04:39,621 --> 02:04:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, like,

1718
02:04:43,553 --> 02:04:44,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Uber Caucasian.

1719
02:04:45,014 --> 02:04:46,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That is literal Caucasian.

1720
02:04:46,695 --> 02:04:47,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I am with Misty.

1721
02:04:47,796 --> 02:04:50,658
[SPEAKER_08]: See, shit like this is why I stick to the Bloody Weather channel.

1722
02:04:51,639 --> 02:04:52,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.

1723
02:04:52,899 --> 02:04:53,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna rain.

1724
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:54,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1725
02:04:54,801 --> 02:04:57,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about ready to sign up for that group going to Mars.

1726
02:04:58,023 --> 02:04:58,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this planet.

1727
02:04:58,683 --> 02:04:59,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gone.

1728
02:05:00,905 --> 02:05:01,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the show.

1729
02:05:02,246 --> 02:05:03,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I will find a way to Skype from Mars.

1730
02:05:04,187 --> 02:05:04,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1731
02:05:04,788 --> 02:05:07,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we move on to more gaming news?

1732
02:05:09,082 --> 02:05:12,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about green people instead of white people, Loki.

1733
02:05:12,986 --> 02:05:13,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

1734
02:05:13,967 --> 02:05:21,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have a mod for Skyrim that turns the Argonians into ninja turtles.

1735
02:05:22,475 --> 02:05:23,296
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked frightening.

1736
02:05:23,636 --> 02:05:34,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you don't want to be Argonian, you can put the shell on yourself and you can be like some strange cat turtle or some chick turtle.

1737
02:05:36,257 --> 02:05:40,641
[SPEAKER_06]: The dude that they have in the picture here looks kind of like The Rock wearing Turtle Shell.

1738
02:05:40,681 --> 02:05:41,763
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, what?

1739
02:05:41,803 --> 02:05:42,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally serious about this.

1740
02:05:43,845 --> 02:05:44,986
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you can check that out.

1741
02:05:45,246 --> 02:05:56,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's on ModDB or if it's actually one of the... It's probably on ModDB or Skyrim Nexus.

1742
02:05:56,558 --> 02:05:58,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Skyrim Nexus is where it's at.

1743
02:05:59,361 --> 02:06:02,706
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah, check it out if that's your thing.

1744
02:06:03,467 --> 02:06:08,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this gives you an idea what the new Michael Bay movie is going to look like because it's terrible.

1745
02:06:10,276 --> 02:06:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1746
02:06:10,876 --> 02:06:17,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1747
02:06:18,202 --> 02:06:18,922
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty cool.

02:06:18,982 --> 02:06:22,145
[SPEAKER_08]: A new album being produced for record label Game Chops.

1749
02:06:22,205 --> 02:06:23,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called World 1-2.

1750
02:06:23,886 --> 02:06:26,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just about Mario.

1751
02:06:26,668 --> 02:06:33,113
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about kind of like what's new and what's going on in bit rock and all that stuff right now.

1752
02:06:33,773 --> 02:06:48,697
[SPEAKER_08]: including people like super hexagon composer Chip Zell, Manami Matsume who did Mega Man and we talked about also doing some tracks for Shovel Knight, Austin Wintory contributing to this, Akira Yamaoka apparently going to be on this too.

1753
02:06:48,957 --> 02:06:49,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I would marry that man.

1754
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:52,098
[SPEAKER_08]: The album comes out May 2nd for $10.

1755
02:06:53,418 --> 02:06:55,659
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check out some of the tracks on

02:06:56,619 --> 02:07:24,507

1757
02:07:27,975 --> 02:07:30,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play a little bit of it, but it's not working.

1758
02:07:30,898 --> 02:07:31,798
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL Live Radio.

1759
02:07:31,838 --> 02:07:32,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Crap.

1760
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:34,781
[SPEAKER_08]: LOL Live Radio.

1761
02:07:34,821 --> 02:07:36,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if one of these others will work here.

1762
02:07:36,662 --> 02:07:38,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try this Chip Zell track real quick.

1763
02:07:42,207 --> 02:07:43,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Live Radio.

1764
02:07:43,748 --> 02:07:45,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it won't work for some reason.

1765
02:07:47,597 --> 02:07:48,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave them the website.

1766
02:07:48,558 --> 02:07:49,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They can listen to it if they want to.

1767
02:07:49,858 --> 02:07:50,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check it out for yourself.

1768
02:07:50,758 --> 02:07:53,079
[SPEAKER_02]: After they've listened to us.

1769
02:07:53,859 --> 02:07:56,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can try to run both at the same time, but it might give you a headache.

1770
02:07:56,380 --> 02:08:00,762
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1771
02:08:00,782 --> 02:08:02,422
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome.

1772
02:08:02,622 --> 02:08:03,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk.

1773
02:08:03,262 --> 02:08:04,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk about whatever tonight.

1774
02:08:04,723 --> 02:08:08,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're getting to the last part of the show a little sooner than usual, but let's be real.

1775
02:08:08,864 --> 02:08:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: The last few shows have all been like three and a half hours, so...

1776
02:08:11,345 --> 02:08:13,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now I can go get my grocery shopping time.

1777
02:08:13,667 --> 02:08:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1778
02:08:14,527 --> 02:08:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

1779
02:08:15,047 --> 02:08:17,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We still might have some calls coming in that could be a good time.

1780
02:08:17,749 --> 02:08:21,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1781
02:08:22,973 --> 02:08:23,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Last minute stories, Loki?

1782
02:08:23,953 --> 02:08:25,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you have anything tonight.

1783
02:08:25,595 --> 02:08:27,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I just am shopping on Steam.

1784
02:08:27,736 --> 02:08:29,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked up Surgeon Simulator 2013.

1785
02:08:29,937 --> 02:08:30,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you did.

1786
02:08:31,298 --> 02:08:36,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also have a double pack of Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World for 99 cents.

1787
02:08:36,962 --> 02:08:37,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1788
02:08:37,803 --> 02:08:38,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not bad.

1789
02:08:38,843 --> 02:08:39,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad at all.

1790
02:08:39,824 --> 02:08:41,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Portal games were on super sale this weekend, right?

1791
02:08:41,765 --> 02:08:42,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I already have Portal.

1792
02:08:42,746 --> 02:08:43,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't have Portal?

1793
02:08:43,767 --> 02:08:50,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think most of our listeners picked that up by now, but if you didn't, for whatever reason... I mean, I'm surprised it's not $0.99 yet.

1794
02:08:51,552 --> 02:08:52,593
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll probably give it away.

1795
02:08:52,613 --> 02:09:00,338
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave Portal away, literally, at one point, and I'm sure Portal 2... Portal 2, right, I think was at a 50% off sale just a few days ago.

1796
02:09:00,358 --> 02:09:01,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1797
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's the whole one this weekend anyway.

1798
02:09:04,281 --> 02:09:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1799
02:09:04,721 --> 02:09:06,823
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to the phones.

1800
02:09:06,863 --> 02:09:07,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1801
02:09:07,824 --> 02:09:08,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1802
02:09:11,127 --> 02:09:12,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Hola, bienvenidos a... Hey, this is X-Link.

1803
02:09:12,888 --> 02:09:14,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, X-Link, how you doing?

1804
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:16,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing good.

1805
02:09:16,991 --> 02:09:17,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time no talk.

1806
02:09:17,551 --> 02:09:17,811
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

1807
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:19,172
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time since I've called in here.

1808
02:09:19,232 --> 02:09:21,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy... Last week, happy 500 episodes.

1809
02:09:22,014 --> 02:09:22,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1810
02:09:22,594 --> 02:09:23,395
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been awesome.

1811
02:09:23,415 --> 02:09:27,778
[SPEAKER_00]: 500, that's very... A lot of episodes, so... We're so old.

1812
02:09:31,016 --> 02:09:46,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling in because I was excited by Earthbound but I was a little disappointed because during the announcements for it they were saying that it was coming for the Wii U and I was hoping that it was also going to come for the 3DS because I do own a 3DS for that and that is one of my favorite games playing while growing up.

1813
02:09:48,088 --> 02:10:00,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't count out the 3DS, but I have a feeling they know a lot of people want Earthbound, and so they'll probably keep it exclusive to Wii U, because if you can even sell a handful of consoles to people that really want to play it again, they'll do it.

1814
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:04,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I don't know why you just wouldn't get a Super Nintendo and get the cart, but the cart...

1815
02:10:05,684 --> 02:10:10,067
[SPEAKER_08]: is not exactly... I mean, it still goes on eBay for like $150, right?

1816
02:10:10,248 --> 02:10:11,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like the portability of it.

1817
02:10:11,749 --> 02:10:19,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the fact that usually when I go to work, sometimes I take the bus and stuff, so it's kind of nice to have it so when I do the bus trips, it usually takes about 30-40 minutes.

1818
02:10:19,935 --> 02:10:23,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just sit there and just, you know, level up my character or do whatever it takes.

1819
02:10:23,957 --> 02:10:25,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Just play and have fun with it.

1820
02:10:25,779 --> 02:10:29,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Why won't Nintendo just open it up so you buy one, get them on all consoles?

1821
02:10:29,622 --> 02:10:34,165
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the... You know, they're still making money not doing it that way, so...

1822
02:10:34,588 --> 02:10:38,810
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they should take that, but then again, that's a playbook out of Sony too.

1823
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:45,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony kind of does that with some of their games with the PSP to the PS3 or, you know, vice versa kind of deal to that.

1824
02:10:45,912 --> 02:10:48,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I don't know about the Vita, but...

1825
02:10:50,014 --> 02:11:02,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I was referring more to the fact that you buy some of their quote-unquote arcade games, their lower-end games, like the pinball and stuff, that you can actually play on both systems without worrying about rebuying it like six times.

1826
02:11:02,482 --> 02:11:02,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like that's

1827
02:11:11,728 --> 02:11:20,230
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing against it because believe it or not here in the household here between me and my girlfriend we had bought Planes vs. Zombies like six different times for six different, almost six different forms of platforms.

1828
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:21,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people did.

1829
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:26,731
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do look forward to that.

1830
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:29,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, really quickly, Rob, you really love League of Legends.

1831
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:31,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to sit there and play with you.

1832
02:11:31,392 --> 02:11:33,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would have a lot of fun with that over Doa.

1833
02:11:33,672 --> 02:11:37,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Doa is just, the game is a lot of fun.

1834
02:11:37,113 --> 02:11:37,853
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of

1835
02:11:39,062 --> 02:12:00,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear I'm gonna give League of Legends the good old once over, but I gotta finish up a game, I gotta write a review for it first, and then I can get into League of Legends over the next week, while there's still not a lot going on for me in WoW right now.

1836
02:12:00,448 --> 02:12:01,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's one of those games...

1837
02:12:02,388 --> 02:12:28,176
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's nice enough where I can go in there and play a game for an hour or two and not worry about anything like right now I'm level 19 out of 30 so I'm working my way up to 30 right now but it's nice enough where I can sit there and play a game or two and not worrying about that you know I have to worry about subscription fee or anything like that unlike some other games like WoW or something what worries me most about League of Legends though is the other people I hear the community is really awful in League of Legends like no offense to the fans out there but I have heard your community is really awful

1838
02:12:29,099 --> 02:12:34,266
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of people that are really awful in the game, but there's also a lot of good people in the game.

1839
02:12:34,326 --> 02:12:34,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good and bad.

1840
02:12:35,047 --> 02:12:37,009
[SPEAKER_00]: But WoW is not that much worse.

1841
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:39,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at the people on there from Kel and stuff.

1842
02:12:39,953 --> 02:12:42,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just the horror stories.

1843
02:12:42,256 --> 02:12:44,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you just sitting here just, you know...

1844
02:12:44,839 --> 02:12:45,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that.

1845
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:47,281
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's with any game in general.

1846
02:12:47,301 --> 02:12:48,742
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the good along with the bad.

1847
02:12:48,822 --> 02:12:52,764
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's the fun of it, like playing with friends and stuff.

1848
02:12:52,784 --> 02:12:55,466
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to worry about that so much, you know.

1849
02:12:55,526 --> 02:13:01,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like one of those things where if you do something wrong or something, people will point it out saying, hey, by the way, you're not doing this right.

1850
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:05,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do this instead or just follow this or go here and look at this.

1851
02:13:05,453 --> 02:13:06,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like they do in WoW.

1852
02:13:06,414 --> 02:13:14,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of nice to know that there is a lot of people that's willing to work and, you know, as long as they're a lot good as there is bad with a lot of games.

1853
02:13:14,879 --> 02:13:18,082
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, I will give League of Legends a serious try.

1854
02:13:18,442 --> 02:13:22,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I've fired it up a couple times, but I haven't done anything serious with it.

1855
02:13:22,045 --> 02:13:27,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will take my friend's offer to help school me a little bit on it, and I'll let you guys all know how it turns out.

1856
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:28,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But give me a couple weeks.

1857
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a couple weeks.

1858
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:34,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if you need any pointers or anything, I'll be more than happy to... How about I kick your ass at it?

1859
02:13:35,155 --> 02:13:36,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, you want to do that, that's fine.

1860
02:13:36,876 --> 02:13:39,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy to do that, play a one-on-one game with you.

1861
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:42,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I can stream it on Twitch like everybody else.

1862
02:13:42,862 --> 02:13:43,342
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

1863
02:13:43,442 --> 02:13:44,303
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1864
02:13:44,443 --> 02:13:44,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1865
02:13:44,823 --> 02:13:46,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1866
02:13:47,265 --> 02:13:49,207
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much about it for right now.

1867
02:13:49,407 --> 02:13:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1868
02:13:50,008 --> 02:13:50,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, have a good one.

1869
02:13:50,608 --> 02:13:52,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to get my input out of Earthbound and stuff.

1870
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:57,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also kind of worried, too, wondering what they're going to do because now they're announcing this after so many years.

1871
02:13:57,834 --> 02:14:05,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of wondering if they're going to sugarcoat it or take stuff out or what they're going to do to replace it because I know a lot of the issues they were having with that was with the music.

1872
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of curious to know...

1873
02:14:07,903 --> 02:14:13,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very curious as well to see if it comes out unedited or if they make any changes.

1874
02:14:13,652 --> 02:14:17,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be very interesting because they're not going to announce it until it's already out.

1875
02:14:17,239 --> 02:14:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

1876
02:14:18,789 --> 02:14:19,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.

1877
02:14:20,110 --> 02:14:21,750
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably an E3 thing too.

1878
02:14:22,171 --> 02:14:24,151
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as the happy, happy cultists are still there.

1879
02:14:24,171 --> 02:14:24,792
[SPEAKER_08]: They're my favorite.

1880
02:14:25,012 --> 02:14:25,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1881
02:14:26,052 --> 02:14:26,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it will be.

1882
02:14:27,613 --> 02:14:29,854
[SPEAKER_08]: They remind me of Shane because everything has to be blue.

1883
02:14:29,974 --> 02:14:31,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1884
02:14:31,375 --> 02:14:31,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1885
02:14:32,555 --> 02:14:33,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

1886
02:14:34,336 --> 02:14:35,116
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good night, man.

1887
02:14:35,156 --> 02:14:35,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to you later.

1888
02:14:35,897 --> 02:14:36,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

1889
02:14:36,477 --> 02:14:38,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1890
02:14:38,358 --> 02:14:38,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1891
02:14:38,738 --> 02:14:42,619
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1892
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:43,460
[SPEAKER_08]: All one word.

1893
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I am still, by the way, singing the praises of Drunken Robot Pornography.

1894
02:14:48,621 --> 02:14:50,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you've been raving about that game on Steam and all that.

1895
02:14:50,642 --> 02:14:51,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone needs to play it.

1896
02:14:52,143 --> 02:14:53,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard as hell, but fun.

1897
02:14:53,663 --> 02:14:55,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a catchy theme song.

1898
02:14:55,664 --> 02:14:56,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played it?

1899
02:14:57,245 --> 02:14:57,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no.

1900
02:14:57,965 --> 02:14:58,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it.

1901
02:14:58,605 --> 02:14:59,086
[SPEAKER_08]: How much is it?

1902
02:14:59,126 --> 02:14:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Five bucks?

1903
02:14:59,486 --> 02:14:59,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Ten bucks.

1904
02:15:00,166 --> 02:15:00,626
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad.

1905
02:15:01,527 --> 02:15:02,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the next call.

1906
02:15:02,927 --> 02:15:03,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1907
02:15:03,868 --> 02:15:04,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1908
02:15:04,968 --> 02:15:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one and only Ranma.

1909
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:07,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey buddy, how you doing?

1910
02:15:07,909 --> 02:15:08,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm doing good.

1911
02:15:08,930 --> 02:15:09,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.

1912
02:15:10,090 --> 02:15:12,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that DarkSakura made some new album art for Anime Jam Session.

1913
02:15:12,991 --> 02:15:13,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks good.

1914
02:15:14,072 --> 02:15:15,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean...

1915
02:15:17,707 --> 02:15:26,349
[SPEAKER_05]: she took my idea and just took it to the next level because that was not what I was expecting I'm just like the entire staff pretty much loves the new logo great

1916
02:15:27,301 --> 02:15:28,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad that you like it.

1917
02:15:28,942 --> 02:15:31,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Now tell people to hire me.

1918
02:15:31,683 --> 02:15:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the official Facebook page, there is a link to your fan page where people can contact you for commissions.

1919
02:15:38,665 --> 02:15:40,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would appreciate that, trust me.

1920
02:15:40,926 --> 02:15:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not mean to derail your call with singing the praises of DarkSakura.

1921
02:15:44,348 --> 02:15:45,168
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind tonight?

1922
02:15:45,268 --> 02:15:45,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, though.

1923
02:15:48,009 --> 02:15:49,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a couple of things.

1924
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:50,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit different from what you were talking about.

1925
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:54,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something I've been meaning to bring up in conversation prior.

1926
02:15:54,592 --> 02:15:54,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1927
02:15:55,592 --> 02:15:59,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Loki bitching about Smartglass.

1928
02:15:59,718 --> 02:16:02,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And truth be told, I understand where he's coming from.

1929
02:16:02,822 --> 02:16:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But my thing is, with Smartglass and the new upcoming PS... Excuse me.

1930
02:16:09,291 --> 02:16:10,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Upcoming Xbox...

1931
02:16:10,993 --> 02:16:15,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see Microsoft use more smart glass integration when playing games.

1932
02:16:15,534 --> 02:16:23,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd also like to see Sony get on the bandwagon with the PS4 because truth be told, not everybody's going to have a Vita.

1933
02:16:24,036 --> 02:16:35,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, if you're going to be beaming stuff to the Vita, which its operating system is slightly similar to Android, maybe we can get a little app on our tablet so we can kind of have a little fun with that too.

1934
02:16:36,358 --> 02:16:46,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure it can work as fast as, say, a Wii U because a Wii U, you know, uses that whole dedicated broadcasting channel to transmit to the pad.

1935
02:16:46,125 --> 02:16:56,652
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot different than the technology in something like smart glass where your little iDevice beams to your wireless and the Xbox or whatever is on that same device.

1936
02:16:56,672 --> 02:16:58,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's kind of running through your router.

1937
02:16:58,453 --> 02:17:00,094
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually slows things down a lot.

1938
02:17:00,134 --> 02:17:04,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not like your device can be a controller suddenly or anything like that.

1939
02:17:04,077 --> 02:17:05,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's not going to work like that.

1940
02:17:05,865 --> 02:17:09,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wouldn't want it as a controller, but like a secondary screen or something like that.

1941
02:17:09,928 --> 02:17:15,672
[SPEAKER_08]: The weird thing about it is that that's what I always thought smart glass was supposed to be, and smart glass was really implemented poorly.

1942
02:17:16,113 --> 02:17:19,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's another example of something that Microsoft really half-assed.

1943
02:17:19,575 --> 02:17:23,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they put on a great show at E3, and then they half-assed their way through it.

1944
02:17:23,998 --> 02:17:26,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Connect Labs is another great example, Game Room.

1945
02:17:27,961 --> 02:17:29,483
[SPEAKER_08]: They half-assed a lot of this shit.

1946
02:17:29,503 --> 02:17:30,043
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't see it.

1947
02:17:30,643 --> 02:17:36,628
[SPEAKER_08]: XNA, sorry about it, but they didn't really give it the due that it deserved.

1948
02:17:36,648 --> 02:17:37,749
[SPEAKER_08]: The vision camera.

1949
02:17:38,246 --> 02:17:38,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the vision camera.

1950
02:17:39,006 --> 02:17:40,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the list goes on and on.

1951
02:17:40,867 --> 02:17:42,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Just add smart glass to the list.

1952
02:17:42,308 --> 02:17:47,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really unfortunate because you kind of see the potential there, especially with it being such a media device.

1953
02:17:48,291 --> 02:17:55,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And watch, at E3 this year, when they're selling their little dedicated channel, they're going to push the second screen technology again.

1954
02:17:55,734 --> 02:17:57,235
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to push smart glass again.

1955
02:17:57,575 --> 02:18:00,036
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really hope to hell someone calls them out on it like...

1956
02:18:00,416 --> 02:18:02,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wasn't this supposed to be there already?

1957
02:18:03,177 --> 02:18:03,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And like what?

1958
02:18:04,358 --> 02:18:05,998
[SPEAKER_08]: A handful of movies have it?

1959
02:18:06,398 --> 02:18:08,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Dance Central and Halo.

1960
02:18:09,079 --> 02:18:13,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And all Halo does is launch what is a separate app anyway.

1961
02:18:13,961 --> 02:18:15,402
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download it as a separate app.

1962
02:18:15,462 --> 02:18:16,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still can't.

1963
02:18:16,582 --> 02:18:17,922
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Forza or whatever.

1964
02:18:18,603 --> 02:18:19,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another one.

1965
02:18:19,163 --> 02:18:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza Horizon uses it.

1966
02:18:21,023 --> 02:18:25,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I still can't, on my Android device, actually pull up the map.

1967
02:18:25,685 --> 02:18:28,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have any of that actual smart glass function.

1968
02:18:28,245 --> 02:18:30,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, hey, look, Xbox app.

1969
02:18:30,206 --> 02:18:31,266
[SPEAKER_06]: We renamed it smart glass.

1970
02:18:31,346 --> 02:18:34,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Smart glass ought to be a hell of a lot better than it is.

1971
02:18:34,707 --> 02:18:35,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really disappointing.

1972
02:18:35,988 --> 02:18:36,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they could be doing these...

1973
02:18:37,708 --> 02:18:45,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not be fast enough to be a controller, so you can't even do little sub-menus and things like that, but why not maps of levels that you're playing?

1974
02:18:45,569 --> 02:18:47,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Like static images that change.

1975
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:51,391
[SPEAKER_08]: It blows my mind how ridiculous it is.

1976
02:18:51,991 --> 02:18:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're right.

1977
02:18:53,551 --> 02:18:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to cut you off, but you're right.

1978
02:18:55,511 --> 02:19:05,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But because, I mean, the Wi-Fi frequency, I mean, it is not as fast, but it gets up there because smart glass is pretty much like an over-glorified controller that...

1979
02:19:05,433 --> 02:19:06,814
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much what it is.

1980
02:19:07,194 --> 02:19:15,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, I use my tablet to tell it to play videos on YouTube on my TV through the 360 or the PS3.

1981
02:19:15,638 --> 02:19:16,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.

1982
02:19:17,059 --> 02:19:17,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

1983
02:19:17,939 --> 02:19:18,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fast.

1984
02:19:18,939 --> 02:19:19,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

1985
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:23,702
[SPEAKER_06]: The new system is supposed to be running on Bluetooth versus this Wi-Fi thing.

1986
02:19:23,782 --> 02:19:33,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they can have an app that directly communicates with it via Bluetooth instead of over Wi-Fi, so you're going to have less latency and you can do more amazing things with it.

1987
02:19:34,287 --> 02:19:34,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1988
02:19:37,014 --> 02:19:46,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, E3 is going to be Microsoft touting all these features again, but we'll see how many of them actually excuse me, actually get implemented to its fullest.

1989
02:19:46,619 --> 02:19:46,759
Yep.

1990
02:19:47,839 --> 02:19:49,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1991
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:52,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a funny Paxi story.

1992
02:19:52,701 --> 02:19:53,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go for it.

1993
02:19:54,242 --> 02:20:03,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're all in one of the rooms, we're all sitting there, you know, we have our 3DSs out, we're, you know, we're swap noting and cross-friending and all that cool stuff.

1994
02:20:03,727 --> 02:20:04,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And then

1995
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:08,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby happens to, you know, walk out of the room because he had to go take care of something.

1996
02:20:09,094 --> 02:20:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends in the room, he's going through his friends list and he's like, oh, Bobby Blackwolf.

1997
02:20:18,202 --> 02:20:19,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm friended with him now.

1998
02:20:20,464 --> 02:20:22,405
[SPEAKER_05]: He just said it very nonchalantly.

1999
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:27,459
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire room just gets quiet and looks at him.

2000
02:20:28,119 --> 02:20:29,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, what?

2001
02:20:30,061 --> 02:20:32,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, um, that was Bobby Blackwell.

2002
02:20:32,844 --> 02:20:34,927
[SPEAKER_05]: He just walked out the room.

2003
02:20:36,963 --> 02:20:40,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So is this somebody that was like a fan of the show that had no idea that Bobby was right in front of them?

2004
02:20:41,024 --> 02:20:49,106
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Paul, who goes by the name of Oshie, he used to be, I think he used to be like a mod on the G4 forums and the chat room and stuff like that.

2005
02:20:49,126 --> 02:20:50,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So they go way back.

2006
02:20:50,387 --> 02:20:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like he didn't realize that was Bobby in the room.

2007
02:20:53,608 --> 02:20:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

2008
02:20:56,011 --> 02:20:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: and we kind of gave them hell for that the whole weekend.

2009
02:20:59,655 --> 02:21:00,275
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

2010
02:21:00,476 --> 02:21:06,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, especially through this radio thing, I've met some people and they're like, you know, you don't look anything like you sound.

2011
02:21:06,341 --> 02:21:07,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just like, all right.

2012
02:21:08,523 --> 02:21:09,544
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you respond to that?

2013
02:21:09,584 --> 02:21:10,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bobby looks like a Bobby.

2014
02:21:12,928 --> 02:21:13,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to respond to that.

2015
02:21:14,029 --> 02:21:15,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that an insult or a compliment?

2016
02:21:16,031 --> 02:21:17,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It could go either way.

2017
02:21:17,953 --> 02:21:18,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

2018
02:21:18,633 --> 02:21:18,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

2019
02:21:19,594 --> 02:21:21,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I still remember that cat to come.

2020
02:21:21,075 --> 02:21:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: We're walking around in the dealer's room.

2021
02:21:23,616 --> 02:21:27,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even five minutes and the guy goes, You're Rob Roberts from Orange Sounds Radio.

2022
02:21:28,498 --> 02:21:28,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2023
02:21:30,059 --> 02:21:30,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Blush.

2024
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:31,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it happened.

2025
02:21:31,599 --> 02:21:34,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when we were at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

2026
02:21:34,681 --> 02:21:35,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

2027
02:21:35,341 --> 02:21:36,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our listeners was there?

2028
02:21:36,882 --> 02:21:37,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, listener.

2029
02:21:38,563 --> 02:21:46,406
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very nice, like, it's an uber compliment, but one thing to remember, guys, like, I'm not Tom Cruise, okay?

2030
02:21:46,446 --> 02:21:47,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God.

2031
02:21:47,287 --> 02:21:48,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God I'm not.

2032
02:21:48,707 --> 02:21:50,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Like more Tom Cruise.

2033
02:21:50,589 --> 02:21:53,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a fan of video games just like the rest of you guys.

2034
02:21:53,592 --> 02:21:56,115
[SPEAKER_08]: So when people are like, oh my god, you're Rob.

2035
02:21:56,155 --> 02:21:58,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, yeah, I'm Rob.

2036
02:21:58,277 --> 02:21:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, how you doing?

2037
02:21:59,118 --> 02:21:59,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about yourself.

2038
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been listening to me for all this time.

2039
02:22:02,322 --> 02:22:02,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about you.

2040
02:22:03,903 --> 02:22:08,308
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's very humbling, but very flattering.

2041
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:10,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

2042
02:22:11,647 --> 02:22:11,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2043
02:22:12,808 --> 02:22:14,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm gonna let you go, Ranma, to see if anybody else comes through, okay?

2044
02:22:15,571 --> 02:22:16,092
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it, bro.

2045
02:22:16,132 --> 02:22:16,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2046
02:22:17,293 --> 02:22:17,934
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

2047
02:22:18,534 --> 02:22:19,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2048
02:22:20,196 --> 02:22:20,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2049
02:22:20,556 --> 02:22:25,361
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange... Y'all right over there in the kitchen?

2050
02:22:27,145 --> 02:22:28,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan's making a mess.

2051
02:22:28,706 --> 02:22:30,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to some tweets.

2052
02:22:30,486 --> 02:22:32,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2053
02:22:32,667 --> 02:22:33,848
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw sending us a tweet.

2054
02:22:33,868 --> 02:22:35,168
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys might have read about this in the news.

2055
02:22:35,568 --> 02:22:39,130
[SPEAKER_08]: LulzSec member sentenced for Sony Pictures website hacking.

2056
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:46,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they went after some of those guys that were involved in that and it looks like they've sentenced a few of them and one of them for the hacking of Sony Pictures website.

2057
02:22:47,873 --> 02:22:51,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Not related to the Sony PlayStation Network hack though, right?

2058
02:22:51,855 --> 02:22:52,055
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2059
02:22:52,075 --> 02:22:52,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Different, right?

2060
02:22:53,456 --> 02:22:53,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2061
02:22:54,216 --> 02:22:55,957
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2062
02:23:23,826 --> 02:23:26,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll never forgive Comcast for what they did.

2063
02:23:27,049 --> 02:23:27,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2064
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:31,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it weird now that that's all really, really over, huh?

2065
02:23:32,055 --> 02:23:32,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2066
02:23:33,056 --> 02:23:34,117
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

2067
02:23:34,257 --> 02:23:36,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Props to Attack of the Show for the ending.

2068
02:23:36,599 --> 02:23:41,464
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a very nice way to end the show with a nod to Leo Laport and Alex and so forth.

2069
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:47,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I know Leo Laporte is still doing his podcast and such.

2070
02:23:48,171 --> 02:23:50,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Chris Perillo is doing live streaming.

2071
02:23:50,352 --> 02:23:54,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have a studio in the North Bay out in Petaluma, I think it's located.

2072
02:23:54,952 --> 02:23:56,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody I know went over there for something.

2073
02:23:57,373 --> 02:24:00,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool that they still kind of have all that in the Bay Area.

2074
02:24:00,253 --> 02:24:04,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not be in the city, but they're producing great content outside the city.

2075
02:24:05,074 --> 02:24:05,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2076
02:24:05,674 --> 02:24:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I didn't mean to derail you, but what's on your mind tonight?

2077
02:24:09,176 --> 02:24:13,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So, once again, I did want to wish you congrats on the 500th episode.

2078
02:24:13,801 --> 02:24:14,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2079
02:24:14,462 --> 02:24:15,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe we're still here?

2080
02:24:16,904 --> 02:24:17,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2081
02:24:17,825 --> 02:24:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel old and I need to see if I can find the old episode where I was there.

2082
02:24:23,812 --> 02:24:24,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember what episode number it was?

2083
02:24:25,974 --> 02:24:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.

2084
02:24:26,754 --> 02:24:29,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was summer of 2003, but that's all I remember.

2085
02:24:30,236 --> 02:24:31,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Two tips for you.

2086
02:24:31,356 --> 02:24:40,860
[SPEAKER_08]: There is the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wikia.com and Dark Tetsuya has put together an awesome little summary of every single episode.

2087
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:46,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at the summer of 2003, you might find the topics and you might go like, oh, I was there when that happened.

2088
02:24:47,382 --> 02:24:52,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's another website, and Dark Tetsuya will correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I think it's olarchive.com

2089
02:24:53,024 --> 02:25:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot T-K I think he had to change the forwarder so he'll give me the new address here in chat in a minute but there is look for it on the VOG Network forums look for Dark Tetsuya he has the OL Archive and there's a lot of old episodes they have up on like a SkyDrive somewhere so there's a lot a lot of old shit

2090
02:25:13,496 --> 02:25:13,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2091
02:25:14,156 --> 02:25:16,257
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'll have to check them out.

2092
02:25:16,317 --> 02:25:17,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the hookup, by the way.

2093
02:25:17,678 --> 02:25:17,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2094
02:25:18,018 --> 02:25:18,938
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is from Dark to Sea.

2095
02:25:19,098 --> 02:25:23,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Bit.ly, so Bit.ly slash O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E.

2096
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:30,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to, and this goes out to the general listenership as well, if you want to hear what Orange Lounge Radio sounded like back in 2003, you can check that out.

2097
02:25:30,863 --> 02:25:34,804
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do want to, I always kind of put this out there, it was a very different show back then.

2098
02:25:35,365 --> 02:25:36,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I was busy reading Harry Potter.

2099
02:25:38,026 --> 02:25:38,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

2100
02:25:40,855 --> 02:25:54,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of the reason why I'm calling here tonight as well, DarkSakura, I just sent over the details for Phantasy Star Online 2 for you, but there's something on my mind aside from that that I kind of want to get out there, and it's got me a little bit worried here.

2101
02:25:56,639 --> 02:26:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding that game, it was announced that it was supposed to come out here in the West, and then we rolled past the release date, and all Sega had to say was it's delayed and nothing else.

2102
02:26:09,822 --> 02:26:12,903
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's not the first time that this has happened.

2103
02:26:14,183 --> 02:26:29,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Colonial Marines, that just happened as well for the Wii U. Obviously that's under a different company but it's got me wondering what's up with the management because there have been other incidences with Sega recently such as the recent Shining Force debacle back in November.

2104
02:26:30,087 --> 02:26:33,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of got me wondering what's going on there and

2105
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:38,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we potentially seeing Sega of America closing soon?

2106
02:26:38,712 --> 02:26:40,754
[SPEAKER_01]: When has Sega had good management in the US?

2107
02:26:41,815 --> 02:26:47,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I am hoping you are just out here yelling the sky is falling, which is perfectly valid.

2108
02:26:47,059 --> 02:26:48,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You have good reason for thinking that.

2109
02:26:49,661 --> 02:26:54,886
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say E3 is kind of Sega's chance to be like, all right, put it out on the table.

2110
02:26:54,946 --> 02:26:55,446
[SPEAKER_08]: What's coming?

2111
02:26:55,506 --> 02:26:57,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Phantasy Star 2 on that list or not?

2112
02:26:58,128 --> 02:27:01,291
[SPEAKER_08]: and if it's not, then I would start to get worried.

2113
02:27:01,671 --> 02:27:04,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But I kind of think that's the type of thing they keep in their pants until E3.

2114
02:27:04,874 --> 02:27:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously think that Sega is still going to have a U.S.

2115
02:27:07,156 --> 02:27:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: presence regardless, even if they have to cut back operations here.

2116
02:27:10,218 --> 02:27:10,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sure.

2117
02:27:10,678 --> 02:27:13,881
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of Japanese companies still have an American presence in the games industry.

2118
02:27:15,682 --> 02:27:21,387
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have the translations done in-house at Sega of Japan, but I was just at PAX East recently.

2119
02:27:21,567 --> 02:27:27,012
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not have a booth there, so that's part of what's got me thinking this.

2120
02:27:27,612 --> 02:27:29,033
[SPEAKER_08]: PAX is kind of hit and miss.

2121
02:27:29,073 --> 02:27:30,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends if they have something to show or not.

2122
02:27:32,256 --> 02:27:35,139
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some companies that don't really do PAX.

2123
02:27:35,199 --> 02:27:36,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Take Blizzard, for example.

2124
02:27:36,821 --> 02:27:42,127
[SPEAKER_08]: They were there at PAX East because they had something to show with this whole new Hearthstone game, but they don't usually do these cons.

2125
02:27:42,287 --> 02:27:44,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Blizzard's like, LOL, we'll do our own con.

2126
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:46,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's actually just it.

2127
02:27:46,492 --> 02:27:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't usually do these things, so they kind of do it when it's convenient for them, which I don't blame them for.

2128
02:27:51,465 --> 02:27:59,589
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, I would go to SegaCon Just saying Agreed Well, what are we missing?

2129
02:27:59,869 --> 02:28:03,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You're playing Phantasy Star Online 2, obviously What are the rest of us missing?

2130
02:28:03,410 --> 02:28:08,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want to check it out at some point You mean in the game or other games?

2131
02:28:08,373 --> 02:28:10,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, in the game In Phantasy Star Online 2, how is it?

2132
02:28:11,852 --> 02:28:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

2133
02:28:12,453 --> 02:28:13,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2134
02:28:28,405 --> 02:28:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: The level design is superb in that even though it's randomized, it's still got a lot of familiar elements and you can just randomly encounter a boss outside of the boss nets.

2135
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:43,590
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just crazy.

2136
02:28:43,690 --> 02:28:47,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this mean that you can make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Phantasy Star Online 2?

2137
02:28:48,212 --> 02:28:48,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

2138
02:28:49,552 --> 02:28:53,194
[SPEAKER_04]: But can I still headshot a Wrappy?

2139
02:28:53,454 --> 02:28:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely spend at least an hour per character just building it.

2140
02:28:57,386 --> 02:28:58,987
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Rappies can I expect to kill?

2141
02:29:00,048 --> 02:29:00,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons.

2142
02:29:00,909 --> 02:29:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

2143
02:29:01,329 --> 02:29:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate those things.

2144
02:29:04,151 --> 02:29:08,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And they still play dead and then get back up and you can shoot them again or whatever.

2145
02:29:08,194 --> 02:29:09,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2146
02:29:09,075 --> 02:29:11,577
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend actually spent $100 to buy a Rappie plushie.

2147
02:29:11,777 --> 02:29:12,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

2148
02:29:12,437 --> 02:29:13,498
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Julie.

2149
02:29:13,658 --> 02:29:14,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

2150
02:29:14,659 --> 02:29:18,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a big English-speaking presence on the game?

2151
02:29:18,242 --> 02:29:22,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there a lot of people like you who are playing it even though it's not out in this country?

2152
02:29:22,765 --> 02:29:23,545
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2153
02:29:40,232 --> 02:29:46,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, people got fed up with how long it was taken, and so they just ran with it, basically.

2154
02:29:46,697 --> 02:29:47,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Fan communities do amazing things.

2155
02:29:47,917 --> 02:29:51,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't see Sega really having too big of a problem with it, to be honest.

2156
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, remember the support that they gave when they closed down the original Phantasy Star Online servers?

2157
02:29:58,344 --> 02:29:58,925
[SPEAKER_04]: True, true.

2158
02:29:59,145 --> 02:30:01,586
[SPEAKER_04]: They did open up the Japanese form.

2159
02:30:02,347 --> 02:30:04,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, but they also provided U.S.

2160
02:30:05,069 --> 02:30:09,692
[SPEAKER_02]: players with the data for their character to transfer to private servers.

2161
02:30:12,321 --> 02:30:13,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think that happened.

2162
02:30:13,541 --> 02:30:15,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was something that fans were hoping for.

2163
02:30:15,942 --> 02:30:22,046
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I was going to do it, but I ended up just sort of not caring because I hadn't been playing Phantasy Star Online for a little while.

2164
02:30:22,766 --> 02:30:28,169
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were allowing full character transfers into private servers.

2165
02:30:29,509 --> 02:30:32,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a limited window that they did it, but they had it available.

2166
02:30:35,252 --> 02:30:36,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to look that up again.

2167
02:30:36,690 --> 02:30:39,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, Prince Brightstar, thanks so much for the call.

2168
02:30:39,241 --> 02:30:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to hear from you for so long.

2169
02:30:40,687 --> 02:30:41,490
[SPEAKER_08]: So, welcome back.

2170
02:30:42,714 --> 02:30:46,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I'm probably going to be here every week for a good bit here.

2171
02:30:46,295 --> 02:30:46,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2172
02:30:46,755 --> 02:30:47,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate the support.

2173
02:30:47,815 --> 02:30:48,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you have a good one, okay, buddy?

2174
02:30:49,436 --> 02:30:49,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

2175
02:30:49,876 --> 02:30:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2176
02:30:50,156 --> 02:30:50,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

2177
02:30:51,056 --> 02:30:51,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2178
02:30:51,717 --> 02:30:52,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to hear from an old friend.

2179
02:30:52,977 --> 02:30:57,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really awesome for somebody that's like, you know, I fell out of the habit or whatever.

2180
02:30:57,638 --> 02:31:00,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Real life gets in the way and you don't end up listening to the show anymore.

2181
02:31:00,499 --> 02:31:00,919
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

2182
02:31:01,279 --> 02:31:07,001
[SPEAKER_08]: But then it's like after all this time, it's like, wow, I came back and y'all are still here and it hasn't really changed that much.

2183
02:31:07,161 --> 02:31:08,961
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a really awesome thing to hear.

2184
02:31:09,061 --> 02:31:10,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

2185
02:31:11,442 --> 02:31:34,451
[SPEAKER_08]: We outlived Tech TV G4 Womp womp Alright, let's see if we get a few more tweets out here I don't know if there's any other last minute stories But quickly, some more tweets from Tigerclaw Centipede creator sees lack of diversity in the game industry Hmm, is that just because it's sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel Milking out the IPs?

2186
02:31:34,491 --> 02:31:38,253
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my assumption here Hold on, I'm bringing up the article here Why would anyone be surprised by that?

2187
02:31:38,613 --> 02:31:40,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen these because they're tweeted to me.

2188
02:31:43,277 --> 02:31:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also depending on where you're looking.

2189
02:31:44,678 --> 02:31:47,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're looking at mainstream gaming, then yeah.

2190
02:31:47,380 --> 02:31:50,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's the headline they're pulling that quote from.

2191
02:31:50,443 --> 02:31:52,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, here's the quote they're pulling that headline from.

2192
02:31:52,865 --> 02:31:56,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So much progress has been made in the development cycle and the way games are developed.

2193
02:31:56,648 --> 02:31:59,450
[SPEAKER_08]: This is according to industry betting Dona Bailey.

2194
02:32:01,352 --> 02:32:07,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems there hasn't been enough progress in the diversity of game designers and gender equality for game designers.

2195
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:11,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2196
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that does make sense.

2197
02:32:14,082 --> 02:32:15,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And I probably totally butchered the name.

2198
02:32:15,603 --> 02:32:19,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably Donna Bailey, but I said it wrong because it's spelled a little differently than what I'm used to.

2199
02:32:19,826 --> 02:32:20,907
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hmm.

2200
02:32:23,163 --> 02:32:33,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sadly it's something, you know, it's not like we haven't heard it before, but I think the best way to help combat that a little bit is prove some of these analysts wrong.

2201
02:32:33,726 --> 02:32:40,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that say that, you know, the masses won't support a game with a strong female lead and so forth.

2202
02:32:40,088 --> 02:32:51,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important that, and I'm not saying you have to support a game just because it has a female lead, but find the one that you like and really rally behind it and, you know, gather support for it and so forth and show these guys they're wrong.

2203
02:32:51,993 --> 02:32:54,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think that we need to see more games that give you a choice

2204
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:00,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I made this comment during Bobby's show, and I think it's worth exploring a little bit.

2205
02:33:00,483 --> 02:33:01,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring this up with you, Jamie.

2206
02:33:01,864 --> 02:33:10,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obviously part of a larger problem with society, and my whole thing is that let's take the dude bros who buy Xbox, and I'm totally stereotyping here, guys.

2207
02:33:10,490 --> 02:33:10,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Bear with me.

2208
02:33:11,431 --> 02:33:18,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take the dude bros that buy their Xboxes because they're only interested in Madden games and the basketball games and all the sports games that come out every year.

2209
02:33:19,216 --> 02:33:22,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can't play as a woman in Madden, but that's not video games' fault.

2210
02:33:23,717 --> 02:33:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That's football.

2211
02:33:41,883 --> 02:33:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, but I don't see it happening just because of that.

2212
02:33:45,287 --> 02:33:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're in a total patriarchal society right now.

2213
02:33:47,971 --> 02:33:49,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just right now, we've always been.

2214
02:33:50,534 --> 02:33:52,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's completely disgusting.

2215
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:56,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to say one thing, that there are...

2216
02:33:57,823 --> 02:34:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: There are degrees of this physical expectation that's put out for sports.

2217
02:34:05,345 --> 02:34:10,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen some women's NBA players who could totally school guys.

2218
02:34:11,407 --> 02:34:13,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't see why we don't have an integrated team.

2219
02:34:13,448 --> 02:34:17,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to refer to the movie, but you remember A League of Their Own?

2220
02:34:17,309 --> 02:34:17,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

2221
02:34:17,689 --> 02:34:18,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit happened.

2222
02:34:19,189 --> 02:34:22,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Where all the men were in war, they had female baseball teams fully on.

2223
02:34:22,370 --> 02:34:24,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the WNBA is a thing.

2224
02:34:25,031 --> 02:34:25,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it is.

2225
02:34:25,711 --> 02:34:33,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm saying that it's not like we haven't had a precedent for having women in sports or even having integrated sports teams like that.

2226
02:34:33,835 --> 02:34:40,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that people have this notion that it shouldn't be done, that it can't be done, that there's a big physical difference.

2227
02:34:41,394 --> 02:34:42,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2228
02:35:02,243 --> 02:35:21,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if a person is physically capable of being a part of whatever that sport is, whatever that event is, they should be allowed to be in it without having to deal with judgment because of their gender or because of any other factor.

2229
02:35:22,677 --> 02:35:24,318
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I did close the Skype line for now.

2230
02:35:24,358 --> 02:35:26,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mean to get on this discussion, but it's a good one.

2231
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:30,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype, but feel free to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2232
02:35:31,726 --> 02:35:37,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Comment from ShadowNextGen, has DarkSakura seen how the UFC has started highlighting women's MMA?

2233
02:35:37,872 --> 02:35:42,317
[SPEAKER_08]: The next season of The Ultimate Fighter has two female coaches that will coach both men and women.

2234
02:35:42,357 --> 02:35:43,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Just curious about your thoughts.

2235
02:35:44,016 --> 02:36:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't watch much UFC I tried watching when oh god what was his name that was in WWF he god I can't because he was just like the most boring dude ever but he was amazing to watch but he came from UFC and then I think went back to UFC and I also watched when Brock Lesnar went to UFC for a little while dude he was vicious but I didn't really I haven't kept up with it

2236
02:36:10,953 --> 02:36:11,934
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2237
02:36:32,273 --> 02:36:33,453
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

2238
02:36:53,171 --> 02:36:57,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this do the image of the woman in sports favors?

2239
02:36:57,798 --> 02:37:03,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Or does it hurt because, well, Danica Patrick's in a game, but it's cutesy la-la land.

2240
02:37:03,225 --> 02:37:04,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's definitely not hurting her wallet.

2241
02:37:06,690 --> 02:37:08,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, props for that, right?

2242
02:37:09,907 --> 02:37:16,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at it so much as a hindrance, although it is, I think, going back to a little bit more on the stereotype.

2243
02:37:17,715 --> 02:37:24,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's definitely getting her some getting her exposure apart from just being pretty awesome on her own.

2244
02:37:24,742 --> 02:37:30,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, aren't we now seeing like more women in NASCAR to like more female drivers?

2245
02:37:31,188 --> 02:37:33,129
[SPEAKER_08]: She's certainly not the last.

2246
02:37:56,124 --> 02:37:59,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Bobby points out too, Danica wasn't the first female driver either.

2247
02:37:59,446 --> 02:38:00,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she wasn't the first.

2248
02:38:00,627 --> 02:38:01,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I just said she wasn't the last.

2249
02:38:02,328 --> 02:38:02,869
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't be last.

2250
02:38:02,889 --> 02:38:11,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But my problem with Danica Patrick is that she is having to rely on stereotypes to keep her popularity up.

2251
02:38:11,915 --> 02:38:16,518
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that whole, well, you gotta show a little boob or you gotta, you know, be this...

2252
02:38:17,859 --> 02:38:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be just a talented driver.

2253
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a sex symbol too.

2254
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: That I hate.

2255
02:38:24,201 --> 02:38:25,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate, I hate, I hate.

2256
02:38:25,361 --> 02:38:30,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people really, like you've got Ross DLUT in chat who says Danica Patrick didn't break through because of her racing.

2257
02:38:30,682 --> 02:38:33,443
[SPEAKER_08]: She broke through because she sexualizes herself in GoDaddy commercials.

2258
02:38:33,943 --> 02:38:38,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got people that kind of resent the whole TNA, if you will.

2259
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:49,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm even going to go into another, because one of my heroes, because I've been trying to work out a lot more, is a weightlifter named Samantha Wright.

2260
02:38:49,565 --> 02:38:51,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is adorable.

2261
02:38:51,866 --> 02:38:59,530
[SPEAKER_02]: She's probably my height, and I think that if I kept working out like she clearly does, I would probably be about the same build.

2262
02:39:00,990 --> 02:39:04,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked at her because we do have a lot of physical traits in common.

2263
02:39:04,992 --> 02:39:10,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that her body type would be a good ideal for me as far as working out and health.

2264
02:39:13,214 --> 02:39:16,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's getting all this extra attention because she is so absolutely adorable.

2265
02:39:16,795 --> 02:39:17,715
[SPEAKER_02]: She is pretty.

2266
02:39:18,475 --> 02:39:19,616
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty hot.

2267
02:39:20,056 --> 02:39:21,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I will say that.

2268
02:39:21,356 --> 02:39:26,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But there have been other female weightlifters who have been just as, if not more talented, if not stronger than her.

2269
02:39:27,478 --> 02:39:54,779
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you look at people who are actually physically strong and I'm not talking about the people who you know are those muscle competitions because they starve themselves to nothing they are at their least healthy when they're at a show you look at the actual strong people the people who do the strongman contest who are pulling semis with their body weight they're built like trunks and the women who participate in these they're built like you know complete

2270
02:39:56,180 --> 02:40:08,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny you bring up the bodybuilding because it brings to mind one of, I think, a great example of where there were very memorable men and women in this, and I'm using this term very loosely with my quotey fingers, sport, American gladiators.

2271
02:40:09,090 --> 02:40:09,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2272
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there were memorable men and women on that show.

2273
02:40:12,212 --> 02:40:14,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was really like an equal...

2274
02:40:15,995 --> 02:40:18,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you one thing about that, and just because I learned how to recognize it.

2275
02:40:19,017 --> 02:40:23,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly enough, when I worked at GNC, because we would have so many roided guys come in.

2276
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:27,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Teenagers take in that andro because of, what was that stupid baseball player?

2277
02:40:29,024 --> 02:40:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck whatever his name was.

2278
02:40:30,465 --> 02:40:34,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, there's a way to tell when a woman is roided.

2279
02:40:34,748 --> 02:40:35,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2280
02:40:37,003 --> 02:40:40,784
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some women on that show who were very naturally strong.

2281
02:40:41,264 --> 02:40:43,784
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked like a strong woman.

2282
02:40:43,824 --> 02:40:48,665
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see what a woman looks like without steroids, who has worked out, who has a small frame?

2283
02:40:48,945 --> 02:40:50,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2.

2284
02:40:51,066 --> 02:40:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm serious.

2285
02:40:52,206 --> 02:40:55,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, honestly, to me, people are like, oh, she looks so bulky.

2286
02:40:55,266 --> 02:40:56,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I thought that was really attractive.

2287
02:40:57,107 --> 02:40:59,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that looking strong was a very good thing.

2288
02:41:00,227 --> 02:41:01,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Mark McGuire, thank you.

2289
02:41:02,088 --> 02:41:02,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Barry Bonds.

2290
02:41:03,588 --> 02:41:08,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then you had the other ones like, and I'm going to go back to using China.

2291
02:41:09,549 --> 02:41:14,970
[SPEAKER_02]: A woman cannot carry that type of muscle structure naturally without having a genetic predisposition towards it.

2292
02:41:15,511 --> 02:41:31,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can tell how many people are augmented who have, uh, uh, breast enhancement surgery on top of having taken steroids because it will very much give more masculine traits to a woman because your beard basically taking steroids.

2293
02:41:34,335 --> 02:41:40,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just giggling because some of our chatters are like, you know, Actdeft's all sports lounge radio.

2294
02:41:40,217 --> 02:41:41,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mean to get this on this big tangent.

2295
02:41:41,818 --> 02:41:53,664
[SPEAKER_08]: My whole point with this before we just kind of went on and on and on with it, my whole point was the whole female leads in video games and we don't have enough of them.

2296
02:41:54,884 --> 02:42:02,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right that that's happening, but my point I'm making with it is that I think it's a reflection of a much larger problem with society.

2297
02:42:02,689 --> 02:42:04,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not specific to video games.

2298
02:42:04,951 --> 02:42:08,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to go off on the other, but I think we agree.

2299
02:42:08,753 --> 02:42:13,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the whole point is that, and this I think is going really towards anything, is that

2300
02:42:15,763 --> 02:42:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have... Even the really brilliant women out there, like just even in academia, are not drawing the biggest attention, are not being taken seriously if they don't also have a certain type of aesthetic, you know, appearance to them.

2301
02:42:30,452 --> 02:42:37,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really a very sad thing because you can have... Pardon me for saying this, the dumpiest looking guy ever.

2302
02:42:37,877 --> 02:42:40,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have neck bearded, you know...

2303
02:42:42,279 --> 02:42:42,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2304
02:42:58,122 --> 02:43:24,046
[SPEAKER_02]: even if she had three times the degree this guy did and had done all this fantastic biomedical research on appearances alone she wouldn't be taken seriously by the majority of people and that's where I think that we're getting into the really sad part and it doesn't and like I said it's not just affecting our gaming world it's affecting culture across the board and I get absolutely so sick of living in this society sometimes just because of it

2305
02:43:24,730 --> 02:43:26,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I did think of another positive, though.

2306
02:43:26,331 --> 02:43:35,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I did think of another place where I think it's done well, where we get male and female sports heroes that we failed to mention, because this is one of the few sporting events I really, truly enjoy watching.

2307
02:43:35,798 --> 02:43:36,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The Olympics.

2308
02:43:36,578 --> 02:43:36,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2309
02:43:37,259 --> 02:43:46,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Olympics are great, because you get a lot of strong athletes, no matter what, from all these different types of sports, and great stories and things.

2310
02:43:46,986 --> 02:43:48,307
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great thing, so...

2311
02:43:49,027 --> 02:43:52,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, even then, I hear, what was it on NBC?

2312
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:57,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the coverage of the Olympics this past one was dreadful, to say the least.

2313
02:43:58,073 --> 02:43:59,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's another issue.

2314
02:44:00,194 --> 02:44:04,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying is that you get side commentary from people.

2315
02:44:04,277 --> 02:44:09,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would go and look at YouTube videos of some of the events because I wasn't keeping up with it all the time.

2316
02:44:10,001 --> 02:44:15,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would see comments, oh, well, she looks like a dude or she looks this or she looks that.

2317
02:44:15,445 --> 02:44:18,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I go into a southern accent when I imitate a stupid person.

2318
02:44:20,048 --> 02:44:25,512
[SPEAKER_02]: But you still get that trying to ascribe aesthetics to what should have nothing to do with it.

2319
02:44:25,672 --> 02:44:26,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

2320
02:44:26,893 --> 02:44:30,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Tangent Train, Tangent Lounge Radio.

2321
02:44:30,415 --> 02:44:31,316
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good discussion, though.

2322
02:44:31,336 --> 02:44:31,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2323
02:44:31,916 --> 02:44:34,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and some chatters talking about tennis.

2324
02:44:34,118 --> 02:44:35,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a really good example, too.

2325
02:44:35,458 --> 02:44:35,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2326
02:44:35,959 --> 02:44:36,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Tennis has a lot of good people.

2327
02:44:36,899 --> 02:44:38,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed doubles is pretty fun, actually.

2328
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:39,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2329
02:44:39,501 --> 02:44:40,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So, good job, chatters.

2330
02:44:42,043 --> 02:45:05,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob turned on my ranty switch Maybe some emails next week Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But for now, we have got to wrap up the show And say goodnight Oh, I may not have got all the Twitter topics I'm sorry, let me quickly try to grab some of these SJ100Matt tweeting One of the most popular card games Is being made into a game for 360 Steve Jackson's Munchkin

2331
02:45:06,136 --> 02:45:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2332
02:45:06,757 --> 02:45:07,638
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.

2333
02:45:07,718 --> 02:45:08,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently.

2334
02:45:09,079 --> 02:45:11,401
[SPEAKER_08]: A link on Ain't It Cool News of all places.

2335
02:45:11,461 --> 02:45:13,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That site's been going on forever too.

2336
02:45:14,084 --> 02:45:14,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

2337
02:45:14,965 --> 02:45:15,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

2338
02:45:15,986 --> 02:45:16,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

2339
02:45:17,988 --> 02:45:19,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Munchkin, the video game.

2340
02:45:21,191 --> 02:45:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

2341
02:45:21,611 --> 02:45:22,312
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be very cool.

2342
02:45:23,942 --> 02:45:24,182
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2343
02:45:24,522 --> 02:45:27,725
[SPEAKER_08]: That is... I'm going to put the phone down and no more Twitter topics for tonight.

2344
02:45:27,745 --> 02:45:30,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR, though, if you want to send us stuff for the future.

2345
02:45:31,207 --> 02:45:33,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get off my feminist pedestal for right now.

2346
02:45:33,329 --> 02:45:34,329
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong with it.

2347
02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:37,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a discussion that needed to be had.

2348
02:45:38,252 --> 02:45:39,073
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2349
02:45:39,773 --> 02:45:40,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's wrap up, though.

2350
02:45:40,574 --> 02:45:41,194
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about done.

2351
02:45:41,555 --> 02:45:42,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We're closing up shop for the night.

2352
02:45:43,116 --> 02:45:45,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you've been quiet over there while DarkSakura and I have been yapping.

2353
02:45:47,679 --> 02:45:48,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2354
02:46:05,572 --> 02:46:07,915
[SPEAKER_08]: We should set up some time to livestream Minecraft.

2355
02:46:07,935 --> 02:46:09,016
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where everything's going.

2356
02:46:09,196 --> 02:46:11,479
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden, all the VOG people have just gotten really into it.

2357
02:46:11,519 --> 02:46:13,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby's doing it, Jamie's doing it, I'm doing it.

2358
02:46:13,601 --> 02:46:14,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see, that's the thing.

2359
02:46:14,482 --> 02:46:19,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know when to be on when no one else is on.

2360
02:46:20,028 --> 02:46:25,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's inevitable that some of us are... I think I was trying to broadcast when Jamie was on.

2361
02:46:25,394 --> 02:46:26,174
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I didn't know she was...

2362
02:46:26,875 --> 02:46:34,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's inevitable some of us are going to step on toes, but I think as a general rule of thumb, we just try not to be live when a live, when, excuse me, a premiere VOG show is on.

2363
02:46:35,102 --> 02:46:36,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, Monday nights are usually really bad.

2364
02:46:37,163 --> 02:46:40,246
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, as long as we're not stepping on the toes of... Do you do commentary?

2365
02:46:40,306 --> 02:46:41,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you do not?

2366
02:46:41,387 --> 02:46:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you not do commentary?

2367
02:46:42,648 --> 02:46:43,749
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you guys doing?

2368
02:46:43,809 --> 02:46:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like...

2369
02:46:44,429 --> 02:46:45,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I do commentary.

2370
02:46:45,489 --> 02:46:46,470
[SPEAKER_08]: She does commentary.

2371
02:46:47,530 --> 02:46:51,011
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was watching Bobby, he had very little commentary, but they have had some.

2372
02:46:51,031 --> 02:46:56,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I do commentary, but the problem is, though, is once again, it's the whole talking in the same room with my wife.

2373
02:46:56,352 --> 02:46:57,632
[SPEAKER_06]: She gets annoyed.

2374
02:46:58,452 --> 02:47:01,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I'm in the back bedroom or something like that, I could try it.

2375
02:47:01,993 --> 02:47:02,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it'd be fine.

2376
02:47:03,874 --> 02:47:05,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'll hopefully start doing some of that.

2377
02:47:06,074 --> 02:47:07,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be selling more games this week.

2378
02:47:08,135 --> 02:47:09,915
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those being Injustice on 360.

2379
02:47:09,955 --> 02:47:10,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2380
02:47:10,095 --> 02:47:10,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it.

2381
02:47:13,716 --> 02:47:15,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, all my friends have it on PS3.

2382
02:47:15,478 --> 02:47:15,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of a bitch.

2383
02:47:16,218 --> 02:47:19,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I got a copy for free and I don't want it.

2384
02:47:20,582 --> 02:47:23,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm not in the fighting game.

2385
02:47:23,924 --> 02:47:25,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll start at one penny tomorrow.

2386
02:47:26,546 --> 02:47:28,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says, we were doing commentary yesterday.

2387
02:47:28,608 --> 02:47:30,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed your stream yesterday because I was out drinking.

2388
02:47:30,830 --> 02:47:32,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Grandpa was in town from San Francisco.

2389
02:47:33,292 --> 02:47:34,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy me doubles.

2390
02:47:34,973 --> 02:47:37,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a little more drunk last night than I did on the 500th episode.

2391
02:47:38,656 --> 02:47:40,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry it wasn't broadcast, but it's for the best.

2392
02:47:42,059 --> 02:47:48,464
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought tonight is thank you all for continuing to listen to Orange Lounge Radio and showing up for an episode like 501 right after 500.

2393
02:47:49,925 --> 02:47:52,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it be live, whether it be podcast, I appreciate your support.

2394
02:47:53,088 --> 02:47:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I forgot to say this last week, which was really stupid.

2395
02:47:56,650 --> 02:47:59,833
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to say, as always, thank you for checking out the show.

2396
02:48:00,253 --> 02:48:03,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like what you hear, remember, we don't ask for a lot.

2397
02:48:03,436 --> 02:48:04,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Just tell a friend or two about the show.

2398
02:48:05,297 --> 02:48:07,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2399
02:48:07,299 --> 02:48:09,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell a person who stopped listening five years ago.

2400
02:48:09,881 --> 02:48:12,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, did you know those schmoes are still on broadcasting?

2401
02:48:13,142 --> 02:48:14,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Help bring people back into the fold.

2402
02:48:15,003 --> 02:48:16,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Help grow our family a little bit.

2403
02:48:16,523 --> 02:48:17,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord.

2404
02:48:17,524 --> 02:48:20,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought.

2405
02:48:23,105 --> 02:48:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Down with the patriarchy.

2406
02:48:24,346 --> 02:48:24,726
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

2407
02:48:26,007 --> 02:48:28,529
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that does it for this week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2408
02:48:28,929 --> 02:48:32,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week on the show, I'm hoping we'll have some special guests here in studio.

2409
02:48:32,712 --> 02:48:33,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like that's going to happen.

2410
02:48:33,673 --> 02:48:34,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Very exciting.

2411
02:48:35,014 --> 02:48:36,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be a long show next week.

2412
02:48:36,596 --> 02:48:42,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And pretty cool interview with two people I really enjoy next week.

2413
02:48:42,861 --> 02:48:45,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So come here live.

2414
02:48:45,443 --> 02:48:46,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Be here live to ask questions.

2415
02:48:47,144 --> 02:48:49,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

2416
02:48:49,286 --> 02:48:51,408
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio for episode 502.

2417
02:48:53,231 --> 02:48:56,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2418
02:48:56,894 --> 02:49:01,116
