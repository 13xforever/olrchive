13987	24458	Tonight, April 7th, 2013, one landmark game studio is shut down, Donkey Kong Country Returns will get a little easier, and one series of tweets rocks the gaming world.
31857	37598	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37678	45820	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 499, April the 7th, 2013.
46320	53162	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games and gaming news and gaming lols and so forth with my co-host.
53182	55222	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55422	56723	Greetings and salivations.
56823	57423	How you doing?
58043	58483	I'm full.
58823	59344	You're full?
59584	60645	I'm full!
60885	61766	What's that commercial?
62127	64129	Full of useless knowledge and gas.
64709	65070	No!
66091	68413	Rob, again, you're confusing me for your car.
69795	71116	My car has useless knowledge?
71356	72477	No, your car's full of gas.
72898	74139	Not right now, it ain't.
75100	75761	Well, with prices.
75881	81347	Anyway, I did my customary stop by Panda, and I have eaten a panda.
82387	83528	Well, you shouldn't eat pandas.
83568	86249	They're a species going extinct.
86850	93673	Because when you think of panda bears, orange chicken is so representative of Chinese culture.
93853	94494	Seriously.
94854	98736	If I go to China and order orange chicken, I wonder what kind of stares I'm going to get.
100757	102138	I've seen real Chinese food.
103519	105160	I don't think orange chicken is among real Chinese food.
105180	109364	I told you the story about my ex and my ex's family when it got really awkward one night, right?
109644	110705	Okay, wait, I'll tell this in a minute.
110765	111545	Okay, tell it in a minute.
111665	113207	First off, Tech Master Loki.
113487	113747	Hi.
113947	114948	Hi, how are you doing, Loki?
115028	115668	I'm doing fine.
115768	117450	Alright, you ready to hear awkward stories about my ex?
117690	118330	Alright, let's go.
118350	118951	Alright, here we go.
119011	120232	So my ex was Chinese, right?
120632	122074	Is this the ex I'm thinking of?
137651	138271	That area, right?
138732	141473	So the deal was we were going to go to Chinese food for dinner.
141693	142814	And they're all very out there.
142834	144395	They're all from Hong Kong, born and raised.
144415	145935	I think he moved here when he was 10 and so forth.
146296	149517	So we went and they had already ordered by the time we got there.
149537	150938	I guess we got there a little late or something.
151458	153379	And on the table is all this food.
153399	155320	And a lot of it is very seafood.
155360	157962	And it's a lot of dishes I haven't really had before.
158062	161724	And there's a fish on the plate with all the meat picked off and the bones.
161804	163465	But I'm like, all right, I'm going to...
164065	164966	I'm going to be cultured.
165066	166306	I'm going to just have a little bit.
166587	168388	So I'm putting just like a little bit of everything.
168408	170629	I just pick a little bit of everything and put it on my plate.
170909	172310	Not because I think it's gross.
172330	175252	I just want to try it, make sure I like it before I put a whole scoop.
175772	179935	And so his sister looks over at me and kind of has this epiphany.
179955	181416	You see this moment of like, oh no.
181736	184417	And looks at me and goes, oh, I'm so sorry.
184477	186759	Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
188300	190041	And I'm like, that's racist.
192662	193583	In a weird way.
194284	196195	Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
197329	199290	Well, she's trying to be considerate, I suppose.
199310	204514	I know, but it's like, I'm trying to just sample, and we didn't order anything.
204614	208136	I ate, there was something there that I really liked, and I had a whole heaping of it.
208156	208937	Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.
209437	213100	See, I have no... If it's good enough for my ex, it was good enough for me, okay?
213120	227249	Well, when I was little in Alabama, I would go over to my friend Dom Noy's house, and her family's from Laos, and I have actually easier time eating Laotian food than actual real Chinese food, because I really can't recognize much of anything I'm eating.
228890	229790	I'm all for it.
229850	230490	I love food.
230590	233491	Food is a great gateway to different cultures around the world.
233832	238233	I will say, though, probably the only culture's food I'm never having again is Filipino.
238393	238733	Sorry.
239194	239794	Sorry, guys.
240694	242635	But Rob, I thought balut was your favorite.
242695	242955	Nope.
244095	244376	Nope.
244516	246496	And some of those dishes, nope.
246756	247657	Balut, Rob.
248717	250958	Sorry, but if you like it, more power to you.
250998	252459	Have you ever heard of virgin boy eggs?
254769	269504	have virgin boy eggs no they are eggs that have been marinated in the pee of young children so how about we move on let's talk about video games shall we
270976	272057	Yeah, that was pretty much it.
272077	273117	Just kind of hung around.
273437	273557	Yeah?
273577	273657	Yeah.
300570	302191	Do you eat a lot of Easter candy?
302631	304992	I was at Target the other day and it's all on sale, half off.
305232	305872	No, not really.
305892	307032	I didn't eat any.
307273	310234	We got one of those hollow rabbits and I haven't touched it.
311754	312334	Just don't care.
312594	317216	I heard there was some candy company suing another over those hollow rabbits or something.
317236	318917	I'm probably grossly simplifying it.
319617	322580	But anyway, we should probably get to gaming news.
322600	323761	That's what you all signed up for.
323801	329086	But I do want to say hello and how you doing to everybody in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
329486	337234	The other ever-present fourth guest on our show because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
337794	342018	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
342699	344561	And some comments in our chat room there.
345321	347242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
360426	366568	AlanAlchemy in chat says, I imagine Nelly isn't really that about the pure sugar toddler crash and meltdown.
366648	368529	I'm sure she's fine without that in her life.
368769	370509	He had a lot of sugar yesterday.
370529	373630	We went over to her parents' house because they had a family over.
374230	375531	A lot of people haven't seen him yet.
376751	379572	He had some cake and stuff, and there's a lot of sugar in that.
381032	382933	He was jumping off the walls yesterday.
383113	384493	So he's going to be four?
385594	385814	Three?
385834	385914	Yeah.
386334	386575	Three.
386795	387016	Three?
387216	387517	Wow.
388479	389882	Have the terrible twos been that terrible?
390503	396516	He's been pretty... Yeah, it's not necessarily terrible, but it's just they start testing their limits.
397786	404210	Tiger Claw in chat saying, holy crap, episode 499, the pressure is really high to make episode 500 the most memorable.
404710	405951	Don't set the bar too high, you guys.
406051	407772	It's going to be all about DDR.
408352	409693	Don't put it too high.
410173	410774	There's a bar.
411294	412175	There comes a point.
412635	414096	You mean the bar we limbo under?
414236	417378	I'm going to let y'all in on a podcasting secret, all right?
417518	422701	So this goes out to all the other podcasters out there and everybody that wants to know what it's like to do a podcast.
423101	428663	All right, so you celebrate one year, you celebrate 100 episodes, you celebrate two years, you celebrate three years, 200, 300.
429823	432624	You know, there comes a point where you're just sick of celebrating.
432644	433484	It's like birthdays.
433684	436645	Like after your 21st birthday, you're like, what do I have left to celebrate?
436665	438125	The fact that my car insurance went down?
438145	440086	Do you realize I take an entire week off for my birthday?
441920	457882	Maybe you're not the best example I am not the best example However, I have gotten the confirmation from my BFF That we will be having red velvet brownies God, Becky, I love you I am buying the red food coloring because she will not
458963	459504	Why not?
460044	461845	Because it's like, I don't know.
461865	463386	Is it that whole it's not safe thing?
463506	465948	I have no idea, but she never has a reason for it.
465968	468550	But I found out that the recipe calls for two whole ounces.
468670	471011	Well, I appreciate anyone willing to put their morals aside.
471031	473913	I was going to the baking store to buy like a gallon jug.
474073	476155	That's why you need to use virgin blood.
477816	480458	It's just virgin boy eggs.
481178	483700	Did I tell you the story about my friend Diane making a red velvet cake?
483880	485121	No, but here we go with food again.
485141	486481	We will get to games at some point, right?
486661	488002	We will get to games.
488022	488322	Alright.
488342	501208	Okay, so she was living in northern Alabama at the time and making a red velvet cake and the Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door and she had just gotten done cutting the cake with a butcher knife while listening to tubular bells so she opened the door with a WHAT?!
503369	506590	This is the same person, by the way, who joined our WoW guild.
507090	507811	Oh, fantastic.
508091	508331	Gwen.
508711	509511	Yeah, I love Gwen.
509531	509972	She was nice.
510812	513113	Yeah, she told you all the embarrassing stories about me in college, too.
514133	520215	So that is always, whenever I think of Red Velvet, I always think of the expression on her face when she told that story.
520255	520855	It was priceless.
521175	528398	All right, here's a good transition comment in our chat room from CriticalMyth, live.vognetwork.com, saying, This is foreshadowing, isn't it?
528518	532759	After 500, it's all about food and the video games they play while eating that food.
533379	534359	That's what it's been about.
534860	535440	Where have you been?
536607	542150	And I wish to remind everyone, and I've told this story a billion times on the show, but how was OLR born?
542470	546472	Because Jamie, Matt, and I all used to play DDR all night, and then what did we do?
546873	554717	We went right over to the cafe in the parking lot and shoved our faces full of, what, tortilla soup and mozzarella sticks.
554777	557959	And Matt with his glass of, not this one, you remember Tall Matt?
558079	558299	Yeah.
558479	559499	With his glass of Merlot.
559659	560340	Yes, Tall Matt.
560360	561220	With his glass of Merlot.
561380	562501	I like a glass of Merlot.
562581	563782	Is it Merlot?
563942	564722	Is it Merlot?
564802	565322	Is it Merlot?
566383	567383	Like suddenly he's French.
568264	568904	Alright, anyhow.
569224	570585	Or how Dan goes, Merlet.
571845	576707	TigerClaw on chat says, for episode 500, are you guys taking voicemails with messages for congratulating you guys?
577027	579028	That's really sweet, but no.
579668	580769	Well, we have something else planned.
581129	581909	I'll talk about that later.
581949	582950	But my ego, Rob.
583790	583970	What?
584030	584350	You know what?
584370	585931	You can send a message congratulating Jamie.
585951	588912	Yeah, send me a message and send me money with it.
589451	589811	Alright.
590532	592933	Again, I'm just saying, after so many episodes, you have to mix it up a little bit.
593493	593753	Alright.
595074	596614	Let's get into gaming.
596654	598815	Yes, it is a show about video games, believe it or not.
598835	599596	I play more games, Rob.
599856	600336	You play more games?
600356	603958	Well, we'll get into Gaming Week, but we have to do the pre-Gaming Week banter.
604038	604438	Okay, okay.
605118	632729	and since we were off last week this week's pre-week or pre-gaming week banter will consist of last week's news set to holic it's a new segment last week yes it's a new segment we're debuting on OLR tonight it's called last week's news set to holic and in this segment we will recap last week's news set to holic so here we go last week's news
635498	641060	Last week in gaming news, the Phantom Pain was revealed to be Metal Gear Solid V. What?
641140	642801	To no one's surprise.
643301	651645	David Hayter apparently wasn't asked to be a Metal Gear Solid V, but it's very interesting because he signed his letter about why he's not in it April 1st.
652555	654556	Hmm, so to be continued on that.
654756	661298	And I really thought it was strange that they went with Bobcat Goldwage, you know, to do the voice, but hey, I trust them.
661318	661819	Why did you hear Bobcat?
661839	662939	I thought they got Gilbert Gottfried.
664520	669922	On the Sony PlayStation 4 Game Developers Conference, more information about friends, system sharing, and the unit or interface.
670942	677745	Nothing too earth-shattering, I thought, except the whole, you have your PlayStation name and your real name, but the real name comes off of Facebook.
677945	678205	Ha ha.
678825	681248	Oh, is that like YouTube where they're trying to get me to use my real name?
681308	681848	I'm like, no.
681868	683550	And they're like, let's tell you more about this.
684190	684611	Oh, I'm sorry.
684631	685992	There's no option not to do that.
686252	690175	Miyamoto teased that a Nintendo theme park could be a possibility.
690756	692377	But, you know, a lot of things could be a possibility.
692397	693839	Will it be called Nintendo Land?
694579	697182	Capcom wants to work with WayForward again.
697967	701308	but probably that'll only happen if DuckTales actually sells a lot of copies.
701328	706710	Speaking of DuckTales Remastered, it was announced that DuckTales Remastered is in consideration for the PC.
706850	707691	Yay!
707711	715294	And lastly, on Kickstarter, Big Blue from the Echo the Dolphin team trying a Kickstarter there for something new.
716714	717715	There it is, last week's news.
717735	720336	That Kickstarter is a little too tree-hugger for me, though.
722714	751677	we need to worry about the planet and all this stuff and we just we're not necessarily making a game now listen if I wanted a game that was like Echo the Dolphin but not Echo the Dolphin I would here's the next evolution in the game and it's already been made this is the best part about it it's called Laser Dolphin yes Laser Dolphin does exist and it's Echo the Dolphin with a giant fucking laser in your head and that's seriously what it is and they have turtles with goddamn dynamite stuck to them and stuff it's Laser Dolphin that sounds like my kind of game Laser Dolphin
752216	753357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
779562	786873	But I'm going to start with Mass Effect because I played Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I've been busy modding.
787074	791420	I'm actually also using Mass Effect 3 for art references.
791661	794465	I don't know if you saw the crap I've been posting.
796569	804981	I played, I finally, finally bought the game that we talked about on our British Friends podcast that we guested on last week.
806243	808205	I downloaded Drunken Robot Pornography.
808546	810809	It is the greatest game in the universe.
810989	812612	It seriously, it's like, okay, you know...
812972	814413	There's a quote for the back of the box.
815994	818877	Okay, you know my overwhelming love for jumping flash?
819837	821519	It's like jumping flash with guns.
822319	828244	Not, you know, shooting carrots at things, but like actual pew-pew die lasers.
828484	836390	And what you have to do is you get these, like, ginormous big robots, but you have to get a number of points before the robot will appear.
836410	837191	They're called titans.
837871	858038	and they have these long appendages and they shoot lasers everywhere and other shit tries to kill you and it's really fucking hard so I finally beat the second stage after a week of trying and I did it while live streaming so I didn't totally embarrass myself okay I was like okay I quit I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm not playing the game I'm not gonna do it live again until I'm sure I can beat the third level
858798	877065	and then um I uh I got something else oh I finally went ahead and downloaded Gratuitous Space Battles but I haven't played it yet I just like the name and uh I'm thinking I'm still thinking about getting Hotline Miami just because all the blood and shooting shit that's really fun good times I played WoW
877905	878326	Oh, that's right.
878366	879366	I saw you log in the other night.
879426	880507	I was like, well, I'm paying for it.
880567	881268	May as well play it.
881328	881788	That's right.
882288	883569	I'm still debating quitting it.
883669	891254	I might wait for another MMO that I am not supposed to let any indication out that I've actually seen it in motion.
891955	898840	So I'm waiting for that to come out before I reserve my judgment and see if I actually jump off the WoW bandwagon.
899520	900701	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
922558	931043	You know what I found though when I was, okay, I got a whole, we went to Dan's mom's house where most of the vault is in storage and I was tearing things up looking for my light box which I could not find.
931443	938987	I found a bag full of my art supplies but when I opened it to go through it when I got home, I found a demo disc for a Magic the Gathering card game.
939747	940808	Oh, the old school one on PC?
940828	944050	The old school one, the demos that we got at E3 that first year.
944170	946391	That game was, oh no, that's not as old school.
946411	948472	There was one I bought at Software Etc.
948532	949072	back in like 97 or 98.
949113	949653	That game was bomb.
952503	956146	It came with the giant card from the Astral Deck or whatever.
956646	957867	And you know what else I found in there?
957967	960650	Actually, speaking of magic, I found my Japanese Legends.
963292	966514	The only set of my magic cards that I never sold off.
966714	968176	DarkSakura, you might be a nerd.
968416	972479	Just saying.
972659	974000	So that was really it.
974981	976122	Then let's go to Loki.
976182	977063	Loki, how was your gaming week?
978049	978529	Dingo Games
993556	996718	Yes, free download or you can buy it for $20.
996838	998519	But please don't buy it for $20.
999479	1000920	That's really a waste of $20.
1002801	1003402	So let's see.
1003462	1006904	This week I didn't play any Bioshock Infinite because I was playing other things.
1007144	1014148	I did end up playing quite a bit of Saints Row the Third, just trying to kind of 100% everything on the PC.
1014388	1021012	Although I don't know why because it's like I sort of did that or I almost did that on the 360, but then I got...
1021912	1022972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1041918	1045559	The last mission is kind of cool, but it's just so quick.
1046080	1050861	The first mission, you're searching for this clone of Johnny Gat, who's actually this brute.
1051142	1053702	And then it just goes by so fast.
1053763	1056103	It's basically one of those, oh, someone's driving the car.
1056183	1057304	You have to fire the rockets out of the back.
1057504	1058064	Okay, cool.
1058104	1060605	I've done that in a bunch of other missions already.
1061025	1067728	Then the second mission, you have a cross-dressing guy who's singing some Aisha songs.
1067808	1070589	And then you have to fire this B-gun at people.
1071189	1076311	Which is cool, I like the B-Gun, but that's the only mission you get it in.
1076351	1079052	You don't unlock it for playing the rest of the game.
1079332	1083794	That's the only thing you get that weapon in, and it's stupid.
1083814	1086475	And then the last mission is kind of cool, where you have the superhero powers.
1086495	1088155	It's kind of almost like a preview of 4.
1088195	1092797	Aren't there a lot of video games where there might be a special stage, and you're like, why can't the whole game just be this?
1093925	1094706	Saints Row The Four
1112581	1118343	Saints Row 4 I think we should call it Saints Row the 4th why not?
1118403	1134147	Saints Row 4 and I'm just so cautious about it because they're like oh yeah we have this big DLC plan well all your DLC has sucked it's really sucked like $7 for 30 minutes of gameplay is really crappy I mean that is just absolutely terrible
1134887	1136509	That's actually worse than movies.
1136850	1141856	I mean, you can't go to a theater and watch a movie for seven bucks anymore.
1142076	1142817	Maybe a matinee.
1142837	1145301	I was going to say matinees are $5.50.
1145681	1147624	But I don't really count that, though, because you have to buy popcorn.
1148425	1149025	Popcorn counts.
1149045	1149847	You have to have popcorn.
1150087	1151228	You can't watch a movie without popcorn.
1152189	1177731	Um, okay, anyway, so, I've been playing some of that, and, you know, here's the other thing, I got really frustrated with one of the missions, because I couldn't, um, the lag or whatever from, like, rain and stuff was causing, my rockets weren't firing fast enough, so, thankfully, since I'm playing on the PC version, I can mod the weapons one there, up to my liking, so I made my rocket launcher fire a lot faster, and lock on a lot faster, so, it's now acceptable for my use.
1178812	1180414	Um, let's see what else.
1180775	1186904	And then I played a little bit of, um, very little bit of Defiance.
1187525	1194495	I spent most of the time doing the typical MMO launch stuff, whereas installing the game and then...
1194915	1212596	Updating the game and then I connected to the servers and played for about 30 minutes going through the tutorial portion of the game which is fucking boring and the game itself is not very exciting right now either but I mean I am in the tutorial section of the game so I don't expect it to be that exciting but like I
1213517	1216038	I noticed the enemies respawning almost instantly.
1216178	1218419	I shoot a guy and pops up another one.
1218439	1219760	I'm like, okay, that's a little weird.
1220260	1221660	But sure, okay, we'll go.
1221680	1226002	That happens in a lot of MMOs when they're first out, though, and the newbie areas are really camped.
1226743	1228063	It's strange.
1229164	1239308	The thing I do like about it, though, is it's not necessarily a game that's just all stat-based, like Final Fantasy or I'm sure WoW to a certain extent.
1240428	1250234	You actually, it will help you if you have first person shooter skills because you're actually aiming your weapon and firing and doing all the dodging and stuff like that.
1250314	1253836	So it's like a third person shooter but you have an MMO.
1255376	1268884	However, because it is just launched and like anything that's online and especially with MMOs, the servers were a little spotty and so I got kicked off the server about 30 minutes in and then I couldn't connect to it again.
1269224	1270144	I haven't really tried.
1270224	1275346	I was going to play this weekend, but I forgot my hard drive that I installed the game to at my work.
1276107	1279488	And so I was unable to play it last night and today.
1280749	1283009	But I'm hopefully going to get into it a little bit more this week.
1283670	1288812	And then I picked up Borderlands 2 on PC because it was $25 for the Borderlands 2 and the Season Pass.
1289212	1294814	And so I'm probably going to start that again on PC, even though I've beaten it twice on the 360.
1294854	1297215	They've upped the level cap, didn't they?
1298035	1301136	Yeah, but it just makes everything... It doesn't really do anything.
1301196	1302596	It just makes the enemies harder.
1303096	1303816	Like, have more life.
1304196	1309057	Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, is Defiance a buy-once game or a monthly sub?
1309177	1309637	Buy-once.
1310317	1310577	Nice.
1310837	1315278	Yeah, so it's buy-once, and then you can play it for whatever.
1315298	1321639	The other thing, too, is, I mean, if you're into... If you want to kind of help yourself out in the game, there's these shift... Not shift codes.
1321659	1322740	There are these...
1324600	1332762	I did that like a few weeks ago and so that helped me out quite a bit although I haven't gotten any of that stuff yet but it's gonna help me out so whenever I get to that
1352352	1373125	but the game they say it's sort of like um sort of like Borderlands I guess you know because the way it plays and it's sure a ripoff I mean at the beginning it seemed like such a ripoff of Borderlands like you start off and you're this arc hunter instead of a vault hunter and you know um there's this
1373505	1378808	AI person that only you can see that's helping you out.
1379328	1380388	Your imaginary friend.
1380788	1383750	Come on, this is totally Halo and fucking Borderlands.
1383770	1385931	They just completely ripped the plots out of there.
1386351	1390533	And the other thing, and I don't know if this ties into those whole microtransactions for things.
1391313	1397600	The characters that you can create, their character creator or whatever, where you can tweak the appearance and everything, sucks.
1397940	1400583	It looks all like this really ugly, old-ass person.
1400983	1408691	And I'm thinking that you can buy better facial features or something like that later on.
1409071	1410212	Buy a better face.
1410352	1411293	Hey, just like real life.
1411653	1416777	No, seriously, because it's like I couldn't get anything that looked interesting.
1416857	1420159	It just all looked like this grisly dude.
1420399	1423161	I mean, it's like, okay, here's the three different face types.
1423562	1425463	And it's like, okay, those are all crap.
1425623	1428165	It's like different layers of, you know, crap.
1428966	1433389	So, whatever, you know, I'm actually looking at the dude's face, you know, while I'm playing the game anyways.
1433409	1434330	Okay.
1435550	1435971	But I don't know.
1435991	1437752	It'd be something I'm interested in.
1437852	1441954	I'm just hoping more people I know are actually playing it because right now it kind of sucks just playing the game by yourself.
1442415	1443355	Extra First Partner's playing it.
1443375	1444696	That's the only other person I know that's playing it.
1444816	1445136	Yeah.
1446677	1447418	He seems to like it, though.
1447438	1449779	Yeah, I'm just willing to check it out.
1449919	1454362	I mean, hopefully it'll drop in price and then people will be able to pick it up because we're going to have $60 on PC.
1454422	1455103	It's kind of expensive.
1455123	1457104	Well, a game can be a shameless ripoff and still be fun.
1457728	1458068	That's true.
1459450	1464334	I didn't have high standards for it anyways, or a high bar set for it, because it's based off a sci-fi show.
1464374	1465055	I mean, come on.
1465115	1465796	It's sci-fi.
1466736	1469179	No one's expecting gold from sci-fi.
1469639	1471421	You know what sci-fi shows are like.
1472442	1476045	I wish it was as awesome as the sci-fi movies they do, like Sharktopus and stuff.
1476065	1477166	That would be kind of cool.
1477226	1477667	By the way.
1477767	1480129	Who doesn't want to play an MMO like Sharktopus?
1480469	1481810	Or just like a weird monster thing.
1481830	1482311	I said yes!
1483632	1484253	Thanks for watching!
1499815	1500115	Yes!
1500695	1501575	That one rules!
1501675	1504056	It was six bucks at Dimple and I came really close to getting it for you.
1504136	1516358	And I gotta say that the woman alien that they have in this show, and I understand that she's not supposed to be like this sex symbol or whatever in this thing.
1516558	1518098	She is fucking ugly.
1518358	1522119	I mean, she is the ugliest weirdest looking alien thing ever.
1522159	1524879	It's like this dreadlocked man-woman thing.
1524999	1526259	I don't even know what it is.
1526339	1527200	It's just weird.
1527520	1529240	She probably thinks humans look weird too.
1529600	1535523	It's just like, I couldn't possibly watch this show and have to stare at this thing.
1536143	1540245	I always love an excuse to play a clip from Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
1541445	1544426	Holy shit!
1547067	1550169	Okay, I have to get this movie.
1550469	1550889	Okay, Rob.
1551169	1552550	The shark eats the plane!
1552650	1554310	Rob, we need to get that movie.
1556417	1558121	And I have Battle Royale on Blu-ray now.
1560005	1563232	We need to do the really stupid violent movie...
1563973	1564513	Birdemic 2.
1565154	1566775	They're making a sequel to Birdemic.
1566795	1567556	I don't know if you know Birdemic.
1567576	1568817	Birdemic, shock and awe.
1569398	1575343	It was this movie where this guy thought it was actually really good and their CG birds are like clip art birds.
1575503	1577845	Like GIF birds that fucking flip.
1578165	1584350	And the guy literally thinks that his movie is so fucking fantastic and he wanted a sequel and he did the birds exactly the same way.
1584511	1585251	They're just shit.
1585351	1586572	It's absolute shit.
1586612	1588494	That's what the station needs, you know?
1588914	1590616	We need a shitty movie podcast.
1592169	1593070	It's funny, you should bring that up.
1595952	1598174	I was going to do a joke and it's gone.
1598274	1599835	Alright, let's move on.
1599855	1601256	Do you have anything else for your gaming week?
1602357	1602817	No, that's it.
1603878	1605219	My son played Angry Birds.
1606300	1607781	It's a slippery slope.
1607901	1608762	Is it his first game?
1609222	1610723	Yeah, he sort of figured.
1610783	1612224	I mean, he had it a little bit.
1612264	1616147	I had a video of him trying it out because his cousins were there.
1616507	1620029	And so they were showing them on their iPads.
1620610	1622671	And he started doing it okay.
1622811	1624212	And then he started launching them backwards.
1624252	1626173	So I don't really know if he gets the game yet.
1626294	1628735	But it's a slippery slope, man.
1629616	1631657	Those kids are so fucking into Angry Birds.
1631777	1633658	Man, that is just some scary cultist shit.
1633678	1634559	Julian plays it too.
1634779	1637021	And then it takes over their lives.
1637301	1638702	He also has gotten pretty good at Pac-Man.
1639262	1639603	Oh, cool.
1639623	1640984	Like Championship Edition or Old School?
1641204	1647129	Like whatever the Flash version on that education site that he goes on is, but it's like a, it's Pac-Man.
1647770	1648911	And which Angry Birds you say?
1649031	1653474	Well, he started off playing Angry Birds Seasons, but then he tried Angry Birds Star Wars.
1653534	1655156	They had all of them, so, you know.
1655176	1655997	Of course, of course.
1657038	1659400	Back in my day, you played Number Munchers and you liked it.
1661004	1661765	Josh and Apple 2E
1678280	1679561	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1701512	1717644	and some of the stages it kind of changes the mechanic a little bit where you have left right up and down in it too and it is just like Space Channel 5 which was kind of awesome so Harmonite is kind of like a little bit of a platformy music thing meets Space Channel 5 and that's pretty cool to me
1717924	1718925	and some of the 3D effects.
1718985	1719365	Pretty good.
1720426	1730414	It's made by the guys who make Pokemon, so that's kind of interesting that they have some stages that'll have the gym battle theme and some of that stuff, but that's kind of whatever.
1731115	1735158	I don't super care about that stuff, but I know there's some people that get really excited about it.
1735658	1736319	So, yeah.
1737396	1740457	I like Harmonite for $15, not bad, and I love music games.
1741377	1749779	Not a lot of multiplayer mechanics or anything like that, so it is very much a single-player game, but I think $15 is an appropriate price for it.
1751020	1753961	Another game I played is a free-to-play game on PlayStation 3.
1754461	1758302	Yeah, PlayStation 3 has a handful of free-to-download stuff and play.
1759402	1763023	DC Universe is one of them and that crappy Free Realms or whatever it's called.
1763283	1765085	Jetpack Joyride Temple Run vs. Techno Kitten Adventure
1783740	1785020	That's all you do, and you go up and down.
1785381	1798965	And you collect coins, you dodge these lasers and rockets and other things, and you use those coins to buy upgrades, which you get at a very slow pace, or you can spend real money and get them at a much faster pace.
1799025	1800965	It's like the Temple Run mechanic.
1801686	1806927	Well, yeah, it was on the iOS and Android already, so yeah, that's why.
1806987	1811129	The graphics, very 16-bit retro-inspired, but I gotta admit...
1812649	1816791	As much as that sounds like it all might be crap, the game is stupid addicting.
1817171	1819593	Like it is just so stupid addicting.
1819913	1824695	And it's addicting in that way that like classic video games are addicting.
1825055	1827997	Like, you know, think back to a game that was on the Atari 2600.
1828877	1833920	Usually it was just one gimmick, but you would sit there for hours trying to improve your score.
1834000	1836901	Think of a game like, I don't know, Stampede, right?
1836941	1839543	People would drop 40 bucks to get Stampede on the Atari 2600.
1840689	1850777	and all it is is the little horse runs and you lasso up the other horses or the, I'm sorry, the cows or you run into the cows to kind of make them go further out in the field and that's the game.
1850937	1867930	That's the whole game and yet you would sit there and play it more and more and more and try to increase your score and that, like, I don't know, like, I sat there and played Jetpack Joyride for like an hour at least earlier today just to try and top the leaderboard which I did do on my friends list.
1867950	1868491	Thank you very much.
1868571	1869111	Mm-hmm.
1870052	1873396	So, yeah, I gotta say, it's free.
1874177	1874597	Why not?
1874678	1875619	And it's got trophies.
1876319	1881325	So, hey, I can't really talk too bad about Jetpack Joyride.
1881605	1888433	I don't think I'd go spend a lot of money on it, but, you know, if somebody wanted to to get ahead, then more power to you.
1888493	1889014	It's your money.
1889074	1890015	Spend it on whatever you want.
1891156	1895059	Um, I thought there was one other game I wanted to talk about before I talk about a classic.
1895499	1899622	Oh, I guess I'll talk about this other free to play game because Alan always teases me about it.
1900482	1907307	And that's Guardian Cross, which is this, um, it's like a, it's, it's by Square Enix and it's a trading card game.
1907407	1920356	And I'm making little quote fingers when I say that trading card game, because it is not like magic and it is not like even like Hearthstone or whatever other types of trading card games you can think of because all the battles are automatic.
1920896	1950356	so it's all just about making your cards as powerful as possible but yet I can't stop hunting down the little animals and playing that game and turning them into cards and then combining the cards together and then the whole NPC story and it's Square Enix so all the artwork's really good and the music's good too and yeah so I've been suckered into that but like any it plays just like a freaking Facebook game and like any Facebook game I'll be really into it for like two weeks and then I'll be like what the fuck is this fuckery and then stop playing it.
1951642	1953052	That'll be the story of Guardian Cross.
1953757	1953878	So...
1955659	1960463	One other classic game I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy V, also on iOS now.
1961363	1963465	A total remake.
1963645	1976614	This is different because Final Fantasy I on iPad and II were based off the PSP version, III and IV off the DS version, but there has not been a Final Fantasy V remake save the Game Boy version, the Game Boy Advance version.
1976934	1982678	And that's the version that this is closest to is because it has the extra dungeon and all that, but they've totally redone the sprites and
1983078	1999739	and all that and it looks great like especially I have an iPad that has the retina display and it looks gorgeous the controls not bad they've changed it so that your characters move in eight directions but basically you put your thumb anywhere what is this eight directions that you speak of I know witchcraft
2000620	2002301	There's only up, down, left, and right.
2002501	2003122	I know, right?
2003822	2013088	But actually, it really helps the whole touch thing because you basically put your thumb anywhere on the screen and that's where the joystick is and then you move it and then we lift your thumb.
2013128	2015329	You don't have a joystick anymore until you put your thumbs down again.
2015689	2016450	So, you know, that's...
2017450	2018692	The controls actually work.
2018952	2022035	And they went back and redid the battles so that the whole battle is by touch.
2022415	2028061	My only bitch about that is that they should have made enough room for all the possible squares that can appear.
2028402	2035629	Because right now, let's say you have a mage that has, like, you know, an ability and then white magic and black magic.
2035649	2038512	Because, you know, in Final Fantasy V you can learn one job and then...
2038852	2040032	DarkSakura can't count everybody.
2040052	2040113	Hey.
2040133	2041593	No, I'm just going to all the wank.
2067402	2070923	I would bet that they're going to do Final Fantasy VI in a style like this for the holiday.
2071183	2072944	V is probably testing the waters a little bit.
2073164	2074184	It's a little more expensive.
2074224	2074744	It's $16.99.
2074864	2078585	It is iPad and iPhone universal.
2078625	2080726	It's a universal app, which some of their older games weren't.
2081086	2081986	So I'm happy about that.
2082406	2093569	But I love the battle system in V. I love the way that you can kind of mix and match the jobs because it really reminds me of when Final Fantasy went MMO in Final Fantasy XI.
2095285	2113836	which by the way had an expansion come out this last week and so of course Shane hits me up on the internet and says Rob you should come back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion I want to play a Geomancer and I want someone to play with Rob Rob you should come back you should come back and I'm like no I'm not coming back no no no finally we cut a deal I said all right
2114716	2130905	if I'm going to do something I don't really want to do and you're going to do something you really don't want to do I will come back to Final Fantasy XI for one month if you buy Civilization V next time it's on sale and he said deal and then he even went and played the demo for Civ V and he's like oh it's not that bad it is kind of like SimCity I'm like I told you
2131946	2158136	but anyway so my part of the deal was to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little while so I have been playing that with the I didn't buy the expansion though Shane has it and so I've been playing with him a little bit and I've looked at his Geomancer and Runefencer and I'm like alright cool new jobs but otherwise I've been leveling my Corsair and she's level 37 now it was double XP weekend this weekend and we were fighting mobs and dungeons duoing and leveling up
2158746	2160266	So, you know, that part's really fun.
2161087	2164147	The job system in Final Fantasy XI is insanely fun.
2164587	2166288	And a lot of the classes are really good.
2166348	2171969	And I love the fact that there's so many mix and match that is really viable in Final Fantasy XI.
2172029	2177231	Like, it used to have to be like, oh no, you don't play a Corsair without a Ranger sub.
2177371	2178451	You just, you don't do it.
2178811	2179391	You're an idiot.
2179511	2181852	If you don't do a Corsair with Ranger sub, that's how you have to do it.
2181872	2185413	But now it's like, okay, you can kind of actually do Corsair Dancer makes a lot of sense.
2185453	2186893	Corsair Black Mage, Corsair Red Mage.
2187573	2191377	There's a lot of different possibilities, and so that I really enjoy.
2193438	2204948	I still think the game is missing so many quality of life things that make other MMOs more enjoyable, such as World of Warcraft, which you all know I play a lot, or even other MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and things like that.
2205288	2211594	A lot of it has to do with travel, and the battle system is still kind of slow, especially when you're soloing and duoing.
2211895	2212435	No jokes.
2212475	2215058	It takes me two minutes to take out a mob by myself at level 37.
2215158	2225028	I know it doesn't sound like a long time, but it's slow when you have to kill six of them in order to get one bag of experience, basically.
2225088	2226629	Is being a white mage still hell on earth?
2227570	2228451	Um, no.
2228831	2232012	Because it's just the way people level at the earlier levels is so different now.
2232252	2238535	You're in a party with 18 people and it's just like, alright, as long as you're carrying somebody, people are fine.
2238575	2241316	There's like hardly any tanks in those parties.
2241336	2244338	Do they still have the text macro system?
2244698	2246419	Oh yeah, that's all.
2246599	2255463	That really got on my nerves after a while just because I'd have all my text macro set up before casting and no, we're not gonna come and get healed and buffed and blah blah.
2255483	2256043	So I'm like, fine, quit.
2256343	2263066	If you use a controller, it's actually really easy now to set up a macro that does cure and then you use up and down to select which party member you want to cast it on.
2263086	2266587	I think that's hilarious because back when I was playing it, I played on a controller.
2266607	2268207	You're like, no, you gotta play on a keyboard.
2268247	2269588	You can't do your macros without a keyboard.
2269768	2271929	I'm like, watch me flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, trigger finger.
2274380	2276323	I'm going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.
2278466	2283473	Cial in chat says, DarkSakura, a healer in any game is a pain, I would imagine.
2283573	2284755	Not necessarily for WoW.
2285055	2286237	It depends on your healing class.
2286417	2288440	In World of Warcraft, it can be super fun, actually.
2288806	2293890	I actually like healing paladins, but I really did not like playing a priest.
2294590	2298733	See, I love priest damage healing with atonement.
2299054	2302656	After they changed the Smackdown priest, you know, what was it, Disc Priest?
2302676	2302997	Shadow?
2303137	2303937	Oh, Disc, yeah, yeah.
2304177	2304778	I like Shadow.
2304838	2309561	Shadow was fun for leveling, but Disc Priest, they completely buffed him up for Panda.
2310938	2315840	Ragenator in chat says, I remember that being in Valkrym Dunes was hell on earth.
2316300	2317301	Well, that's gone.
2318621	2319641	People don't do that anymore.
2319901	2325924	You go to Gusken Mines and you level in a group with 18 people and what happens is everybody level sinks.
2325944	2327104	Sounds like a clusterfuck.
2327384	2329665	It kind of is, but it's... Well, we live stream some of it.
2329845	2334347	If you've been watching the Twitch TV Orange Lounge Radio, we live streamed some earlier this week so you can see this in action.
2335127	2364098	um but uh yeah we we played some of that and uh you basically level sync to someone who's around level 15 because everyone gets the xp it's just that everybody's abilities are set to level 15 and then they're just pulling skeletons over and over and it's called book burning because every zone now has a book that has five or six pages and a page will say like in Guskin Minds it says kill six members of the skeleton family do you want to repeat and you hit yes so you just kill skeletons over and over and over again and every time you kill six you
2365039	2367000	You got 600 XP.
2367040	2368181	You got 700 XP.
2369182	2372684	All the way up to, I think, 1,200 is the cap around there or something like that.
2373225	2374866	And then it's just you do that over and over again.
2374986	2376767	And before you know it, you're level 35.
2377828	2379690	And now you're going to Crawler's Nest to do the same thing.
2381471	2382151	It's crazy.
2383252	2385454	People leveled to 99 in like two weeks now.
2386587	2389108	That just takes out some of the fun, but then again... No.
2389228	2391689	But then again, you know me, the queen of impatience on Wellnet.
2392029	2393510	Well, no.
2394511	2395591	I'm still 87.
2395851	2399833	SSJ100Matt says, yeah, you guys were in the mines for two plus hours.
2400173	2406496	That's true, but in that time, we went from level 12 to level... I want to say I was 26 by the time we were out of there.
2406976	2413239	And compared to the... In Valkyrum Dunes parties, I was lucky to go from 12 to 14 in two hours.
2413739	2415220	Remember Valkyrum Dunes parties, Loki?
2415240	2415320	Yeah.
2415580	2416000	Remember that?
2416200	2416900	Yeah.
2417281	2421322	Is that that place that's like right outside the main starting area that you used to make me start in?
2421482	2422382	It was the... No.
2422422	2427044	The stupid desert that had the port, the docks out on the side?
2427404	2428344	Okay, I remember that.
2429744	2430165	You know me.
2430185	2431325	I don't know what places are called.
2431345	2432025	I just know landmarks.
2432065	2433066	That's not a thing anymore.
2433246	2433426	Yeah.
2433946	2434486	It's interesting.
2434846	2440628	No, Gusken Mines is the scary... You would go in there and you would hear this siren go off randomly that sounds like the siren from Silent Hill.
2441187	2442228	Oh no, I never went there.
2442248	2448551	I just went to this other place when one of my friends in New York was playing with me that had like a Bahamut running around.
2449751	2450692	Oh, like a summoner or something?
2450972	2455194	No, it was just like a big like uber creature that would follow around and we tried to take him out at 14.
2455234	2457675	No, that wasn't smart.
2457695	2458315	That wasn't going to happen.
2459356	2459616	All right.
2459636	2462117	Anyway, that's enough talk about a game that's like 11 years old.
2462257	2464078	So let's get into... Like us.
2464518	2465179	Ha ha ha.
2465999	2467381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2480836	2485500	and you should check that out because it's hosted by Syl from Girls Gone Wow.
2485640	2486241	I love Syl.
2486281	2491785	And Razorbug who's, you know, a part of that whole, you know, kind of, he does a lot of the Warcraft other stuff too.
2491945	2492085	Yes.
2492125	2492686	And he's great.
2493006	2494087	And we had a really good time.
2494167	2497790	So it's, I think, the only time all three of us guessed.
2497930	2498290	No.
2498871	2505416	If you go back to like some of the E3 specials back when it was the all games, all that stuff, I'm pretty sure we all guessed it on a couple shows doing that.
2505496	2505657	But
2506297	2508458	I forgot to write down the episode number.
2508478	2509919	Did anyone catch what episode number it is?
2509939	2510340	La la la la la
2527210	2530216	Look for the one that went up April 2nd, I think was the day it went up.
2530617	2533162	That was indeed because it was the day after.
2533362	2533823	No, it wasn't.
2534064	2534545	Was it April 2nd?
2534565	2535527	Yeah, it was the day after April Fool's.
2535547	2536308	We taped it on April Fool's.
2536930	2537130	Okay.
2538743	2551892	Alrighty, also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course next week is episode 500 And everybody keeps asking us, what are you going to do?
2551952	2566922	And the answer is, we're going to do a show Like we always do There you go Alright, let's talk about some video game news I'm going to be in a red velvet brownie coma That's true We're getting food made for us, that's a great reward And my friend Carly might come and bring German chocolate cake
2568553	2570655	You know, I need to be losing weight right now.
2571816	2572597	Alright, anyhow.
2574719	2581466	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, radio.
2581707	2586411	Let's go to some gaming news, because there were some pretty big things that happened this week, right, Loki?
2586652	2590596	Yes, LucasArts was closed by Disney, and their quote is...
2590976	2606918	After evaluating our position in the games market we decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.
2608219	2636828	um as a result or as a result of this change we had layoffs across the organization we're incredibly appreciative and proud of the talented teams who have been developing our new titles so basically instead of now you know making everything in-house they're going to license off their properties to other developers to make games for it so it's not like you're not going to see any more Star Wars games it's just you may see Star Wars games from EA although actually I guess we kind of already have seen that
2637989	2638769	or other companies.
2640050	2648656	And I would assume that also includes other properties like Maniac Mansion and all those adventure games that no one else makes except for, you know, Telltale Games.
2650598	2658863	And of course, as a result of that, Star Wars 1313 is on hold because obviously they're not developing in-house anymore.
2660224	2661846	Is it on hold or did they just cancel it?
2662046	2662706	It is halted.
2663186	2666669	So it's still going to come out, I think, just maybe a while.
2668112	2669273	All depends on who picks it up.
2671595	2675919	Well... Well... Who of us saw this happening?
2675939	2681424	Because, I mean, I was like, you know they're going to start closing things and making changes and... I don't know.
2681464	2683466	I didn't really necessarily think that they were going to do it.
2683486	2684627	I didn't think it would happen that fast.
2685248	2686709	I don't know, I had a feeling, but...
2709147	2711270	It sucks.
2711310	2719201	I don't like talking about things where people lose their jobs and so forth, but maybe the management was not picking the right games to greenlight.
2719342	2724109	Who is it that Disney usually goes for for their development, though, for all of their proprietary games?
2724784	2726445	Well, all over the map, really.
2726525	2727225	I mean, think about it.
2727385	2728546	Disney has their own studios.
2728846	2730967	I know, but I mean, I'm trying to think.
2730987	2734108	I thought they closed them.
2734128	2736629	They worked with Bethesda, too, for a while.
2736769	2750135	That's the interesting thing, is that this might not be as... Besides the job loss, which sucks, the other half of this might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is, because it's not like Disney doesn't license its stuff out pretty liberally.
2750836	2758666	uh even last week uh excuse me two weeks ago when we were last live on the show what game was everybody excited about two weeks ago what was everybody losing their shit over at PAX East
2760612	2762273	DuckTales, Freemastered
2785074	2809877	I just would hope that whoever they're going to choose for more of their publishing that they really go look at a company with a good reputation The depressing part of this though is that the games that those of us that are PC nerds really remember so fondly from the 90s such as Loom, Maniac Mansion, all the things that LucasArts did back in the day I don't know what can come of that
2810545	2821330	I'm completely, I think, in a kind of a sore spot over the whole thing just because I'm actually more worried about ILM, about what's going to happen with that.
2821350	2826312	Because I have, ever since I was a little kid, I have had, I guess, the big girl boner for ILM.
2826712	2827712	I wanted to work for them.
2828193	2829893	I wanted to grow up and work for ILM.
2829993	2831034	And, you know, that didn't happen.
2831114	2833895	But when we went to the Skywalker Ranch, you remember my friend Krista?
2834896	2836177	She used to work for LucasArts.
2836677	2838018	Worked on KOTOR.
2838959	2842362	And I got to go to Skywalker Ranch and bought my ILM shirt and everything.
2842442	2846125	And was in meatloaf flicking distance of George Lucas.
2846165	2851730	And if I had known then what I know now, I would have just kidnapped him and cloned him and made my own robot George.
2853391	2854052	No more prequels!
2854632	2859736	Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This crushes all the Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts 3 talk.
2861417	2883685	Not necessarily Not at all, actually No I think it's quite the opposite I think there's a greater chance of something like that happening now I went in Indiana Jones level in Kingdom Hearts Now it's just a matter of getting to a Kingdom Hearts 3 square I know, they can't count either That's the part you should be concerned about They're hanging out with Valve these days, I think 3, we don't know what 3 is, her
2888672	2891733	I've seen people on Facebook that are like, Boycott Disney!
2891833	2893154	This is bull!
2893174	2896716	I'm just kind of like, Dude, you guys are hanging on to memories from the 90s.
2898637	2900778	Believe me, as I get older, I understand that.
2901178	2907061	But if you look at what LucasArts has done in the past few years, from a business perspective...
2909099	2909839	We did see it coming.
2938485	2939805	Game Developers Conference for one.
2940126	2949969	There's a lot of that great stuff that goes on where I feel like there'll at least be opportunities and the game developers are looking out for each other because unfortunately it can be a very volatile industry.
2950369	2954670	So I really hope that it has a happy ending for those folks at least.
2957111	2957551	Was that it?
2957811	2959512	Did we talk about the Star Wars 1313 part?
2959792	2960312	Yes, you did.
2960932	2962813	Sorry, I missed it.
2963093	2964113	Do you think that will happen?
2964534	2965594	Yeah, I think it will happen still.
2967168	2967769	You know what, though?
2967809	2975975	I'm just... The other thing with the changes, too, is that since they're wiping out the book canon, I know a lot of people who are pissed off.
2976696	2980959	There is a lot of nerd rage going on over the book canon.
2981060	2983522	Well, wiping out the canon's a bit extreme.
2983542	2991228	I don't think you should disrespect the book universe and all this, but the talk of making one of those books Star Wars 7, that was never going to happen.
2991368	2992849	That was never going to happen.
2993470	2995191	Like, that is way too...
2996132	3019054	there's way too much like I tried getting into the Star Wars books and I maybe read like one of the first trilogies and after that I was like no I can't do this anymore because it's just completely gone you know you sit and read the Star Wars wiki where they go through all the stuff about the books I was like okay I'm done it's way out of hand but they've built up that much lore and just to sort of dismiss it
3019915	3021758	Look at what Abrams did with Star Trek.
3021798	3025242	A lot of people were pissed about what was going to happen there, but I think it turned out great.
3026023	3027925	But he did stay with established lore.
3027945	3029487	They set an alternate universe.
3029507	3030308	Yeah, exactly.
3030408	3033733	But did he feel the need to turn a book into a movie?
3034033	3034333	No.
3036276	3038438	And now his universe has spawned new books.
3039454	3040415	In the new universe.
3040775	3041035	Yeah.
3041936	3042256	Anyhow.
3044117	3044677	Let's move on.
3044737	3046018	Let's talk about Harmonix.
3046218	3048780	Kind of had a bit of a uh-oh this week.
3048860	3052262	And I even got an email about this because I'm registered on rockband.com.
3052302	3054043	But yeah, Harmonix sent out an email.
3054063	3057245	If you're registered on rockband.com or dancecenter.com, you probably got this.
3057805	3060867	Servers went down over the weekend because of a third-party attack.
3061487	3065049	Not saying who did this, but somebody was trying to get into the servers.
3065069	3065690	Yeah.
3066010	3074253	Passwords for all these websites have been reset as a precautionary measure, so you're going to have to change your password when you log into the site again.
3075113	3078594	Note that no user's information was published or misused that they found.
3079194	3085636	Harmonix doesn't keep credit card or social security, I mean they didn't have any of that, so your personal information is not really at risk.
3086097	3086717	However...
3087717	3097840	As is good practice, if you use the same password on Harmonix, like if you use the same email password on that site that you use somewhere else, you probably want to change it.
3097900	3100761	Like your bank, if your bank password matches your Harmonix password.
3100821	3104962	If you use your bank password on anything video game related, then stop doing that.
3107563	3115686	Honestly, people, if you're going to make any of your passwords unique, your bank password needs to be unique and your PayPal password needs to be unique.
3116147	3117807	Not the same as your bank password.
3117827	3118728	They need to be separate.
3119366	3138718	don't ever ever ever use and your email password that's the third one because I'm going to say don't ever ever ever use your email password anywhere else because 99% of the time that's what they want and while I'm at it while I'm on my tangent people be careful what you share on Facebook think about it
3139818	3142240	What are the security questions that are usually asked?
3142260	3143721	It's all those memes that are going around on Facebook right now.
3143741	3144642	It's all those memes on Facebook.
3145182	3147444	Post your drag queen name, like and share.
3147724	3148765	The street you were born on.
3148805	3150286	The street you were born on in your pet.
3150726	3151026	Yeah.
3151086	3151507	Hello.
3151787	3152828	Those are common questions.
3155269	3156850	No, it's one, two, three, four, five.
3157211	3158972	Yeah, so just be careful.
3161463	3162463	You know what my rule of thumb is?
3162503	3163724	Stop using Facebook.
3163764	3166485	That would be a great security precaution right there.
3166505	3166805	Stop using it.
3166825	3169746	I practically have, except my mom sort of guilted me into going back.
3170507	3172467	Oh, except use it to like Orange Zones Radio.
3172487	3173528	Yeah, use it to like Orange Zones Radio.
3173548	3175068	We're not going to steal your shit, I promise.
3175108	3175809	I super promise.
3176129	3179030	But, um... Crap, I completely forgot.
3179070	3179290	Oh, yeah.
3179590	3182631	My rule of thumb for password, numbers, and another language.
3184212	3184632	There you go.
3185332	3186573	Now you just told everybody your password.
3188013	3188734	They don't know a language.
3189154	3189254	Aww.
3190655	3206778	Uno Dos Tres, that's her password Ichi Ni Which is as much as Rob can count in Japanese No, I remember that song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi Wasn't that a DDR song or a Beatmania song or something?
3206798	3217720	I don't remember It was on a Dance Mania album or something There's that little song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi So you can count to four I can count to four because of that song
3219145	3222849	Alright, don't we have stories to do or some shit?
3223209	3223830	Who cares?
3225051	3227613	We're gonna talk about food and languages.
3228054	3233279	Wait, there was something else I was gonna... Damn it, there was something else I was gonna share on it.
3233559	3237123	You know what, I lost it, so you know what, here's the shark eating the plane again.
3238502	3239063	Holy shit!
3239183	3242386	I still want to see that movie.
3242446	3243747	You know what else was six bucks?
3244248	3245229	Actually, there was Repo.
3246550	3247011	On Blu-ray.
3247111	3247792	I need to get Repo.
3247832	3248452	I love that movie.
3249113	3250274	Okay, so was it my turn?
3250734	3250915	Yes.
3252236	3254578	Well, a Microsoft creative director had a hissy fit online.
3255740	3259663	And it gave me a perfect excuse to use the term hissy fit because that's pretty much what it was.
3260624	3266910	Orthy, who is Adam Orth, the creative director, said, Sorry, I don't get the drama around having an always on console.
3267550	3269612	Every device now is always on.
3269632	3270793	That's the world we live in.
3271093	3272675	And the hashtag was deal with it.
3273957	3295844	well that of course got people up in arms because you know anytime I'm going to say this to anybody who works for any company when you work for a company and people know you work for that company you are always a representative of that company you cannot say anything in a public forum that isn't going to reflect back on the company that you work for which I just want to say sucks
3296184	3297024	Yeah, it sucks.
3297425	3298725	That's the kind of world we live in.
3298785	3300366	But like, you know, I work my day job.
3300386	3302127	A lot of people don't know this, but I work in health care.
3302647	3309811	So like, I try very hard to like not say anything about like, I can't tell you my opinion on Affordable Care Act.
3310291	3316354	Because if I were to tell you that, you know, one way or the other, you know, that might be construed as that's how my employer thinks.
3316514	3318275	And so I have to be careful not to talk about it.
3318295	3319495	When I worked for the mortgage company.
3321416	3347452	I couldn't really talk about Bank of America and when I worked for the inspection company too because they were all our clients it would have gotten back even though my Facebook is completely locked down and private so I do think I feel bad for this guy as much as you might not like his opinion and you might disagree with it and you might be ready to have your laundry list of well here's what's wrong with your opinion guy
3348172	3353215	It kind of sucks that he can't say his opinion without everybody going, Confirmation!
3353436	3354496	This is confirmation!
3354756	3355277	He said it!
3355377	3356237	It's gospel!
3356417	3357098	Oh my god!
3357158	3359139	I'm canceling my pre-order right now!
3359459	3361080	Microsoft is doomed!
3361401	3363962	I don't even think what he said was that bad.
3364122	3369686	It was adding the hashtag to it that made it sort of like the snarky, I don't care what you think kind of thing.
3370046	3394105	but Microsoft actually came back with an apology or a statement put out by Major Nelson and I'm just going to read this out we apologize for the inappropriate comments made by an employee on Twitter yesterday this person is not a spokesperson for Microsoft and his personal views do not reflect the customer centric approach blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we are very sorry if this offended anyone blah blah blah wink wink wink and we are making no further comments on this matter
3394825	3395145	I don't know.
3395165	3396646	I think he gets paid a lot more than I do.
3396686	3400327	So, I mean, he should, you know, he should at least use some discretion on Twitter.
3400747	3402087	It was not a good idea.
3402427	3406508	But the way everybody's raking him through the coals, people make mistakes.
3406648	3407349	God damn.
3407889	3409549	And here's the other thing.
3409609	3413911	Dungeon Buster in our chat saying some of the quick memes done around that were pretty hilarious.
3413971	3418292	And links us to quick meme where, you know, it's just all these memes around it.
3418472	3418492	I...
3419793	3421895	I actually looked at that stuff and I kind of winced.
3421955	3426319	I was like, you know, as humorous as some of this might be, I feel bad for this guy.
3427100	3432305	I mean, he's just getting dragged through all these parts of the internet over an opinion.
3433367	3434868	But that's the nature of the internet.
3435208	3436830	It just sucks.
3436890	3437551	He's on Twitter.
3437811	3439132	Doesn't he know what the internet is?
3439313	3439533	I mean...
3439813	3440553	I'm on Twitter.
3441434	3452780	Yeah, and you're probably smart enough to know that if you worked for a big company that may have a console that's coming out that people are thinking that it's always online and you make a comment like, well, I don't see what all your problems are with this always online thing.
3453020	3454301	I mean, it's not like, you know.
3454521	3456482	I don't talk about the healthcare industry on my Twitter.
3456502	3458763	It's the one thing you're not going to hear me talk about.
3458943	3459843	And I use a fake name.
3459923	3461584	This guy's position is as a creative director.
3461704	3464406	He's in a position of some power within the company.
3465066	3471250	I don't know exactly what area of creativity he happens to direct.
3472071	3473431	It could be marketing.
3473652	3476794	I'd have to research more, but I don't know too much about the guy.
3477154	3484639	But when you've got speculation coming out about a system, especially right now when E3 is in a couple months,
3486900	3487120	Yeah.
3487460	3489482	But the Xbox was already supposed to be announced.
3489722	3494445	Well, if rumors are to be believed... I thought this was the end of this month.
3495165	3500048	Well, we heard before it was going to be early April, but yet not even invites going out yet.
3500368	3512756	But yeah, but they're supposed... Okay, when you have anything coming up that's going to have information hopefully being made about it, people are still going to try to speculate to get the jump, especially in the news industry.
3513276	3514977	You know, any type of video game related news.
3515157	3515538	And, you know...
3516258	3517299	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3537288	3538208	Or confirm rumors.
3539889	3540329	I'm with you.
3540409	3542190	Go into some other comments in our chat room there real quick.
3542230	3546072	Marissa Congusto at live.vognetwork.com says, Make a troll account to bitch.
3546732	3549253	He should have made a troll account that wasn't attached to his name.
3550494	3553595	So I can talk openly about health care.
3553635	3554716	Actually, I have no desire to.
3555016	3555836	So I can do that.
3556117	3557177	I'm going to make a troll account.
3557317	3561279	I'll call it, instead of Rob Roberts, I'll be Robin Roberts.
3561359	3562660	That'll be my name, Robin Roberts.
3562980	3563260	Oh, wait.
3563900	3565241	Shit, I can't, I can't do that one.
3565261	3566042	Robert's Rob.
3566062	3577792	All right, let me read this other comment here from Queen Simia at live.vognetwork.com says, his comment was the cherry on top of the shit sundae that was Diablo 3, SimCity, hell, even Origin.
3578152	3582956	It just all adds up in the public eye to developers and publishers not giving a damn.
3583516	3591903	You know, I'm with that comment quite a bit because as much as I think it sucks that, you know, he's getting dragged across all the corners of the internet and
3592083	3600490	It does really show how out of touch some of the management level people are with what gamers really are looking for.
3601610	3604653	Or is it just a case of the vocal minority?
3604673	3606094	Are we the vocal minority?
3609156	3611038	I have this mental image of...
3613086	3614647	them sitting on their little cloud.
3615107	3615387	Yes.
3615547	3619049	Surrounded by their little... Because everything's in the cloud now.
3619389	3619869	In the cloud.
3619930	3621430	So they actually work in the cloud too.
3621450	3622111	They work in the cloud.
3622151	3622711	In the fluffy cloud.
3622831	3629675	And they have their huge walls up where they only get very small filtered information for they look for their little target.
3630695	3633897	And they're not really paying attention to what's really going on in the real world.
3633917	3635738	They're looking at their bottom lines.
3635818	3641761	They say... You've basically got executives up there who don't really have their... People love Angry Birds.
3641941	3642301	Yeah.
3643376	3645957	Let's do some more microtransactions, durr.
3646037	3654439	But here's the thing, though, is I think the way they're looking at it is that they make these decisions that are unpopular and people still buy it anyways.
3655139	3661060	And then they come out with a sequel later on that has these same kinds of decisions and people still buy it anyways.
3661140	3662781	It's like DLC for Call of Duty.
3663141	3669763	Everyone bitch to bitch to bitch about how there's like, you know, why am I paying $60 for maps after, you know, Call of Duty comes out?
3669783	3671143	Why am I having to do this?
3671543	3672043	People buy them.
3672544	3673024	And that's the thing.
3673084	3675465	They're going to keep doing it if people are going to keep buying them.
3675686	3679048	And that's why you see more microtransactions in these games because people buy them.
3679448	3681089	They wouldn't put them in there if people didn't buy them.
3681689	3682269	And that's the thing.
3682590	3686732	You may hate it all you want, but there are still people out there buying this crap.
3687312	3688653	Same with all these online stuff.
3688673	3690795	There are people that will still think it's a good thing.
3690815	3693236	They'll defend Microsoft saying it's a fantastic idea.
3693716	3699720	But what I think is the problem, aside from the fact that he's a creative director and he thinks like this because, you know...
3700280	3701581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3721110	3722711	A lot of their rumors end up being true.
3723191	3725152	And granted, this could be one of the ones that's not true.
3725312	3726692	However, I don't know.
3727132	3733375	There's just something in this case about where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's two... This won't fucking stop.
3733795	3735596	And so this says to me...
3737335	3738296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3754093	3758675	refuse us to comment on it, and we still don't know when this thing is getting announced.
3759055	3765957	If Microsoft wanted to change something in light of what happened with SimCity and maybe some of this other reaction, they can still do that.
3766258	3768258	Well, here's the other thing, too, about the always online part.
3768338	3769819	It still kind of stings a little bit.
3769839	3775681	It's just, if it's always online, you're going to think, well, okay, well, then I should be able to play multiplayer online.
3775781	3778062	Oh, sorry, you've got to pay for Xbox Live Gold for that.
3778542	3796569	so it's gotta be always online because they always want you to use Xbox Live Gold and how many features of this always online console are they gonna hide behind Xbox Live Gold like Netflix in this one or Hulu Plus or YouTube the YouTube fucking app is behind Gold on the Xbox 360 it's kind of ridiculous
3797822	3798142	I don't know.
3798222	3811495	All I gotta say is, you know, I hope that the console's not online only because I can tell you right now, you know, the situation I'm in where I'm playing at my work and I'm in a spot of the building that doesn't have Wi-Fi at this point and that would not work for me.
3811635	3816059	I can't play a console that doesn't have, that doesn't allow me to play offline.
3816439	3818581	And so, I just won't buy it.
3819442	3819942	Simple as that.
3819963	3819983	I,
3820743	3847274	I think if they do make this thing always online and it's the whole you have to register maybe it's not so much the always online thing but if it's true that it boots you after three minutes of not being connected and if it's true that you have to register your games to prevent used games I mean Microsoft is just giving it to Sony
3847998	3850300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3871879	3879805	The not looking at where your audience is, not looking at what your audience wants, marketing it in a completely stupid way.
3881006	3883368	What's the pro to offset that con?
3884048	3885529	It has to be a huge pro.
3886350	3887211	Are all the games $20?
3887311	3889492	They'd have to pay for my internet.
3890173	3894016	Is that the pro that all the games are $20 now because they have no resale value?
3894717	3895517	Is that the pro?
3895577	3896938	Because that's a pro worth...
3898059	3900721	Are they games on the caliber of Halo 4, but now they're $20?
3901262	3905325	Because that's a pro going, okay, well, now maybe you're talking, Microsoft.
3905345	3906065	No, they're too greedy.
3906125	3907686	The game industry is too greedy.
3908147	3908907	That's the problem.
3909007	3911990	It's just like saying, hey, the price of oil went down.
3912410	3913351	Gas prices are coming down, right?
3913991	3914191	Right?
3914612	3914892	Right?
3915012	3915212	No?
3915412	3921737	And if this story says anything, it's the internet saying, this is not a good thing.
3923573	3925494	Let's hope it's not too late for Microsoft to listen.
3925854	3936397	There's a part of me that's actually more hoping that this guy put that out as a feeler to see what the reaction would be, even though I know it's probably just some stupid comment.
3937098	3946361	But still, they got a pretty firm response from the community, so hopefully this would be enough that they go, okay, well, let's not do this, or at least not do it yet.
3946787	3947287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3967700	3983606	Now there's also a rumor that's saying that the console is going to be about $500 or $300 subsidized with that plan they have right now where you pay so much a month because you're getting Xbox Live Gold tied in there as well and you pay over the life of the console or a couple years or something like that.
3986106	3990368	I mean, I seriously think if they do this with online only, it's like fucking PS3 all over again.
3991589	3997311	$499 and, you know, oh, by the way, it's always online.
3997791	4009275	The subsidy rumor about it only costing $300 getting some steam this week, which is so... That was in our list list at the end of the year last year, like what horrible gaming rumor is going to come true or something like that.
4009795	4010436	We called it!
4012696	4012957	Maybe.
4013117	4014297	We predict the futures.
4014577	4017419	DarkTetsuya in chat says, $20 games, LOL.
4017699	4018439	That's never gonna happen.
4018459	4019340	My iPad says hi.
4019620	4029024	I mean, I actually was thinking more if they made like a subscription service, you know, you have their, it's always online, you get Xbox Live, and then they do like a Steam model.
4031048	4032549	But even so, that doesn't seem likely.
4032649	4037150	What's the pro to offset the con that if I'm offline for three minutes, I get booted?
4037170	4043152	Because Steam, if I'm online and I get booted offline, I don't disconnect from everything.
4043552	4047493	And the other thing, too, is Steam games are usually pretty cheap.
4047633	4050434	Like Borderlands plus all the DLC for $25.
4051514	4054915	That's kind of hard to compete against $60 games and stuff.
4054955	4057016	I know Borderlands has come down in price a little bit.
4058197	4061058	But still, though, like Bioshock 1 and 2 for $4.
4061918	4062599	I don't see that.
4062619	4066480	You know, I'm not getting two copies of, you know, two Xbox 360 games for $4.
4066520	4072342	Well, on the same token, you remember how, you know, Origin is such a fuck-up right now.
4073063	4074583	Well, it has always been such a fuck-up.
4074643	4075584	It's not just right now.
4076204	4081846	Well, I mean, don't they require that, like, for now, most of the Origin games, you have to be online for those to work to?
4083367	4090929	I don't know, because the only thing I will play on Origin is a game that requires you, or that has, is a game that is meant to be played online, so I am online.
4091069	4093110	Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, that's all I use Origin for.
4093250	4099172	Well, you remember when they did, what was it, Patch 4 for Mass Effect 3, and it totally screwed up on my online stuff.
4099432	4100413	Let me verify my DLC.
4100433	4100573	Sure.
4101013	4102014	and I couldn't play single player.
4102314	4103114	Yeah, it's ridiculous.
4103154	4103494	Stupid.
4103554	4104255	Origin's terrible.
4104295	4106696	But to be fair, Steam was terrible when it came out too.
4107076	4116421	And if this console is always online, I'm just telling you right now, it's all the more reason for people to hack the shit out of it because if it's something that people... Ain't that the truth.
4116541	4124906	If it's something that the vocal minority doesn't like, it's going to become a fucking target and you better believe that they will find a way to do it.
4124946	4130189	Alright, let me... I don't want to keep dragging this out especially because it's basically a rumor.
4130829	4135291	But this is a comment worth responding to, so this will be the last thing on this topic and then we'll move on.
4135992	4138053	BlackWolfInChat says, Here's the problem.
4138613	4141274	The internet is a small portion of their target audience.
4141735	4143515	So the internet doesn't like the Xbox.
4143796	4145056	Everyone else will get it anyway.
4145296	4145857	Not caring.
4146837	4148798	In theory, you're right, Bobby.
4149298	4154341	But the problem is that vocal minority starts that whole word of mouth.
4155397	4158499	It's all about who they tell other people about.
4158979	4164221	When people are considering buying a game console, do you know how many people have come to me and said, Rob, what game console should I get?
4164521	4165222	What should I buy?
4165882	4172245	A lot of those vocal minority are people that work for GameStop and other retailers.
4172745	4183050	Unless Microsoft's going to really sweeten the pot, which it might be a deal they're willing to sign to try and get those things to move, GameStop has already come out and said, we don't like this idea.
4183850	4186511	So that's really bad.
4186871	4192674	Now, you might come out and say, well, a lot of hardcore gamers didn't like the Wii either, and look at how well that did.
4192714	4193734	But there was a big difference.
4194334	4197456	People with the Wii were like, yeah, kids will like the Wii.
4197696	4199076	Oh, yeah, the Wii's something different.
4199376	4200417	Oh, yeah, I know you.
4200477	4202017	You're not looking for anything too hard.
4202037	4203198	You're a soccer mom.
4203378	4204338	You'll love the Wii.
4204418	4205479	Go get it.
4206099	4207680	It was a different type of situation.
4207740	4210341	Nobody outright hated what the Wii was doing.
4211341	4228773	or what about when you get these stories let's just assume that this is going to be like every other online only or online required thing to come out that oh hey I just paid $500 for my new system and I can't fucking play any games on it because their servers are down and wait till that hits mainstream news
4229093	4236838	I know it may not hit it right away, but it's going to get some attention if it's anti-consumer where, oh, by the way, it locks down all this stuff.
4236858	4238159	They have this technology in place.
4238419	4243382	You're not going to have retailers caring about it because, first of all, they don't make anything off the consoles anyways.
4243622	4251627	If this is a retailer that makes money off of used games, they're probably not going to want to support a console that doesn't make any sort of money back for them.
4252608	4253228	So I don't know.
4255834	4256595	Thanks for watching!
4275734	4276954	Yeah, I wonder who that is, Rob.
4276974	4277375	That's it.
4277415	4280276	We're docking your pay.
4280296	4284517	Rob, coffee.
4284597	4287438	It's almost like the next logical step here is to talk about that story.
4287478	4288558	I can't believe we don't have it.
4288578	4290019	That's what we have for having a fluid.
4290513	4293334	Nick Earl, Senior Vice President of EA's mobile and social all-play label
4308562	4315227	basically saying that the people that are responding to the microtransactions in Real Racing 3 are the vocal minority.
4316187	4321651	Ultimately, the numbers would show that they and others all support the freemium model better.
4322832	4337121	And basically saying that people were, I guess, annoyed at the fact that the all-you-can-eat model, or they're saying that the game, the DLC in it, I want to say there was like, what, 200 and some dollars of DLC in that game?
4339623	4351016	But once again, I think it kind of goes back to the fact that you have this model where people are hating on it, but there's people still buying that crap.
4351136	4354300	I want to talk about the Peter Moore consumerist thing.
4354320	4355581	That's what I want to talk about.
4355641	4356142	I'm getting to that.
4356162	4356582	All right, thank you.
4356602	4357023	I'm getting to that.
4357583	4364406	So, yeah, yeah, yeah, this guy, what he said, but then like, okay, then the real bomb was dropped later, so let's get to that.
4364426	4372188	So, okay, because every year they do this thing on this website, the Consumerist, where they vote for the worst company in America, basically.
4372208	4374509	They have the golden poo that they send out to them.
4374529	4376030	But it's like, whose line is it anyway?
4376070	4376530	It doesn't matter.
4376610	4377150	It doesn't matter.
4377170	4377891	The points don't matter.
4378151	4381552	It's just, it's a popularity or anti-popularity contest or whatever.
4382552	4387194	And last year, EA took the prize because of Mass Effect or something like that.
4387955	4393817	And this year, they're into... Well, now, Loki, if you read what the consumers had to say, it was a lot more than just Mass Effect.
4393837	4394457	Okay, well, fine.
4394757	4405382	EA gets blamed for microtransactions, for inventing that model, for the online pass and inventing that model, for getting games rushed, da-da-da-da-da, blah-blah-blah, I'm very angry, and I'm on the internet.
4405622	4405822	Yes.
4406242	4408423	So, basically, you know, they...
4409804	4436321	They're in the finals, or pretty close to being in the finals And, you know, they come out, Peter Moore comes out And basically saying, hey, we can do better And some of the bullshit though, I mean, I love this quote The tallest trees catch the most wind Yes, we're hating on you because you're such a big company, that's it The tallest trees break the most wind
4437003	4439585	Wouldn't that just be the biggest asses?
4440565	4443447	Some of these complaints are 100% legitimate.
4443487	4447850	Like all companies, we are not perfect, but others just don't hold water.
4448271	4452954	Many continue to claim that the always-on function in SimCity is a DRM scheme.
4453174	4453654	It's not.
4453734	4455055	People still want to argue about it.
4455455	4456496	We can't be any clearer.
4456856	4457297	It's not.
4457577	4458017	Period.
4458798	4459338	I agree.
4459658	4460159	It's not.
4460859	4462320	That doesn't make it any less shitty.
4476204	4478285	It doesn't matter why it's broken.
4478565	4479525	It's just it's broken.
4480426	4483627	Some people claim that there's no room for Origin as a competitor to Steam.
4484247	4486108	45 million registered users are proving that wrong.
4486648	4493491	By the way, you have to fucking sign up on it to play console games that are by EA, PC games that are by EA.
4494871	4498752	How many satisfied customers out of that 45 million?
4499193	4499933	I dare you.
4500093	4501994	Pull each and every single one of them.
4502334	4504495	How are you satisfied with this service?
4505175	4505555	I dare you.
4505675	4506235	Dare you.
4506976	4509918	Well, I really just hate EA's customer service.
4510018	4514160	Okay, I got one good person the entire time I had that whole issue with my Mass Effect 3.
4514200	4515781	Well, the majority of it's outsourced.
4516262	4517142	Exactly, exactly.
4517182	4521245	I hate to say it, but that's actually a bigger problem than just in the video game industry.
4521265	4522366	You get what you pay for.
4522446	4522886	Exactly.
4523086	4524427	And that's true in any industry.
4525012	4528676	However, I completely forgot what I was going to say, so you were going to say?
4528736	4535382	Some people think that the free-to-play games and microtransactions are the pox on gaming.
4535662	4538725	Tens of millions more are playing and loving these games.
4539806	4539866	Oh.
4540266	4540947	Whatever, okay?
4541067	4543109	I'll give them that because... That's a valid point.
4543269	4549515	That's a valid point because they have the stuff that... You don't like it, don't fucking play it, stop spending money on it.
4550115	4555960	But people are, so... Because it would be a different story if they were putting out stuff that you could...
4556921	4565645	Get games that were like, I guess, but when you've got titles that people have gotten pretty much hooked on, then yeah, they do pretty much have a captive audience.
4565685	4568246	People want to get more of it.
4568626	4569307	It's kind of a catch-22.
4569527	4572088	You either do without it and do without their service.
4572108	4573909	Wait, wait.
4573949	4576090	So BlackWolfInChat says, I'm satisfied.
4576170	4576470	Great.
4576670	4578171	One person out of 45 million is satisfied.
4578191	4578811	Good, Bobby.
4579011	4585276	Bobby, how do we... And I'm just throwing out ideas here and he'll tell me to shut up if he doesn't like this.
4585336	4594683	But can we do something on VOG where I can have a poll, like an Insta poll, like a live listener poll, so I can go up and say, are you using Origin and are you satisfied?
4594703	4596745	And we can poll people live while the show's going on.
4596905	4597746	Is that possible?
4598146	4600167	Because I want that for next week.
4600188	4600648	Well, this is what...
4600988	4601769	Can we?
4601949	4602389	Please?
4602689	4604191	Please, Bobby?
4604391	4605712	This is what I have to say about Origin Story.
4606372	4608714	About their, you know, going, oh, so many people are using it.
4608934	4611436	Well, they did prove on Mythbusters that you could polish a turd.
4613077	4614158	Doesn't make it less of a turd.
4616082	4620525	One thing that I want to say about the free-to-play games and microtransactions, listen, it's a free-to-play game.
4620925	4633495	You're paying nothing for the game, and so paying microtransactions for something, or say, buying in-game items, spending like five bucks or something on in-game items isn't that big a deal because you paid nothing for the game.
4633775	4639060	The problem comes into when you have a $60 fucking game, and then you're still wanting these microtransactions.
4639080	4639140	Yes.
4639740	4666746	fee to pay is basically fee to pay, I love it fee to pay oh Bobby says it has been designed just not developed and maybe next week Bobby works very hard on coding VOGnetwork.com and he doesn't get paid anything for it so thank you Bobby Bobby gets paid in love I appreciate your consideration and I will withhold my feelings on SimCity for five more minutes out of thank you
4667166	4669008	Bobby gets paid in love, snark, and spite.
4669368	4670549	Exactly.
4670769	4680617	See, we've seen mailing lists that direct people to vote for EA because they disagree with the choice of the cover athlete on Madden NFL.
4680998	4681878	Yes, really.
4682039	4682779	Okay, well, fine.
4682819	4683520	Sports fans are crazy.
4684300	4692964	In the past year, we've received thousands of emails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games.
4693024	4700347	This week, we're seeing posts on conservative websites urging people to protest LGBT policy by voting EA for the worst company in America.
4700427	4704408	Okay, I give them props for promoting that community and stuff like that.
4704768	4706189	And yeah, there are assholes out there.
4706589	4711751	But at the same time, I don't think it's the majority of those votes you're getting because of that.
4712031	4713452	It's because, you know...
4715113	4735988	I don't know it's this weird kind of like you know I love that this letter is very staunch like if that's why you're voting us the worst company in America then fucking bring it because you're full of it so I love that kind of tone because you know clap clap clap I wish all people could get that but anyway I
4737742	4749128	It's weird to me that he calls that out because then I go, alright, I'm really appreciative that you're supportive of all that, but let's not use it as a weapon when things aren't going your way.
4751769	4756792	It does kind of... I appreciate your stance, but now's not the time.
4757752	4765976	And then the quote for last year, he says, the complaints against us last year were our support of SOPA and that they didn't like the ending of Mass Effect 3.
4766176	4766897	And this is back...
4767797	4778005	The response on Consumerist, they say, actually, our analysis of the reasons for EA's inclusion in last year's finale make no mention of Mass Effect 3 or SOPA.
4778025	4785090	Instead, it looks like the EA's history of buying smaller, successful developers with the intention of milking and arguably ruining intellectual properties.
4785510	4792332	And I'd like to mention in there too, especially as a factor of this year, maybe their idea that, hey, re-releasing a game, or I'm sorry, not re-releasing a game.
4806417	4822050	Putting out a game on the Wii, for example, FIFA 13, and basically just taking FIFA 12 and reskinning, say, FIFA 13 and updating the rosters, maybe not a good thing helping them, you know, with their argument that, you know, the quality in those games.
4822290	4824932	Oh, and that was also in the Vita and the Wii U version, by the way.
4825172	4827715	They ported the FIFA 12 game.
4827855	4829856	Is Peter Moore the next CEO of EA?
4830016	4830877	He is the CEO.
4830977	4831838	He is.
4831878	4832919	He's the CEO-o.
4833319	4834240	He's not the CEO-o.
4834620	4835721	No, wait a minute.
4835761	4838261	They replaced what's-his-fuck with somebody else.
4838321	4839562	With the former CEO.
4839622	4843523	But when I read that letter, I'm like, this guy is talking like he's the new CEO.
4843543	4850286	Look, despite the fact that we're flaming this whole thing a little bit,
4850846	4861391	I do appreciate some of the frankness of this and I appreciate the fact that at least they're trying and not just kind of like, la la la, we can't hear you, la la la, you're still buying our stuff anyway, screw you.
4861892	4868515	I appreciate that he's trying to respond to some of this in a very direct manner and I do applaud that.
4869095	4876459	My only problem is I'm like, it kind of really shows, really shows where some of the blindness is, I believe.
4877880	4882445	But once again, they're only going to go in a direction in their business that makes them money.
