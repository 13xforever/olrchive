7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, April 7th, 2013, one landmark game studio is shut down, Donkey Kong Country Returns will get a little easier, and one series of tweets rocks the gaming world.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 499, April 7th, 2013.
46000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games and gaming news and gaming lols and so forth with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55000	69000	Greetings and salivations. How you doing? I'm full. You're full? I'm full! What's that commercial? Full of useless knowledge and gas. No, Rob, again you're confusing me for your car.
69000	81000	My car has useless knowledge? No, your car's full of gas. Not right now it ain't. Well, the price is. Anyway, I did my customary stop by panda and I have eaten a panda.
82000	94000	Well, you shouldn't eat pandas. They're a species going extinct. Oh, because you know, when you think of panda bears, orange chicken is, you know, so representative of Chinese culture. Seriously.
94000	105000	If I go to China and order orange chicken, I wonder what kind of stairs I'm going to get. I've seen real Chinese food. I don't think orange chicken is among real Chinese food.
105000	116000	I told you the story about my ex and my ex's family when it got really awkward one night, right? Okay, wait, I'll tell us in a minute. First off, Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine.
116000	124000	You ready to hear awkward stories about my ex? All right, let's go. All right, here we go. So my ex was Chinese, right? Is this the ex I'm thinking of? It's the infamous one that a lot of people are thinking of.
124000	138000	Okay, so my ex was Chinese, right? So one time we went to go meet his sister's, like his family, which was the sister and the husband and kids and all this. They lived in Hayward, question mark, somewhere over in East Bay, that area, right?
138000	146000	So the deal was we were going to go to Chinese food for dinner. And you know, they're all very out. They were all from Hong Kong, born and raised. I think he moved here when he was 10 and so forth.
146000	158000	So we went and you know, they had already ordered by the time we got there, I guess we got there a little late or something. And on the table is all this food. And a lot of it is like very seafood. And it's a lot of dishes I haven't really had before.
158000	171000	And like, there's like a fish on the plate with all the meat picked off in the bones. But I'm like, all right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be cultured, I'm gonna just have a little bit. So I'm putting just like a little bit of everything. I just pick up pick a little bit of everything and put it on my plate.
171000	187000	Not because like, I think it's gross. I just, you know, want to try it, make sure I like it before I put a little scoop. And so his sister looks over at me and said, and like kind of has this epiphany. Like you see this moment of like, Oh, no, and looks at me and goes, Oh, I'm so sorry. Should I should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
188000	190000	And I'm like, that's racist.
192000	197000	In a weird way. Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
197000	209000	Well, she's trying to be considered I know, but it's like, I'm trying to just sample and we didn't order anything I ate. There was something there that I really liked. And I had a whole heap of it. Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.
209000	213000	See, I have no, if it's good enough for my ex, it was good enough for me. Okay.
213000	227000	When I was little in Alabama, I would go over to my friend Amnoi's house and her family's from Laos. And I have actually easier time eating Laotian food than actual real Chinese food. Because I really can't recognize much of anything I'm eating.
228000	239000	I'm all for I'm all for I love food, food, food is a great gateway to different cultures around the world. I will say though, probably the only cultures food I'm never having again is Filipino. Sorry. Sorry, guys.
240000	242000	But Rob, I thought balut was your favorite.
243000	246000	Nope. Nope. And some of those dishes. Nope.
247000	248000	Balut, Rob.
249000	250000	But if you like it, more power to you.
251000	252000	Have you ever heard of virgin boy eggs?
253000	254000	What's that?
255000	256000	Have virgin boy eggs?
257000	258000	No.
259000	262000	They are eggs that have been marinated in the pee of young children.
264000	265000	So how about we move on?
265000	273000	Yes. Let's talk about video games, shall we? How was your week, Loki? Do you have any funny stories that you want to tell?
274000	275000	Have any funny stories?
276000	277000	We had a week off last week. Did you have a good Easter?
278000	279000	Yeah, it was all right.
280000	284000	How was Josh's Easter? Because he's getting a little older and can probably appreciate all the candy now, right?
285000	292000	We don't let him have really much of the candy. He had plenty of like dessert and stuff. We just went over for brunch.
292000	297000	And yeah, that was pretty much it. Just kind of hung around.
298000	299000	Yeah?
300000	304000	Do you eat a lot of Easter candy? I was at Target the other day and it's all on sale. Half off.
305000	310000	No, not really. I didn't eat any. We got one of those hollow rabbits and I just haven't touched it.
311000	312000	Just don't care.
313000	318000	I heard there was some candy company suing another over those hollow rabbits or something. I'm probably like grossly simplifying it.
318000	323000	But anyway, we should probably get to gaming news. That's what you all signed up for.
324000	328000	But I do want to say hello and how you doing to everybody in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
329000	335000	The ever-present fourth guest on our show because of course we do tape live every Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network.
336000	341000	vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
342000	349000	And some comments in our chat room there. Let's see. Technus saying, Glad you like Laotian food. Dark Sakura?
350000	354000	I actually really, really love Laotian food but the only time I've had it has ever been home cooked.
355000	359000	So I don't know if it's any different in formal cuisine or anything.
360000	366000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, I imagine Nelly isn't really that about the pure sugar toddler crash at Meltdown.
367000	368000	I'm sure she's fine without that anyway.
368000	375000	He had a lot of sugar yesterday. We went over to her parents house because they had a family over. A lot of people haven't seen him yet.
376000	382000	So he had some cake and stuff and there was a lot of sugar in that. He was jumping off the walls yesterday.
383000	385000	So what, he's going to be four? Three?
386000	387000	Three.
388000	390000	Have the terrible twos been that terrible?
391000	396000	He's been pretty, yeah it's not necessarily terrible but it's just they start testing their limits.
396000	403000	Tigerclaw in chat saying, Holy crap episode 499 the pressure is really high to make episode 500 the most memorable.
404000	405000	Don't set the bar too high you guys.
406000	407000	It's going to be all about DDR.
408000	409000	Don't put it too high.
410000	411000	There's a bar.
412000	413000	There comes a point.
414000	415000	You mean the bar we limbo under?
416000	417000	I'm going to let you all in on a podcasting secret. Alright?
418000	422000	So this goes out to all the you other podcasters out there and everybody that wants to know what it's like to do a podcast.
422000	429000	Alright so you celebrate one year, you celebrate 100 episodes, you celebrate two years, you celebrate three years, 200, 300.
430000	433000	You know there comes a point where you're just sick of celebrating. It's like birthdays.
434000	437000	Like after your 21st birthday you're like, what do I have left to celebrate? The fact that my car insurance went down.
438000	440000	Do you realize I take an entire week off for my birthday?
441000	442000	Maybe you're not the best example.
443000	444000	I am not the best example.
444000	452000	However I have gotten the confirmation from my BFF that we will be having red velvet brownies.
453000	454000	God Becky I love you.
455000	457000	I am buying the red food coloring because she will not.
458000	459000	Why not?
460000	461000	Because it's like, I don't know.
462000	463000	Is it that whole it's not safe thing?
464000	468000	I have no idea but she never has a reason for it but I found out that the recipe calls for two whole ounces.
469000	470000	Well I appreciate anyone willing to put their morals aside to ask.
471000	473000	I was going to the baking store to buy like a gallon jug.
474000	476000	That's why you need to use virgin blood.
477000	478000	It's just...
479000	480000	Virgin boy eggs?
481000	483000	Did I tell you the story about my friend Diane making a red velvet cake?
484000	486000	No but here we go with food again. We will get to games at some point.
487000	488000	We will get to games.
489000	494000	She was living in northern Alabama at the time and making a red velvet cake and the Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door.
495000	499000	And she had just gotten done cutting the cake with a butcher knife while listening to Tubular Bell.
500000	501000	She was at the door with a...
502000	503000	WHAT?!
504000	507000	This is the same person by the way who joined our wow guild a while back.
508000	509000	Oh fantastic.
510000	511000	Gwen.
512000	513000	Yeah I love Gwen. She was nice.
514000	515000	Yeah she told you all the embarrassing stories about me in college too.
516000	520000	So that is always whenever I think of red velvet I always think of the expression on her face when she told that story.
521000	522000	It was priceless.
523000	524000	Alright here's a good transition comment in our chat room from Critical Myth.
525000	526000	Live.FogNetwork.com saying,
526000	532000	This is foreshadowing isn't it? After 500 it's all about food and the video games they play while eating that food.
533000	535000	That's what it's been about. Where have you been?
536000	541000	And I wish to remind everyone, and I've told this story a billion times on the show, but how was OLR born?
542000	546000	Because Jamie, Matt and I all used to play DDR all night and then what did we do?
547000	552000	We went right over to the cafe in the parking lot and shoved our faces full of what?
553000	554000	Tortilla soup and mozzarella sticks.
554000	557000	And Matt with his glass of, not this one, remember Tall Matt?
558000	559000	Yeah. With his glass of Merlot.
560000	561000	Yes, Tall Matt. With his glass of Merlot.
562000	563000	I like a glass of Merlot and he always says Merlot.
564000	565000	He used to say Merlot.
566000	567000	Like suddenly he's French.
568000	569000	Alright anyhow.
570000	571000	Or how Dan goes, Merlot.
572000	576000	Tigercall on chat says, For episode 500 are you guys taking voicemails with messages for congratulating you guys?
577000	578000	That's really sweet but no.
579000	581000	Well we have something else planned and I'll talk about that later.
582000	583000	But my ego Rob.
584000	586000	You know what? You can send a message congratulating Jamie if that's what you want.
587000	588000	Yeah send me a message and send me money with it.
589000	592000	Alright. Again I'm just saying after so many episodes you have to mix it up a little bit.
593000	598000	Alright. Let's get into gaming. Yes it is a show about video games believe it or not.
599000	600000	I play more games Rob.
601000	603000	You play more games? Well we'll get into gaming week but we have to do the pre-gaming week banter.
604000	605000	Okay cool.
605000	614000	And since we were off last week this week's pre-gaming week banter will consist of last week's news set to holic.
615000	616000	It's a new segment.
617000	618000	Last week's news set to holic?
619000	621000	Yes it's a new segment we're debuting on OLR tonight. It's called last week's news set to holic.
622000	626000	And in this segment we will recap last week's news set to holic.
627000	629000	So here we go.
631000	632000	Last week's news.
635000	642000	Last week in gaming news the Phantom Pain was revealed to be Metal Gear Solid 5 to no one's surprise.
643000	652000	David Hayter apparently wasn't asked to be a Metal Gear Solid 5 but it's very interesting because he signed his letter about why he's not in it. April 1st.
653000	654000	So to be continued on that.
655000	660000	And I really thought it was strange that they went with Bobcat Goldway to do the voice but hey I trust them.
661000	663000	Why did you hear Bobcat? I thought they got Gilbert Gottfried.
663000	669000	On the Sony PlayStation 4 Game Developers Conference more information about friends, system sharing and the user interface.
670000	677000	Nothing too earth shattering I thought except the whole you have your PlayStation name and your real name but the real name comes off of Facebook.
678000	683000	Oh is that like YouTube where they're trying to get me to use my real name and I'm like no and they're like let's tell you more about this.
684000	685000	Oh I'm sorry there's no option not to do that.
686000	689000	Miyamoto teased that a Nintendo theme park could be a possibility.
690000	692000	But you know a lot of things could be a possibility.
693000	697000	Nintendo Land? Capcom wants to work with WayForward again.
698000	701000	But probably that will only happen if DuckTales actually sells a lot of copies.
702000	706000	Speaking of DuckTales Remastered it was announced that DuckTales Remastered is in consideration for the PC.
707000	713000	And lastly on Kickstarter, Big Blue from the Echo the Dolphin team trying to Kickstarter there.
714000	715000	There's something new.
716000	717000	There it is last week's news.
718000	720000	That Kickstarter is a little too tree hugger for me though.
720000	727000	We need to worry about the planet and all your stuff and we're not necessarily making a game.
728000	732000	Now listen if I wanted a game that was like Echo the Dolphin but not Echo the Dolphin.
733000	736000	Here's the next evolution in the game and it's already been made. This is the best part about it.
737000	738000	It's called Laser Dolphin.
739000	743000	Yes Laser Dolphin does exist and it's Echo the Dolphin with a giant fucking laser in your head.
744000	745000	And that's seriously what it is.
746000	748000	They have turtles with god damn dynamite stuck to them and stuff.
748000	750000	That sounds like my kind of game.
751000	752000	Laser Dolphin.
753000	755000	So what are we going to get next like the reboot of Colibri with a railgun?
756000	757000	Sure why not.
758000	759000	I'd play it.
760000	761000	Let's talk about the things that we've been doing this week in our gaming week.
762000	766000	Although honestly if you want to talk about the games you've been playing for the last two weeks I don't think anyone would be none the wiser.
767000	768000	Ladies first Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?
769000	772000	My gaming week was actually more than Mass Effect.
773000	775000	Oh my god.
775000	779000	She played something that wasn't Mass Effect you guys.
780000	786000	But I'm going to start with Mass Effect because I played Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I've been busy modding.
787000	791000	I'm actually also using Mass Effect 3 for art references.
792000	794000	I don't know if you saw the crap I've been posting.
794000	805000	I finally finally bought the game that we talked about on our British Friends podcast that we guested on last week.
806000	808000	I downloaded Drunken Robot Pornography.
809000	811000	It is the greatest game in the universe.
812000	814000	There's a quote for the back of the box.
815000	818000	Okay you know my overwhelming love for Jumping Flash.
819000	821000	It's like Jumping Flash with guns.
821000	827000	Not you know shooting carrots at things but like actual pew pew die lasers.
828000	837000	And what you have to do is you get these like ginormous big robots but you have to get a number of points before the robot will appear they're called titans.
838000	843000	And they have these long appendages and they shoot lasers everywhere and other shit tries to kill you and it's really fucking hard.
843000	851000	So I finally beat the second stage after a week of trying and I did it while live streaming so I didn't totally embarrass myself.
852000	858000	Okay I quit. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not playing the game. I'm not going to do it live again until I'm sure I can beat the third level.
859000	866000	And then I got something else. Oh I finally went ahead and downloaded Gratuitous Space Battles but I haven't played it yet.
867000	868000	I just like the name.
868000	875000	And I'm still thinking about getting Hotline Miami just because all the blood and shooting shit. That's really fun.
876000	877000	Good times. I played well.
878000	879000	Oh that's right. I saw you log in the other night.
880000	881000	I was like well I'm paying for it. May as well play it.
882000	891000	That's right. I'm still debating quitting it. I might wait for another MMO that I am not supposed to let any indication out that I've actually seen it in motion.
891000	898000	So I'm waiting for that to come out before I reserve my judgment and see if I actually jump off the WoW bandwagon.
899000	904000	But it was kind of fun. There were people on so I like chatting. You were on one night and then somebody else was on in the guild.
905000	911000	Yeah the Hoard House Guild actually has a nice little file. It's not like a huge guild. We're not like the biggest guild in WoW by any means.
912000	914000	But we have a nice little group that plays there that's on.
914000	921000	Ha ha ha Raginator. I'll let you finish Dark Soccer but Magic 2013 is the greatest game ever. How about no?
922000	923000	Nope.
924000	931000	You know what I found though? We went to Dan's mom's house where most of the vault is in storage and I was tearing things up looking for my lightbox which I could not find.
932000	939000	I found a bag full of my art supplies but when I opened it to go through it when I got home I found a demo task for a Magic the Gathering card game.
940000	941000	Oh the old school one on PC?
941000	943000	The old school one. The demos that we got at E3 that first year.
944000	951000	Oh no that's not as old school. There was one I bought at Software Etc back in like 97 or 98. That game was bomb.
952000	956000	It came with the giant card from the Astral deck or whatever.
957000	960000	And you know what else I found in there actually speaking of Magic? I found my Japanese Legends.
961000	966000	The only set of my Magic cards that I never sold off.
967000	969000	Dark Soccer you might be a nerd. Just saying.
969000	970000	Duh.
971000	974000	So that was really it and yeah.
975000	977000	Then let's go to Loki. Loki how was your gaming week?
978000	989000	I was just about to link in chat room Laser Dolphin the game. It literally like the box art or the title screen is like the most ridiculous thing ever.
990000	991000	That is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
992000	993000	It is a dolphin.
994000	1001000	Free download or you can buy it for 20 bucks. Please don't buy it for 20 bucks. That's really a waste of 20 dollars.
1002000	1006000	So let's see. This week I didn't play any Bioshock Infinite because I was playing other things.
1007000	1014000	I did end up playing quite a bit of Sings for the Third. Just trying to kind of 100% everything on the PC.
1014000	1024000	Although I don't know why because it's like I sort of did that or I almost did that on the 360 but then I got my save gone and I kind of got bored with it a little bit.
1025000	1036000	And I don't know I played through the trouble with clones that piece of DLC but man I'm so glad I didn't buy those like at full price because that thing took maybe like 30 minutes to go through.
1037000	1045000	It was three missions. Three missions and one of I mean the like last mission is kind of cool but it's just so quick.
1046000	1053000	Like the first mission you're searching for this clone of Johnny Gat who's actually this brute and then it just goes by so fast.
1054000	1057000	It's basically one of those oh someone's driving the car you have to fire the rockets out of the back.
1057000	1060000	Okay cool I've done that in like a bunch of other missions already.
1061000	1071000	Then the second mission you have a cross dressing guy who's singing some Aisha songs and then you have to fire this bee gun at people which is cool.
1072000	1078000	I like the bee gun but that's the only mission you get it in. You don't unlock it for playing like the rest of the game.
1079000	1083000	It's the only thing that you get that weapon in and it's stupid.
1083000	1087000	And then the last mission is kind of cool where you have the superhero powers it's kind of like almost like a preview of the four.
1088000	1092000	Aren't there a lot of video games where like there might be like a special stage and you're like why can't the whole game just be this?
1093000	1101000	Yeah well it's stupid that that gun is not in the rest of the game. I think they probably are trying to sell it as DLC or maybe we're going to incorporate it in the four or some garbage like that.
1102000	1110000	But see that's why I'm so cautious about Saints Row the four which I'm still buying when it comes out immediately just because I like Saints Row.
1111000	1112000	Saints Row the four?
1114000	1117000	I think we should call it Saints Row the fourth. Why not?
1118000	1124000	But yeah Saints Row four and you know I'm just so cautious about it because they're like oh yeah we have this big DLC plan.
1125000	1131000	Well all your DLC has sucked. It's really sucked. Like seven dollars for thirty minutes of gameplay is really crappy.
1132000	1141000	I mean that is just absolutely terrible. That's actually worse than movies. I mean you can't go to a theater and watch a movie for seven bucks anymore.
1141000	1142000	Maybe a matinee.
1143000	1145000	I was going to say matinees are $5.50.
1146000	1151000	But I don't really count that though because you have to buy popcorn. Popcorn counts. You have to have popcorn. You can't watch a movie without popcorn.
1152000	1158000	Okay anyway so I've been playing some of that and you know here's the other thing. I got really frustrated with one of the missions because I couldn't.
1159000	1169000	The lag or whatever from like rain and stuff was causing. My rockets weren't firing fast enough so thankfully since I'm playing on the PC version I can mod the weapons one.
1170000	1177000	They're up to my liking so I made my rocket launcher fire a lot faster and lock on a lot faster so it's now acceptable for my use.
1178000	1195000	Let's see what else. And then I played a little bit of, very little bit of Defiance. I spent most of the time doing the typical MMO launch stuff whereas installing the game and then updating the game.
1196000	1203000	And then I connected to the servers and played for about thirty minutes going through the tutorial portion of the game which is fucking boring.
1204000	1211000	And the game itself is not very exciting right now either but I mean I am in the tutorial section of the game so I don't expect it to be that exciting.
1212000	1221000	But like I noticed the enemies respawning like almost instantly like I shoot a guy and pops up another one I'm like okay that's a little weird but sure okay we'll go.
1222000	1226000	That happens in a lot of MMOs when they're first out though and the newbie areas are really camped you know.
1226000	1239000	It's just, it's strange. The thing I do like about it though is it's not necessarily a game that's just all stat based like Final Fantasy or I'm sure like WoW to a certain extent.
1240000	1253000	You actually, it will help you if you have first person shooter skills because you're actually aiming your weapon and firing and doing all the dodging and stuff like that so it's like a third person shooter but you know an MMO.
1254000	1268000	However because it is just launched and like anything that's online and especially with MMOs the servers were a little spotty and so I got kicked off the server about thirty minutes in and then I couldn't connect to it again.
1269000	1279000	I haven't really tried. I was gonna play this weekend but I forgot my hard drive that I installed the game to at my work and so I was unable to play it last night and today.
1280000	1295000	But I'm hopefully gonna get into it a little bit more this week and then I picked up Borderlands 2 on PC because it was twenty five bucks for the Borderlands 2 and the Season Pass and so I'm probably gonna start that again on PC even though I've beaten it twice on the 360.
1296000	1297000	They've upped the level cap didn't they?
1298000	1303000	Yeah but it just makes everything, it doesn't really do anything. It just makes the enemies harder. Like have more life.
1304000	1308000	Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to know is Defiance a buy once game or a monthly sub?
1309000	1310000	Buy once.
1310000	1311000	Nice.
1311000	1321000	Yeah so it's buy once and then you can play it for whatever and the other thing too is I mean if you're into if you want to kind of you know help yourself out the game there's the shift or not shift codes there.
1322000	1329000	These what do they call them? Arc codes or something like that? It's something that's tied in with the Defiance website and stuff.
1330000	1347000	If you find them or just go to the wiki that has all of them just enter it's gonna take a while you have to enter in a hundred and twenty of them but when you do you unlock a bunch of like starter stuff like new weapons and shit that'll help you out so I did that like a few weeks ago and so that helped me out quite a bit.
1347000	1362000	Although I haven't gotten any of that stuff yet but it's gonna help me out so whenever I get to that. But the game they say it's sort of like Borderlands I guess you know because the way it plays and it's sure a rip off.
1362000	1378000	I mean at the beginning it seemed like such a rip off of Borderlands like you start off and you're this arc hunter instead of a vault hunter and you know there is this AI person that's you know that only you can see that's helping you out.
1379000	1380000	Your imaginary friend?
1381000	1390000	Come on this is totally Halo and fucking Borderlands and it's like completely ripped the plots out of there. And the other thing and I don't know if this ties into those whole microtransactions for things.
1391000	1408000	The characters that you can create their character creator or whatever where you can tweak the appearance and everything sucks. It looks all like this really ugly old ass person and I'm thinking that you can buy better facial features or something like that later on.
1408000	1409000	Buy a better face.
1409000	1410000	Hey just like real life.
1410000	1427000	No seriously because it's like I couldn't get anything that looked interesting. It just all looked like this grizzly dude. I mean it's like okay here's the three different face types and it's like okay those are all crap. It's like different layers of you know crap.
1428000	1433000	So whatever you know I'm actually looking at the dude's face you know while I'm playing the game anyways.
1434000	1441000	But I don't know it'd be it'd be something I'm interested in. I'm just hoping more people I know are actually playing it because right now it kind of sucks just playing the game by yourself.
1442000	1444000	Extraverse partners playing it. That's the only other person I know that's playing it.
1445000	1446000	Yeah.
1446000	1447000	He seems to like it though.
1448000	1457000	Yeah. I'm just waiting to check it out. I mean hopefully it'll drop in price and then people will be able to pick it up because we're at 60 bucks on PC. It's kind of expensive game can be a shameless rip off and still be fun.
1457000	1458000	That's true.
1458000	1465000	It's just I didn't have high standards for it anyways or a high high bar set for because it's based off a sci fi show. I mean come on it's sci fi.
1466000	1471000	Hey no one's expecting like gold from sci fi. It's just you know what sci fi shows are like.
1472000	1476000	I wish it was as awesome as the sci fi movies they do like shark to push and that would be kind of cool.
1477000	1482000	By the way who doesn't want to play an MMO like shark to push or just like a sci fi movie like a weird monster.
1483000	1487000	I said years ago they should make those sci fi movies into games and people would eat that shit up.
1488000	1493000	I almost bought you that giant robo shark versus giant octopus or whatever movie it was awesome at a dimple.
1494000	1495000	Is that the one with Deborah Gibson.
1496000	1499000	I don't know. It's the one where the shark eats the airplane.
1500000	1501000	Yes that one rule.
1502000	1503000	It was six bucks a dimple and I came really close to getting it.
1503000	1516000	And I got to say that the woman the woman alien that they have in the show and I understand she's not supposed to be like this sex symbol or whatever in this thing.
1517000	1524000	She is fucking ugly. I mean she is the ugliest like weirdest looking alien thing ever. It's like this dreadlocked man woman thing.
1525000	1527000	I don't even know what it is. It's just weird.
1528000	1529000	She probably thinks humans look weird too.
1529000	1534000	It's just like I just like oh I couldn't possibly watch this show and have to stare at this thing.
1535000	1540000	Yeah. I always love an excuse to play a clip from mega shark versus giant octopus.
1541000	1542000	Holy shit.
1547000	1548000	Okay I have to get this movie.
1550000	1551000	Okay Rob.
1552000	1555000	Rob we need to we need to we need to get that movie.
1556000	1558000	And I have Battle Royale in blue right now.
1559000	1560000	Oh yeah nice.
1560000	1563000	We need to do the really stupid violent movie.
1564000	1568000	Birdemic 2. They're making a sequel to Birdemic. I don't know if you heard Birdemic shock and awe.
1569000	1577000	It was this movie where this guy thought it was actually really good and their CG birds are like clip art birds like Jif birds that fucking flip.
1578000	1584000	And the guy literally thinks that his movie is so fucking fantastic and they wanted a sequel and he did the birds exactly the same way.
1585000	1586000	They're just shit. It's absolute shit.
1586000	1590000	That's what this that's what the station needs you know. We need a shitty movie podcast.
1591000	1599000	It's funny you should bring that up. I I I I I was gonna do a joke and it's gone. All right let's move on.
1600000	1601000	Do you have anything else for your gaming week.
1602000	1605000	No that's it. Oh my son played Angry Birds.
1606000	1607000	It's a slippery slope.
1608000	1609000	Is it his first game.
1609000	1622000	Yeah he sort of figured I mean he had it a little bit I had a video of him trying it out because his cousins were there and so they were showing him on his on their iPads and he started doing it OK.
1623000	1629000	And then he started launching him backwards so I don't really know if he gets the game yet but it's a slippery slope man ice.
1630000	1637000	Those kids are so fucking into Angry Birds man that is just some scary cultish shit plays it too and it takes over their lives.
1637000	1638000	He also has gotten pretty good Pac-Man.
1639000	1640000	Oh cool like Championship Edition or old school.
1641000	1646000	Like whatever the Flash version on that education site that he goes on is but it's like a it's Pac-Man.
1647000	1654000	And which Angry Birds you say. Well he started off playing Angry Birds seasons but then he tried Angry Birds Star Wars. They had all of them so you know.
1655000	1656000	Of course. Of course.
1657000	1659000	Back in my day you played number munchers and you liked it.
1660000	1665000	All right. You should get Josh an Apple 2e. That's what you should do. Make him learn like we did.
1665000	1669000	All right. My gaming week I actually played a few new things this week.
1670000	1676000	So the first thing I want to talk about is Harmonite which is a downloadable title on the 3DS.
1677000	1685000	It's a little bit of a music game kind of interesting because it's a music game but the music in the game is just made by simple platforming mechanics.
1685000	1696000	You automatically run and you can jump or you can attack and like usually attacking is like a drumbeat and jumping will make you know make the actual notes if you catch the actual pattern of the notes.
1697000	1700000	But there's branching sometimes in the stages that allow different things to happen.
1701000	1706000	And some of the stages it kind of changes the mechanic a little bit where you have left right up and down in it too.
1707000	1711000	And it is just like Space Channel 5 which was kind of awesome.
1711000	1717000	So Harmonite is kind of like a little bit of a platforming music thing meets Space Channel 5 and that's pretty cool to me.
1718000	1721000	And some of the 3D effects pretty good. It's made by the guys who make Pokemon.
1722000	1730000	So that's kind of interesting that you know they have some stages that will have like the gym battle theme and some of that stuff but that's kind of whatever that's all.
1731000	1734000	I don't I don't super care about that stuff but I know there's some people that get really excited about it.
1735000	1740000	So yeah. So I liked Harmonite for 15 bucks. Not bad. And you know I love music games.
1741000	1750000	Not a lot of like multiplayer mechanics or anything like that so it is very much a single player game but I think you know 15 dollars is an appropriate price for it.
1751000	1758000	Another game I played is a free to play game on PlayStation 3. Yeah PlayStation 3 has a handful of free to download stuff and play.
1759000	1763000	Like you know DC Universe is one of them and that crappy free realms or whatever it's called.
1764000	1766000	But this isn't an MMO or anything like that. It's called Jetpack Joyride.
1766000	1772000	And it's something that Extifer at Horde House told me about and I went and downloaded it and checked it out.
1773000	1782000	It's kind of temple run meets techno kitten adventure. That's exactly what this game plays like to me because it's that whole like you float up and down with the button.
1783000	1786000	That's all. You have one button. That's all you do and you go up and down and you collect coins.
1786000	1794000	You dodge these lasers and rockets and other things and you use those coins to buy upgrades which you get at a very slow pace.
1795000	1800000	Or you can spend real money and get them at a much faster pace. It's like the temple run mechanic.
1801000	1806000	Well yeah it was on the iOS and Android already so yeah I'm just wondering.
1806000	1816000	The graphics very 16 bit retro inspired but I got to admit as much as that sounds like it all might be crap the game is stupid addicting.
1817000	1824000	Like it is just so stupid addicting. And it's addicting in that way that like classic video games are addicting.
1825000	1833000	Like you know think back to a game that was on the Atari 2600. Usually it was just one gimmick but you would sit there for hours trying to improve your score.
1833000	1839000	Think of a game like I don't know Stampede. Right. People would drop 40 bucks to get stampede on the Atari 2600.
1840000	1849000	And all it is is the little horse runs and you lasso up the other horses or the I'm sorry the cows or you run into the cows to kind of make them go further out in the field.
1850000	1856000	And that's that's the game. That's the whole game. And yet you would sit there and play it more and more and more and try to increase your score.
1856000	1868000	And that like I don't know like I like I've sat there and played Jetpack Joyride for like an hour at least earlier today just to try and top the leaderboard which I did do on my friend's list. Thank you very much.
1869000	1881000	So yeah I got to say it's free. Why not. It's got trophies. So hey I I I can't really talk too bad about Jetpack Joyride.
1881000	1890000	I don't think I'd go spend a lot of money on it. But you know if somebody wanted to to get ahead then more power to you. It's your money. Spend it on whatever you want.
1891000	1899000	I thought there was one other game I want to talk about before I talk about a classic. Oh I guess I'll talk about this other free to play game because Alan always teases me about it.
1899000	1912000	And that's Guardian Cross which is this it's like a it's by Square Enix and it's a trading card game. And I'm making little quote fingers when I say that trading card game because it is not like magic.
1913000	1920000	And it is not like even like Hearthstone or whatever other types of trading card games you can think of because all the battles are automatic.
1920000	1930000	So it's all just about making your cards as powerful as possible. But yet I can't stop hunting down the little animals and playing that game and turning them into cards.
1931000	1938000	And then combining the cards together and then the whole NPC story and it's Square Enix so all the artwork's really good and the music's good too.
1938000	1950000	And yeah so I've been suckered into that but like any it plays just like a freaking Facebook game and like any Facebook game I'll be really into it for like two weeks and I'll be like what the fuck is this fuckery and then stop playing it.
1951000	1953000	That'll be the story of Guardian Cross.
1954000	1968000	One other classic game I've been playing this week. Final Fantasy 5 also on iOS now. A total remake. This is different because Final Fantasy 1 on iPad and 2 were based off the PSP version.
1969000	1976000	3 and 4 off the DS version but there has not been a Final Fantasy 5 remake save the Game Boy version, the Game Boy Advance version.
1977000	1984000	And that's the version that this is closest to is because it has the extra dungeon and all that but they've totally redone the sprites and all that and it looks great.
1985000	1994000	Like especially I have an iPad that has the retina display and it looks gorgeous. The controls, not bad. They've changed it so that your characters move in 8 directions.
1995000	1997000	But basically you put your thumb anywhere.
1998000	2002000	What is this 8 directions that you speak of? Witchcraft! There's only up, down, left and right.
2002000	2012000	I know right? But actually it really helps the whole touch thing because you put your thumb anywhere on the screen and that's where the joystick is and then you move it and then you lift your thumb.
2013000	2015000	You don't have a joystick anymore until you put your thumbs down again.
2016000	2021000	The controls actually work and they went back and redid the battles so that the whole battle is by touch.
2022000	2027000	My only bitch about that is that they should have made enough room for all the possible squares that can appear.
2027000	2039000	Because right now let's say you have a mage that has an ability and then white magic and black magic because in Final Fantasy 5 you can learn one job and then keep a trait while you go to another job.
2040000	2046000	You have to scroll while you're battling and sometimes I've clicked the wrong thing trying to scroll and that was freaking annoying.
2047000	2056000	But otherwise it's a great remake and now the question on everybody's mind is, well the next game in line for IOS would be what kids? Final Fantasy 6!
2057000	2059000	Seven! No, six.
2060000	2061000	Dark Sakura can't count everybody.
2062000	2064000	Hey, no I'm just going to all the link.
2065000	2072000	I would bet that they're going to do Final Fantasy 6 in a style like this for the holiday. Five is probably testing the waters a little bit.
2072000	2081000	It's a little more expensive. It's $16.99. It is iPad and iPhone universal. It's a universal app which some of their older games weren't so I'm happy about that.
2082000	2093000	But I love the battle system in Five. I love the way that you can kind of mix and match the jobs because it really reminds me of when Final Fantasy went MMO in Final Fantasy 11.
2094000	2105000	Which by the way had an expansion come out this last week and so of course Shane hits me up on the internet and says, Rob you should come back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion.
2106000	2108000	I want to play a Geomancer and I want someone to play with. Rob, Rob you should come back. You should come back.
2109000	2118000	And I'm like, no I'm not coming back. No, no, no. Finally we cut a deal. I said, alright if I'm going to do something I don't really want to do and you're going to do something you really don't want to do.
2118000	2125000	I will come back to Final Fantasy 11 for one month if you buy Civilization V next time it's on sale and he said deal.
2126000	2131000	And then he even went and played the demo for Civ V and he's like, oh it's not that bad. It is kind of like Sim City. I'm like, I told you.
2132000	2139000	But anyway, so my part of the deal was to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little while. So I have been playing that with the exp- I didn't buy the expansion though.
2140000	2146000	Shane has it and so I've been playing with him a little bit and I've looked at his Geomancer and Rune Fencer and I'm like, alright cool, new jobs.
2147000	2158000	But otherwise I've been leveling my Corsair and she's level 37 now. It was double XP weekend this weekend and we were fighting mobs in dungeons, duoing and leveling up.
2158000	2166000	So that part's really fun. The job system in Final Fantasy 11 is insanely fun and a lot of the classes are really good.
2167000	2177000	I love the fact that there's so many mix and match that is really viable in Final Fantasy 11. It used to have to be like, oh no, you don't play a Corsair without a Ranger sub.
2178000	2181000	You don't do it. You're an idiot. If you don't do a Corsair with Ranger sub that's how you have to do it.
2181000	2186000	But now it's like, okay you can kind of actually do Corsair Dancer makes a lot of sense, Corsair Black Mage, Corsair Red Mage.
2187000	2191000	You know there's a lot of different possibilities and so that I really enjoy.
2192000	2204000	I still think the game is missing so many quality of life things that make other MMOs more enjoyable such as World of Warcraft which you all know I play a lot or even other MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and things like that.
2205000	2212000	A lot of it has to do with travel and the battle system is still kind of slow especially when you're soloing and duoing. No jokes.
2213000	2224000	It takes me two minutes to take out a mob by myself at level 37. I know it doesn't sound like a long time but it's slow when you have to kill six of them in order to get one bag of experience basically.
2225000	2227000	Is being a white mage still hell on earth?
2227000	2241000	No because it's just the way people level at the earlier levels is so different now. You're in a party with 18 people and it's just like, alright as long as you're carrying somebody people are fine. There's hardly any tanks in those parties.
2242000	2244000	Did it still have the text macro system?
2245000	2246000	Oh yeah, that's all.
2247000	2256000	That really got on my nerves after a while just because I'd have all my text macro set up before casting and no we're not going to come and get healed and buffed and blah blah blah. Fine, quit.
2257000	2263000	It's actually really easy now to set up a macro that does cure and then you use up and down to select which party member you want to cast it on.
2264000	2272000	I think that's hilarious because back when I was playing it I played on the controller and you're like no you gotta play on a keyboard you can't do your macros without a keyboard. I'm like watch me flip flip flip flip trigger finger.
2273000	2283000	I'm going to mispronounce this name so I apologize. Sial in chat says dark soccer a healer in any game is a pain I would imagine.
2284000	2286000	Not necessarily for wow. It depends on your healing class.
2287000	2288000	It can be super fun actually.
2289000	2293000	I actually like healing paladins but I really did not like playing a priest.
2294000	2298000	See I love priest damage healing with his home ish.
2299000	2302000	After they changed the smack down priest. What was it? Disc priest.
2303000	2304000	Oh disc yeah yeah.
2305000	2309000	I like shadow. Shadow was fun for leveling but disc priest they completely buffed him up for panda.
2310000	2317000	Raginator in chat says I remember that being in Valcrum dunes was hell on earth. Well that's gone.
2318000	2325000	People don't do that anymore. You go to Guskin mines and you level in a group with 18 people and what happens is everybody level sinks.
2326000	2327000	It sounds like a cluster fuck.
2328000	2334000	It kind of is but it's well we live stream some of it if you've been watching the twitch tv orange launch radio we live stream some earlier this week so you can see this in action.
2334000	2344000	But yeah we played some of that and you basically level sink to someone who's around level 15 because everyone gets the XP.
2345000	2349000	It's just that everybody's abilities are set to level 15 and then they're just pulling skeletons over and over and it's called book burning.
2350000	2358000	Because every zone now has a book that has 5 or 6 pages and a page will say like in Guskin mines it says kill 6 members of the skeleton family.
2359000	2360000	Do you want to repeat? And you hit yes.
2360000	2368000	So you just kill skeletons over and over and over again and every time you kill 6 you got 600 XP. You got 700 XP.
2369000	2372000	All the way up to I think 1200 is the cap around there or something like that.
2373000	2379000	And then it's just you do that over and over again and before you know it you're level 35 and now you're going to crawler's nest to do the same thing.
2380000	2385000	It's crazy. People leveled to 99 in like 2 weeks now.
2385000	2392000	That just takes out some of the fun but then again you know me the queen of impatience on wow now.
2393000	2395000	Like I'm still 87.
2396000	2406000	SSJ100Matt says yeah you guys were in the mines for 2 plus hours. That's true but in that time we went from level 12 to level I want to say I was 26 by the time we were out of there.
2406000	2416000	And like compared to the like in Valcrum Dunes parties I was lucky to go from 12 to 14 in 2 hours. Remember Valcrum Dunes parties Loki? Remember that?
2417000	2421000	Is that that place that's like right outside the main starting area that you used to make me start in?
2422000	2428000	The stupid desert that had the port, the docks out on the side? Okay I remember that.
2429000	2432000	You know me I don't know what places are called. I just know landmarks.
2432000	2440000	That's not a thing anymore. Yeah it's interesting. No Gusken Mines is the scary you would go in there and you would hear this siren go off randomly that sounds like the siren from Silent Hill.
2441000	2448000	Oh no I never went there. I just went to this other place when one of my friends in New York was playing with me that had like a Bahamut running around.
2449000	2450000	Oh like a summoner or something?
2451000	2457000	No it was just like a big like uber creature that would follow around and we tried to take him out at 14. No that wasn't smart.
2457000	2464000	That wasn't going to happen. Alright anyway that's enough talk about a game that's like 11 years old so let's get into. Like us.
2465000	2474000	Alright let's get into some quick housekeeping. First off Dark Sakura mentioned this earlier but I just want to make sure everybody knows Dark Sakura, myself and Loki.
2475000	2485000	We didn't do it OLR last week but we all guessed it on another show that taped on Monday. It's called The Obscurecast and you should check that out because it's hosted by Cyl from Girls Gone Wow.
2485000	2491000	I love Cyl. And Razorbug who's you know a part of that whole you know kind of he does a lot of the Warcraft other stuff too.
2492000	2509000	Yes. And he's great and we had a really good time so it's I think the only time all three of us guessed. No if you go back to like some of the E3 specials back when it was the All Games all that stuff I'm pretty sure we all guessed it on a couple shows doing that but it's been a long time since all three of us guessed it on a show so that's pretty cool.
2510000	2514000	Wish you could have stayed longer. I know. Had a lunch. Loki's only there for like an hour but he was on his lunch break.
2515000	2525000	Darn that job thing. It's in iTunes and Stitcher and all that fun stuff just search for Obscurecast and check out I forgot to write down the episode number. Did anyone catch what episode number it is?
2526000	2534000	Look for the one that went up April 2nd I think was the day it went up. That was indeed because it was the day after no it wasn't was it April 2nd?
2534000	2537000	No it was the day after April Fools. We taped on April Fools.
2538000	2547000	Alrighty. Also follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O L R. You can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2548000	2556000	And of course next week is episode 500 and everybody keeps asking us what are you going to do and the answer is we're going to do a show like we always do. There you go.
2557000	2562000	Alright let's talk about some video game news. I'm going to be in a red velvet brownie coma. That's true.
2562000	2567000	We're getting food made for us. That's a great reward. And my friend Carly might come and bring German chocolate cake.
2568000	2572000	You know I need to be losing weight right now. Alright anyhow.
2574000	2581000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase radio.
2582000	2586000	Let's go to some gaming news because there were some pretty big things that happened this week right Loki?
2586000	2607000	Yes LucasArts was closed by Disney and their quote is after evaluating our position in the games market we decided to shift LucasArts from an internal developing or internal development to a licensing model minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.
2607000	2619000	As a result or as a result of this change we had layoffs across the organization. We're incredibly appreciative and proud of the talented teams who have been developing our new titles.
2620000	2629000	So basically instead of now you know making everything in house they're going to license off their properties to other developers to make games for it.
2629000	2638000	So it's not like you're not going to see any more Star Wars games just you may see Star Wars games from EA although actually I guess we kind of already have seen that or other companies.
2639000	2648000	And I would assume that also includes other properties like Maniac Mansion and all those adventure games that no one else makes except for you know Telltale games.
2649000	2658000	And of course as a result of that Star Wars 1313 is on hold because obviously they're not developing in house anymore.
2659000	2661000	Is it on hold or did they just cancel it?
2662000	2669000	It is halted so it's still going to come out I think just maybe a while. It all depends on who picks it up.
2669000	2679000	Well who of us saw this happening because I mean I was like you know they're going to start closing things and making changes.
2680000	2684000	I don't know I didn't really necessarily think that they were going to do it. I didn't think it would happen that fast.
2685000	2686000	I don't know I had a feeling but.
2687000	2695000	I always hate it when one bad game kind of closes a studio and obviously LucasArts last game was that whole Star Wars connect which just it was it was not good.
2695000	2697000	There's no nice way to say it.
2698000	2704000	And LucasArts really hasn't I think made the must have talk about game the way that they did back in the 90s.
2705000	2709000	And we could we could talk till we're blue in the face about why that is but you know they're just it sucks.
2710000	2718000	I don't like talking about things where people lose their jobs and so forth but you know maybe the management was not picking the right games to greenlight.
2719000	2723000	Who was it that Disney usually goes for for their development though for like all of their proprietary games?
2723000	2726000	Well they all over the map really I mean think about it.
2727000	2728000	Disney has their own studios.
2729000	2736000	I know but I mean I'm trying to think well I mean Kingdom Hearts Square there was they worked with Bethesda too for a while.
2737000	2750000	That's the interesting thing is that this might not be as besides the job loss which sucks the other half of this might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is because it's not like Disney doesn't license its stuff out pretty liberally.
2750000	2756000	Even last week excuse me two weeks ago when we were last live on the show what game was everybody excited about two weeks ago?
2757000	2759000	What was everybody losing their shit over at PAX East?
2760000	2761000	DuckTales.
2762000	2765000	Right that's a Disney thing that was licensed to Capcom right?
2766000	2769000	Square has Kingdom Hearts I mean it's not like these Disney things aren't licensed out.
2770000	2776000	So it's not like you're never gonna see another Star Wars game and you probably will see another Indiana Jones game before too long.
2776000	2780000	In fact I think the Lego games still do pretty well in the Indiana Jones universe right?
2781000	2782000	They're done with those.
2783000	2784000	But yeah they did okay.
2785000	2792000	I just would hope that if for whoever they're gonna choose for more of their publishing that they really go look at a company with a good reputation.
2793000	2800000	The depressing part of this though is that the games that you know those of us that are PC nerds really remember so fondly from like the 90s.
2800000	2809000	Such as Loom, Maniac Mansion, you know all the things that LucasArts did back in the day those I don't know what can come of that.
2810000	2818000	I'm completely I think in a kind of a sore spot over the whole thing just because I'm actually more worried about ILM.
2819000	2826000	About what's gonna happen with that because I have ever since I was a little kid I have had I guess the big girl boner for ILM.
2826000	2834000	I wanted to work for them. I wanted to grow up and work for ILM and you know that didn't happen but when we went to the Skywalker Ranch you remember my friend Krista?
2835000	2845000	She used to work for LucasArts. Worked on KOTOR and I got to go to the Skywalker Ranch and bought my ILM shirt and everything and was in meatloaf flicking distance of George Lucas.
2846000	2852000	And if I had known then what I know now I would have just kidnapped him and cloned him and made my own robot George.
2853000	2854000	No more prequels!
2854000	2860000	Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says this crushes all these Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts 3 talk.
2861000	2867000	Not necessarily. Not at all actually. I think it's quite the opposite. I think there's a greater chance of something like that happening now.
2868000	2870000	I went in Indiana Jones level into Kingdom Hearts.
2871000	2875000	Now it's just a matter of getting to a Kingdom Hearts 3 square.
2876000	2877000	I know they can't count either.
2878000	2879000	That's the part you should be concerned about.
2880000	2881000	They're hanging out with Valve these days I think.
2881000	2883000	Three! We don't know what three is!
2884000	2891000	I've seen people on Facebook that are like Boycott Disney! This is bull!
2892000	2896000	And I'm just kind of like dude you guys are hanging on to memories from the 90s.
2897000	2900000	Believe me as I get older I understand that.
2901000	2908000	But if you look at what LucasArts has done in the past few years from a business perspective it kind of makes sense.
2909000	2910000	Yeah we did see it coming.
2911000	2916000	Now I really do hope those that got laid off can rise from the ashes.
2917000	2919000	Usually new studios get formed.
2920000	2923000	Other studios get stronger with all this talent out there.
2924000	2927000	I've seen that there's people like I think ArenaNet.
2928000	2933000	The people that make Guild Wars were posting things on their Twitter about hey if you were LucasArts we're hiring.
2934000	2937000	And that's the great thing about the games industry is there's a lot of great networking that goes on.
2937000	2939000	You know Game Developers Conference for one.
2940000	2947000	There's a lot of that great stuff that goes on where I feel like there will at least be opportunities and the game developers are looking out for each other.
2948000	2950000	Because unfortunately it can be a very volatile industry.
2951000	2954000	So I really hope that it has a happy ending for those folks at least.
2955000	2959000	Was that it? Did we talk about the Star Wars 1313 part?
2960000	2961000	Yes you did. Sorry I missed it.
2962000	2964000	Do you think that will happen?
2965000	2966000	Yeah I think it will happen still.
2967000	2973000	You know what though the other thing with the changes too is that since they're wiping out the book canon.
2974000	2976000	I know a lot of people who are pissed off.
2977000	2980000	There is a lot of nerd rage going on over the book canon.
2981000	2983000	Well wiping out the canon is a bit extreme.
2984000	2986000	I don't think you should disrespect the book universe and all this.
2987000	2989000	But the talk of making one of those books Star Wars 7.
2990000	2991000	That was never going to happen.
2992000	2993000	That was never going to happen.
2994000	2995000	Like that is way too.
2996000	2997000	There's way too much.
2998000	3002000	Like I tried getting into the Star Wars books and I maybe read one of the first trilogies.
3003000	3006000	And after that I was like no I can't do this anymore because it's just completely gone.
3007000	3011000	You know you sit and read the Star Wars wiki where they go through all the stuff about the books.
3012000	3013000	I was like okay I'm done.
3014000	3015000	It's way out of hand.
3016000	3019000	But they've built up that much lore and just to sort of dismiss it.
3020000	3021000	Look at what Abrams did with Star Trek.
3021000	3023000	Like a lot of people were pissed about what was going to happen there.
3024000	3025000	But I think it turned out great.
3026000	3029000	But he did stay with established lore. They set an alternate universe.
3030000	3033000	But did he feel the need to turn a book into a movie?
3034000	3035000	No.
3036000	3038000	And now his universe has spawned new books.
3039000	3040000	In the new universe.
3041000	3042000	Anyhow.
3043000	3045000	Let's move on. Let's talk about harmonics.
3045000	3046000	Let's talk about harmonics.
3047000	3048000	Kind of had a bit of a uh-oh this week.
3049000	3052000	And I even got an email about this because I'm registered on rockband.com.
3053000	3054000	But yeah harmonics sent out an email.
3055000	3057000	If you're registered on rockband.com or dancecenter.com you probably got this.
3058000	3060000	Servers went down over the weekend because of a third party attack.
3061000	3065000	Not saying who did this but somebody was trying to get into the servers.
3066000	3070000	Passwords for all these websites have been reset as a precautionary measure.
3071000	3074000	So you're going to have to change your password when you log into the site again.
3075000	3078000	Note that no user's information was published or misused that they found.
3079000	3081000	Harmonics doesn't keep credit card or social security.
3082000	3085000	I mean they didn't have any of that so you know your personal information is not really at risk.
3086000	3091000	However, as is good practice, if you use the same password on harmonics.
3092000	3096000	Like if you use the same email password on that site that you use somewhere else.
3097000	3098000	You probably want to change it. Like your bank.
3099000	3100000	If your bank password matches your harmonics password.
3101000	3103000	If you use your bank password on anything video game related.
3103000	3105000	Stop doing that.
3106000	3110000	Honestly people if you're going to make any of your passwords unique.
3111000	3115000	Your bank password needs to be unique and your paypal password needs to be unique.
3116000	3118000	Not the same as your bank password. They need to be separate.
3119000	3122000	Don't ever ever ever use and your email password.
3123000	3126000	That's the third one because I'm going to say don't ever ever ever use your email password anywhere else.
3127000	3130000	Because 99% of the time that's what they want.
3130000	3134000	And while I'm at it. While I'm on my tangent people.
3135000	3137000	Be careful what you share on Facebook.
3138000	3141000	Think about it. What are the security questions that are usually asked?
3142000	3143000	It's all those memes that are going around on Facebook right now.
3144000	3147000	It's all those memes on Facebook. Post your drag queen name. Like and share.
3148000	3150000	The street you were born on. The town. The street you were born on in your pet.
3151000	3153000	Yeah. Hello. Those are common questions.
3154000	3156000	No it's one, two, three, four, five.
3157000	3159000	Yeah so just be careful.
3160000	3162000	You know what my rule of thumb is?
3163000	3166000	Stop using Facebook. That would be a great security precaution right there.
3167000	3169000	I practically have except my mom sort of guilted me into going back.
3170000	3172000	Oh except use it to like Orange Lawn Radio.
3173000	3174000	Yeah use it to like Orange Lawn Radio.
3175000	3176000	But we're not going to steal your shit. I promise. I super promise.
3177000	3179000	But um. Crap I completely forgot. Oh yeah.
3180000	3182000	My rule of thumb for a password. Numbers and another language.
3183000	3186000	There you go. Now you just told everybody your password.
3187000	3189000	They don't know a language. Ah.
3190000	3192000	Uno dos tres. That's her password.
3193000	3194000	Ichi ni.
3195000	3197000	Which is as much as Rob can count in Japanese.
3198000	3199000	No I remember that song that goes.
3200000	3202000	Ichi ni san chi.
3203000	3206000	Wasn't that a DDR song or a Beatmania song or something?
3207000	3208000	I don't remember.
3209000	3210000	It was on a Dancemania album or something.
3211000	3212000	There's that little song that goes.
3213000	3214000	Ichi ni san chi.
3215000	3216000	So you can count to four.
3217000	3218000	I can count to four because of that song.
3219000	3220000	Alright.
3221000	3222000	Don't we have stories to do or some shit?
3223000	3224000	Who cares.
3225000	3226000	We're going to talk about food.
3227000	3228000	And languages.
3229000	3230000	Wait there was something else I was going to.
3231000	3233000	Dammit there was something else I was going to share on it.
3234000	3235000	You know what I lost it so you know what.
3236000	3237000	Here's the shark eating the plane again.
3238000	3239000	Holy shit.
3241000	3242000	I still want to see that movie guys.
3242000	3243000	You know what else was six bucks.
3244000	3245000	Actually there was Repo.
3246000	3247000	On Blu-ray.
3248000	3249000	I need to get Repo.
3250000	3251000	I love that movie.
3252000	3253000	Okay so was it my turn?
3254000	3255000	Yes.
3256000	3257000	Well a Microsoft creative director had a hissy fit online.
3258000	3259000	And it gave me a perfect excuse to use the term hissy fit.
3260000	3261000	Because that's pretty much what it was.
3262000	3263000	Orthy who is Adam Orth the creative director said.
3264000	3266000	Sorry I don't get the drama around having an always on console.
3267000	3268000	Every device now is always on.
3269000	3270000	That's the world we live in.
3270000	3271000	And the hashtag was deal with it.
3272000	3273000	Well.
3274000	3275000	That of course got people up in arms.
3276000	3277000	Because you know anytime.
3278000	3280000	I'm going to say this to anybody who works for any company.
3281000	3282000	When you work for a company.
3283000	3284000	And people know you work for that company.
3285000	3286000	You are always a representative of that company.
3287000	3288000	You cannot say anything.
3289000	3290000	In a public forum.
3291000	3292000	That isn't going to reflect back on the company that you work for.
3293000	3294000	Which I just want to say sucks.
3295000	3296000	Yeah it sucks.
3297000	3298000	That's the kind of world we live in.
3298000	3299000	But like you know I work my day job.
3300000	3301000	A lot of people don't know this but I work in health care.
3302000	3306000	So like I try very hard to like not say anything about like.
3307000	3309000	I can't tell you my opinion on Affordable Care Act.
3310000	3311000	Because if I were to tell you that.
3312000	3313000	You know one way or the other.
3314000	3315000	You know that might be construed as that's how my employer thinks.
3316000	3317000	And so I have to be careful not to talk about it.
3318000	3319000	Which sucks.
3320000	3321000	When I worked for the mortgage company.
3322000	3323000	I couldn't really talk about.
3324000	3325000	You know I couldn't talk about Bank of America.
3326000	3327000	I couldn't talk about.
3328000	3329000	It would have gotten back.
3330000	3332000	Even though my Facebook is completely locked down in private.
3333000	3336000	So I do think I feel bad for this guy.
3337000	3339000	As much as you might not like his opinion.
3340000	3341000	And you might disagree with it.
3342000	3343000	And you might be ready to have your laundry list of.
3344000	3346000	Well here's what's wrong with your opinion.
3347000	3348000	Guy.
3349000	3351000	It kind of sucks that he can't say his opinion without everybody going.
3352000	3353000	Confirmation.
3354000	3355000	This is confirmation. He said it.
3356000	3357000	It's gospel. Oh my God.
3358000	3359000	This is preorder right now.
3360000	3361000	Microsoft is doomed.
3362000	3364000	I don't even think what he said was that bad.
3365000	3367000	It was adding the hashtag to it that made it sort of like the snarky.
3368000	3369000	I don't care what you think kind of thing.
3370000	3372000	But Microsoft actually came back.
3373000	3375000	With an apology or a statement.
3376000	3377000	Put out by Major Nelson.
3378000	3379000	And I'm just going to read this out.
3380000	3382000	We apologize for the inappropriate comments made by an employee on Twitter yesterday.
3383000	3384000	This person is not a spokesperson for Microsoft.
3385000	3387000	And his personal views do not reflect the customer centric approach.
3388000	3389000	Mala bla bla bla bla.
3390000	3392000	We were very sorry if this offended anyone blah blah blah, wink wink wink.
3393000	3394000	And we are making any further comments on this matter.
3395000	3400000	I don't know I think he gets paid a lot more than I do so I mean he should at least have some discretion on Twitter.
3401000	3402000	It was not a good idea.
3403000	3406200	But the way everybody's raking him through the coals, people make mistakes.
3407000	3408000	God damn.
3409000	3410000	Here's the other thing.
3411000	3414000	Dungeon buster in our chat saying some of the quick memes done around that are pretty hilarious.
3414000	3418000	And links us to quick meme where you know it's just all these memes around it.
3419000	3421000	I actually looked at that stuff and I kind of winced.
3422000	3426000	I was like you know as humorous as some of this might be like I feel bad for this guy.
3427000	3432000	Like to be, I mean he's just getting dragged through all these parts of the internet over an opinion.
3433000	3434000	But that's the nature of the internet.
3435000	3436000	It just sucks.
3437000	3439000	He's on Twitter. Doesn't he know what the internet is?
3440000	3441000	I'm on Twitter.
3441000	3447000	Yeah and you're probably smart enough to know that if you worked for a big company that you know may have a console that's coming out.
3448000	3452000	That people are thinking that is always online and you make a comment like well I don't see what all your problems with this always online thing.
3453000	3454000	I mean it's not like you know.
3455000	3456000	I don't talk about the healthcare industry on my Twitter.
3457000	3458000	It's the one thing you're not going to hear me talking about.
3459000	3460000	And I use a fake name.
3461000	3464000	This guy's position is as a creative director. He's in a position of some power within the company.
3464000	3471000	I mean maybe I don't know exactly what area of creativity he happens to direct.
3472000	3476000	It could be marketing. It could be. I mean I have to research more about it. I don't know too much about the guy.
3477000	3485000	But when you've got speculation coming out about a system especially you know right now when what E3 is in how many months? Couple months?
3486000	3487000	Couple months.
3488000	3489000	But the Xbox was already supposed to be announced.
3490000	3492000	Well if rumors are to be believed.
3492000	3494000	I thought this was the end of this month.
3495000	3499000	Well we we heard before it was going to be early April but yet not even invites going out yet.
3500000	3505000	But yeah but they're supposed. Okay when you have anything coming up that's going to have information hopefully being made about it.
3506000	3512000	People are still going to try to speculate to get the jump especially in the news industry.
3513000	3514000	You know any type of video game related news.
3514000	3525000	And you know like remember the what was the deal where someone said some rumor about a game and then the company said well no even though we had an interview with you that's not what's happening.
3526000	3527000	And we covered it a few weeks ago.
3528000	3535000	But people are going to try to grasp at anything that's going to give them some sort of superior position as far as the knowledge base about the machine.
3536000	3537000	Or confirm rumors.
3537000	3538000	Or confirm rumors.
3539000	3542000	I'm with you. Go into some other comments in our chat room there real quick.
3543000	3546000	Marissa Congusto at live.vognetwork.com says make a troll account to bitch.
3547000	3549000	He should have made a troll account that wasn't attached to his name.
3550000	3553000	Maybe that's so I can I can talk openly about health care.
3554000	3555000	Actually I have no desire to but so I could I could do that.
3556000	3557000	I'm going to make a troll account.
3558000	3561000	I'll call it instead of Rob Roberts I'll be Robin Roberts.
3562000	3563000	That'll be my name. Robin Roberts.
3564000	3565000	Oh wait. Shit. I can't I can't do that one.
3565000	3566000	Roberts Rob.
3567000	3577000	All right let me read this other comment here from Queen Simea at live.vognetwork.com says his comment was the cherry on top of the shit sundae that was Diablo 3, SimCity, hell even Origin.
3578000	3582000	It just all adds up in the public eye to developers and publishers not giving a damn.
3583000	3591000	You know I'm I'm with that comment quite a bit because as much as I think it sucks that you know he's getting dragged across all the corners of the Internet.
3591000	3600000	It does really show how out of touch some of the management level people are with what gamers really are looking for.
3601000	3606000	Or is that just is it just a case of the vocal minority? Are we the vocal minority?
3606000	3617000	I have this mental image of them sitting on their little cloud surrounded by their little.
3618000	3619000	Because everything's in the cloud now.
3620000	3621000	They actually work in the cloud.
3622000	3635000	They work in the cloud and they have their huge walls up where they only get very small filtered information for they look for their little target and they're not really paying attention to what's really going on the real world they're looking at their bottom lines.
3636000	3642000	I would say you've basically got executives up there who don't really have the love angry birds.
3643000	3645000	Let's do some more microtransactions.
3646000	3654000	But here's the thing though is I think what the way they're looking at it is that they make these decisions that are unpopular and people still buy it anyways.
3655000	3661000	And then they come out with a sequel later on that has these same kinds of decisions and people still buy it anyways.
3661000	3669000	It's like DLC for Call of Duty. Everyone bitched a bitched a bitched about how there's like you know why am I paying $60 for maps after you know Call of Duty comes out?
3670000	3672000	Why am I having to do this? People buy them.
3673000	3675000	And that's the thing is they're going to keep doing it if people are going to keep buying them.
3676000	3679000	And that's why you see more microtransactions in these games because people buy them.
3680000	3681000	They wouldn't put them in there if people didn't buy them.
3682000	3686000	And that's the thing is you may hate it all you want but there are still people out there buying this crap.
3686000	3693000	Same with the always online stuff. There are people that will still think it's a good thing. They'll defend Microsoft and think it's a fantastic idea.
3694000	3705000	But what I think is the problem aside from the fact that he's a creative director and he thinks like this because he obviously is having some sort of impact on how this next console is being made or at least how the software is being made.
3706000	3709000	And that's not necessarily a good thing.
3709000	3711000	And I don't know.
3712000	3717000	It's getting to a point for me between this and all these like this rumor won't fucking die.
3718000	3722000	And you know what we've learned about Microsoft before? A lot of their rumors end up being true.
3723000	3726000	And granted this could be one of the ones that's not true. However I don't know.
3727000	3733000	There's just something in this case about where there's smoke there's fire and there's two this won't fucking stop.
3733000	3747000	And so this this says to me there is some truth in this whether it's a less severe form of the truth like what Loki theorized a couple weeks ago on the show that it's always online in the way we connect 24 was always online.
3748000	3758000	But I don't know anymore like the only saving grace here is that Microsoft refuses to comment on it and we still don't know when this thing is getting announced.
3758000	3765000	If Microsoft wanted to change something in light of what happened with SimCity and maybe some of this other reaction they can still do that.
3766000	3775000	Well here's the other thing too about the always online part it still kind of stings a little bit is just if it's always online you're going to think well OK well then I should be able to play multiplayer online.
3776000	3781000	Oh sorry got to pay for Xbox Live Gold for that. So it's got to be always online because they always want you to use Xbox Live Gold.
3782000	3790000	And how many features of this always online console are they going to hide behind Xbox Live Gold like Netflix in this one or Hulu Plus or YouTube.
3791000	3796000	The YouTube fucking app is behind gold on the Xbox 360. It's kind of ridiculous.
3797000	3811000	I don't know all I got to say is you know I hope that the console is not online only because I can tell you right now you know the situation I'm in where I'm playing at my work and I'm in a spot of the building that doesn't have Wi-Fi at this point and that would not work for me.
3812000	3819000	I can't play a console that doesn't have that doesn't allow me to play offline and so I just won't buy it. Simple as that.
3820000	3832000	I think if they do make this thing always online and it's the whole you have to register you're like if it maybe it's not so much the always online thing but if it's like the always online as like if it's off DRM.
3833000	3840000	OK if it's true that it boots you after three minutes of not being connected and if it's true that you have to register your games to prevent used games.
3840000	3852000	I mean I mean Microsoft is just giving it to Sony. They are just handed it over to so here you go. This cause this generation is on us.
3853000	3869000	I just it would be a business decision of colossal bad proportions and I just I can't believe they would be so stupid and also like what's the problem to me like it's one of those same type of bad decisions that basically killed Sega in the console market.
3870000	3879000	To the not looking at where your audience is not looking at what your audience wants marketing it in a completely stupid way.
3880000	3883000	What's the pro to offset that con.
3884000	3887000	I am a huge pro are all the games twenty dollars.
3887000	3893000	Is that the pro that all the games are twenty dollars now because they have no resale value.
3894000	3896000	Is that the pro because that's a pro worth.
3897000	3905000	I mean are they games on the caliber of Halo 4 but now they're twenty dollars because that's a pro we're going OK well now maybe you're talking now because they're too greedy.
3906000	3907000	The game industry is too greedy.
3908000	3912000	That's the problem. It's just like just like say hey the price of oil went down gas prices are coming down right.
3913000	3921000	Right. Right. No. And if no story says anything it's the Internet saying this is not a good thing.
3923000	3925000	Let's hope it's not too late for Microsoft to listen.
3926000	3936000	There's a part of me that's actually more hoping that they you know that this guy put that out as a feeler to see what the reaction would be even though I know it's probably just some stupid comment.
3936000	3946000	But still they got a pretty firm response from the community so hopefully this would be enough that they go OK well let's not do this or at least not do it yet.
3947000	3953000	I don't think it's anything like that but there's also another rumor and I really don't like reporting rumors because we don't know.
3954000	3960000	Like I said I there's a whole obvious online thing I'm just waiting for Microsoft to come out and say something because until then it's that's what it is it's a rumor.
3960000	3966000	Obviously it's a rumor we keep hearing a lot of and I don't know if it could be just the whole you know telephone thing where it just keeps getting repeated.
3967000	3979000	But now there's also a rumor that's saying that the console is going to be about five hundred bucks or three hundred dollars subsidized with that plan they have like right now where you pay you know so much a month because you're getting Xbox Live Gold tied in there as well.
3980000	3983000	And you pay over the life of the console or a couple of years or something like that.
3984000	3989000	I mean I seriously think if they do this with online only it's like fucking PS3 all over again.
3990000	3996000	Four hundred ninety nine dollars and you know oh by the way it's always online.
3997000	4008000	The subsidy rumor about it only costing three hundred dollars giving getting some steam this week which is so that was in our list list at the end of the year last year like what horrible gaming rumors going to come true or something like that.
4009000	4010000	We called it.
4012000	4016000	Maybe we predict the futures dark Tetsuya and chat says twenty dollar games.
4017000	4019000	L.O.L. I'm never going to have my iPad says hi.
4020000	4029000	I mean I'm actually was thinking more if they made like a subscription service you know you have there it's always online you get Xbox Live and then they do like a steam model.
4030000	4032000	Again but even so that doesn't seem likely.
4033000	4036000	What's the pro to offset the con that if I'm offline for three minutes.
4036000	4043000	Yeah I guess it is. Well because steam you know if I'm online and I get booted offline I don't disconnect from everything.
4044000	4051000	And the other thing too is steam games are usually pretty cheap like Borderlands plus all the DLC for twenty five bucks.
4052000	4057000	That's kind of hard to compete against sixty dollar games and so I know a Borderlands has come down in price a little bit.
4057000	4066000	But still though like Bioshock one and two for four dollars. I don't see that you know I'm not getting two copies of you know two Xbox 360 games for four dollars.
4067000	4072000	Well on the same token you remember how you know origin is such a fuck up right now.
4073000	4075000	Well it has always been such a fuck up if not just right now.
4076000	4081000	Well I mean don't they require that like for now most the origin games you have to be online for those to work too.
4082000	4089000	I don't know because the only thing I will play on origin is a game that requires you that has is a game that is meant to be played online.
4090000	4092000	So I am online Mass Effect 3 multiplayer that's all I use origin for.
4093000	4101000	Well you remember when they did what was it patch four for Mass Effect 3 and it totally screwed up all my online stuff wouldn't let me verify my DLC and I couldn't play single player.
4102000	4105000	Yeah it's ridiculous. Origin's terrible but to be fair steam was terrible.
4105000	4113000	And if this console is always online I'm just telling you right now it's all more reason for people to hack the shit out of it.
4114000	4124000	Because if it's something that the vocal minority doesn't like it's going to become a fucking target and you better believe that they will find a way to do it.
4125000	4135000	Alright let me, I don't want to keep dragging this out especially because it's basically a rumor but this is a comment worth responding to so this will be the last thing on this topic and then we'll move on.
4136000	4146000	BlackWolfInChat says here's the problem the internet is a small portion of their target audience so the internet doesn't like the Xbox everyone else will get it anyway not caring.
4146000	4160000	In theory you're right Bobby but the problem is that vocal minority starts that whole word of mouth and it's all about who they tell other people about you know when people are considering buying a game console.
4161000	4172000	Do you know how many people have come to me and said Rob what game console should I get what should I buy and you know a lot of those vocal minority are people that work for GameStop and other retailers.
4172000	4183000	And unless Microsoft's going to really sweeten the pot which might it might be a deal they're willing to sign to try and get those things to move GameStop has already come out and said we don't like this idea.
4184000	4193000	So that's really you know that's really bad now you might come out and say well a lot of hardcore gamers didn't like the Wii either and look at how well that did but there was a big difference.
4193000	4210000	People with the Wii were like yeah kids will like the Wii oh yeah the Wii is something different oh yeah I know you you're not looking for anything too hard you're a soccer mom you'll love the Wii go get it you know it was a different type of situation nobody outright hated what the Wii was doing.
4211000	4220000	Or what about when you get these stories let's just assume that this is going to be like every other online only or online required thing to come out.
4221000	4228000	That oh hey I just paid $500 for my new system and I can't fucking play any games on it because their servers are down and wait till that hits mainstream news.
4229000	4238000	I know it may not hit it right away but it's going to get some attention if you know it's anti-consumer where oh by the way it locks down all this stuff they have this technology in place.
4238000	4251000	You're not going to have retailers caring about it because first of all they'll make anything off the consoles anyways if this is a retailer that you know makes money off of used games they're probably not going to want to support a console that doesn't make any sort of you know money back for them.
4252000	4253000	So I don't know.
4255000	4258000	Did we not put the EA story in tonight's show roll?
4259000	4261000	I don't know but yeah EA's full of shit.
4262000	4263000	What the fuck.
4264000	4270000	Loki can you I hate to put you on the spot but I know you have another story but can you jump in here with the EA and what's going on there because you've been following that whole thing.
4271000	4272000	Why is it not on the show roll?
4273000	4274000	I don't know.
4275000	4276000	What a terrible producer this show has.
4277000	4278000	Yeah I wonder who that is Rob.
4279000	4280000	That's it we're docking your pay.
4281000	4282000	Rob coffee.
4283000	4288000	So I just it's like it's almost like the next logical step here is to talk about that story I can't believe.
4289000	4290000	So let's talk about EA.
4291000	4298000	So speaking of people I radio speaking to people that have no idea and you know we're talking about you know the vocal minority again.
4299000	4315000	And this is where we're quoting it from it's basically a mobile Nick Earl the senior vice president of EA's mobile and social all played label basically saying that the people that are responding to the microtransactions in real racing three are the vocal minority.
4315000	4321000	Ultimately the numbers would show that they and other are others all support the freemium model better.
4322000	4325000	And basically you know saying that people were.
4326000	4337000	I guess annoyed at the fact that you know the all all you can eat model or they're saying that the game you know the DLC in it I want to say it was like what 200 and some dollars of DLC in that game.
4339000	4342000	But once again I think kind of goes back to the fact that.
4345000	4351000	You have this model where people are hating on it but there's people still buying that crap can we talk about that.
4352000	4353000	I want to talk about the Peter Moore consumerist.
4354000	4356000	Oh yes and I want to talk about I'm getting there.
4357000	4371000	So yeah yeah yeah this guy what he said but then like OK then the real bomb was dropped later so let's let's get it's OK because you know every year they do this thing on this Web site the consumerist where they vote for the worst company in America.
4372000	4374000	Basically they have the golden poo that they send out to them.
4375000	4381000	Like whose line is it anyway. It doesn't matter. The points don't matter. It's just it's a popularity or anti popularity contest or whatever.
4382000	4387000	And last year I took the prize because of Mass Effect or something like that.
4388000	4393000	And this year they're in. Well now Loki if you read what the consumers had to say it was a lot more than just Mass Effect.
4393000	4401000	E.A. gets blamed for microtransactions for inventing that model for the online pass and inventing that model for getting games rushed.
4402000	4413000	Blah blah blah. I'm very angry and I'm on the Internet. Yes. So basically you know they they're in the finals or they are pretty close to being in the finals.
4413000	4425000	And you know they come out and Peter Moore comes out and basically saying hey we can do better. And some of the bullshit though.
4426000	4433000	I mean I love this quote. The tallest trees catch the most wind. Yes we're hating on you because you're such a big company. That's it.
4433000	4439000	The tallest trees break the most wind. Some. There's something that must be the biggest asses.
4440000	4447000	Some of these complaints are 100 percent legitimate like all companies. We are not perfect but in others just don't hold water.
4448000	4456000	Many continue to claim that the always on function in Sim City is a DRM scheme. It's not. People still want to argue about it. We can't be any clearer.
4456000	4467000	It's not period. I agree. It's not. I don't think it was ever about the DRM. It was about microtransactions and making sure that you wouldn't be able to hack them into the game.
4468000	4475000	That's what it's about is the microtransaction model. It's not about the DR. That doesn't make it any less shitty.
4476000	4486000	It doesn't matter why. You know it's broken. It's just it's broken. Some people claim that there's no room for origin as a competitor to seem 45 million registered users are proving that wrong.
4487000	4498000	By the way you have to fucking sign up on it to play console games that are by EA PC games that are by EA. Yeah. Oh how many satisfied customers out of that 45 million.
4498000	4506000	I dare you pull each and every single one of them. How are you satisfied with this service. I dare you.
4507000	4514000	Well I really just hate EA's customer service. OK. I got one good person the entire time I had that whole issue with my Mass Effect 3.
4515000	4521000	Well the majority of its outsourced. Exactly. Exactly. I hate to say it but that's you know I mean that's actually a bigger problem than just in the video game industry.
4521000	4538000	You get what you pay for. Exactly. That's true in any industry. However I completely forgot what I was going to say. So you were going to say some people think that the free to play games and microtransactions are the pox on the box on gaming tens of millions more are playing and loving these games.
4539000	4558000	Whatever. OK. I'll give them that because that's a valid point. That's a valid point because you know they have the stuff that you and I don't like it. Don't fucking play it. Stop spending money on it. But people are so because it would be a different story if they were putting out you know stuff that you could get games that were like I guess.
4558000	4572000	But when you've got titles that many people have gotten pretty much hooked on then yeah they do pretty much have a captive audience. People want to get more of it. It's I mean it's kind of a catch 22 you either do without it and do without their service.
4573000	4600000	OK. So Black Wolf in chat says I'm satisfied. Great. One person out of forty five million is that Bobby. How do we. And I'm just throwing out ideas here and and he'll tell me to shut up if he doesn't like this. But how can we do something on vogue where like I can have a poll like an insta poll like a live listener poll so I can go up and say are you using origin and are you satisfied and we can like poll people live all the shows going on. Is that like possible because I we I want that for next week.
4601000	4614000	This is what I have to say about. Please Bobby. This is what I have to say about origin story about their you know going oh so many people are using it. Well they did prove a myth busters that you could polish a turd doesn't make it less of a turd.
4615000	4633000	One thing that I want to say about the free to play games and microtransactions. Listen it's a free to play game. You're paying nothing for the game. And so paying microtransactions for something or say buying in-game items you know spending like five bucks or something on in-game items isn't that big a deal because you paid nothing for the game.
4633000	4642000	The problem comes into when you have a $60 fucking game and then you're still wanting these microtransactions fee to pay is basically fee to pay. I love it.
4642000	4644000	Fee to pay.
4646000	4659000	Oh Bobby. Bobby says it has been designed just not developed and maybe next week and I Bobby works very hard on coding vog network.com and he doesn't get paid anything for it. So thank you Bobby I appreciate it gets paid in love.
4660000	4666000	I appreciate your consideration and I will I will withhold my feelings on SimCity for five more minutes out of thank you.
4667000	4669000	Bobby gets paid in love snark and spite.
4669000	4680000	See we've seen we've seen mailing lists that direct people to vote for EA because they disagree with the choice of the cover athlete on Madden NFL.
4680000	4692000	Yes really. OK we'll find sports fans are crazy. In the past year we've received thousands of e-mails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games.
4692000	4704000	This week we're seeing posts on conservative websites urging people to protest LGBT policy by voting EA for the worst company in America. OK I give them props for promoting that community and stuff like that.
4704000	4721000	And yeah there are assholes out there. But at the same time I don't think it's the majority of those votes you're getting because of because of that. It's because you know it's this weird kind of like you know I I love that this letter is very staunch like
4721000	4734000	if that's why you're voting as the worst company in America then fucking bring it because you're full it you're full of it. So I love that kind of tone because you know clap clap clap I wish all you know people could could get that.
4735000	4749000	But anyway I it's weird to me that he calls that out because then I go all right I'm really appreciative that you're supportive of all that but let's not use it as a weapon when things aren't going your way.
4750000	4756000	Just it. It does kind of you know I appreciate your stance but now's not the time.
4757000	4766000	Yeah. And then the quote for last he says last year the complaints against us last year were our support of SOPA and that they didn't like the ending the Mass Effect 3 and this is back.
4767000	4787000	This is the response on consumerist. They say actually aren't our analysis of the reasons for EA's inclusion in last year's finale make no mention of Mass Effect 3 or soap and said it looks like the EA's history of buying smaller successful developers with the intention of milking and arguably ruining intellectual properties that made these acquired companies so attractive.
4788000	4795000	It also discusses EA's exclusivity deals on popular sports games as some say are effectively set the bar for retail prices for the rest of the gaming industry.
4796000	4809000	And I'd like to mention in there too especially you know as a factor of this year maybe there's their idea that hey we're releasing a game or I'm sorry not really the game putting out a game on the Wii for example FIFA 13.
4810000	4821000	And basically just taking FIFA 12 and reskinning say FIFA 13 and updating the rosters maybe not a good thing helping them you know with their argument that you know the quality in those games.
4822000	4829000	Oh and that was also in the Vita and the Wii U version by the way they ported the FIFA 12 game is Peter Moore the next CEO of EA.
4830000	4834000	Yes he is. He's the CEO. Oh he's not the CEO.
4835000	4839000	No wait a minute they replaced what's the fuck with somebody else with the former CEO.
4840000	4850000	But I'm just like when I read that letter I'm like this guy is talking like he's the new CEO. Look I appreciate it despite the fact that we're we're we're you know flaming this whole thing a little bit.
4850000	4861000	I do appreciate some of the frankness of this and I appreciate the fact that at least they're trying and not just kind of like la la la we can't hear you la la la you're still buying our stuff anyway screw you.
4862000	4868000	I appreciate that he's trying to respond to some of this in a very direct manner and I do applaud that.
4869000	4876000	My only problem is is I'm like it kind of really really shows really shows where some of the blindness is I believe.
4876000	4883000	But anyway but once again though they're only going to go in a direction in their business that makes them money. And if you know my.
