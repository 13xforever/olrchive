00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:24,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 7th, 2013, one landmark game studio is shut down, Donkey Kong Country Returns will get a little easier, and one series of tweets rocks the gaming world.

2
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:37,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:45,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 499, April the 7th, 2013.

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,162
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games and gaming news and gaming lols and so forth with my co-host.

5
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and salivations.

7
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,423
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

8
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:58,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm full.

9
00:00:58,823 --> 00:00:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: You're full?

10
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:00,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm full!

11
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:01,766
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that commercial?

12
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:04,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Full of useless knowledge and gas.

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,070
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

14
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, again, you're confusing me for your car.

15
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,116
[SPEAKER_05]: My car has useless knowledge?

16
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:12,477
[SPEAKER_01]: No, your car's full of gas.

17
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Not right now, it ain't.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with prices.

19
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:21,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I did my customary stop by Panda, and I have eaten a panda.

20
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:23,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you shouldn't eat pandas.

21
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:26,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a species going extinct.

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you think of panda bears, orange chicken is so representative of Chinese culture.

23
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

24
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: If I go to China and order orange chicken, I wonder what kind of stares I'm going to get.

25
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen real Chinese food.

26
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think orange chicken is among real Chinese food.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you the story about my ex and my ex's family when it got really awkward one night, right?

28
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:50,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wait, I'll tell this in a minute.

29
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:51,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, tell it in a minute.

30
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,207
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, Tech Master Loki.

31
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:53,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you doing, Loki?

33
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:55,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

34
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:57,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you ready to hear awkward stories about my ex?

35
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go.

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

37
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So my ex was Chinese, right?

38
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the ex I'm thinking of?

39
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That area, right?

40
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:21,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So the deal was we were going to go to Chinese food for dinner.

41
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:22,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all very out there.

42
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,395
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all from Hong Kong, born and raised.

43
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he moved here when he was 10 and so forth.

44
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went and they had already ordered by the time we got there.

45
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:30,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we got there a little late or something.

46
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the table is all this food.

47
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it is very seafood.

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot of dishes I haven't really had before.

49
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:41,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a fish on the plate with all the meat picked off and the bones.

50
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,465
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, all right, I'm going to...

51
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:44,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be cultured.

52
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just have a little bit.

53
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:48,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm putting just like a little bit of everything.

54
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I just pick a little bit of everything and put it on my plate.

55
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because I think it's gross.

56
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to try it, make sure I like it before I put a whole scoop.

57
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And so his sister looks over at me and kind of has this epiphany.

58
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You see this moment of like, oh no.

59
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:04,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And looks at me and goes, oh, I'm so sorry.

60
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:06,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's racist.

62
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:13,583
[SPEAKER_05]: In a weird way.

63
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?

64
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she's trying to be considerate, I suppose.

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but it's like, I'm trying to just sample, and we didn't order anything.

66
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:28,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate, there was something there that I really liked, and I had a whole heaping of it.

67
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:28,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.

68
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:33,100
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I have no... If it's good enough for my ex, it was good enough for me, okay?

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:47,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I was little in Alabama, I would go over to my friend Dom Noy's house, and her family's from Laos, and I have actually easier time eating Laotian food than actual real Chinese food, because I really can't recognize much of anything I'm eating.

70
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for it.

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I love food.

72
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Food is a great gateway to different cultures around the world.

73
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:58,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say, though, probably the only culture's food I'm never having again is Filipino.

74
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:58,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

75
00:03:59,194 --> 00:03:59,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

76
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,635
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob, I thought balut was your favorite.

77
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:02,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

78
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:04,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

79
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:06,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those dishes, nope.

80
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:07,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Balut, Rob.

81
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, but if you like it, more power to you.

82
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of virgin boy eggs?

83
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:29,504
[SPEAKER_05]: have virgin boy eggs no they are eggs that have been marinated in the pee of young children so how about we move on let's talk about video games shall we

84
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was pretty much it.

85
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of hung around.

86
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

87
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:33,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

88
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you eat a lot of Easter candy?

89
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at Target the other day and it's all on sale, half off.

90
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:05,872
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

91
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't eat any.

92
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one of those hollow rabbits and I haven't touched it.

93
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:12,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't care.

94
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:17,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard there was some candy company suing another over those hollow rabbits or something.

95
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably grossly simplifying it.

96
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, we should probably get to gaming news.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,761
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you all signed up for.

98
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:29,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to say hello and how you doing to everybody in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

99
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:37,234
[SPEAKER_05]: The other ever-present fourth guest on our show because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:42,018
[SPEAKER_05]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,242
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:06,568
[SPEAKER_05]: AlanAlchemy in chat says, I imagine Nelly isn't really that about the pure sugar toddler crash and meltdown.

104
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she's fine without that in her life.

105
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,509
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a lot of sugar yesterday.

106
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,630
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over to her parents' house because they had a family over.

107
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,531
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people haven't seen him yet.

108
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,572
[SPEAKER_04]: He had some cake and stuff, and there's a lot of sugar in that.

109
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: He was jumping off the walls yesterday.

110
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:24,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to be four?

111
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:25,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?

112
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:25,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

113
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:26,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Three.

114
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:27,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?

115
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:27,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

116
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Have the terrible twos been that terrible?

117
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:36,516
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been pretty... Yeah, it's not necessarily terrible, but it's just they start testing their limits.

118
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:44,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw in chat saying, holy crap, episode 499, the pressure is really high to make episode 500 the most memorable.

119
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't set the bar too high, you guys.

120
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,772
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all about DDR.

121
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:49,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put it too high.

122
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:50,774
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bar.

123
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,175
[SPEAKER_05]: There comes a point.

124
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean the bar we limbo under?

125
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:57,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let y'all in on a podcasting secret, all right?

126
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:02,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So this goes out to all the other podcasters out there and everybody that wants to know what it's like to do a podcast.

127
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:08,663
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so you celebrate one year, you celebrate 100 episodes, you celebrate two years, you celebrate three years, 200, 300.

128
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there comes a point where you're just sick of celebrating.

129
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:13,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like birthdays.

130
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Like after your 21st birthday, you're like, what do I have left to celebrate?

131
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,125
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that my car insurance went down?

132
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you realize I take an entire week off for my birthday?

133
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:37,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're not the best example I am not the best example However, I have gotten the confirmation from my BFF That we will be having red velvet brownies God, Becky, I love you I am buying the red food coloring because she will not

134
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:39,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

135
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like, I don't know.

136
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it that whole it's not safe thing?

137
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea, but she never has a reason for it.

138
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,550
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found out that the recipe calls for two whole ounces.

139
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I appreciate anyone willing to put their morals aside.

140
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to the baking store to buy like a gallon jug.

141
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you need to use virgin blood.

142
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:00,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just virgin boy eggs.

143
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I tell you the story about my friend Diane making a red velvet cake?

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,121
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but here we go with food again.

145
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,481
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get to games at some point, right?

146
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:08,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get to games.

147
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:08,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

148
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:21,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so she was living in northern Alabama at the time and making a red velvet cake and the Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door and she had just gotten done cutting the cake with a butcher knife while listening to tubular bells so she opened the door with a WHAT?!

149
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,590
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same person, by the way, who joined our WoW guild.

150
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fantastic.

151
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:28,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Gwen.

152
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:29,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love Gwen.

153
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:29,972
[SPEAKER_01]: She was nice.

154
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she told you all the embarrassing stories about me in college, too.

155
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:40,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is always, whenever I think of Red Velvet, I always think of the expression on her face when she told that story.

156
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:40,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It was priceless.

157
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:48,398
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's a good transition comment in our chat room from CriticalMyth, live.vognetwork.com, saying, This is foreshadowing, isn't it?

158
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: After 500, it's all about food and the video games they play while eating that food.

159
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's been about.

160
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have you been?

161
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish to remind everyone, and I've told this story a billion times on the show, but how was OLR born?

162
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Jamie, Matt, and I all used to play DDR all night, and then what did we do?

163
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:14,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We went right over to the cafe in the parking lot and shoved our faces full of, what, tortilla soup and mozzarella sticks.

164
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:17,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And Matt with his glass of, not this one, you remember Tall Matt?

165
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

166
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,499
[SPEAKER_01]: With his glass of Merlot.

167
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Tall Matt.

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,220
[SPEAKER_01]: With his glass of Merlot.

169
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a glass of Merlot.

170
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:23,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Merlot?

171
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:24,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Merlot?

172
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:25,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Merlot?

173
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Like suddenly he's French.

174
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:28,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

175
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how Dan goes, Merlet.

176
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:36,707
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw on chat says, for episode 500, are you guys taking voicemails with messages for congratulating you guys?

177
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:39,028
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really sweet, but no.

178
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:40,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have something else planned.

179
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:41,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk about that later.

180
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:42,950
[SPEAKER_01]: But my ego, Rob.

181
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,970
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

182
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

183
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send a message congratulating Jamie.

184
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, send me a message and send me money with it.

185
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:49,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

186
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm just saying, after so many episodes, you have to mix it up a little bit.

187
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:53,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

188
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into gaming.

189
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:58,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is a show about video games, believe it or not.

190
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I play more games, Rob.

191
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: You play more games?

192
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll get into Gaming Week, but we have to do the pre-Gaming Week banter.

193
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:04,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

194
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:32,729
[SPEAKER_05]: and since we were off last week this week's pre-week or pre-gaming week banter will consist of last week's news set to holic it's a new segment last week yes it's a new segment we're debuting on OLR tonight it's called last week's news set to holic and in this segment we will recap last week's news set to holic so here we go last week's news

195
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:41,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week in gaming news, the Phantom Pain was revealed to be Metal Gear Solid V. What?

196
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,801
[SPEAKER_05]: To no one's surprise.

197
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:51,645
[SPEAKER_05]: David Hayter apparently wasn't asked to be a Metal Gear Solid V, but it's very interesting because he signed his letter about why he's not in it April 1st.

198
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, so to be continued on that.

199
00:10:54,756 --> 00:11:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really thought it was strange that they went with Bobcat Goldwage, you know, to do the voice, but hey, I trust them.

200
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:01,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you hear Bobcat?

201
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they got Gilbert Gottfried.

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,922
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Sony PlayStation 4 Game Developers Conference, more information about friends, system sharing, and the unit or interface.

203
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:17,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing too earth-shattering, I thought, except the whole, you have your PlayStation name and your real name, but the real name comes off of Facebook.

204
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:18,205
Ha ha.

205
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that like YouTube where they're trying to get me to use my real name?

206
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:21,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no.

207
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:23,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, let's tell you more about this.

208
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

209
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,992
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no option not to do that.

210
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:30,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Miyamoto teased that a Nintendo theme park could be a possibility.

211
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, a lot of things could be a possibility.

212
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be called Nintendo Land?

213
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom wants to work with WayForward again.

214
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:41,308
[SPEAKER_05]: but probably that'll only happen if DuckTales actually sells a lot of copies.

215
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:46,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of DuckTales Remastered, it was announced that DuckTales Remastered is in consideration for the PC.

216
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

217
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:55,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, on Kickstarter, Big Blue from the Echo the Dolphin team trying a Kickstarter there for something new.

218
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:57,715
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, last week's news.

219
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,336
[SPEAKER_04]: That Kickstarter is a little too tree-hugger for me, though.

220
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:31,677
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to worry about the planet and all this stuff and we just we're not necessarily making a game now listen if I wanted a game that was like Echo the Dolphin but not Echo the Dolphin I would here's the next evolution in the game and it's already been made this is the best part about it it's called Laser Dolphin yes Laser Dolphin does exist and it's Echo the Dolphin with a giant fucking laser in your head and that's seriously what it is and they have turtles with goddamn dynamite stuck to them and stuff it's Laser Dolphin that sounds like my kind of game Laser Dolphin

221
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,357
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

222
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:06,873
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to start with Mass Effect because I played Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I've been busy modding.

223
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:11,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually also using Mass Effect 3 for art references.

224
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:14,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you saw the crap I've been posting.

225
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:24,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I played, I finally, finally bought the game that we talked about on our British Friends podcast that we guested on last week.

226
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded Drunken Robot Pornography.

227
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the greatest game in the universe.

228
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It seriously, it's like, okay, you know...

229
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a quote for the back of the box.

230
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:38,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you know my overwhelming love for jumping flash?

231
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like jumping flash with guns.

232
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:48,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, you know, shooting carrots at things, but like actual pew-pew die lasers.

233
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:56,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you have to do is you get these, like, ginormous big robots, but you have to get a number of points before the robot will appear.

234
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,191
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called titans.

235
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:18,038
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have these long appendages and they shoot lasers everywhere and other shit tries to kill you and it's really fucking hard so I finally beat the second stage after a week of trying and I did it while live streaming so I didn't totally embarrass myself okay I was like okay I quit I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm not playing the game I'm not gonna do it live again until I'm sure I can beat the third level

236
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:37,065
[SPEAKER_01]: and then um I uh I got something else oh I finally went ahead and downloaded Gratuitous Space Battles but I haven't played it yet I just like the name and uh I'm thinking I'm still thinking about getting Hotline Miami just because all the blood and shooting shit that's really fun good times I played WoW

237
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:38,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

238
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you log in the other night.

239
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:40,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, I'm paying for it.

240
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,268
[SPEAKER_01]: May as well play it.

241
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

242
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still debating quitting it.

243
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:51,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I might wait for another MMO that I am not supposed to let any indication out that I've actually seen it in motion.

244
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:58,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for that to come out before I reserve my judgment and see if I actually jump off the WoW bandwagon.

245
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,701
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:31,043
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I found though when I was, okay, I got a whole, we went to Dan's mom's house where most of the vault is in storage and I was tearing things up looking for my light box which I could not find.

247
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:38,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a bag full of my art supplies but when I opened it to go through it when I got home, I found a demo disc for a Magic the Gathering card game.

248
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:40,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the old school one on PC?

249
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:44,050
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school one, the demos that we got at E3 that first year.

250
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was, oh no, that's not as old school.

251
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,472
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one I bought at Software Etc.

252
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: back in like 97 or 98.

253
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:49,653
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was bomb.

254
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:56,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It came with the giant card from the Astral Deck or whatever.

255
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:57,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what else I found in there?

256
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, speaking of magic, I found my Japanese Legends.

257
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:06,514
[SPEAKER_01]: The only set of my magic cards that I never sold off.

258
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,176
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, you might be a nerd.

259
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:12,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

260
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really it.

261
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Then let's go to Loki.

262
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

263
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:18,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Dingo Games

264
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, free download or you can buy it for $20.

265
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:38,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But please don't buy it for $20.

266
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really a waste of $20.

267
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

268
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:46,904
[SPEAKER_04]: This week I didn't play any Bioshock Infinite because I was playing other things.

269
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I did end up playing quite a bit of Saints Row the Third, just trying to kind of 100% everything on the PC.

270
00:16:54,388 --> 00:17:01,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't know why because it's like I sort of did that or I almost did that on the 360, but then I got...

271
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:02,972
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

272
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,559
[SPEAKER_04]: The last mission is kind of cool, but it's just so quick.

273
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,861
[SPEAKER_04]: The first mission, you're searching for this clone of Johnny Gat, who's actually this brute.

274
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it just goes by so fast.

275
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically one of those, oh, someone's driving the car.

276
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,304
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to fire the rockets out of the back.

277
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

278
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that in a bunch of other missions already.

279
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:47,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the second mission, you have a cross-dressing guy who's singing some Aisha songs.

280
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to fire this B-gun at people.

281
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:56,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is cool, I like the B-Gun, but that's the only mission you get it in.

282
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't unlock it for playing the rest of the game.

283
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:03,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing you get that weapon in, and it's stupid.

284
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:06,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last mission is kind of cool, where you have the superhero powers.

285
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of almost like a preview of 4.

286
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:12,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't there a lot of video games where there might be a special stage, and you're like, why can't the whole game just be this?

287
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row The Four

288
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:38,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row 4 I think we should call it Saints Row the 4th why not?

289
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:54,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row 4 and I'm just so cautious about it because they're like oh yeah we have this big DLC plan well all your DLC has sucked it's really sucked like $7 for 30 minutes of gameplay is really crappy I mean that is just absolutely terrible

290
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:56,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually worse than movies.

291
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't go to a theater and watch a movie for seven bucks anymore.

292
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:02,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a matinee.

293
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say matinees are $5.50.

294
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't really count that, though, because you have to buy popcorn.

295
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Popcorn counts.

296
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:09,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have popcorn.

297
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't watch a movie without popcorn.

298
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:37,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay, anyway, so, I've been playing some of that, and, you know, here's the other thing, I got really frustrated with one of the missions, because I couldn't, um, the lag or whatever from, like, rain and stuff was causing, my rockets weren't firing fast enough, so, thankfully, since I'm playing on the PC version, I can mod the weapons one there, up to my liking, so I made my rocket launcher fire a lot faster, and lock on a lot faster, so, it's now acceptable for my use.

299
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see what else.

300
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:46,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played a little bit of, um, very little bit of Defiance.

301
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:54,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent most of the time doing the typical MMO launch stuff, whereas installing the game and then...

302
00:19:54,915 --> 00:20:12,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Updating the game and then I connected to the servers and played for about 30 minutes going through the tutorial portion of the game which is fucking boring and the game itself is not very exciting right now either but I mean I am in the tutorial section of the game so I don't expect it to be that exciting but like I

303
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed the enemies respawning almost instantly.

304
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I shoot a guy and pops up another one.

305
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, that's a little weird.

306
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But sure, okay, we'll go.

307
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That happens in a lot of MMOs when they're first out, though, and the newbie areas are really camped.

308
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strange.

309
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:39,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing I do like about it, though, is it's not necessarily a game that's just all stat-based, like Final Fantasy or I'm sure WoW to a certain extent.

310
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:50,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually, it will help you if you have first person shooter skills because you're actually aiming your weapon and firing and doing all the dodging and stuff like that.

311
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:53,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a third person shooter but you have an MMO.

312
00:20:55,376 --> 00:21:08,884
[SPEAKER_04]: However, because it is just launched and like anything that's online and especially with MMOs, the servers were a little spotty and so I got kicked off the server about 30 minutes in and then I couldn't connect to it again.

313
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really tried.

314
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:15,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to play this weekend, but I forgot my hard drive that I installed the game to at my work.

315
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was unable to play it last night and today.

316
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:23,009
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm hopefully going to get into it a little bit more this week.

317
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I picked up Borderlands 2 on PC because it was $25 for the Borderlands 2 and the Season Pass.

318
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:34,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm probably going to start that again on PC, even though I've beaten it twice on the 360.

319
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:37,215
[SPEAKER_01]: They've upped the level cap, didn't they?

320
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:41,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it just makes everything... It doesn't really do anything.

321
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes the enemies harder.

322
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:43,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, have more life.

323
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:49,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, is Defiance a buy-once game or a monthly sub?

324
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:49,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy-once.

325
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:50,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

326
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:55,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's buy-once, and then you can play it for whatever.

327
00:21:55,298 --> 00:22:01,639
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing, too, is, I mean, if you're into... If you want to kind of help yourself out in the game, there's these shift... Not shift codes.

328
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:02,740
[SPEAKER_04]: There are these...

329
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:12,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that like a few weeks ago and so that helped me out quite a bit although I haven't gotten any of that stuff yet but it's gonna help me out so whenever I get to that

330
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:53,125
[SPEAKER_04]: but the game they say it's sort of like um sort of like Borderlands I guess you know because the way it plays and it's sure a ripoff I mean at the beginning it seemed like such a ripoff of Borderlands like you start off and you're this arc hunter instead of a vault hunter and you know um there's this

331
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:58,808
[SPEAKER_04]: AI person that only you can see that's helping you out.

332
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Your imaginary friend.

333
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:03,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, this is totally Halo and fucking Borderlands.

334
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,931
[SPEAKER_04]: They just completely ripped the plots out of there.

335
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, and I don't know if this ties into those whole microtransactions for things.

336
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:17,600
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters that you can create, their character creator or whatever, where you can tweak the appearance and everything, sucks.

337
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks all like this really ugly, old-ass person.

338
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:28,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking that you can buy better facial features or something like that later on.

339
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:30,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy a better face.

340
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:31,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, just like real life.

341
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, because it's like I couldn't get anything that looked interesting.

342
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:40,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It just all looked like this grisly dude.

343
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, okay, here's the three different face types.

344
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, okay, those are all crap.

345
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:48,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like different layers of, you know, crap.

346
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:53,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever, you know, I'm actually looking at the dude's face, you know, while I'm playing the game anyways.

347
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

348
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:55,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

349
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be something I'm interested in.

350
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:01,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just hoping more people I know are actually playing it because right now it kind of sucks just playing the game by yourself.

351
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Extra First Partner's playing it.

352
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,696
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only other person I know that's playing it.

353
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

354
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:07,418
[SPEAKER_05]: He seems to like it, though.

355
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:09,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just willing to check it out.

356
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hopefully it'll drop in price and then people will be able to pick it up because we're going to have $60 on PC.

357
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of expensive.

358
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:17,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a game can be a shameless ripoff and still be fun.

359
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

360
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have high standards for it anyways, or a high bar set for it, because it's based off a sci-fi show.

361
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:25,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

362
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:25,796
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sci-fi.

363
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,179
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's expecting gold from sci-fi.

364
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:31,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sci-fi shows are like.

365
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:36,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it was as awesome as the sci-fi movies they do, like Sharktopus and stuff.

366
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,166
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool.

367
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:37,667
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way.

368
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't want to play an MMO like Sharktopus?

369
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just like a weird monster thing.

370
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I said yes!

371
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

372
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

373
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That one rules!

374
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:04,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It was six bucks at Dimple and I came really close to getting it for you.

375
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:16,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta say that the woman alien that they have in this show, and I understand that she's not supposed to be like this sex symbol or whatever in this thing.

376
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,098
[SPEAKER_04]: She is fucking ugly.

377
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, she is the ugliest weirdest looking alien thing ever.

378
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this dreadlocked man-woman thing.

379
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what it is.

380
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weird.

381
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,240
[SPEAKER_01]: She probably thinks humans look weird too.

382
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, I couldn't possibly watch this show and have to stare at this thing.

383
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:40,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I always love an excuse to play a clip from Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.

384
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:44,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit!

385
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:50,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to get this movie.

386
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:50,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Rob.

387
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,550
[SPEAKER_01]: The shark eats the plane!

388
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, we need to get that movie.

389
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have Battle Royale on Blu-ray now.

390
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:03,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do the really stupid violent movie...

391
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:04,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Birdemic 2.

392
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,775
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making a sequel to Birdemic.

393
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:07,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know Birdemic.

394
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:08,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Birdemic, shock and awe.

395
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:15,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this movie where this guy thought it was actually really good and their CG birds are like clip art birds.

396
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Like GIF birds that fucking flip.

397
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:24,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy literally thinks that his movie is so fucking fantastic and he wanted a sequel and he did the birds exactly the same way.

398
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:25,251
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just shit.

399
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolute shit.

400
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,494
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the station needs, you know?

401
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a shitty movie podcast.

402
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:33,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, you should bring that up.

403
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:38,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do a joke and it's gone.

404
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:39,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

405
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything else for your gaming week?

406
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:42,817
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's it.

407
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,219
[SPEAKER_04]: My son played Angry Birds.

408
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slippery slope.

409
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:48,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it his first game?

410
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:50,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he sort of figured.

411
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he had it a little bit.

412
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a video of him trying it out because his cousins were there.

413
00:26:56,507 --> 00:27:00,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they were showing them on their iPads.

414
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started doing it okay.

415
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he started launching them backwards.

416
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really know if he gets the game yet.

417
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a slippery slope, man.

418
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:11,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Those kids are so fucking into Angry Birds.

419
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:13,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that is just some scary cultist shit.

420
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:14,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Julian plays it too.

421
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it takes over their lives.

422
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:18,702
[SPEAKER_01]: He also has gotten pretty good at Pac-Man.

423
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:19,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

424
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:20,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Championship Edition or Old School?

425
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:27,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whatever the Flash version on that education site that he goes on is, but it's like a, it's Pac-Man.

426
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And which Angry Birds you say?

427
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he started off playing Angry Birds Seasons, but then he tried Angry Birds Star Wars.

428
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,156
[SPEAKER_04]: They had all of them, so, you know.

429
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:35,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, of course.

430
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in my day, you played Number Munchers and you liked it.

431
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:41,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh and Apple 2E

432
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

433
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:37,644
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of the stages it kind of changes the mechanic a little bit where you have left right up and down in it too and it is just like Space Channel 5 which was kind of awesome so Harmonite is kind of like a little bit of a platformy music thing meets Space Channel 5 and that's pretty cool to me

434
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of the 3D effects.

435
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:39,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good.

436
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:50,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made by the guys who make Pokemon, so that's kind of interesting that they have some stages that'll have the gym battle theme and some of that stuff, but that's kind of whatever.

437
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:55,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't super care about that stuff, but I know there's some people that get really excited about it.

438
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:56,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

439
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:00,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Harmonite for $15, not bad, and I love music games.

440
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:09,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of multiplayer mechanics or anything like that, so it is very much a single-player game, but I think $15 is an appropriate price for it.

441
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game I played is a free-to-play game on PlayStation 3.

442
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, PlayStation 3 has a handful of free-to-download stuff and play.

443
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:23,023
[SPEAKER_05]: DC Universe is one of them and that crappy Free Realms or whatever it's called.

444
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Jetpack Joyride Temple Run vs. Techno Kitten Adventure

445
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you do, and you go up and down.

446
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:58,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And you collect coins, you dodge these lasers and rockets and other things, and you use those coins to buy upgrades, which you get at a very slow pace, or you can spend real money and get them at a much faster pace.

447
00:29:59,025 --> 00:30:00,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the Temple Run mechanic.

448
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:06,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it was on the iOS and Android already, so yeah, that's why.

449
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:11,129
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics, very 16-bit retro-inspired, but I gotta admit...

450
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,791
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as that sounds like it all might be crap, the game is stupid addicting.

451
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:19,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it is just so stupid addicting.

452
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:24,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's addicting in that way that like classic video games are addicting.

453
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:27,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, think back to a game that was on the Atari 2600.

454
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:33,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it was just one gimmick, but you would sit there for hours trying to improve your score.

455
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of a game like, I don't know, Stampede, right?

456
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:39,543
[SPEAKER_05]: People would drop 40 bucks to get Stampede on the Atari 2600.

457
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:50,777
[SPEAKER_05]: and all it is is the little horse runs and you lasso up the other horses or the, I'm sorry, the cows or you run into the cows to kind of make them go further out in the field and that's the game.

458
00:30:50,937 --> 00:31:07,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole game and yet you would sit there and play it more and more and more and try to increase your score and that, like, I don't know, like, I sat there and played Jetpack Joyride for like an hour at least earlier today just to try and top the leaderboard which I did do on my friends list.

459
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

460
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:09,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

461
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I gotta say, it's free.

462
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:14,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

463
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:15,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got trophies.

464
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey, I can't really talk too bad about Jetpack Joyride.

465
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:28,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'd go spend a lot of money on it, but, you know, if somebody wanted to to get ahead, then more power to you.

466
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:29,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your money.

467
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Spend it on whatever you want.

468
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I thought there was one other game I wanted to talk about before I talk about a classic.

469
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:39,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess I'll talk about this other free to play game because Alan always teases me about it.

470
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:47,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's Guardian Cross, which is this, um, it's like a, it's, it's by Square Enix and it's a trading card game.

471
00:31:47,407 --> 00:32:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm making little quote fingers when I say that trading card game, because it is not like magic and it is not like even like Hearthstone or whatever other types of trading card games you can think of because all the battles are automatic.

472
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:30,356
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's all just about making your cards as powerful as possible but yet I can't stop hunting down the little animals and playing that game and turning them into cards and then combining the cards together and then the whole NPC story and it's Square Enix so all the artwork's really good and the music's good too and yeah so I've been suckered into that but like any it plays just like a freaking Facebook game and like any Facebook game I'll be really into it for like two weeks and then I'll be like what the fuck is this fuckery and then stop playing it.

473
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:33,052
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be the story of Guardian Cross.

474
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:33,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

475
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,463
[SPEAKER_05]: One other classic game I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy V, also on iOS now.

476
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:43,465
[SPEAKER_05]: A total remake.

477
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:56,614
[SPEAKER_05]: This is different because Final Fantasy I on iPad and II were based off the PSP version, III and IV off the DS version, but there has not been a Final Fantasy V remake save the Game Boy version, the Game Boy Advance version.

478
00:32:56,934 --> 00:33:02,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the version that this is closest to is because it has the extra dungeon and all that, but they've totally redone the sprites and

479
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:19,739
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that and it looks great like especially I have an iPad that has the retina display and it looks gorgeous the controls not bad they've changed it so that your characters move in eight directions but basically you put your thumb anywhere what is this eight directions that you speak of I know witchcraft

480
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,301
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only up, down, left, and right.

481
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

482
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But actually, it really helps the whole touch thing because you basically put your thumb anywhere on the screen and that's where the joystick is and then you move it and then we lift your thumb.

483
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:35,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a joystick anymore until you put your thumbs down again.

484
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:36,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's...

485
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: The controls actually work.

486
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:42,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And they went back and redid the battles so that the whole battle is by touch.

487
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:48,061
[SPEAKER_05]: My only bitch about that is that they should have made enough room for all the possible squares that can appear.

488
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:55,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, let's say you have a mage that has, like, you know, an ability and then white magic and black magic.

489
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:58,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, in Final Fantasy V you can learn one job and then...

490
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:00,032
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura can't count everybody.

491
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

492
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,593
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just going to all the wank.

493
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:30,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bet that they're going to do Final Fantasy VI in a style like this for the holiday.

494
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,944
[SPEAKER_05]: V is probably testing the waters a little bit.

495
00:34:33,164 --> 00:34:34,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little more expensive.

496
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:34,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $16.99.

497
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: It is iPad and iPhone universal.

498
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a universal app, which some of their older games weren't.

499
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:41,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy about that.

500
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:53,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love the battle system in V. I love the way that you can kind of mix and match the jobs because it really reminds me of when Final Fantasy went MMO in Final Fantasy XI.

501
00:34:55,285 --> 00:35:13,836
[SPEAKER_05]: which by the way had an expansion come out this last week and so of course Shane hits me up on the internet and says Rob you should come back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion I want to play a Geomancer and I want someone to play with Rob Rob you should come back you should come back and I'm like no I'm not coming back no no no finally we cut a deal I said all right

502
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:30,905
[SPEAKER_05]: if I'm going to do something I don't really want to do and you're going to do something you really don't want to do I will come back to Final Fantasy XI for one month if you buy Civilization V next time it's on sale and he said deal and then he even went and played the demo for Civ V and he's like oh it's not that bad it is kind of like SimCity I'm like I told you

503
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:58,136
[SPEAKER_05]: but anyway so my part of the deal was to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little while so I have been playing that with the I didn't buy the expansion though Shane has it and so I've been playing with him a little bit and I've looked at his Geomancer and Runefencer and I'm like alright cool new jobs but otherwise I've been leveling my Corsair and she's level 37 now it was double XP weekend this weekend and we were fighting mobs and dungeons duoing and leveling up

504
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that part's really fun.

505
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: The job system in Final Fantasy XI is insanely fun.

506
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the classes are really good.

507
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:11,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the fact that there's so many mix and match that is really viable in Final Fantasy XI.

508
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:17,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it used to have to be like, oh no, you don't play a Corsair without a Ranger sub.

509
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, you don't do it.

510
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:19,391
[SPEAKER_05]: You're an idiot.

511
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,852
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't do a Corsair with Ranger sub, that's how you have to do it.

512
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's like, okay, you can kind of actually do Corsair Dancer makes a lot of sense.

513
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:26,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Corsair Black Mage, Corsair Red Mage.

514
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:31,377
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of different possibilities, and so that I really enjoy.

515
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think the game is missing so many quality of life things that make other MMOs more enjoyable, such as World of Warcraft, which you all know I play a lot, or even other MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and things like that.

516
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it has to do with travel, and the battle system is still kind of slow, especially when you're soloing and duoing.

517
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:52,435
[SPEAKER_05]: No jokes.

518
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:55,058
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes me two minutes to take out a mob by myself at level 37.

519
00:36:55,158 --> 00:37:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it doesn't sound like a long time, but it's slow when you have to kill six of them in order to get one bag of experience, basically.

520
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:06,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Is being a white mage still hell on earth?

521
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no.

522
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:12,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's just the way people level at the earlier levels is so different now.

523
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:18,535
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in a party with 18 people and it's just like, alright, as long as you're carrying somebody, people are fine.

524
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:21,316
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like hardly any tanks in those parties.

525
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they still have the text macro system?

526
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:26,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's all.

527
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:35,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That really got on my nerves after a while just because I'd have all my text macro set up before casting and no, we're not gonna come and get healed and buffed and blah blah.

528
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:36,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, fine, quit.

529
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:43,066
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use a controller, it's actually really easy now to set up a macro that does cure and then you use up and down to select which party member you want to cast it on.

530
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's hilarious because back when I was playing it, I played on a controller.

531
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:48,207
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, you gotta play on a keyboard.

532
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,588
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do your macros without a keyboard.

533
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, watch me flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, trigger finger.

534
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.

535
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:03,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Cial in chat says, DarkSakura, a healer in any game is a pain, I would imagine.

536
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily for WoW.

537
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:06,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on your healing class.

538
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,440
[SPEAKER_05]: In World of Warcraft, it can be super fun, actually.

539
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:13,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like healing paladins, but I really did not like playing a priest.

540
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,733
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I love priest damage healing with atonement.

541
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:22,656
[SPEAKER_01]: After they changed the Smackdown priest, you know, what was it, Disc Priest?

542
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:22,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Shadow?

543
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:23,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Disc, yeah, yeah.

544
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:24,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Shadow.

545
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Shadow was fun for leveling, but Disc Priest, they completely buffed him up for Panda.

546
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:35,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragenator in chat says, I remember that being in Valkrym Dunes was hell on earth.

547
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's gone.

548
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:39,641
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't do that anymore.

549
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:45,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to Gusken Mines and you level in a group with 18 people and what happens is everybody level sinks.

550
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a clusterfuck.

551
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:49,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of is, but it's... Well, we live stream some of it.

552
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:54,347
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've been watching the Twitch TV Orange Lounge Radio, we live streamed some earlier this week so you can see this in action.

553
00:38:55,127 --> 00:39:24,098
[SPEAKER_05]: um but uh yeah we we played some of that and uh you basically level sync to someone who's around level 15 because everyone gets the xp it's just that everybody's abilities are set to level 15 and then they're just pulling skeletons over and over and it's called book burning because every zone now has a book that has five or six pages and a page will say like in Guskin Minds it says kill six members of the skeleton family do you want to repeat and you hit yes so you just kill skeletons over and over and over again and every time you kill six you

554
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,000
[SPEAKER_05]: You got 600 XP.

555
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You got 700 XP.

556
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:32,684
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way up to, I think, 1,200 is the cap around there or something like that.

557
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's just you do that over and over again.

558
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you know it, you're level 35.

559
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:39,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you're going to Crawler's Nest to do the same thing.

560
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:42,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

561
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:45,454
[SPEAKER_05]: People leveled to 99 in like two weeks now.

562
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:49,108
[SPEAKER_01]: That just takes out some of the fun, but then again... No.

563
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,689
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, you know me, the queen of impatience on Wellnet.

564
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:53,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.

565
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:55,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still 87.

566
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,833
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, yeah, you guys were in the mines for two plus hours.

567
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:06,496
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, but in that time, we went from level 12 to level... I want to say I was 26 by the time we were out of there.

568
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:13,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And compared to the... In Valkyrum Dunes parties, I was lucky to go from 12 to 14 in two hours.

569
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Valkyrum Dunes parties, Loki?

570
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

571
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

572
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

573
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that that place that's like right outside the main starting area that you used to make me start in?

574
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:22,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the... No.

575
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:27,044
[SPEAKER_01]: The stupid desert that had the port, the docks out on the side?

576
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:28,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I remember that.

577
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:30,165
[SPEAKER_01]: You know me.

578
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what places are called.

579
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know landmarks.

580
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,066
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a thing anymore.

581
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:33,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

582
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:34,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

583
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:40,628
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Gusken Mines is the scary... You would go in there and you would hear this siren go off randomly that sounds like the siren from Silent Hill.

584
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I never went there.

585
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:48,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to this other place when one of my friends in New York was playing with me that had like a Bahamut running around.

586
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like a summoner or something?

587
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:55,194
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was just like a big like uber creature that would follow around and we tried to take him out at 14.

588
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,675
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that wasn't smart.

589
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:58,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't going to happen.

590
00:40:59,356 --> 00:40:59,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

591
00:40:59,636 --> 00:41:02,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's enough talk about a game that's like 11 years old.

592
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into... Like us.

593
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:05,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha.

594
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

595
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:25,500
[SPEAKER_05]: and you should check that out because it's hosted by Syl from Girls Gone Wow.

596
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Syl.

597
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:31,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And Razorbug who's, you know, a part of that whole, you know, kind of, he does a lot of the Warcraft other stuff too.

598
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:32,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

599
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:32,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's great.

600
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:34,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a really good time.

601
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:37,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, I think, the only time all three of us guessed.

602
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,290
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

603
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:45,416
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go back to like some of the E3 specials back when it was the all games, all that stuff, I'm pretty sure we all guessed it on a couple shows doing that.

604
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:45,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But

605
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to write down the episode number.

606
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:49,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anyone catch what episode number it is?

607
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:50,340
[SPEAKER_05]: La la la la la

608
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for the one that went up April 2nd, I think was the day it went up.

609
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:13,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That was indeed because it was the day after.

610
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:13,823
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't.

611
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:14,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it April 2nd?

612
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was the day after April Fool's.

613
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:16,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We taped it on April Fool's.

614
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:17,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

615
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course next week is episode 500 And everybody keeps asking us, what are you going to do?

616
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:46,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is, we're going to do a show Like we always do There you go Alright, let's talk about some video game news I'm going to be in a red velvet brownie coma That's true We're getting food made for us, that's a great reward And my friend Carly might come and bring German chocolate cake

617
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:50,655
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I need to be losing weight right now.

618
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:52,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

619
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:01,466
[SPEAKER_05]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, radio.

620
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:06,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to some gaming news, because there were some pretty big things that happened this week, right, Loki?

621
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:10,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, LucasArts was closed by Disney, and their quote is...

622
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: After evaluating our position in the games market we decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.

623
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:56,828
[SPEAKER_04]: um as a result or as a result of this change we had layoffs across the organization we're incredibly appreciative and proud of the talented teams who have been developing our new titles so basically instead of now you know making everything in-house they're going to license off their properties to other developers to make games for it so it's not like you're not going to see any more Star Wars games it's just you may see Star Wars games from EA although actually I guess we kind of already have seen that

624
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:58,769
[SPEAKER_04]: or other companies.

625
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would assume that also includes other properties like Maniac Mansion and all those adventure games that no one else makes except for, you know, Telltale Games.

626
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:18,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, as a result of that, Star Wars 1313 is on hold because obviously they're not developing in-house anymore.

627
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on hold or did they just cancel it?

628
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:22,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It is halted.

629
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:26,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still going to come out, I think, just maybe a while.

630
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:29,273
[SPEAKER_04]: All depends on who picks it up.

631
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:35,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... Well... Who of us saw this happening?

632
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:41,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, I was like, you know they're going to start closing things and making changes and... I don't know.

633
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:43,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really necessarily think that they were going to do it.

634
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:44,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think it would happen that fast.

635
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:46,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I had a feeling, but...

636
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:11,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

637
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:19,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like talking about things where people lose their jobs and so forth, but maybe the management was not picking the right games to greenlight.

638
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:24,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is it that Disney usually goes for for their development, though, for all of their proprietary games?

639
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:26,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all over the map, really.

640
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:27,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about it.

641
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:28,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney has their own studios.

642
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:30,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I mean, I'm trying to think.

643
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:34,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they closed them.

644
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:36,629
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked with Bethesda, too, for a while.

645
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:50,135
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the interesting thing, is that this might not be as... Besides the job loss, which sucks, the other half of this might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is, because it's not like Disney doesn't license its stuff out pretty liberally.

646
00:45:50,836 --> 00:45:58,666
[SPEAKER_05]: uh even last week uh excuse me two weeks ago when we were last live on the show what game was everybody excited about two weeks ago what was everybody losing their shit over at PAX East

647
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:02,273
[SPEAKER_05]: DuckTales, Freemastered

648
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:49,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I just would hope that whoever they're going to choose for more of their publishing that they really go look at a company with a good reputation The depressing part of this though is that the games that those of us that are PC nerds really remember so fondly from the 90s such as Loom, Maniac Mansion, all the things that LucasArts did back in the day I don't know what can come of that

649
00:46:50,545 --> 00:47:01,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely, I think, in a kind of a sore spot over the whole thing just because I'm actually more worried about ILM, about what's going to happen with that.

650
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have, ever since I was a little kid, I have had, I guess, the big girl boner for ILM.

651
00:47:06,712 --> 00:47:07,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to work for them.

652
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:09,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to grow up and work for ILM.

653
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that didn't happen.

654
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:13,895
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we went to the Skywalker Ranch, you remember my friend Krista?

655
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:16,177
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to work for LucasArts.

656
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:18,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked on KOTOR.

657
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to go to Skywalker Ranch and bought my ILM shirt and everything.

658
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:26,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And was in meatloaf flicking distance of George Lucas.

659
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:31,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had known then what I know now, I would have just kidnapped him and cloned him and made my own robot George.

660
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:34,052
[SPEAKER_05]: No more prequels!

661
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This crushes all the Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts 3 talk.

662
00:47:41,417 --> 00:48:03,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily Not at all, actually No I think it's quite the opposite I think there's a greater chance of something like that happening now I went in Indiana Jones level in Kingdom Hearts Now it's just a matter of getting to a Kingdom Hearts 3 square I know, they can't count either That's the part you should be concerned about They're hanging out with Valve these days, I think 3, we don't know what 3 is, her

663
00:48:08,672 --> 00:48:11,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people on Facebook that are like, Boycott Disney!

664
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,154
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bull!

665
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:16,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kind of like, Dude, you guys are hanging on to memories from the 90s.

666
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:20,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me, as I get older, I understand that.

667
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:27,061
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at what LucasArts has done in the past few years, from a business perspective...

668
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:29,839
[SPEAKER_01]: We did see it coming.

669
00:48:58,485 --> 00:48:59,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Developers Conference for one.

670
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of that great stuff that goes on where I feel like there'll at least be opportunities and the game developers are looking out for each other because unfortunately it can be a very volatile industry.

671
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really hope that it has a happy ending for those folks at least.

672
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:17,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that it?

673
00:49:17,811 --> 00:49:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we talk about the Star Wars 1313 part?

674
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:20,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you did.

675
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:22,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I missed it.

676
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that will happen?

677
00:49:24,534 --> 00:49:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it will happen still.

678
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:27,769
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

679
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:35,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just... The other thing with the changes, too, is that since they're wiping out the book canon, I know a lot of people who are pissed off.

680
00:49:36,696 --> 00:49:40,959
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of nerd rage going on over the book canon.

681
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wiping out the canon's a bit extreme.

682
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:51,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you should disrespect the book universe and all this, but the talk of making one of those books Star Wars 7, that was never going to happen.

683
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:52,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That was never going to happen.

684
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that is way too...

685
00:49:56,132 --> 00:50:19,054
[SPEAKER_01]: there's way too much like I tried getting into the Star Wars books and I maybe read like one of the first trilogies and after that I was like no I can't do this anymore because it's just completely gone you know you sit and read the Star Wars wiki where they go through all the stuff about the books I was like okay I'm done it's way out of hand but they've built up that much lore and just to sort of dismiss it

686
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:21,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at what Abrams did with Star Trek.

687
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:25,242
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people were pissed about what was going to happen there, but I think it turned out great.

688
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,925
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did stay with established lore.

689
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,487
[SPEAKER_01]: They set an alternate universe.

690
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:30,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

691
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But did he feel the need to turn a book into a movie?

692
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:34,333
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

693
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:38,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And now his universe has spawned new books.

694
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,415
[SPEAKER_05]: In the new universe.

695
00:50:40,775 --> 00:50:41,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

696
00:50:41,936 --> 00:50:42,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

697
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:44,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

698
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:46,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about Harmonix.

699
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:48,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of had a bit of a uh-oh this week.

700
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And I even got an email about this because I'm registered on rockband.com.

701
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,043
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Harmonix sent out an email.

702
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:57,245
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're registered on rockband.com or dancecenter.com, you probably got this.

703
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Servers went down over the weekend because of a third-party attack.

704
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:05,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Not saying who did this, but somebody was trying to get into the servers.

705
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:05,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

706
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:14,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Passwords for all these websites have been reset as a precautionary measure, so you're going to have to change your password when you log into the site again.

707
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Note that no user's information was published or misused that they found.

708
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:25,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Harmonix doesn't keep credit card or social security, I mean they didn't have any of that, so your personal information is not really at risk.

709
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:26,717
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

710
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:37,840
[SPEAKER_05]: As is good practice, if you use the same password on Harmonix, like if you use the same email password on that site that you use somewhere else, you probably want to change it.

711
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your bank, if your bank password matches your Harmonix password.

712
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:44,962
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use your bank password on anything video game related, then stop doing that.

713
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:55,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, people, if you're going to make any of your passwords unique, your bank password needs to be unique and your PayPal password needs to be unique.

714
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the same as your bank password.

715
00:51:57,827 --> 00:51:58,728
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be separate.

716
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:18,718
[SPEAKER_05]: don't ever ever ever use and your email password that's the third one because I'm going to say don't ever ever ever use your email password anywhere else because 99% of the time that's what they want and while I'm at it while I'm on my tangent people be careful what you share on Facebook think about it

717
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:22,240
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the security questions that are usually asked?

718
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,721
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all those memes that are going around on Facebook right now.

719
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:24,642
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all those memes on Facebook.

720
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:27,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Post your drag queen name, like and share.

721
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:28,765
[SPEAKER_01]: The street you were born on.

722
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:30,286
[SPEAKER_01]: The street you were born on in your pet.

723
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:31,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

724
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

725
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:32,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are common questions.

726
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:36,850
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's one, two, three, four, five.

727
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:38,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so just be careful.

728
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:42,463
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what my rule of thumb is?

729
00:52:42,503 --> 00:52:43,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop using Facebook.

730
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:46,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a great security precaution right there.

731
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:46,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop using it.

732
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:49,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I practically have, except my mom sort of guilted me into going back.

733
00:52:50,507 --> 00:52:52,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, except use it to like Orange Zones Radio.

734
00:52:52,487 --> 00:52:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, use it to like Orange Zones Radio.

735
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to steal your shit, I promise.

736
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:55,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I super promise.

737
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:59,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um... Crap, I completely forgot.

738
00:52:59,070 --> 00:52:59,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

739
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,631
[SPEAKER_01]: My rule of thumb for password, numbers, and another language.

740
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:04,632
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

741
00:53:05,332 --> 00:53:06,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you just told everybody your password.

742
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:08,734
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know a language.

743
00:53:09,154 --> 00:53:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Aww.

744
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:26,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Uno Dos Tres, that's her password Ichi Ni Which is as much as Rob can count in Japanese No, I remember that song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi Wasn't that a DDR song or a Beatmania song or something?

745
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:37,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember It was on a Dance Mania album or something There's that little song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi So you can count to four I can count to four because of that song

746
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:42,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, don't we have stories to do or some shit?

747
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

748
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:47,613
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk about food and languages.

749
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:53,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, there was something else I was gonna... Damn it, there was something else I was gonna share on it.

750
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:57,123
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I lost it, so you know what, here's the shark eating the plane again.

751
00:53:58,502 --> 00:53:59,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit!

752
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:02,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want to see that movie.

753
00:54:02,446 --> 00:54:03,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what else was six bucks?

754
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:05,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there was Repo.

755
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,011
[SPEAKER_01]: On Blu-ray.

756
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:07,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get Repo.

757
00:54:07,832 --> 00:54:08,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that movie.

758
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so was it my turn?

759
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

760
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a Microsoft creative director had a hissy fit online.

761
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gave me a perfect excuse to use the term hissy fit because that's pretty much what it was.

762
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:26,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Orthy, who is Adam Orth, the creative director, said, Sorry, I don't get the drama around having an always on console.

763
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Every device now is always on.

764
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:30,793
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the world we live in.

765
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:32,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hashtag was deal with it.

766
00:54:33,957 --> 00:54:55,844
[SPEAKER_01]: well that of course got people up in arms because you know anytime I'm going to say this to anybody who works for any company when you work for a company and people know you work for that company you are always a representative of that company you cannot say anything in a public forum that isn't going to reflect back on the company that you work for which I just want to say sucks

767
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:57,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it sucks.

768
00:54:57,425 --> 00:54:58,725
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the kind of world we live in.

769
00:54:58,785 --> 00:55:00,366
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, you know, I work my day job.

770
00:55:00,386 --> 00:55:02,127
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't know this, but I work in health care.

771
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:09,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I try very hard to like not say anything about like, I can't tell you my opinion on Affordable Care Act.

772
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:16,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if I were to tell you that, you know, one way or the other, you know, that might be construed as that's how my employer thinks.

773
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I have to be careful not to talk about it.

774
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:19,495
[SPEAKER_01]: When I worked for the mortgage company.

775
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:47,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't really talk about Bank of America and when I worked for the inspection company too because they were all our clients it would have gotten back even though my Facebook is completely locked down and private so I do think I feel bad for this guy as much as you might not like his opinion and you might disagree with it and you might be ready to have your laundry list of well here's what's wrong with your opinion guy

776
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of sucks that he can't say his opinion without everybody going, Confirmation!

777
00:55:53,436 --> 00:55:54,496
[SPEAKER_05]: This is confirmation!

778
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:55,277
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it!

779
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:56,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gospel!

780
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:57,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

781
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm canceling my pre-order right now!

782
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:01,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft is doomed!

783
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:03,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think what he said was that bad.

784
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:09,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It was adding the hashtag to it that made it sort of like the snarky, I don't care what you think kind of thing.

785
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: but Microsoft actually came back with an apology or a statement put out by Major Nelson and I'm just going to read this out we apologize for the inappropriate comments made by an employee on Twitter yesterday this person is not a spokesperson for Microsoft and his personal views do not reflect the customer centric approach blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we are very sorry if this offended anyone blah blah blah wink wink wink and we are making no further comments on this matter

786
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:35,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

787
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:36,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he gets paid a lot more than I do.

788
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:40,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, he should, you know, he should at least use some discretion on Twitter.

789
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not a good idea.

790
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:46,508
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way everybody's raking him through the coals, people make mistakes.

791
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:47,349
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn.

792
00:56:47,889 --> 00:56:49,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the other thing.

793
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:53,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeon Buster in our chat saying some of the quick memes done around that were pretty hilarious.

794
00:56:53,971 --> 00:56:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And links us to quick meme where, you know, it's just all these memes around it.

795
00:56:58,472 --> 00:56:58,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

796
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:01,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually looked at that stuff and I kind of winced.

797
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:06,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you know, as humorous as some of this might be, I feel bad for this guy.

798
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's just getting dragged through all these parts of the internet over an opinion.

799
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,868
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the nature of the internet.

800
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sucks.

801
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,551
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on Twitter.

802
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:19,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't he know what the internet is?

803
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:19,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

804
00:57:19,813 --> 00:57:20,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on Twitter.

805
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:32,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you're probably smart enough to know that if you worked for a big company that may have a console that's coming out that people are thinking that it's always online and you make a comment like, well, I don't see what all your problems are with this always online thing.

806
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like, you know.

807
00:57:34,521 --> 00:57:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't talk about the healthcare industry on my Twitter.

808
00:57:36,502 --> 00:57:38,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one thing you're not going to hear me talk about.

809
00:57:38,943 --> 00:57:39,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use a fake name.

810
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,584
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's position is as a creative director.

811
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:44,406
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in a position of some power within the company.

812
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what area of creativity he happens to direct.

813
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:53,431
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be marketing.

814
00:57:53,652 --> 00:57:56,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to research more, but I don't know too much about the guy.

815
00:57:57,154 --> 00:58:04,639
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you've got speculation coming out about a system, especially right now when E3 is in a couple months,

816
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

817
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Xbox was already supposed to be announced.

818
00:58:09,722 --> 00:58:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if rumors are to be believed... I thought this was the end of this month.

819
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:20,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we heard before it was going to be early April, but yet not even invites going out yet.

820
00:58:20,368 --> 00:58:32,756
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but they're supposed... Okay, when you have anything coming up that's going to have information hopefully being made about it, people are still going to try to speculate to get the jump, especially in the news industry.

821
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,977
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, any type of video game related news.

822
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know...

823
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:37,299
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

824
00:58:57,288 --> 00:58:58,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Or confirm rumors.

825
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:00,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you.

826
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:02,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Go into some other comments in our chat room there real quick.

827
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Congusto at live.vognetwork.com says, Make a troll account to bitch.

828
00:59:06,732 --> 00:59:09,253
[SPEAKER_05]: He should have made a troll account that wasn't attached to his name.

829
00:59:10,494 --> 00:59:13,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can talk openly about health care.

830
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:14,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have no desire to.

831
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:15,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can do that.

832
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:17,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make a troll account.

833
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:21,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call it, instead of Rob Roberts, I'll be Robin Roberts.

834
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,660
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be my name, Robin Roberts.

835
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.

836
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, I can't, I can't do that one.

837
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert's Rob.

838
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:37,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let me read this other comment here from Queen Simia at live.vognetwork.com says, his comment was the cherry on top of the shit sundae that was Diablo 3, SimCity, hell, even Origin.

839
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:42,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It just all adds up in the public eye to developers and publishers not giving a damn.

840
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:51,903
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm with that comment quite a bit because as much as I think it sucks that, you know, he's getting dragged across all the corners of the internet and

841
00:59:52,083 --> 01:00:00,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It does really show how out of touch some of the management level people are with what gamers really are looking for.

842
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it just a case of the vocal minority?

843
01:00:04,673 --> 01:00:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we the vocal minority?

844
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:11,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this mental image of...

845
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:14,647
[SPEAKER_01]: them sitting on their little cloud.

846
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:15,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

847
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:19,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Surrounded by their little... Because everything's in the cloud now.

848
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:19,869
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cloud.

849
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So they actually work in the cloud too.

850
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,111
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in the cloud.

851
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:22,711
[SPEAKER_01]: In the fluffy cloud.

852
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:29,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have their huge walls up where they only get very small filtered information for they look for their little target.

853
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:33,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not really paying attention to what's really going on in the real world.

854
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,738
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at their bottom lines.

855
01:00:35,818 --> 01:00:41,761
[SPEAKER_01]: They say... You've basically got executives up there who don't really have their... People love Angry Birds.

856
01:00:41,941 --> 01:00:42,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

857
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:45,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some more microtransactions, durr.

858
01:00:46,037 --> 01:00:54,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing, though, is I think the way they're looking at it is that they make these decisions that are unpopular and people still buy it anyways.

859
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:01,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they come out with a sequel later on that has these same kinds of decisions and people still buy it anyways.

860
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like DLC for Call of Duty.

861
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:09,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone bitch to bitch to bitch about how there's like, you know, why am I paying $60 for maps after, you know, Call of Duty comes out?

862
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I having to do this?

863
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,043
[SPEAKER_04]: People buy them.

864
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing.

865
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,465
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to keep doing it if people are going to keep buying them.

866
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:19,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why you see more microtransactions in these games because people buy them.

867
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't put them in there if people didn't buy them.

868
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:22,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing.

869
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You may hate it all you want, but there are still people out there buying this crap.

870
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with all these online stuff.

871
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:30,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people that will still think it's a good thing.

872
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:33,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll defend Microsoft saying it's a fantastic idea.

873
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is the problem, aside from the fact that he's a creative director and he thinks like this because, you know...

874
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,581
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

875
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:02,711
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of their rumors end up being true.

876
01:02:03,191 --> 01:02:05,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, this could be one of the ones that's not true.

877
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:06,692
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I don't know.

878
01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just something in this case about where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's two... This won't fucking stop.

879
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:15,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this says to me...

880
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:18,296
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

881
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:38,675
[SPEAKER_05]: refuse us to comment on it, and we still don't know when this thing is getting announced.

882
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: If Microsoft wanted to change something in light of what happened with SimCity and maybe some of this other reaction, they can still do that.

883
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:48,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the other thing, too, about the always online part.

884
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:49,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It still kind of stings a little bit.

885
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:55,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, if it's always online, you're going to think, well, okay, well, then I should be able to play multiplayer online.

886
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:58,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, you've got to pay for Xbox Live Gold for that.

887
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:16,569
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's gotta be always online because they always want you to use Xbox Live Gold and how many features of this always online console are they gonna hide behind Xbox Live Gold like Netflix in this one or Hulu Plus or YouTube the YouTube fucking app is behind Gold on the Xbox 360 it's kind of ridiculous

888
01:03:17,822 --> 01:03:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

889
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: All I gotta say is, you know, I hope that the console's not online only because I can tell you right now, you know, the situation I'm in where I'm playing at my work and I'm in a spot of the building that doesn't have Wi-Fi at this point and that would not work for me.

890
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:36,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play a console that doesn't have, that doesn't allow me to play offline.

891
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:38,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I just won't buy it.

892
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:39,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple as that.

893
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:39,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I,

894
01:03:40,743 --> 01:04:07,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if they do make this thing always online and it's the whole you have to register maybe it's not so much the always online thing but if it's true that it boots you after three minutes of not being connected and if it's true that you have to register your games to prevent used games I mean Microsoft is just giving it to Sony

895
01:04:07,998 --> 01:04:10,300
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

896
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:39,805
[SPEAKER_01]: The not looking at where your audience is, not looking at what your audience wants, marketing it in a completely stupid way.

897
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:43,368
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the pro to offset that con?

898
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:45,529
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be a huge pro.

899
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Are all the games $20?

900
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:49,492
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have to pay for my internet.

901
01:04:50,173 --> 01:04:54,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the pro that all the games are $20 now because they have no resale value?

902
01:04:54,717 --> 01:04:55,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the pro?

903
01:04:55,577 --> 01:04:56,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's a pro worth...

904
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they games on the caliber of Halo 4, but now they're $20?

905
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's a pro going, okay, well, now maybe you're talking, Microsoft.

906
01:05:05,345 --> 01:05:06,065
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're too greedy.

907
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: The game industry is too greedy.

908
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.

909
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:11,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like saying, hey, the price of oil went down.

910
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Gas prices are coming down, right?

911
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

912
01:05:14,612 --> 01:05:14,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

913
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:15,212
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

914
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:21,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this story says anything, it's the internet saying, this is not a good thing.

915
01:05:23,573 --> 01:05:25,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope it's not too late for Microsoft to listen.

916
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:36,397
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a part of me that's actually more hoping that this guy put that out as a feeler to see what the reaction would be, even though I know it's probably just some stupid comment.

917
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:46,361
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, they got a pretty firm response from the community, so hopefully this would be enough that they go, okay, well, let's not do this, or at least not do it yet.

918
01:05:46,787 --> 01:05:47,287
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

919
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's also a rumor that's saying that the console is going to be about $500 or $300 subsidized with that plan they have right now where you pay so much a month because you're getting Xbox Live Gold tied in there as well and you pay over the life of the console or a couple years or something like that.

920
01:06:26,106 --> 01:06:30,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I seriously think if they do this with online only, it's like fucking PS3 all over again.

921
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: $499 and, you know, oh, by the way, it's always online.

922
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:49,275
[SPEAKER_05]: The subsidy rumor about it only costing $300 getting some steam this week, which is so... That was in our list list at the end of the year last year, like what horrible gaming rumor is going to come true or something like that.

923
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We called it!

924
01:06:52,696 --> 01:06:52,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

925
01:06:53,117 --> 01:06:54,297
[SPEAKER_01]: We predict the futures.

926
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,419
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, $20 games, LOL.

927
01:06:57,699 --> 01:06:58,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That's never gonna happen.

928
01:06:58,459 --> 01:06:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: My iPad says hi.

929
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:09,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I actually was thinking more if they made like a subscription service, you know, you have their, it's always online, you get Xbox Live, and then they do like a Steam model.

930
01:07:11,048 --> 01:07:12,549
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, that doesn't seem likely.

931
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:17,150
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the pro to offset the con that if I'm offline for three minutes, I get booted?

932
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:23,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Steam, if I'm online and I get booted offline, I don't disconnect from everything.

933
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:27,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, too, is Steam games are usually pretty cheap.

934
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:30,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Borderlands plus all the DLC for $25.

935
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of hard to compete against $60 games and stuff.

936
01:07:34,955 --> 01:07:37,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Borderlands has come down in price a little bit.

937
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:41,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, though, like Bioshock 1 and 2 for $4.

938
01:07:41,918 --> 01:07:42,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see that.

939
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not getting two copies of, you know, two Xbox 360 games for $4.

940
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:52,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on the same token, you remember how, you know, Origin is such a fuck-up right now.

941
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:54,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it has always been such a fuck-up.

942
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:55,584
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just right now.

943
01:07:56,204 --> 01:08:01,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, don't they require that, like, for now, most of the Origin games, you have to be online for those to work to?

944
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:10,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because the only thing I will play on Origin is a game that requires you, or that has, is a game that is meant to be played online, so I am online.

945
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, that's all I use Origin for.

946
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:19,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you remember when they did, what was it, Patch 4 for Mass Effect 3, and it totally screwed up on my online stuff.

947
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:20,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me verify my DLC.

948
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:20,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

949
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,014
[SPEAKER_01]: and I couldn't play single player.

950
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:23,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's ridiculous.

951
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:23,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid.

952
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:24,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin's terrible.

953
01:08:24,295 --> 01:08:26,696
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be fair, Steam was terrible when it came out too.

954
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:36,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this console is always online, I'm just telling you right now, it's all the more reason for people to hack the shit out of it because if it's something that people... Ain't that the truth.

955
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:44,906
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's something that the vocal minority doesn't like, it's going to become a fucking target and you better believe that they will find a way to do it.

956
01:08:44,946 --> 01:08:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me... I don't want to keep dragging this out especially because it's basically a rumor.

957
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:55,291
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a comment worth responding to, so this will be the last thing on this topic and then we'll move on.

958
01:08:55,992 --> 01:08:58,053
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolfInChat says, Here's the problem.

959
01:08:58,613 --> 01:09:01,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet is a small portion of their target audience.

960
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:03,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So the internet doesn't like the Xbox.

961
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:05,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone else will get it anyway.

962
01:09:05,296 --> 01:09:05,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Not caring.

963
01:09:06,837 --> 01:09:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: In theory, you're right, Bobby.

964
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:14,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is that vocal minority starts that whole word of mouth.

965
01:09:15,397 --> 01:09:18,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about who they tell other people about.

966
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:24,221
[SPEAKER_05]: When people are considering buying a game console, do you know how many people have come to me and said, Rob, what game console should I get?

967
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:25,222
[SPEAKER_05]: What should I buy?

968
01:09:25,882 --> 01:09:32,245
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of those vocal minority are people that work for GameStop and other retailers.

969
01:09:32,745 --> 01:09:43,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless Microsoft's going to really sweeten the pot, which it might be a deal they're willing to sign to try and get those things to move, GameStop has already come out and said, we don't like this idea.

970
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really bad.

971
01:09:46,871 --> 01:09:52,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you might come out and say, well, a lot of hardcore gamers didn't like the Wii either, and look at how well that did.

972
01:09:52,714 --> 01:09:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a big difference.

973
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: People with the Wii were like, yeah, kids will like the Wii.

974
01:09:57,696 --> 01:09:59,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, the Wii's something different.

975
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:00,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I know you.

976
01:10:00,477 --> 01:10:02,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not looking for anything too hard.

977
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a soccer mom.

978
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:04,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll love the Wii.

979
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:05,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get it.

980
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:07,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a different type of situation.

981
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody outright hated what the Wii was doing.

982
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: or what about when you get these stories let's just assume that this is going to be like every other online only or online required thing to come out that oh hey I just paid $500 for my new system and I can't fucking play any games on it because their servers are down and wait till that hits mainstream news

983
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:36,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it may not hit it right away, but it's going to get some attention if it's anti-consumer where, oh, by the way, it locks down all this stuff.

984
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,159
[SPEAKER_04]: They have this technology in place.

985
01:10:38,419 --> 01:10:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have retailers caring about it because, first of all, they don't make anything off the consoles anyways.

986
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:51,627
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is a retailer that makes money off of used games, they're probably not going to want to support a console that doesn't make any sort of money back for them.

987
01:10:52,608 --> 01:10:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

988
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:56,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

989
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:16,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wonder who that is, Rob.

990
01:11:16,974 --> 01:11:17,375
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

991
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We're docking your pay.

992
01:11:20,296 --> 01:11:24,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, coffee.

993
01:11:24,597 --> 01:11:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like the next logical step here is to talk about that story.

994
01:11:27,478 --> 01:11:28,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe we don't have it.

995
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we have for having a fluid.

996
01:11:30,513 --> 01:11:33,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick Earl, Senior Vice President of EA's mobile and social all-play label

997
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:55,227
[SPEAKER_04]: basically saying that the people that are responding to the microtransactions in Real Racing 3 are the vocal minority.

998
01:11:56,187 --> 01:12:01,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, the numbers would show that they and others all support the freemium model better.

999
01:12:02,832 --> 01:12:17,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically saying that people were, I guess, annoyed at the fact that the all-you-can-eat model, or they're saying that the game, the DLC in it, I want to say there was like, what, 200 and some dollars of DLC in that game?

1000
01:12:19,623 --> 01:12:31,016
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, I think it kind of goes back to the fact that you have this model where people are hating on it, but there's people still buying that crap.

1001
01:12:31,136 --> 01:12:34,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about the Peter Moore consumerist thing.

1002
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to talk about.

1003
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:36,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting to that.

1004
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:36,582
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1005
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting to that.

1006
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, yeah, yeah, this guy, what he said, but then like, okay, then the real bomb was dropped later, so let's get to that.

1007
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, because every year they do this thing on this website, the Consumerist, where they vote for the worst company in America, basically.

1008
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,509
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the golden poo that they send out to them.

1009
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:56,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, whose line is it anyway?

1010
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

1011
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:57,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

1012
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:57,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The points don't matter.

1013
01:12:58,151 --> 01:13:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's a popularity or anti-popularity contest or whatever.

1014
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:07,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year, EA took the prize because of Mass Effect or something like that.

1015
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year, they're into... Well, now, Loki, if you read what the consumers had to say, it was a lot more than just Mass Effect.

1016
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, fine.

1017
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:25,382
[SPEAKER_05]: EA gets blamed for microtransactions, for inventing that model, for the online pass and inventing that model, for getting games rushed, da-da-da-da-da, blah-blah-blah, I'm very angry, and I'm on the internet.

1018
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:25,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1019
01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:28,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So, basically, you know, they...

1020
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:56,321
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the finals, or pretty close to being in the finals And, you know, they come out, Peter Moore comes out And basically saying, hey, we can do better And some of the bullshit though, I mean, I love this quote The tallest trees catch the most wind Yes, we're hating on you because you're such a big company, that's it The tallest trees break the most wind

1021
01:13:57,003 --> 01:13:59,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that just be the biggest asses?

1022
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:03,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these complaints are 100% legitimate.

1023
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:07,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all companies, we are not perfect, but others just don't hold water.

1024
01:14:08,271 --> 01:14:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Many continue to claim that the always-on function in SimCity is a DRM scheme.

1025
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:13,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1026
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:15,055
[SPEAKER_04]: People still want to argue about it.

1027
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:16,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't be any clearer.

1028
01:14:16,856 --> 01:14:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1029
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:18,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

1030
01:14:18,798 --> 01:14:19,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

1031
01:14:19,658 --> 01:14:20,159
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

1032
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:22,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make it any less shitty.

1033
01:14:36,204 --> 01:14:38,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter why it's broken.

1034
01:14:38,565 --> 01:14:39,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it's broken.

1035
01:14:40,426 --> 01:14:43,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people claim that there's no room for Origin as a competitor to Steam.

1036
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:46,108
[SPEAKER_04]: 45 million registered users are proving that wrong.

1037
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:53,491
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, you have to fucking sign up on it to play console games that are by EA, PC games that are by EA.

1038
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:58,752
[SPEAKER_05]: How many satisfied customers out of that 45 million?

1039
01:14:59,193 --> 01:14:59,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I dare you.

1040
01:15:00,093 --> 01:15:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull each and every single one of them.

1041
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:04,495
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you satisfied with this service?

1042
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:05,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I dare you.

1043
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:06,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Dare you.

1044
01:15:06,976 --> 01:15:09,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really just hate EA's customer service.

1045
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:14,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I got one good person the entire time I had that whole issue with my Mass Effect 3.

1046
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the majority of it's outsourced.

1047
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.

1048
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:21,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but that's actually a bigger problem than just in the video game industry.

1049
01:15:21,265 --> 01:15:22,366
[SPEAKER_05]: You get what you pay for.

1050
01:15:22,446 --> 01:15:22,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1051
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's true in any industry.

1052
01:15:25,012 --> 01:15:28,676
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I completely forgot what I was going to say, so you were going to say?

1053
01:15:28,736 --> 01:15:35,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people think that the free-to-play games and microtransactions are the pox on gaming.

1054
01:15:35,662 --> 01:15:38,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Tens of millions more are playing and loving these games.

1055
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:39,866
Oh.

1056
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, okay?

1057
01:15:41,067 --> 01:15:43,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them that because... That's a valid point.

1058
01:15:43,269 --> 01:15:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a valid point because they have the stuff that... You don't like it, don't fucking play it, stop spending money on it.

1059
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:55,960
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are, so... Because it would be a different story if they were putting out stuff that you could...

1060
01:15:56,921 --> 01:16:05,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Get games that were like, I guess, but when you've got titles that people have gotten pretty much hooked on, then yeah, they do pretty much have a captive audience.

1061
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:08,246
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to get more of it.

1062
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:09,307
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a catch-22.

1063
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:12,088
[SPEAKER_01]: You either do without it and do without their service.

1064
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1065
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So BlackWolfInChat says, I'm satisfied.

1066
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:16,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1067
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,171
[SPEAKER_05]: One person out of 45 million is satisfied.

1068
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:18,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, Bobby.

1069
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:25,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, how do we... And I'm just throwing out ideas here and he'll tell me to shut up if he doesn't like this.

1070
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But can we do something on VOG where I can have a poll, like an Insta poll, like a live listener poll, so I can go up and say, are you using Origin and are you satisfied?

1071
01:16:34,703 --> 01:16:36,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can poll people live while the show's going on.

1072
01:16:36,905 --> 01:16:37,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that possible?

1073
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:40,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want that for next week.

1074
01:16:40,188 --> 01:16:40,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is what...

1075
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:41,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we?

1076
01:16:41,949 --> 01:16:42,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Please?

1077
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:44,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, Bobby?

1078
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,712
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I have to say about Origin Story.

1079
01:16:46,372 --> 01:16:48,714
[SPEAKER_01]: About their, you know, going, oh, so many people are using it.

1080
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:51,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they did prove on Mythbusters that you could polish a turd.

1081
01:16:53,077 --> 01:16:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't make it less of a turd.

1082
01:16:56,082 --> 01:17:00,525
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I want to say about the free-to-play games and microtransactions, listen, it's a free-to-play game.

1083
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:13,495
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying nothing for the game, and so paying microtransactions for something, or say, buying in-game items, spending like five bucks or something on in-game items isn't that big a deal because you paid nothing for the game.

1084
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem comes into when you have a $60 fucking game, and then you're still wanting these microtransactions.

1085
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:19,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1086
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:46,746
[SPEAKER_05]: fee to pay is basically fee to pay, I love it fee to pay oh Bobby says it has been designed just not developed and maybe next week Bobby works very hard on coding VOGnetwork.com and he doesn't get paid anything for it so thank you Bobby Bobby gets paid in love I appreciate your consideration and I will withhold my feelings on SimCity for five more minutes out of thank you

1087
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby gets paid in love, snark, and spite.

1088
01:17:49,368 --> 01:17:50,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1089
01:17:50,769 --> 01:18:00,617
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we've seen mailing lists that direct people to vote for EA because they disagree with the choice of the cover athlete on Madden NFL.

1090
01:18:00,998 --> 01:18:01,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, really.

1091
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:02,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, fine.

1092
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:03,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Sports fans are crazy.

1093
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:12,964
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past year, we've received thousands of emails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games.

1094
01:18:13,024 --> 01:18:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, we're seeing posts on conservative websites urging people to protest LGBT policy by voting EA for the worst company in America.

1095
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:24,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I give them props for promoting that community and stuff like that.

1096
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:26,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there are assholes out there.

1097
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I don't think it's the majority of those votes you're getting because of that.

1098
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because, you know...

1099
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:55,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know it's this weird kind of like you know I love that this letter is very staunch like if that's why you're voting us the worst company in America then fucking bring it because you're full of it so I love that kind of tone because you know clap clap clap I wish all people could get that but anyway I

1100
01:18:57,742 --> 01:19:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird to me that he calls that out because then I go, alright, I'm really appreciative that you're supportive of all that, but let's not use it as a weapon when things aren't going your way.

1101
01:19:11,769 --> 01:19:16,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It does kind of... I appreciate your stance, but now's not the time.

1102
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:25,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the quote for last year, he says, the complaints against us last year were our support of SOPA and that they didn't like the ending of Mass Effect 3.

1103
01:19:26,176 --> 01:19:26,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is back...

1104
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:38,005
[SPEAKER_04]: The response on Consumerist, they say, actually, our analysis of the reasons for EA's inclusion in last year's finale make no mention of Mass Effect 3 or SOPA.

1105
01:19:38,025 --> 01:19:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, it looks like the EA's history of buying smaller, successful developers with the intention of milking and arguably ruining intellectual properties.

1106
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:52,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to mention in there too, especially as a factor of this year, maybe their idea that, hey, re-releasing a game, or I'm sorry, not re-releasing a game.

1107
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:22,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting out a game on the Wii, for example, FIFA 13, and basically just taking FIFA 12 and reskinning, say, FIFA 13 and updating the rosters, maybe not a good thing helping them, you know, with their argument that, you know, the quality in those games.

1108
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and that was also in the Vita and the Wii U version, by the way.

1109
01:20:25,172 --> 01:20:27,715
[SPEAKER_04]: They ported the FIFA 12 game.

1110
01:20:27,855 --> 01:20:29,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Peter Moore the next CEO of EA?

1111
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:30,877
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the CEO.

1112
01:20:30,977 --> 01:20:31,838
[SPEAKER_05]: He is.

1113
01:20:31,878 --> 01:20:32,919
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the CEO-o.

1114
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:34,240
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not the CEO-o.

1115
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,721
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wait a minute.

1116
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,261
[SPEAKER_01]: They replaced what's-his-fuck with somebody else.

1117
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:39,562
[SPEAKER_05]: With the former CEO.

1118
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:43,523
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I read that letter, I'm like, this guy is talking like he's the new CEO.

1119
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:50,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, despite the fact that we're flaming this whole thing a little bit,

1120
01:20:50,846 --> 01:21:01,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate some of the frankness of this and I appreciate the fact that at least they're trying and not just kind of like, la la la, we can't hear you, la la la, you're still buying our stuff anyway, screw you.

1121
01:21:01,892 --> 01:21:08,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that he's trying to respond to some of this in a very direct manner and I do applaud that.

1122
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:16,459
[SPEAKER_05]: My only problem is I'm like, it kind of really shows, really shows where some of the blindness is, I believe.

1123
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,445
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, they're only going to go in a direction in their business that makes them money.
