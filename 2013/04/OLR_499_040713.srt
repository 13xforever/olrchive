00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, April 7th, 2013, one landmark game studio is shut down, Donkey Kong Country Returns will get a little easier, and one series of tweets rocks the gaming world.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 499, April 7th, 2013.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games and gaming news and gaming lols and so forth with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Greetings and salivations. How you doing? I'm full. You're full? I'm full! What's that commercial? Full of useless knowledge and gas. No, Rob, again you're confusing me for your car.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
My car has useless knowledge? No, your car's full of gas. Not right now it ain't. Well, the price is. Anyway, I did my customary stop by panda and I have eaten a panda.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, you shouldn't eat pandas. They're a species going extinct. Oh, because you know, when you think of panda bears, orange chicken is, you know, so representative of Chinese culture. Seriously.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If I go to China and order orange chicken, I wonder what kind of stairs I'm going to get. I've seen real Chinese food. I don't think orange chicken is among real Chinese food.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I told you the story about my ex and my ex's family when it got really awkward one night, right? Okay, wait, I'll tell us in a minute. First off, Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You ready to hear awkward stories about my ex? All right, let's go. All right, here we go. So my ex was Chinese, right? Is this the ex I'm thinking of? It's the infamous one that a lot of people are thinking of.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so my ex was Chinese, right? So one time we went to go meet his sister's, like his family, which was the sister and the husband and kids and all this. They lived in Hayward, question mark, somewhere over in East Bay, that area, right?

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So the deal was we were going to go to Chinese food for dinner. And you know, they're all very out. They were all from Hong Kong, born and raised. I think he moved here when he was 10 and so forth.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we went and you know, they had already ordered by the time we got there, I guess we got there a little late or something. And on the table is all this food. And a lot of it is like very seafood. And it's a lot of dishes I haven't really had before.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And like, there's like a fish on the plate with all the meat picked off in the bones. But I'm like, all right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be cultured, I'm gonna just have a little bit. So I'm putting just like a little bit of everything. I just pick up pick a little bit of everything and put it on my plate.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Not because like, I think it's gross. I just, you know, want to try it, make sure I like it before I put a little scoop. And so his sister looks over at me and said, and like kind of has this epiphany. Like you see this moment of like, Oh, no, and looks at me and goes, Oh, I'm so sorry. Should I should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I'm like, that's racist.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In a weird way. Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, she's trying to be considered I know, but it's like, I'm trying to just sample and we didn't order anything I ate. There was something there that I really liked. And I had a whole heap of it. Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
See, I have no, if it's good enough for my ex, it was good enough for me. Okay.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When I was little in Alabama, I would go over to my friend Amnoi's house and her family's from Laos. And I have actually easier time eating Laotian food than actual real Chinese food. Because I really can't recognize much of anything I'm eating.

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm all for I'm all for I love food, food, food is a great gateway to different cultures around the world. I will say though, probably the only cultures food I'm never having again is Filipino. Sorry. Sorry, guys.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But Rob, I thought balut was your favorite.

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Nope. Nope. And some of those dishes. Nope.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Balut, Rob.

27
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But if you like it, more power to you.

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Have you ever heard of virgin boy eggs?

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's that?

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Have virgin boy eggs?

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They are eggs that have been marinated in the pee of young children.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So how about we move on?

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes. Let's talk about video games, shall we? How was your week, Loki? Do you have any funny stories that you want to tell?

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Have any funny stories?

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We had a week off last week. Did you have a good Easter?

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, it was all right.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How was Josh's Easter? Because he's getting a little older and can probably appreciate all the candy now, right?

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We don't let him have really much of the candy. He had plenty of like dessert and stuff. We just went over for brunch.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And yeah, that was pretty much it. Just kind of hung around.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah?

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you eat a lot of Easter candy? I was at Target the other day and it's all on sale. Half off.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No, not really. I didn't eat any. We got one of those hollow rabbits and I just haven't touched it.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just don't care.

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I heard there was some candy company suing another over those hollow rabbits or something. I'm probably like grossly simplifying it.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But anyway, we should probably get to gaming news. That's what you all signed up for.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But I do want to say hello and how you doing to everybody in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The ever-present fourth guest on our show because of course we do tape live every Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network.

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And some comments in our chat room there. Let's see. Technus saying, Glad you like Laotian food. Dark Sakura?

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I actually really, really love Laotian food but the only time I've had it has ever been home cooked.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I don't know if it's any different in formal cuisine or anything.

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, I imagine Nelly isn't really that about the pure sugar toddler crash at Meltdown.

54
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sure she's fine without that anyway.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He had a lot of sugar yesterday. We went over to her parents house because they had a family over. A lot of people haven't seen him yet.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So he had some cake and stuff and there was a lot of sugar in that. He was jumping off the walls yesterday.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So what, he's going to be four? Three?

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Three.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Have the terrible twos been that terrible?

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's been pretty, yeah it's not necessarily terrible but it's just they start testing their limits.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Tigerclaw in chat saying, Holy crap episode 499 the pressure is really high to make episode 500 the most memorable.

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't set the bar too high you guys.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's going to be all about DDR.

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't put it too high.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's a bar.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There comes a point.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You mean the bar we limbo under?

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to let you all in on a podcasting secret. Alright?

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So this goes out to all the you other podcasters out there and everybody that wants to know what it's like to do a podcast.

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright so you celebrate one year, you celebrate 100 episodes, you celebrate two years, you celebrate three years, 200, 300.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You know there comes a point where you're just sick of celebrating. It's like birthdays.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Like after your 21st birthday you're like, what do I have left to celebrate? The fact that my car insurance went down.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do you realize I take an entire week off for my birthday?

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe you're not the best example.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I am not the best example.

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
However I have gotten the confirmation from my BFF that we will be having red velvet brownies.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
God Becky I love you.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am buying the red food coloring because she will not.

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why not?

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Because it's like, I don't know.

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it that whole it's not safe thing?

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I have no idea but she never has a reason for it but I found out that the recipe calls for two whole ounces.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well I appreciate anyone willing to put their morals aside to ask.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was going to the baking store to buy like a gallon jug.

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's why you need to use virgin blood.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just...

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Virgin boy eggs?

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Did I tell you the story about my friend Diane making a red velvet cake?

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No but here we go with food again. We will get to games at some point.

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We will get to games.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She was living in northern Alabama at the time and making a red velvet cake and the Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And she had just gotten done cutting the cake with a butcher knife while listening to Tubular Bell.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She was at the door with a...

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WHAT?!

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is the same person by the way who joined our wow guild a while back.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh fantastic.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Gwen.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah I love Gwen. She was nice.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah she told you all the embarrassing stories about me in college too.

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that is always whenever I think of red velvet I always think of the expression on her face when she told that story.

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It was priceless.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Alright here's a good transition comment in our chat room from Critical Myth.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Live.FogNetwork.com saying,

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is foreshadowing isn't it? After 500 it's all about food and the video games they play while eating that food.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's what it's been about. Where have you been?

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I wish to remind everyone, and I've told this story a billion times on the show, but how was OLR born?

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because Jamie, Matt and I all used to play DDR all night and then what did we do?

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We went right over to the cafe in the parking lot and shoved our faces full of what?

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Tortilla soup and mozzarella sticks.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And Matt with his glass of, not this one, remember Tall Matt?

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah. With his glass of Merlot.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes, Tall Matt. With his glass of Merlot.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I like a glass of Merlot and he always says Merlot.

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He used to say Merlot.

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like suddenly he's French.

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alright anyhow.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or how Dan goes, Merlot.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Tigercall on chat says, For episode 500 are you guys taking voicemails with messages for congratulating you guys?

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's really sweet but no.

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well we have something else planned and I'll talk about that later.

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But my ego Rob.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know what? You can send a message congratulating Jamie if that's what you want.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah send me a message and send me money with it.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Alright. Again I'm just saying after so many episodes you have to mix it up a little bit.

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Alright. Let's get into gaming. Yes it is a show about video games believe it or not.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I play more games Rob.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You play more games? Well we'll get into gaming week but we have to do the pre-gaming week banter.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay cool.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And since we were off last week this week's pre-gaming week banter will consist of last week's news set to holic.

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a new segment.

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Last week's news set to holic?

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes it's a new segment we're debuting on OLR tonight. It's called last week's news set to holic.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And in this segment we will recap last week's news set to holic.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So here we go.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Last week's news.

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Last week in gaming news the Phantom Pain was revealed to be Metal Gear Solid 5 to no one's surprise.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
David Hayter apparently wasn't asked to be a Metal Gear Solid 5 but it's very interesting because he signed his letter about why he's not in it. April 1st.

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So to be continued on that.

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I really thought it was strange that they went with Bobcat Goldway to do the voice but hey I trust them.

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why did you hear Bobcat? I thought they got Gilbert Gottfried.

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
On the Sony PlayStation 4 Game Developers Conference more information about friends, system sharing and the user interface.

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Nothing too earth shattering I thought except the whole you have your PlayStation name and your real name but the real name comes off of Facebook.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh is that like YouTube where they're trying to get me to use my real name and I'm like no and they're like let's tell you more about this.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh I'm sorry there's no option not to do that.

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Miyamoto teased that a Nintendo theme park could be a possibility.

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But you know a lot of things could be a possibility.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Nintendo Land? Capcom wants to work with WayForward again.

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But probably that will only happen if DuckTales actually sells a lot of copies.

149
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Speaking of DuckTales Remastered it was announced that DuckTales Remastered is in consideration for the PC.

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And lastly on Kickstarter, Big Blue from the Echo the Dolphin team trying to Kickstarter there.

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's something new.

152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There it is last week's news.

153
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That Kickstarter is a little too tree hugger for me though.

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We need to worry about the planet and all your stuff and we're not necessarily making a game.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now listen if I wanted a game that was like Echo the Dolphin but not Echo the Dolphin.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here's the next evolution in the game and it's already been made. This is the best part about it.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's called Laser Dolphin.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes Laser Dolphin does exist and it's Echo the Dolphin with a giant fucking laser in your head.

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And that's seriously what it is.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They have turtles with god damn dynamite stuck to them and stuff.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That sounds like my kind of game.

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Laser Dolphin.

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So what are we going to get next like the reboot of Colibri with a railgun?

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sure why not.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'd play it.

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's talk about the things that we've been doing this week in our gaming week.

167
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Although honestly if you want to talk about the games you've been playing for the last two weeks I don't think anyone would be none the wiser.

168
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ladies first Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
My gaming week was actually more than Mass Effect.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh my god.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She played something that wasn't Mass Effect you guys.

172
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But I'm going to start with Mass Effect because I played Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I've been busy modding.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm actually also using Mass Effect 3 for art references.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know if you saw the crap I've been posting.

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I finally finally bought the game that we talked about on our British Friends podcast that we guested on last week.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I downloaded Drunken Robot Pornography.

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It is the greatest game in the universe.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There's a quote for the back of the box.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay you know my overwhelming love for Jumping Flash.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's like Jumping Flash with guns.

181
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Not you know shooting carrots at things but like actual pew pew die lasers.

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And what you have to do is you get these like ginormous big robots but you have to get a number of points before the robot will appear they're called titans.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And they have these long appendages and they shoot lasers everywhere and other shit tries to kill you and it's really fucking hard.

184
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I finally beat the second stage after a week of trying and I did it while live streaming so I didn't totally embarrass myself.

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay I quit. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not playing the game. I'm not going to do it live again until I'm sure I can beat the third level.

186
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And then I got something else. Oh I finally went ahead and downloaded Gratuitous Space Battles but I haven't played it yet.

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I just like the name.

188
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I'm still thinking about getting Hotline Miami just because all the blood and shooting shit. That's really fun.

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Good times. I played well.

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh that's right. I saw you log in the other night.

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was like well I'm paying for it. May as well play it.

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's right. I'm still debating quitting it. I might wait for another MMO that I am not supposed to let any indication out that I've actually seen it in motion.

193
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So I'm waiting for that to come out before I reserve my judgment and see if I actually jump off the WoW bandwagon.

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But it was kind of fun. There were people on so I like chatting. You were on one night and then somebody else was on in the guild.

195
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah the Hoard House Guild actually has a nice little file. It's not like a huge guild. We're not like the biggest guild in WoW by any means.

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But we have a nice little group that plays there that's on.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ha ha ha Raginator. I'll let you finish Dark Soccer but Magic 2013 is the greatest game ever. How about no?

198
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nope.

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know what I found though? We went to Dan's mom's house where most of the vault is in storage and I was tearing things up looking for my lightbox which I could not find.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I found a bag full of my art supplies but when I opened it to go through it when I got home I found a demo task for a Magic the Gathering card game.

201
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh the old school one on PC?

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The old school one. The demos that we got at E3 that first year.

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh no that's not as old school. There was one I bought at Software Etc back in like 97 or 98. That game was bomb.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It came with the giant card from the Astral deck or whatever.

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And you know what else I found in there actually speaking of Magic? I found my Japanese Legends.

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The only set of my Magic cards that I never sold off.

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Dark Soccer you might be a nerd. Just saying.

208
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Duh.

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So that was really it and yeah.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then let's go to Loki. Loki how was your gaming week?

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was just about to link in chat room Laser Dolphin the game. It literally like the box art or the title screen is like the most ridiculous thing ever.

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It is a dolphin.

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Free download or you can buy it for 20 bucks. Please don't buy it for 20 bucks. That's really a waste of 20 dollars.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So let's see. This week I didn't play any Bioshock Infinite because I was playing other things.

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I did end up playing quite a bit of Sings for the Third. Just trying to kind of 100% everything on the PC.

217
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Although I don't know why because it's like I sort of did that or I almost did that on the 360 but then I got my save gone and I kind of got bored with it a little bit.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I don't know I played through the trouble with clones that piece of DLC but man I'm so glad I didn't buy those like at full price because that thing took maybe like 30 minutes to go through.

219
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It was three missions. Three missions and one of I mean the like last mission is kind of cool but it's just so quick.

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like the first mission you're searching for this clone of Johnny Gat who's actually this brute and then it just goes by so fast.

221
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's basically one of those oh someone's driving the car you have to fire the rockets out of the back.

222
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay cool I've done that in like a bunch of other missions already.

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Then the second mission you have a cross dressing guy who's singing some Aisha songs and then you have to fire this bee gun at people which is cool.

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I like the bee gun but that's the only mission you get it in. You don't unlock it for playing like the rest of the game.

225
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's the only thing that you get that weapon in and it's stupid.

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And then the last mission is kind of cool where you have the superhero powers it's kind of like almost like a preview of the four.

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Aren't there a lot of video games where like there might be like a special stage and you're like why can't the whole game just be this?

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah well it's stupid that that gun is not in the rest of the game. I think they probably are trying to sell it as DLC or maybe we're going to incorporate it in the four or some garbage like that.

229
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But see that's why I'm so cautious about Saints Row the four which I'm still buying when it comes out immediately just because I like Saints Row.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Saints Row the four?

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think we should call it Saints Row the fourth. Why not?

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But yeah Saints Row four and you know I'm just so cautious about it because they're like oh yeah we have this big DLC plan.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well all your DLC has sucked. It's really sucked. Like seven dollars for thirty minutes of gameplay is really crappy.

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I mean that is just absolutely terrible. That's actually worse than movies. I mean you can't go to a theater and watch a movie for seven bucks anymore.

235
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Maybe a matinee.

236
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I was going to say matinees are $5.50.

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But I don't really count that though because you have to buy popcorn. Popcorn counts. You have to have popcorn. You can't watch a movie without popcorn.

238
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay anyway so I've been playing some of that and you know here's the other thing. I got really frustrated with one of the missions because I couldn't.

239
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The lag or whatever from like rain and stuff was causing. My rockets weren't firing fast enough so thankfully since I'm playing on the PC version I can mod the weapons one.

240
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They're up to my liking so I made my rocket launcher fire a lot faster and lock on a lot faster so it's now acceptable for my use.

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's see what else. And then I played a little bit of, very little bit of Defiance. I spent most of the time doing the typical MMO launch stuff whereas installing the game and then updating the game.

242
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And then I connected to the servers and played for about thirty minutes going through the tutorial portion of the game which is fucking boring.

243
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And the game itself is not very exciting right now either but I mean I am in the tutorial section of the game so I don't expect it to be that exciting.

244
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But like I noticed the enemies respawning like almost instantly like I shoot a guy and pops up another one I'm like okay that's a little weird but sure okay we'll go.

245
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That happens in a lot of MMOs when they're first out though and the newbie areas are really camped you know.

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's just, it's strange. The thing I do like about it though is it's not necessarily a game that's just all stat based like Final Fantasy or I'm sure like WoW to a certain extent.

247
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You actually, it will help you if you have first person shooter skills because you're actually aiming your weapon and firing and doing all the dodging and stuff like that so it's like a third person shooter but you know an MMO.

248
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:08,000
However because it is just launched and like anything that's online and especially with MMOs the servers were a little spotty and so I got kicked off the server about thirty minutes in and then I couldn't connect to it again.

249
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I haven't really tried. I was gonna play this weekend but I forgot my hard drive that I installed the game to at my work and so I was unable to play it last night and today.

250
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But I'm hopefully gonna get into it a little bit more this week and then I picked up Borderlands 2 on PC because it was twenty five bucks for the Borderlands 2 and the Season Pass and so I'm probably gonna start that again on PC even though I've beaten it twice on the 360.

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They've upped the level cap didn't they?

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah but it just makes everything, it doesn't really do anything. It just makes the enemies harder. Like have more life.

253
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to know is Defiance a buy once game or a monthly sub?

254
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Buy once.

255
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Nice.

256
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah so it's buy once and then you can play it for whatever and the other thing too is I mean if you're into if you want to kind of you know help yourself out the game there's the shift or not shift codes there.

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
These what do they call them? Arc codes or something like that? It's something that's tied in with the Defiance website and stuff.

258
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:27,000
If you find them or just go to the wiki that has all of them just enter it's gonna take a while you have to enter in a hundred and twenty of them but when you do you unlock a bunch of like starter stuff like new weapons and shit that'll help you out so I did that like a few weeks ago and so that helped me out quite a bit.

259
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Although I haven't gotten any of that stuff yet but it's gonna help me out so whenever I get to that. But the game they say it's sort of like Borderlands I guess you know because the way it plays and it's sure a rip off.

260
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I mean at the beginning it seemed like such a rip off of Borderlands like you start off and you're this arc hunter instead of a vault hunter and you know there is this AI person that's you know that only you can see that's helping you out.

261
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Your imaginary friend?

262
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Come on this is totally Halo and fucking Borderlands and it's like completely ripped the plots out of there. And the other thing and I don't know if this ties into those whole microtransactions for things.

263
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The characters that you can create their character creator or whatever where you can tweak the appearance and everything sucks. It looks all like this really ugly old ass person and I'm thinking that you can buy better facial features or something like that later on.

264
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Buy a better face.

265
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey just like real life.

266
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No seriously because it's like I couldn't get anything that looked interesting. It just all looked like this grizzly dude. I mean it's like okay here's the three different face types and it's like okay those are all crap. It's like different layers of you know crap.

267
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So whatever you know I'm actually looking at the dude's face you know while I'm playing the game anyways.

268
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But I don't know it'd be it'd be something I'm interested in. I'm just hoping more people I know are actually playing it because right now it kind of sucks just playing the game by yourself.

269
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Extraverse partners playing it. That's the only other person I know that's playing it.

270
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

271
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He seems to like it though.

272
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah. I'm just waiting to check it out. I mean hopefully it'll drop in price and then people will be able to pick it up because we're at 60 bucks on PC. It's kind of expensive game can be a shameless rip off and still be fun.

273
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's true.

274
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's just I didn't have high standards for it anyways or a high high bar set for because it's based off a sci fi show. I mean come on it's sci fi.

275
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hey no one's expecting like gold from sci fi. It's just you know what sci fi shows are like.

276
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I wish it was as awesome as the sci fi movies they do like shark to push and that would be kind of cool.

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
By the way who doesn't want to play an MMO like shark to push or just like a sci fi movie like a weird monster.

278
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I said years ago they should make those sci fi movies into games and people would eat that shit up.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I almost bought you that giant robo shark versus giant octopus or whatever movie it was awesome at a dimple.

280
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Is that the one with Deborah Gibson.

281
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't know. It's the one where the shark eats the airplane.

282
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes that one rule.

283
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It was six bucks a dimple and I came really close to getting it.

284
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And I got to say that the woman the woman alien that they have in the show and I understand she's not supposed to be like this sex symbol or whatever in this thing.

285
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
She is fucking ugly. I mean she is the ugliest like weirdest looking alien thing ever. It's like this dreadlocked man woman thing.

286
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't even know what it is. It's just weird.

287
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She probably thinks humans look weird too.

288
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's just like I just like oh I couldn't possibly watch this show and have to stare at this thing.

289
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah. I always love an excuse to play a clip from mega shark versus giant octopus.

290
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Holy shit.

291
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay I have to get this movie.

292
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay Rob.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Rob we need to we need to we need to get that movie.

294
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And I have Battle Royale in blue right now.

295
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh yeah nice.

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We need to do the really stupid violent movie.

297
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Birdemic 2. They're making a sequel to Birdemic. I don't know if you heard Birdemic shock and awe.

298
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It was this movie where this guy thought it was actually really good and their CG birds are like clip art birds like Jif birds that fucking flip.

299
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And the guy literally thinks that his movie is so fucking fantastic and they wanted a sequel and he did the birds exactly the same way.

300
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They're just shit. It's absolute shit.

301
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's what this that's what the station needs you know. We need a shitty movie podcast.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's funny you should bring that up. I I I I I was gonna do a joke and it's gone. All right let's move on.

303
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Do you have anything else for your gaming week.

304
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
No that's it. Oh my son played Angry Birds.

305
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's a slippery slope.

306
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is it his first game.

307
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah he sort of figured I mean he had it a little bit I had a video of him trying it out because his cousins were there and so they were showing him on his on their iPads and he started doing it OK.

308
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then he started launching him backwards so I don't really know if he gets the game yet but it's a slippery slope man ice.

309
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Those kids are so fucking into Angry Birds man that is just some scary cultish shit plays it too and it takes over their lives.

310
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
He also has gotten pretty good Pac-Man.

311
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh cool like Championship Edition or old school.

312
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Like whatever the Flash version on that education site that he goes on is but it's like a it's Pac-Man.

313
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And which Angry Birds you say. Well he started off playing Angry Birds seasons but then he tried Angry Birds Star Wars. They had all of them so you know.

314
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Of course. Of course.

315
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Back in my day you played number munchers and you liked it.

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
All right. You should get Josh an Apple 2e. That's what you should do. Make him learn like we did.

317
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
All right. My gaming week I actually played a few new things this week.

318
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So the first thing I want to talk about is Harmonite which is a downloadable title on the 3DS.

319
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's a little bit of a music game kind of interesting because it's a music game but the music in the game is just made by simple platforming mechanics.

320
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You automatically run and you can jump or you can attack and like usually attacking is like a drumbeat and jumping will make you know make the actual notes if you catch the actual pattern of the notes.

321
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But there's branching sometimes in the stages that allow different things to happen.

322
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And some of the stages it kind of changes the mechanic a little bit where you have left right up and down in it too.

323
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And it is just like Space Channel 5 which was kind of awesome.

324
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So Harmonite is kind of like a little bit of a platforming music thing meets Space Channel 5 and that's pretty cool to me.

325
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And some of the 3D effects pretty good. It's made by the guys who make Pokemon.

326
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So that's kind of interesting that you know they have some stages that will have like the gym battle theme and some of that stuff but that's kind of whatever that's all.

327
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't I don't super care about that stuff but I know there's some people that get really excited about it.

328
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So yeah. So I liked Harmonite for 15 bucks. Not bad. And you know I love music games.

329
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Not a lot of like multiplayer mechanics or anything like that so it is very much a single player game but I think you know 15 dollars is an appropriate price for it.

330
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Another game I played is a free to play game on PlayStation 3. Yeah PlayStation 3 has a handful of free to download stuff and play.

331
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Like you know DC Universe is one of them and that crappy free realms or whatever it's called.

332
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But this isn't an MMO or anything like that. It's called Jetpack Joyride.

333
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And it's something that Extifer at Horde House told me about and I went and downloaded it and checked it out.

334
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's kind of temple run meets techno kitten adventure. That's exactly what this game plays like to me because it's that whole like you float up and down with the button.

335
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's all. You have one button. That's all you do and you go up and down and you collect coins.

336
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You dodge these lasers and rockets and other things and you use those coins to buy upgrades which you get at a very slow pace.

337
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Or you can spend real money and get them at a much faster pace. It's like the temple run mechanic.

338
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well yeah it was on the iOS and Android already so yeah I'm just wondering.

339
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The graphics very 16 bit retro inspired but I got to admit as much as that sounds like it all might be crap the game is stupid addicting.

340
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like it is just so stupid addicting. And it's addicting in that way that like classic video games are addicting.

341
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Like you know think back to a game that was on the Atari 2600. Usually it was just one gimmick but you would sit there for hours trying to improve your score.

342
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Think of a game like I don't know Stampede. Right. People would drop 40 bucks to get stampede on the Atari 2600.

343
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And all it is is the little horse runs and you lasso up the other horses or the I'm sorry the cows or you run into the cows to kind of make them go further out in the field.

344
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And that's that's the game. That's the whole game. And yet you would sit there and play it more and more and more and try to increase your score.

345
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And that like I don't know like I like I've sat there and played Jetpack Joyride for like an hour at least earlier today just to try and top the leaderboard which I did do on my friend's list. Thank you very much.

346
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So yeah I got to say it's free. Why not. It's got trophies. So hey I I I can't really talk too bad about Jetpack Joyride.

347
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't think I'd go spend a lot of money on it. But you know if somebody wanted to to get ahead then more power to you. It's your money. Spend it on whatever you want.

348
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I thought there was one other game I want to talk about before I talk about a classic. Oh I guess I'll talk about this other free to play game because Alan always teases me about it.

349
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And that's Guardian Cross which is this it's like a it's by Square Enix and it's a trading card game. And I'm making little quote fingers when I say that trading card game because it is not like magic.

350
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And it is not like even like Hearthstone or whatever other types of trading card games you can think of because all the battles are automatic.

351
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So it's all just about making your cards as powerful as possible. But yet I can't stop hunting down the little animals and playing that game and turning them into cards.

352
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And then combining the cards together and then the whole NPC story and it's Square Enix so all the artwork's really good and the music's good too.

353
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And yeah so I've been suckered into that but like any it plays just like a freaking Facebook game and like any Facebook game I'll be really into it for like two weeks and I'll be like what the fuck is this fuckery and then stop playing it.

354
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That'll be the story of Guardian Cross.

355
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:48,000
One other classic game I've been playing this week. Final Fantasy 5 also on iOS now. A total remake. This is different because Final Fantasy 1 on iPad and 2 were based off the PSP version.

356
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
3 and 4 off the DS version but there has not been a Final Fantasy 5 remake save the Game Boy version, the Game Boy Advance version.

357
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And that's the version that this is closest to is because it has the extra dungeon and all that but they've totally redone the sprites and all that and it looks great.

358
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Like especially I have an iPad that has the retina display and it looks gorgeous. The controls, not bad. They've changed it so that your characters move in 8 directions.

359
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But basically you put your thumb anywhere.

360
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What is this 8 directions that you speak of? Witchcraft! There's only up, down, left and right.

361
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I know right? But actually it really helps the whole touch thing because you put your thumb anywhere on the screen and that's where the joystick is and then you move it and then you lift your thumb.

362
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You don't have a joystick anymore until you put your thumbs down again.

363
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The controls actually work and they went back and redid the battles so that the whole battle is by touch.

364
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
My only bitch about that is that they should have made enough room for all the possible squares that can appear.

365
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Because right now let's say you have a mage that has an ability and then white magic and black magic because in Final Fantasy 5 you can learn one job and then keep a trait while you go to another job.

366
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You have to scroll while you're battling and sometimes I've clicked the wrong thing trying to scroll and that was freaking annoying.

367
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But otherwise it's a great remake and now the question on everybody's mind is, well the next game in line for IOS would be what kids? Final Fantasy 6!

368
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Seven! No, six.

369
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Dark Sakura can't count everybody.

370
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hey, no I'm just going to all the link.

371
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I would bet that they're going to do Final Fantasy 6 in a style like this for the holiday. Five is probably testing the waters a little bit.

372
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It's a little more expensive. It's $16.99. It is iPad and iPhone universal. It's a universal app which some of their older games weren't so I'm happy about that.

373
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But I love the battle system in Five. I love the way that you can kind of mix and match the jobs because it really reminds me of when Final Fantasy went MMO in Final Fantasy 11.

374
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Which by the way had an expansion come out this last week and so of course Shane hits me up on the internet and says, Rob you should come back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion.

375
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I want to play a Geomancer and I want someone to play with. Rob, Rob you should come back. You should come back.

376
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And I'm like, no I'm not coming back. No, no, no. Finally we cut a deal. I said, alright if I'm going to do something I don't really want to do and you're going to do something you really don't want to do.

377
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I will come back to Final Fantasy 11 for one month if you buy Civilization V next time it's on sale and he said deal.

378
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And then he even went and played the demo for Civ V and he's like, oh it's not that bad. It is kind of like Sim City. I'm like, I told you.

379
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But anyway, so my part of the deal was to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little while. So I have been playing that with the exp- I didn't buy the expansion though.

380
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Shane has it and so I've been playing with him a little bit and I've looked at his Geomancer and Rune Fencer and I'm like, alright cool, new jobs.

381
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But otherwise I've been leveling my Corsair and she's level 37 now. It was double XP weekend this weekend and we were fighting mobs in dungeons, duoing and leveling up.

382
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So that part's really fun. The job system in Final Fantasy 11 is insanely fun and a lot of the classes are really good.

383
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I love the fact that there's so many mix and match that is really viable in Final Fantasy 11. It used to have to be like, oh no, you don't play a Corsair without a Ranger sub.

384
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You don't do it. You're an idiot. If you don't do a Corsair with Ranger sub that's how you have to do it.

385
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But now it's like, okay you can kind of actually do Corsair Dancer makes a lot of sense, Corsair Black Mage, Corsair Red Mage.

386
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You know there's a lot of different possibilities and so that I really enjoy.

387
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I still think the game is missing so many quality of life things that make other MMOs more enjoyable such as World of Warcraft which you all know I play a lot or even other MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and things like that.

388
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
A lot of it has to do with travel and the battle system is still kind of slow especially when you're soloing and duoing. No jokes.

389
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It takes me two minutes to take out a mob by myself at level 37. I know it doesn't sound like a long time but it's slow when you have to kill six of them in order to get one bag of experience basically.

390
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Is being a white mage still hell on earth?

391
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:21,000
No because it's just the way people level at the earlier levels is so different now. You're in a party with 18 people and it's just like, alright as long as you're carrying somebody people are fine. There's hardly any tanks in those parties.

392
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Did it still have the text macro system?

393
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh yeah, that's all.

394
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That really got on my nerves after a while just because I'd have all my text macro set up before casting and no we're not going to come and get healed and buffed and blah blah blah. Fine, quit.

395
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's actually really easy now to set up a macro that does cure and then you use up and down to select which party member you want to cast it on.

396
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I think that's hilarious because back when I was playing it I played on the controller and you're like no you gotta play on a keyboard you can't do your macros without a keyboard. I'm like watch me flip flip flip flip trigger finger.

397
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm going to mispronounce this name so I apologize. Sial in chat says dark soccer a healer in any game is a pain I would imagine.

398
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Not necessarily for wow. It depends on your healing class.

399
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It can be super fun actually.

400
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I actually like healing paladins but I really did not like playing a priest.

401
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
See I love priest damage healing with his home ish.

402
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
After they changed the smack down priest. What was it? Disc priest.

403
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh disc yeah yeah.

404
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I like shadow. Shadow was fun for leveling but disc priest they completely buffed him up for panda.

405
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Raginator in chat says I remember that being in Valcrum dunes was hell on earth. Well that's gone.

406
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
People don't do that anymore. You go to Guskin mines and you level in a group with 18 people and what happens is everybody level sinks.

407
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It sounds like a cluster fuck.

408
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It kind of is but it's well we live stream some of it if you've been watching the twitch tv orange launch radio we live stream some earlier this week so you can see this in action.

409
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But yeah we played some of that and you basically level sink to someone who's around level 15 because everyone gets the XP.

410
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's just that everybody's abilities are set to level 15 and then they're just pulling skeletons over and over and it's called book burning.

411
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Because every zone now has a book that has 5 or 6 pages and a page will say like in Guskin mines it says kill 6 members of the skeleton family.

412
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Do you want to repeat? And you hit yes.

413
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So you just kill skeletons over and over and over again and every time you kill 6 you got 600 XP. You got 700 XP.

414
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
All the way up to I think 1200 is the cap around there or something like that.

415
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then it's just you do that over and over again and before you know it you're level 35 and now you're going to crawler's nest to do the same thing.

416
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's crazy. People leveled to 99 in like 2 weeks now.

417
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That just takes out some of the fun but then again you know me the queen of impatience on wow now.

418
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like I'm still 87.

419
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SSJ100Matt says yeah you guys were in the mines for 2 plus hours. That's true but in that time we went from level 12 to level I want to say I was 26 by the time we were out of there.

420
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And like compared to the like in Valcrum Dunes parties I was lucky to go from 12 to 14 in 2 hours. Remember Valcrum Dunes parties Loki? Remember that?

421
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Is that that place that's like right outside the main starting area that you used to make me start in?

422
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The stupid desert that had the port, the docks out on the side? Okay I remember that.

423
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You know me I don't know what places are called. I just know landmarks.

424
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's not a thing anymore. Yeah it's interesting. No Gusken Mines is the scary you would go in there and you would hear this siren go off randomly that sounds like the siren from Silent Hill.

425
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh no I never went there. I just went to this other place when one of my friends in New York was playing with me that had like a Bahamut running around.

426
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh like a summoner or something?

427
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
No it was just like a big like uber creature that would follow around and we tried to take him out at 14. No that wasn't smart.

428
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That wasn't going to happen. Alright anyway that's enough talk about a game that's like 11 years old so let's get into. Like us.

429
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Alright let's get into some quick housekeeping. First off Dark Sakura mentioned this earlier but I just want to make sure everybody knows Dark Sakura, myself and Loki.

430
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We didn't do it OLR last week but we all guessed it on another show that taped on Monday. It's called The Obscurecast and you should check that out because it's hosted by Cyl from Girls Gone Wow.

431
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I love Cyl. And Razorbug who's you know a part of that whole you know kind of he does a lot of the Warcraft other stuff too.

432
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes. And he's great and we had a really good time so it's I think the only time all three of us guessed. No if you go back to like some of the E3 specials back when it was the All Games all that stuff I'm pretty sure we all guessed it on a couple shows doing that but it's been a long time since all three of us guessed it on a show so that's pretty cool.

433
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Wish you could have stayed longer. I know. Had a lunch. Loki's only there for like an hour but he was on his lunch break.

434
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Darn that job thing. It's in iTunes and Stitcher and all that fun stuff just search for Obscurecast and check out I forgot to write down the episode number. Did anyone catch what episode number it is?

435
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Look for the one that went up April 2nd I think was the day it went up. That was indeed because it was the day after no it wasn't was it April 2nd?

436
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No it was the day after April Fools. We taped on April Fools.

437
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Alrighty. Also follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O L R. You can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

438
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And of course next week is episode 500 and everybody keeps asking us what are you going to do and the answer is we're going to do a show like we always do. There you go.

439
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Alright let's talk about some video game news. I'm going to be in a red velvet brownie coma. That's true.

440
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We're getting food made for us. That's a great reward. And my friend Carly might come and bring German chocolate cake.

441
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You know I need to be losing weight right now. Alright anyhow.

442
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase radio.

443
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's go to some gaming news because there were some pretty big things that happened this week right Loki?

444
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yes LucasArts was closed by Disney and their quote is after evaluating our position in the games market we decided to shift LucasArts from an internal developing or internal development to a licensing model minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.

445
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:39,000
As a result or as a result of this change we had layoffs across the organization. We're incredibly appreciative and proud of the talented teams who have been developing our new titles.

446
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So basically instead of now you know making everything in house they're going to license off their properties to other developers to make games for it.

447
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So it's not like you're not going to see any more Star Wars games just you may see Star Wars games from EA although actually I guess we kind of already have seen that or other companies.

448
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And I would assume that also includes other properties like Maniac Mansion and all those adventure games that no one else makes except for you know Telltale games.

449
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And of course as a result of that Star Wars 1313 is on hold because obviously they're not developing in house anymore.

450
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Is it on hold or did they just cancel it?

451
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It is halted so it's still going to come out I think just maybe a while. It all depends on who picks it up.

452
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well who of us saw this happening because I mean I was like you know they're going to start closing things and making changes.

453
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't know I didn't really necessarily think that they were going to do it. I didn't think it would happen that fast.

454
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I don't know I had a feeling but.

455
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I always hate it when one bad game kind of closes a studio and obviously LucasArts last game was that whole Star Wars connect which just it was it was not good.

456
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There's no nice way to say it.

457
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And LucasArts really hasn't I think made the must have talk about game the way that they did back in the 90s.

458
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And we could we could talk till we're blue in the face about why that is but you know they're just it sucks.

459
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't like talking about things where people lose their jobs and so forth but you know maybe the management was not picking the right games to greenlight.

460
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Who was it that Disney usually goes for for their development though for like all of their proprietary games?

461
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Well they all over the map really I mean think about it.

462
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Disney has their own studios.

463
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I know but I mean I'm trying to think well I mean Kingdom Hearts Square there was they worked with Bethesda too for a while.

464
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's the interesting thing is that this might not be as besides the job loss which sucks the other half of this might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is because it's not like Disney doesn't license its stuff out pretty liberally.

465
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Even last week excuse me two weeks ago when we were last live on the show what game was everybody excited about two weeks ago?

466
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What was everybody losing their shit over at PAX East?

467
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
DuckTales.

468
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Right that's a Disney thing that was licensed to Capcom right?

469
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Square has Kingdom Hearts I mean it's not like these Disney things aren't licensed out.

470
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So it's not like you're never gonna see another Star Wars game and you probably will see another Indiana Jones game before too long.

471
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
In fact I think the Lego games still do pretty well in the Indiana Jones universe right?

472
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
They're done with those.

473
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But yeah they did okay.

474
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I just would hope that if for whoever they're gonna choose for more of their publishing that they really go look at a company with a good reputation.

475
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The depressing part of this though is that the games that you know those of us that are PC nerds really remember so fondly from like the 90s.

476
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Such as Loom, Maniac Mansion, you know all the things that LucasArts did back in the day those I don't know what can come of that.

477
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm completely I think in a kind of a sore spot over the whole thing just because I'm actually more worried about ILM.

478
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
About what's gonna happen with that because I have ever since I was a little kid I have had I guess the big girl boner for ILM.

479
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I wanted to work for them. I wanted to grow up and work for ILM and you know that didn't happen but when we went to the Skywalker Ranch you remember my friend Krista?

480
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,000
She used to work for LucasArts. Worked on KOTOR and I got to go to the Skywalker Ranch and bought my ILM shirt and everything and was in meatloaf flicking distance of George Lucas.

481
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And if I had known then what I know now I would have just kidnapped him and cloned him and made my own robot George.

482
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
No more prequels!

483
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says this crushes all these Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts 3 talk.

484
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Not necessarily. Not at all actually. I think it's quite the opposite. I think there's a greater chance of something like that happening now.

485
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I went in Indiana Jones level into Kingdom Hearts.

486
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Now it's just a matter of getting to a Kingdom Hearts 3 square.

487
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I know they can't count either.

488
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's the part you should be concerned about.

489
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
They're hanging out with Valve these days I think.

490
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Three! We don't know what three is!

491
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I've seen people on Facebook that are like Boycott Disney! This is bull!

492
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I'm just kind of like dude you guys are hanging on to memories from the 90s.

493
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Believe me as I get older I understand that.

494
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But if you look at what LucasArts has done in the past few years from a business perspective it kind of makes sense.

495
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah we did see it coming.

496
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Now I really do hope those that got laid off can rise from the ashes.

497
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Usually new studios get formed.

498
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Other studios get stronger with all this talent out there.

499
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I've seen that there's people like I think ArenaNet.

500
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
The people that make Guild Wars were posting things on their Twitter about hey if you were LucasArts we're hiring.

501
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And that's the great thing about the games industry is there's a lot of great networking that goes on.

502
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You know Game Developers Conference for one.

503
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There's a lot of that great stuff that goes on where I feel like there will at least be opportunities and the game developers are looking out for each other.

504
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because unfortunately it can be a very volatile industry.

505
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So I really hope that it has a happy ending for those folks at least.

506
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Was that it? Did we talk about the Star Wars 1313 part?

507
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes you did. Sorry I missed it.

508
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Do you think that will happen?

509
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah I think it will happen still.

510
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You know what though the other thing with the changes too is that since they're wiping out the book canon.

511
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I know a lot of people who are pissed off.

512
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There is a lot of nerd rage going on over the book canon.

513
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Well wiping out the canon is a bit extreme.

514
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I don't think you should disrespect the book universe and all this.

515
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But the talk of making one of those books Star Wars 7.

516
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That was never going to happen.

517
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That was never going to happen.

518
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Like that is way too.

519
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
There's way too much.

520
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Like I tried getting into the Star Wars books and I maybe read one of the first trilogies.

521
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And after that I was like no I can't do this anymore because it's just completely gone.

522
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You know you sit and read the Star Wars wiki where they go through all the stuff about the books.

523
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I was like okay I'm done.

524
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's way out of hand.

525
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But they've built up that much lore and just to sort of dismiss it.

526
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Look at what Abrams did with Star Trek.

527
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Like a lot of people were pissed about what was going to happen there.

528
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But I think it turned out great.

529
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But he did stay with established lore. They set an alternate universe.

530
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But did he feel the need to turn a book into a movie?

531
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
No.

532
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And now his universe has spawned new books.

533
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
In the new universe.

534
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Anyhow.

535
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Let's move on. Let's talk about harmonics.

536
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Let's talk about harmonics.

537
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Kind of had a bit of a uh-oh this week.

538
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I even got an email about this because I'm registered on rockband.com.

539
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But yeah harmonics sent out an email.

540
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
If you're registered on rockband.com or dancecenter.com you probably got this.

541
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Servers went down over the weekend because of a third party attack.

542
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Not saying who did this but somebody was trying to get into the servers.

543
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Passwords for all these websites have been reset as a precautionary measure.

544
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So you're going to have to change your password when you log into the site again.

545
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Note that no user's information was published or misused that they found.

546
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Harmonics doesn't keep credit card or social security.

547
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I mean they didn't have any of that so you know your personal information is not really at risk.

548
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
However, as is good practice, if you use the same password on harmonics.

549
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Like if you use the same email password on that site that you use somewhere else.

550
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
You probably want to change it. Like your bank.

551
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
If your bank password matches your harmonics password.

552
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
If you use your bank password on anything video game related.

553
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Stop doing that.

554
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Honestly people if you're going to make any of your passwords unique.

555
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Your bank password needs to be unique and your paypal password needs to be unique.

556
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Not the same as your bank password. They need to be separate.

557
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Don't ever ever ever use and your email password.

558
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's the third one because I'm going to say don't ever ever ever use your email password anywhere else.

559
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Because 99% of the time that's what they want.

560
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And while I'm at it. While I'm on my tangent people.

561
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Be careful what you share on Facebook.

562
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Think about it. What are the security questions that are usually asked?

563
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's all those memes that are going around on Facebook right now.

564
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's all those memes on Facebook. Post your drag queen name. Like and share.

565
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
The street you were born on. The town. The street you were born on in your pet.

566
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah. Hello. Those are common questions.

567
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
No it's one, two, three, four, five.

568
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah so just be careful.

569
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You know what my rule of thumb is?

570
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Stop using Facebook. That would be a great security precaution right there.

571
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I practically have except my mom sort of guilted me into going back.

572
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Oh except use it to like Orange Lawn Radio.

573
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah use it to like Orange Lawn Radio.

574
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But we're not going to steal your shit. I promise. I super promise.

575
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But um. Crap I completely forgot. Oh yeah.

576
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
My rule of thumb for a password. Numbers and another language.

577
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
There you go. Now you just told everybody your password.

578
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They don't know a language. Ah.

579
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Uno dos tres. That's her password.

580
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Ichi ni.

581
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Which is as much as Rob can count in Japanese.

582
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
No I remember that song that goes.

583
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Ichi ni san chi.

584
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Wasn't that a DDR song or a Beatmania song or something?

585
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I don't remember.

586
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It was on a Dancemania album or something.

587
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
There's that little song that goes.

588
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Ichi ni san chi.

589
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So you can count to four.

590
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I can count to four because of that song.

591
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Alright.

592
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Don't we have stories to do or some shit?

593
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Who cares.

594
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
We're going to talk about food.

595
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And languages.

596
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Wait there was something else I was going to.

597
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Dammit there was something else I was going to share on it.

598
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You know what I lost it so you know what.

599
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Here's the shark eating the plane again.

600
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Holy shit.

601
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I still want to see that movie guys.

602
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You know what else was six bucks.

603
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Actually there was Repo.

604
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
On Blu-ray.

605
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I need to get Repo.

606
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I love that movie.

607
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Okay so was it my turn?

608
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes.

609
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Well a Microsoft creative director had a hissy fit online.

610
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And it gave me a perfect excuse to use the term hissy fit.

611
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Because that's pretty much what it was.

612
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Orthy who is Adam Orth the creative director said.

613
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Sorry I don't get the drama around having an always on console.

614
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Every device now is always on.

615
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
That's the world we live in.

616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And the hashtag was deal with it.

617
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Well.

618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That of course got people up in arms.

619
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Because you know anytime.

620
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm going to say this to anybody who works for any company.

621
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
When you work for a company.

622
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And people know you work for that company.

623
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You are always a representative of that company.

624
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You cannot say anything.

625
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
In a public forum.

626
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That isn't going to reflect back on the company that you work for.

627
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Which I just want to say sucks.

628
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah it sucks.

629
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That's the kind of world we live in.

630
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But like you know I work my day job.

631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
A lot of people don't know this but I work in health care.

632
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So like I try very hard to like not say anything about like.

633
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I can't tell you my opinion on Affordable Care Act.

634
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Because if I were to tell you that.

635
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You know one way or the other.

636
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
You know that might be construed as that's how my employer thinks.

637
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And so I have to be careful not to talk about it.

638
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Which sucks.

639
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
When I worked for the mortgage company.

640
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I couldn't really talk about.

641
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
You know I couldn't talk about Bank of America.

642
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I couldn't talk about.

643
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It would have gotten back.

644
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Even though my Facebook is completely locked down in private.

645
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So I do think I feel bad for this guy.

646
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
As much as you might not like his opinion.

647
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And you might disagree with it.

648
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And you might be ready to have your laundry list of.

649
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Well here's what's wrong with your opinion.

650
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Guy.

651
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It kind of sucks that he can't say his opinion without everybody going.

652
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Confirmation.

653
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This is confirmation. He said it.

654
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's gospel. Oh my God.

655
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
This is preorder right now.

656
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Microsoft is doomed.

657
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't even think what he said was that bad.

658
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It was adding the hashtag to it that made it sort of like the snarky.

659
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't care what you think kind of thing.

660
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But Microsoft actually came back.

661
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
With an apology or a statement.

662
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Put out by Major Nelson.

663
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And I'm just going to read this out.

664
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We apologize for the inappropriate comments made by an employee on Twitter yesterday.

665
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
This person is not a spokesperson for Microsoft.

666
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And his personal views do not reflect the customer centric approach.

667
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Mala bla bla bla bla.

668
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We were very sorry if this offended anyone blah blah blah, wink wink wink.

669
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And we are making any further comments on this matter.

670
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know I think he gets paid a lot more than I do so I mean he should at least have some discretion on Twitter.

671
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It was not a good idea.

672
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,200
But the way everybody's raking him through the coals, people make mistakes.

673
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
God damn.

674
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Here's the other thing.

675
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Dungeon buster in our chat saying some of the quick memes done around that are pretty hilarious.

676
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And links us to quick meme where you know it's just all these memes around it.

677
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I actually looked at that stuff and I kind of winced.

678
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I was like you know as humorous as some of this might be like I feel bad for this guy.

679
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Like to be, I mean he's just getting dragged through all these parts of the internet over an opinion.

680
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But that's the nature of the internet.

681
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It just sucks.

682
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
He's on Twitter. Doesn't he know what the internet is?

683
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm on Twitter.

684
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah and you're probably smart enough to know that if you worked for a big company that you know may have a console that's coming out.

685
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
That people are thinking that is always online and you make a comment like well I don't see what all your problems with this always online thing.

686
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I mean it's not like you know.

687
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't talk about the healthcare industry on my Twitter.

688
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's the one thing you're not going to hear me talking about.

689
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And I use a fake name.

690
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
This guy's position is as a creative director. He's in a position of some power within the company.

691
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I mean maybe I don't know exactly what area of creativity he happens to direct.

692
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It could be marketing. It could be. I mean I have to research more about it. I don't know too much about the guy.

693
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But when you've got speculation coming out about a system especially you know right now when what E3 is in how many months? Couple months?

694
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Couple months.

695
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But the Xbox was already supposed to be announced.

696
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Well if rumors are to be believed.

697
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I thought this was the end of this month.

698
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Well we we heard before it was going to be early April but yet not even invites going out yet.

699
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But yeah but they're supposed. Okay when you have anything coming up that's going to have information hopefully being made about it.

700
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
People are still going to try to speculate to get the jump especially in the news industry.

701
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You know any type of video game related news.

702
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And you know like remember the what was the deal where someone said some rumor about a game and then the company said well no even though we had an interview with you that's not what's happening.

703
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And we covered it a few weeks ago.

704
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But people are going to try to grasp at anything that's going to give them some sort of superior position as far as the knowledge base about the machine.

705
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Or confirm rumors.

706
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Or confirm rumors.

707
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm with you. Go into some other comments in our chat room there real quick.

708
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Marissa Congusto at live.vognetwork.com says make a troll account to bitch.

709
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
He should have made a troll account that wasn't attached to his name.

710
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Maybe that's so I can I can talk openly about health care.

711
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Actually I have no desire to but so I could I could do that.

712
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I'm going to make a troll account.

713
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'll call it instead of Rob Roberts I'll be Robin Roberts.

714
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
That'll be my name. Robin Roberts.

715
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Oh wait. Shit. I can't I can't do that one.

716
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Roberts Rob.

717
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:37,000
All right let me read this other comment here from Queen Simea at live.vognetwork.com says his comment was the cherry on top of the shit sundae that was Diablo 3, SimCity, hell even Origin.

718
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It just all adds up in the public eye to developers and publishers not giving a damn.

719
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know I'm I'm with that comment quite a bit because as much as I think it sucks that you know he's getting dragged across all the corners of the Internet.

720
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It does really show how out of touch some of the management level people are with what gamers really are looking for.

721
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Or is that just is it just a case of the vocal minority? Are we the vocal minority?

722
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I have this mental image of them sitting on their little cloud surrounded by their little.

723
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Because everything's in the cloud now.

724
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
They actually work in the cloud.

725
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:35,000
They work in the cloud and they have their huge walls up where they only get very small filtered information for they look for their little target and they're not really paying attention to what's really going on the real world they're looking at their bottom lines.

726
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I would say you've basically got executives up there who don't really have the love angry birds.

727
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Let's do some more microtransactions.

728
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But here's the thing though is I think what the way they're looking at it is that they make these decisions that are unpopular and people still buy it anyways.

729
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And then they come out with a sequel later on that has these same kinds of decisions and people still buy it anyways.

730
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's like DLC for Call of Duty. Everyone bitched a bitched a bitched about how there's like you know why am I paying $60 for maps after you know Call of Duty comes out?

731
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Why am I having to do this? People buy them.

732
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And that's the thing is they're going to keep doing it if people are going to keep buying them.

733
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And that's why you see more microtransactions in these games because people buy them.

734
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
They wouldn't put them in there if people didn't buy them.

735
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And that's the thing is you may hate it all you want but there are still people out there buying this crap.

736
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Same with the always online stuff. There are people that will still think it's a good thing. They'll defend Microsoft and think it's a fantastic idea.

737
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But what I think is the problem aside from the fact that he's a creative director and he thinks like this because he obviously is having some sort of impact on how this next console is being made or at least how the software is being made.

738
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And that's not necessarily a good thing.

739
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And I don't know.

740
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's getting to a point for me between this and all these like this rumor won't fucking die.

741
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And you know what we've learned about Microsoft before? A lot of their rumors end up being true.

742
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And granted this could be one of the ones that's not true. However I don't know.

743
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There's just something in this case about where there's smoke there's fire and there's two this won't fucking stop.

744
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And so this this says to me there is some truth in this whether it's a less severe form of the truth like what Loki theorized a couple weeks ago on the show that it's always online in the way we connect 24 was always online.

745
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But I don't know anymore like the only saving grace here is that Microsoft refuses to comment on it and we still don't know when this thing is getting announced.

746
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
If Microsoft wanted to change something in light of what happened with SimCity and maybe some of this other reaction they can still do that.

747
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Well here's the other thing too about the always online part it still kind of stings a little bit is just if it's always online you're going to think well OK well then I should be able to play multiplayer online.

748
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh sorry got to pay for Xbox Live Gold for that. So it's got to be always online because they always want you to use Xbox Live Gold.

749
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And how many features of this always online console are they going to hide behind Xbox Live Gold like Netflix in this one or Hulu Plus or YouTube.

750
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The YouTube fucking app is behind gold on the Xbox 360. It's kind of ridiculous.

751
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I don't know all I got to say is you know I hope that the console is not online only because I can tell you right now you know the situation I'm in where I'm playing at my work and I'm in a spot of the building that doesn't have Wi-Fi at this point and that would not work for me.

752
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I can't play a console that doesn't have that doesn't allow me to play offline and so I just won't buy it. Simple as that.

753
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I think if they do make this thing always online and it's the whole you have to register you're like if it maybe it's not so much the always online thing but if it's like the always online as like if it's off DRM.

754
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
OK if it's true that it boots you after three minutes of not being connected and if it's true that you have to register your games to prevent used games.

755
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I mean I mean Microsoft is just giving it to Sony. They are just handed it over to so here you go. This cause this generation is on us.

756
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I just it would be a business decision of colossal bad proportions and I just I can't believe they would be so stupid and also like what's the problem to me like it's one of those same type of bad decisions that basically killed Sega in the console market.

757
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:39,000
To the not looking at where your audience is not looking at what your audience wants marketing it in a completely stupid way.

758
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
What's the pro to offset that con.

759
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I am a huge pro are all the games twenty dollars.

760
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Is that the pro that all the games are twenty dollars now because they have no resale value.

761
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Is that the pro because that's a pro worth.

762
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I mean are they games on the caliber of Halo 4 but now they're twenty dollars because that's a pro we're going OK well now maybe you're talking now because they're too greedy.

763
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
The game industry is too greedy.

764
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
That's the problem. It's just like just like say hey the price of oil went down gas prices are coming down right.

765
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Right. Right. No. And if no story says anything it's the Internet saying this is not a good thing.

766
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Let's hope it's not too late for Microsoft to listen.

767
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:36,000
There's a part of me that's actually more hoping that they you know that this guy put that out as a feeler to see what the reaction would be even though I know it's probably just some stupid comment.

768
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:46,000
But still they got a pretty firm response from the community so hopefully this would be enough that they go OK well let's not do this or at least not do it yet.

769
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I don't think it's anything like that but there's also another rumor and I really don't like reporting rumors because we don't know.

770
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Like I said I there's a whole obvious online thing I'm just waiting for Microsoft to come out and say something because until then it's that's what it is it's a rumor.

771
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Obviously it's a rumor we keep hearing a lot of and I don't know if it could be just the whole you know telephone thing where it just keeps getting repeated.

772
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But now there's also a rumor that's saying that the console is going to be about five hundred bucks or three hundred dollars subsidized with that plan they have like right now where you pay you know so much a month because you're getting Xbox Live Gold tied in there as well.

773
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And you pay over the life of the console or a couple of years or something like that.

774
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I mean I seriously think if they do this with online only it's like fucking PS3 all over again.

775
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Four hundred ninety nine dollars and you know oh by the way it's always online.

776
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:48,000
The subsidy rumor about it only costing three hundred dollars giving getting some steam this week which is so that was in our list list at the end of the year last year like what horrible gaming rumors going to come true or something like that.

777
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We called it.

778
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Maybe we predict the futures dark Tetsuya and chat says twenty dollar games.

779
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
L.O.L. I'm never going to have my iPad says hi.

780
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I mean I'm actually was thinking more if they made like a subscription service you know you have there it's always online you get Xbox Live and then they do like a steam model.

781
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Again but even so that doesn't seem likely.

782
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What's the pro to offset the con that if I'm offline for three minutes.

783
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yeah I guess it is. Well because steam you know if I'm online and I get booted offline I don't disconnect from everything.

784
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And the other thing too is steam games are usually pretty cheap like Borderlands plus all the DLC for twenty five bucks.

785
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's kind of hard to compete against sixty dollar games and so I know a Borderlands has come down in price a little bit.

786
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But still though like Bioshock one and two for four dollars. I don't see that you know I'm not getting two copies of you know two Xbox 360 games for four dollars.

787
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well on the same token you remember how you know origin is such a fuck up right now.

788
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Well it has always been such a fuck up if not just right now.

789
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Well I mean don't they require that like for now most the origin games you have to be online for those to work too.

790
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I don't know because the only thing I will play on origin is a game that requires you that has is a game that is meant to be played online.

791
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So I am online Mass Effect 3 multiplayer that's all I use origin for.

792
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Well you remember when they did what was it patch four for Mass Effect 3 and it totally screwed up all my online stuff wouldn't let me verify my DLC and I couldn't play single player.

793
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah it's ridiculous. Origin's terrible but to be fair steam was terrible.

794
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And if this console is always online I'm just telling you right now it's all more reason for people to hack the shit out of it.

795
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Because if it's something that the vocal minority doesn't like it's going to become a fucking target and you better believe that they will find a way to do it.

796
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Alright let me, I don't want to keep dragging this out especially because it's basically a rumor but this is a comment worth responding to so this will be the last thing on this topic and then we'll move on.

797
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:06,000
BlackWolfInChat says here's the problem the internet is a small portion of their target audience so the internet doesn't like the Xbox everyone else will get it anyway not caring.

798
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:20,000
In theory you're right Bobby but the problem is that vocal minority starts that whole word of mouth and it's all about who they tell other people about you know when people are considering buying a game console.

799
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Do you know how many people have come to me and said Rob what game console should I get what should I buy and you know a lot of those vocal minority are people that work for GameStop and other retailers.

800
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And unless Microsoft's going to really sweeten the pot which might it might be a deal they're willing to sign to try and get those things to move GameStop has already come out and said we don't like this idea.

801
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So that's really you know that's really bad now you might come out and say well a lot of hardcore gamers didn't like the Wii either and look at how well that did but there was a big difference.

802
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:10,000
People with the Wii were like yeah kids will like the Wii oh yeah the Wii is something different oh yeah I know you you're not looking for anything too hard you're a soccer mom you'll love the Wii go get it you know it was a different type of situation nobody outright hated what the Wii was doing.

803
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Or what about when you get these stories let's just assume that this is going to be like every other online only or online required thing to come out.

804
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That oh hey I just paid $500 for my new system and I can't fucking play any games on it because their servers are down and wait till that hits mainstream news.

805
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I know it may not hit it right away but it's going to get some attention if you know it's anti-consumer where oh by the way it locks down all this stuff they have this technology in place.

806
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You're not going to have retailers caring about it because first of all they'll make anything off the consoles anyways if this is a retailer that you know makes money off of used games they're probably not going to want to support a console that doesn't make any sort of you know money back for them.

807
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So I don't know.

808
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Did we not put the EA story in tonight's show roll?

809
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I don't know but yeah EA's full of shit.

810
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
What the fuck.

811
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Loki can you I hate to put you on the spot but I know you have another story but can you jump in here with the EA and what's going on there because you've been following that whole thing.

812
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Why is it not on the show roll?

813
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't know.

814
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What a terrible producer this show has.

815
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah I wonder who that is Rob.

816
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That's it we're docking your pay.

817
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Rob coffee.

818
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So I just it's like it's almost like the next logical step here is to talk about that story I can't believe.

819
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So let's talk about EA.

820
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So speaking of people I radio speaking to people that have no idea and you know we're talking about you know the vocal minority again.

821
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And this is where we're quoting it from it's basically a mobile Nick Earl the senior vice president of EA's mobile and social all played label basically saying that the people that are responding to the microtransactions in real racing three are the vocal minority.

822
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Ultimately the numbers would show that they and other are others all support the freemium model better.

823
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And basically you know saying that people were.

824
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I guess annoyed at the fact that you know the all all you can eat model or they're saying that the game you know the DLC in it I want to say it was like what 200 and some dollars of DLC in that game.

825
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But once again I think kind of goes back to the fact that.

826
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You have this model where people are hating on it but there's people still buying that crap can we talk about that.

827
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I want to talk about the Peter Moore consumerist.

828
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Oh yes and I want to talk about I'm getting there.

829
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So yeah yeah yeah this guy what he said but then like OK then the real bomb was dropped later so let's let's get it's OK because you know every year they do this thing on this Web site the consumerist where they vote for the worst company in America.

830
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Basically they have the golden poo that they send out to them.

831
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Like whose line is it anyway. It doesn't matter. The points don't matter. It's just it's a popularity or anti popularity contest or whatever.

832
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And last year I took the prize because of Mass Effect or something like that.

833
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And this year they're in. Well now Loki if you read what the consumers had to say it was a lot more than just Mass Effect.

834
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,000
E.A. gets blamed for microtransactions for inventing that model for the online pass and inventing that model for getting games rushed.

835
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Blah blah blah. I'm very angry and I'm on the Internet. Yes. So basically you know they they're in the finals or they are pretty close to being in the finals.

836
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And you know they come out and Peter Moore comes out and basically saying hey we can do better. And some of the bullshit though.

837
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I mean I love this quote. The tallest trees catch the most wind. Yes we're hating on you because you're such a big company. That's it.

838
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,000
The tallest trees break the most wind. Some. There's something that must be the biggest asses.

839
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Some of these complaints are 100 percent legitimate like all companies. We are not perfect but in others just don't hold water.

840
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Many continue to claim that the always on function in Sim City is a DRM scheme. It's not. People still want to argue about it. We can't be any clearer.

841
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's not period. I agree. It's not. I don't think it was ever about the DRM. It was about microtransactions and making sure that you wouldn't be able to hack them into the game.

842
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:35,000
That's what it's about is the microtransaction model. It's not about the DR. That doesn't make it any less shitty.

843
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It doesn't matter why. You know it's broken. It's just it's broken. Some people claim that there's no room for origin as a competitor to seem 45 million registered users are proving that wrong.

844
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:58,000
By the way you have to fucking sign up on it to play console games that are by EA PC games that are by EA. Yeah. Oh how many satisfied customers out of that 45 million.

845
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I dare you pull each and every single one of them. How are you satisfied with this service. I dare you.

846
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Well I really just hate EA's customer service. OK. I got one good person the entire time I had that whole issue with my Mass Effect 3.

847
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Well the majority of its outsourced. Exactly. Exactly. I hate to say it but that's you know I mean that's actually a bigger problem than just in the video game industry.

848
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You get what you pay for. Exactly. That's true in any industry. However I completely forgot what I was going to say. So you were going to say some people think that the free to play games and microtransactions are the pox on the box on gaming tens of millions more are playing and loving these games.

849
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Whatever. OK. I'll give them that because that's a valid point. That's a valid point because you know they have the stuff that you and I don't like it. Don't fucking play it. Stop spending money on it. But people are so because it would be a different story if they were putting out you know stuff that you could get games that were like I guess.

850
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But when you've got titles that many people have gotten pretty much hooked on then yeah they do pretty much have a captive audience. People want to get more of it. It's I mean it's kind of a catch 22 you either do without it and do without their service.

851
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:40,000
OK. So Black Wolf in chat says I'm satisfied. Great. One person out of forty five million is that Bobby. How do we. And I'm just throwing out ideas here and and he'll tell me to shut up if he doesn't like this. But how can we do something on vogue where like I can have a poll like an insta poll like a live listener poll so I can go up and say are you using origin and are you satisfied and we can like poll people live all the shows going on. Is that like possible because I we I want that for next week.

852
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:54,000
This is what I have to say about. Please Bobby. This is what I have to say about origin story about their you know going oh so many people are using it. Well they did prove a myth busters that you could polish a turd doesn't make it less of a turd.

853
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:13,000
One thing that I want to say about the free to play games and microtransactions. Listen it's a free to play game. You're paying nothing for the game. And so paying microtransactions for something or say buying in-game items you know spending like five bucks or something on in-game items isn't that big a deal because you paid nothing for the game.

854
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:22,000
The problem comes into when you have a $60 fucking game and then you're still wanting these microtransactions fee to pay is basically fee to pay. I love it.

855
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Fee to pay.

856
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh Bobby. Bobby says it has been designed just not developed and maybe next week and I Bobby works very hard on coding vog network.com and he doesn't get paid anything for it. So thank you Bobby I appreciate it gets paid in love.

857
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I appreciate your consideration and I will I will withhold my feelings on SimCity for five more minutes out of thank you.

858
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Bobby gets paid in love snark and spite.

859
01:17:49,000 --> 01:18:00,000
See we've seen we've seen mailing lists that direct people to vote for EA because they disagree with the choice of the cover athlete on Madden NFL.

860
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yes really. OK we'll find sports fans are crazy. In the past year we've received thousands of e-mails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games.

861
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:24,000
This week we're seeing posts on conservative websites urging people to protest LGBT policy by voting EA for the worst company in America. OK I give them props for promoting that community and stuff like that.

862
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And yeah there are assholes out there. But at the same time I don't think it's the majority of those votes you're getting because of because of that. It's because you know it's this weird kind of like you know I I love that this letter is very staunch like

863
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:54,000
if that's why you're voting as the worst company in America then fucking bring it because you're full it you're full of it. So I love that kind of tone because you know clap clap clap I wish all you know people could could get that.

864
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But anyway I it's weird to me that he calls that out because then I go all right I'm really appreciative that you're supportive of all that but let's not use it as a weapon when things aren't going your way.

865
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Just it. It does kind of you know I appreciate your stance but now's not the time.

866
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah. And then the quote for last he says last year the complaints against us last year were our support of SOPA and that they didn't like the ending the Mass Effect 3 and this is back.

867
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This is the response on consumerist. They say actually aren't our analysis of the reasons for EA's inclusion in last year's finale make no mention of Mass Effect 3 or soap and said it looks like the EA's history of buying smaller successful developers with the intention of milking and arguably ruining intellectual properties that made these acquired companies so attractive.

868
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It also discusses EA's exclusivity deals on popular sports games as some say are effectively set the bar for retail prices for the rest of the gaming industry.

869
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And I'd like to mention in there too especially you know as a factor of this year maybe there's their idea that hey we're releasing a game or I'm sorry not really the game putting out a game on the Wii for example FIFA 13.

870
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And basically just taking FIFA 12 and reskinning say FIFA 13 and updating the rosters maybe not a good thing helping them you know with their argument that you know the quality in those games.

871
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Oh and that was also in the Vita and the Wii U version by the way they ported the FIFA 12 game is Peter Moore the next CEO of EA.

872
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yes he is. He's the CEO. Oh he's not the CEO.

873
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
No wait a minute they replaced what's the fuck with somebody else with the former CEO.

874
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But I'm just like when I read that letter I'm like this guy is talking like he's the new CEO. Look I appreciate it despite the fact that we're we're we're you know flaming this whole thing a little bit.

875
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I do appreciate some of the frankness of this and I appreciate the fact that at least they're trying and not just kind of like la la la we can't hear you la la la you're still buying our stuff anyway screw you.

876
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I appreciate that he's trying to respond to some of this in a very direct manner and I do applaud that.

877
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
My only problem is is I'm like it kind of really really shows really shows where some of the blindness is I believe.

878
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But anyway but once again though they're only going to go in a direction in their business that makes them money. And if you know my.
