00:00.000 --> 00:19.440
Today, April 28th, 2013, Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.520
More video games are set to become movies, and can you really get pizza delivered with

00:23.520 --> 00:24.520
your 360?

00:24.520 --> 00:36.320
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:36.320 --> 00:37.760
Lounge Radio.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.720
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games, and gaming

00:44.120 --> 00:47.920
culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.080
First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Hello.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:53.080 --> 00:55.440
Um, uh, sated.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
Sated or satiated?

00:56.440 --> 00:59.440
Could you do that pizza?

00:59.440 --> 01:02.120
But wouldn't that be- Oh, whatever.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
Alright.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.400
Well, uh, grammar specifics aside- And, and, um, just to tell PrinceBrightStar,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.320
I've been playing PSO, too.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.720
What is, what is, what is the, what did he ask?

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
I missed it.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.280
Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so he's just affirming that, yes, I did get

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
everything to work.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.520
Awesome.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.280
Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?

01:21.280 --> 01:25.880
Yes, but I have to re-patch my game and re-do the translations and blah, and I've had other

01:25.880 --> 01:27.400
stuff to play.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.480
Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.480
Hi.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.760
How are you, Loki?

01:31.760 --> 01:32.760
Doing good.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.760
Good.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.760
What's new with you?

01:34.760 --> 01:35.760
I'm collecting drugs.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.760
You're collecting drugs?

01:36.760 --> 01:43.440
Well, I'm finishing my pickups on, uh, the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.720
Ah, I see what you did there.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
Okay.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.520
Uh, I thought you were all done with Saints Row the Third.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.040
I am, but- It's like a platinum trophy thing.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.040
Sort of.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.040
It's on Steam, though.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.040
Oh, okay.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
Fair enough.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.040
Same, same.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.600
Alright, um, we have some guests joining us in the studio tonight, and I'm really excited

01:58.600 --> 02:02.240
about this because, um, these are guys I've been trying to get on the show for a very,

02:02.240 --> 02:03.960
very, very, very, very long time.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.080
Uh, these guys are long-time friends of mine, and, um, I think one of them was here, like,

02:08.080 --> 02:10.600
seven years ago, but how many of you are listening then?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.680
Like 98% of you, this is all new.

02:12.680 --> 02:19.360
Please say hello, everybody, to, from the GameBui.org podcast, say hello to Captain

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
Spike.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
Hi!

02:21.360 --> 02:22.360
Hi!

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
How are you, Spike?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.000
Uh, doing pretty good, thank you for having me.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.640
No problem!

02:27.640 --> 02:31.400
And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim!

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Hello!

02:32.400 --> 02:33.800
How are you, Tim?

02:33.800 --> 02:34.960
I am quaking in my boots.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.800
This is my first podcast ever.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
Is it really?

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
Yep.

02:38.800 --> 02:44.680
Wow, you're like- This is also Rob's first podcast, though.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.200
So, we've stolen your, uh, guest virginity.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
I suppose so.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.040
I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about it that way.

02:52.040 --> 02:56.160
You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.640
So yeah, there's, like, every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.180
No disrespect to those of you doing podcasts, but, like, Captain Spike, I'm calling myself

03:04.180 --> 03:05.180
an idiot.

03:05.180 --> 03:09.280
But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days, it's really surprising to

03:09.280 --> 03:13.440
me, you've never done this before.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.080
But we'll be gentle, I promise.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.080
Thank you.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.080
All right, you're welcome.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.080
Um, so I wanted to-

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
Break out the feathers.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.520
Before we get into, like, how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys

03:22.520 --> 03:24.640
kind of, like, about, like, the things you guys do.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.160
So I'm gonna start with Spike.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.560
So a few years ago, um, I know you came on OLR, like, seven years ago, that was back

03:30.560 --> 03:32.440
when I lived with Xtifer, right?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.440
It sure was, yeah.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.080
Do you remember what we even talked about then?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.880
I have no idea.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.880
How did you and I meet?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.240
Tell the listeners.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.560
The internet, Adam.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.600
And then, you know, you know, we were on a message board, there was a, you know, IRL

03:46.600 --> 03:52.400
meetup party, we went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
an hour.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Don't smoke, guys.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
It's bad for you.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
No, smoking is bad.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Yeah, so we quit.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Okay, I have to ask.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
They were the dejarmes, right?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Oh, I'm sure.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
Oh, death.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.960
Like there's anything other.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.720
Um, so, so fast forward to today, you've got your podcast now.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.880
Tell us about Game Buoy.

04:08.880 --> 04:14.240
Yeah, so I host the gamebuoy.org video game podcast.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.520
Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all

04:18.520 --> 04:25.320
the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of, you know, niche genres

04:25.320 --> 04:30.080
that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.880
I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast, and obviously, you know, I'm not

04:33.880 --> 04:37.680
being rude with that, but it's like, it is so easy to do it now, but, but surely you

04:37.680 --> 04:40.800
kind of have to take that step, like, why do I want to do a podcast?

04:40.800 --> 04:43.440
So why, Captain Spike, did you want to do a podcast?

04:43.440 --> 04:48.400
Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and, you

04:48.400 --> 04:52.960
know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this,

04:52.960 --> 04:57.360
but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.640
That's fair.

04:58.640 --> 05:03.480
Especially, you know, we started, um, Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have

05:03.480 --> 05:07.680
a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do, so.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.720
And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.000
No tea, no shade.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
No, all tea, all shade.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.720
We do it for free.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.160
We spend money on it.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.760
So no, we're not getting paid.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.760
Okay.

05:18.760 --> 05:22.320
Well, that's, but I like, I like that you guys have a niche and you know, I've had people

05:22.320 --> 05:27.200
ask me before because we've had, have, have had this podcast a long, long, long, long

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
time.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.520
Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, Hey, Rob, how do

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
I start a podcast?

05:32.520 --> 05:35.320
And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
to warn you.

05:36.320 --> 05:41.160
It's a very, there's a lot of people in this pool and people have peed in this pool and

05:41.160 --> 05:43.200
yeah, it's kind of gross.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.440
There's a lot of stuff, but you got to find your niche.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.160
You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.200
You know, how am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.000
It's going to get me noticed, right?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.360
So you guys have your niche and I think it's, it's, it's fun because you guys don't like

05:56.360 --> 06:00.200
just talk about under the radar news, but I noticed you kind of theme a lot of your

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
episodes.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.560
So you'll have like your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way

06:05.560 --> 06:06.560
I noticed.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.320
Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but, um, we, we really wanted to have

06:10.320 --> 06:15.080
sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot

06:15.080 --> 06:19.200
of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.200
Gotcha.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.280
So it's, it's you and you and, uh, what do you call him on the show?

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
I know his real name.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
What's his first mate?

06:26.280 --> 06:27.280
Slidekick.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
That is that his first mate.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
Slidekick.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
Yeah.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
Yeah.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
And you guys, you guys have been buds forever, right?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.520
I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years nearly.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
Yeah.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.220
And Slidekick's my frenemy in the wow podcasting community.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.220
So that's always a lot of fun.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.220
Yeah.

06:40.220 --> 06:41.220
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

06:41.220 --> 06:44.340
You all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.

06:44.340 --> 06:46.340
I still have episodes on my phone.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.780
So you were the subscriber.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.780
That was me.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.780
I'm just kidding.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.180
You were their leech and a fan.

06:53.180 --> 06:58.180
I would, it was when I ran out of history podcasts and I was like, well, there's always

06:58.180 --> 07:01.460
this one and I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.460
People were like, what do you want?

07:04.460 --> 07:07.780
But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick cause I was always in chat

07:07.780 --> 07:09.540
and everything.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.540
You're so mean.

07:10.540 --> 07:13.960
Um, so let me talk, let me talk about like you as a gamer.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.220
So obviously you must've been into all the music games and stuff like we were cause you

07:17.220 --> 07:18.820
were on the show at that time.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.100
Um, what, how did you get into gaming at all?

07:22.100 --> 07:24.060
Like how did you start playing video games?

07:24.060 --> 07:25.740
What, what, what hooked you into this?

07:25.740 --> 07:27.100
Why are you a gamer?

07:27.100 --> 07:29.100
Um, why am I a gamer?

07:29.100 --> 07:34.360
Um, my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games.

07:34.400 --> 07:39.880
So I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know, the old Irem game, I think it was

07:39.880 --> 07:41.520
Irem, I don't know.

07:41.520 --> 07:48.720
And uh, after that, you know, got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
Awesome.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.040
What, what's like your favorite video games ever?

07:52.040 --> 07:55.240
What are like your favorite things that have ever been done?

07:55.240 --> 07:58.760
Uh, Super Mario World and Bayonetta.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.120
Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.840
I think it has some of the best, uh, like situational awareness in a 3d action game

08:06.840 --> 08:07.840
that I've ever seen.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.840
Yeah.

08:08.840 --> 08:09.840
Interesting.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.940
I really liked the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction

08:13.940 --> 08:14.940
and what have you.

08:14.940 --> 08:18.000
Those are just, they're not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.760
Like if I'm, if I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
to Bayonetta.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.080
But no, I think that's great.

08:24.080 --> 08:28.720
You know, a lot of people don't usually dare to name for all practical purposes a current

08:28.720 --> 08:29.720
game.

08:29.720 --> 08:38.800
I think it's super well designed and you know, I think that Super Mario World is certainly

08:38.800 --> 08:42.040
the best 2d, best designed 2d platformer.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.200
Um, you know, so you must've been excited about virtual console this week.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
Yeah.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.920
The first thing I did was download it and play it until my, uh, second player rage quit

08:50.920 --> 08:51.920
on me.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.440
Sorry about, uh, magic Koopa.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.440
No, that is crap.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.280
Um, gosh, what else I want to ask you about games?

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
Um, okay.

09:01.280 --> 09:07.400
Bayonetta 2 then, and this whole, it's exclusive for Nintendo, like where, where are you at

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
with Nintendo?

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
Where's your head at?

09:09.400 --> 09:14.800
Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks and it's a kitty thing and dah, dah,

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
dah, dah.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.260
But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2, like where's your head out with that?

09:18.260 --> 09:21.300
I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.

09:21.540 --> 09:27.980
I think that, um, you know, them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably

09:27.980 --> 09:30.740
also a bad business choice.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.820
But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from.

09:32.820 --> 09:33.820
So I'm happy.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.920
Uh, go to our chat room.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.260
We always have the other guests on our show, the live chat room, live.vognetwork.com because

09:41.260 --> 09:45.180
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

09:45.180 --> 09:47.220
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

09:47.900 --> 09:53.580
And looking at our chat room, we see some comments such as, um, let's see, Dungeon Buster

09:53.580 --> 09:55.280
says Bayonetta rocks.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.500
Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.080
Once you had the NES version, you blow right through the entire game.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.360
Absolutely true.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
That's true.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.880
And then does it, does it lose something though?

10:05.880 --> 10:09.080
Once you play it on the console, like can you go back and play it in the arcade now

10:09.080 --> 10:10.460
that you've just beat it?

10:10.460 --> 10:14.460
No, but I mean, you know why I didn't really want to either.

10:14.460 --> 10:18.780
I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages

10:18.780 --> 10:22.540
of Nintendo fun club, Nintendo power, you know.

10:22.540 --> 10:23.540
Awesome.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.580
Uh, let's see.

10:25.580 --> 10:31.740
And going to, um, Ross DOUT says arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain

10:31.740 --> 10:32.740
quarters.

10:32.740 --> 10:33.740
Of course they were.

10:33.740 --> 10:34.740
I always think of that.

10:34.740 --> 10:40.060
Um, you remember Wayne's world, which turned 20 years old apparently this month.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.220
How old does that make you feel at me feel right now?

10:42.220 --> 10:43.220
Right.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.220
He's 20 years old.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.220
Right.

10:45.220 --> 10:49.740
So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade and the guy goes, yeah, we just

10:49.740 --> 10:50.740
got this new game.

10:50.740 --> 10:53.500
But when you killed the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.340
The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.

10:55.340 --> 11:00.940
He never shows up and I'm like, Oh, that's like so old arcade machine.

11:00.940 --> 11:01.940
Like I love it.

11:01.940 --> 11:06.100
That's up there with the boss of carnival being named token taker.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.460
Uh, let's see.

11:09.460 --> 11:15.180
And um, slide kick in chat, uh, agreeing with Tim apparently saying magic Koopa is a ratchet

11:15.180 --> 11:16.180
hoe.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.180
There you go.

11:17.180 --> 11:18.180
Thank you.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.180
Slidekick.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.180
All right.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.740
Um, so if people want to check out your podcast, which I do recommend, it's, it's a, it's a

11:23.740 --> 11:24.740
great listen.

11:24.740 --> 11:28.500
Even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I'd like to see you do it more often,

11:28.500 --> 11:29.500
but no pressure.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.500
What's with that?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.940
What you're being so rude.

11:31.940 --> 11:32.940
That's a compliment.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.940
I am a guest.

11:33.940 --> 11:34.940
No, that's a compliment.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.380
That means I want more of it.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.380
Right.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.380
How's that a bad thing?

11:38.380 --> 11:39.380
Okay.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.140
Good things come to those who wait.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.140
That's true.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.740
Um, you know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to a game, buoy.org.

11:46.740 --> 11:53.620
Um, but you know, we're also on iTunes game, buoy podcast, hard to miss.

11:53.620 --> 11:59.580
And the art actually looks like a little game boy, but get it boy.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.580
It's great.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.580
I like it.

12:01.580 --> 12:02.580
All right.

12:02.580 --> 12:05.620
Um, what, uh, Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.

12:05.620 --> 12:10.780
Um, you, since, since you have a lot of like timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you

12:10.780 --> 12:14.180
know, are, are, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might

12:14.180 --> 12:17.620
be outdated, you know, the, you got a good, good chunk that's timeless.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.420
What do you think is one of like your best episodes of the ones you've done so far?

12:20.420 --> 12:23.780
Like if I, if I need to go back and find like a good conversation, which one would you like

12:23.780 --> 12:25.100
recommend most?

12:25.100 --> 12:26.100
Okay.

12:26.100 --> 12:32.100
So, um, the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on

12:32.100 --> 12:40.460
the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock infinite, um, a game, which as a game, I was

12:40.460 --> 12:45.580
kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things

12:45.580 --> 12:49.540
from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms

12:49.540 --> 12:51.540
of games.

12:51.540 --> 12:54.780
We talked about that for a couple of hours and I was really happy with how it, how it

12:54.780 --> 12:59.260
came out, uh, despite it being unpleasantly long.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.460
Well, you know what?

13:01.460 --> 13:05.380
This show's really unpleasantly long most every week, so it's all good.

13:05.380 --> 13:12.380
Um, and we also, uh, we had a pretty in-depth discussion on, uh, LGBT issues in games, um,

13:12.380 --> 13:14.540
and we're actually going to do a follow up on that this summer.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.920
So I'm very excited.

13:15.920 --> 13:22.380
This is a good part to plug the gamer X panel that is coming up, uh, the gamer X is what

13:22.380 --> 13:25.360
the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?

13:25.360 --> 13:28.900
And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted

13:28.900 --> 13:35.620
on right now at gamerconnect.com and our panel is podcast X zone, right?

13:35.620 --> 13:37.700
And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody.

13:37.700 --> 13:41.780
It's going to be, I'm representing OLR and we're going to, we're hopefully getting some

13:41.780 --> 13:42.980
folks from courthouse too.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.900
And then of course, game buoy podcast, uh, the Koopa club guys out of Chicago are coming

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
out.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.900
They're going to be there.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.580
And, uh, well game bar I think has representation, right?

13:52.580 --> 13:54.140
Am I leaving anybody out so far?

13:54.140 --> 13:55.500
I think it's those shows.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.540
I think that's it.

13:56.540 --> 14:00.460
Although we are in talks with a couple other other podcasts for representation.

14:00.460 --> 14:01.460
Yes.

14:01.460 --> 14:04.180
So, um, podcast X zone at gamer connects, it's going to be fun.

14:04.180 --> 14:06.740
And I hear they're announcing the guests for gamer con later tonight.

14:06.740 --> 14:07.740
So that's, um, that's exciting.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.940
That's going to be a fun show.

14:09.940 --> 14:12.220
Um, all right.

14:12.220 --> 14:15.980
By the way, before I, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address, um,

14:15.980 --> 14:19.180
some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.

14:19.180 --> 14:24.580
So when we were taping live on Bobby Black Wolf, like my usual mic, like died.

14:24.580 --> 14:28.700
So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan

14:28.700 --> 14:32.380
B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.900
Uh, it's just, you know, we had to do a last minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear

14:35.900 --> 14:36.900
us at all.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.380
We replaced Rob with a pod person.

14:38.380 --> 14:42.460
Well, I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming

14:42.460 --> 14:43.460
up as usual.

14:43.460 --> 14:47.700
And I just don't have the time, like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like,

14:47.700 --> 14:52.540
I'll try to make it a little louder, but, um, hopefully it won't sound too terrible

14:52.540 --> 14:56.460
when I listen back to it later because, uh, Shane's messaging me in the chat, like you're

14:56.460 --> 15:00.140
going to hate listening to this later because you sound off.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.660
That's probably accurate.

15:01.660 --> 15:02.980
All right.

15:02.980 --> 15:05.980
Um, anyhow, let's move on.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.540
Uh, Tim, you don't have a podcast.

15:09.540 --> 15:13.300
I don't, I'm sorry to hear that, but you know, you're, you're coming on our show the first

15:13.300 --> 15:14.300
time.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.300
It's a brand new world.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.420
Uh, you work in the games industry.

15:17.420 --> 15:18.420
I do.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.420
Who do you work for?

15:19.420 --> 15:20.420
I work for crystal dynamics.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.540
And what, what would we know out of crystal dynamics?

15:22.540 --> 15:24.820
Uh, we just released a game called Tomb Raider.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.380
Oh, I think I've heard of that.

15:26.380 --> 15:27.380
Yes.

15:27.380 --> 15:28.380
Yeah.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.460
Didn't you guys do that mad cross game that never came out?

15:30.460 --> 15:32.460
No, that was crystal dreams.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.460
Oh yeah.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.420
Do you, do you get that?

15:35.420 --> 15:37.940
Do people get confused with the other companies?

15:37.940 --> 15:41.380
Like I know a telltale and traveler's tales all the time.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.660
I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.

15:43.660 --> 15:47.300
I think, uh, I've gotten a lot of people who, who wonder who are you and then I'll say something

15:47.300 --> 15:50.740
like Tomb Raider or I'll say legacy of Kane and suddenly like, Oh, are you going to make

15:50.740 --> 15:51.740
a new legacy of Kane?

15:51.740 --> 15:55.140
Um, that's probably the most common question.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.140
Are you?

15:56.140 --> 15:57.140
No comment.

15:57.140 --> 15:58.140
Of course.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.140
Of course.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.140
All right.

16:00.140 --> 16:03.740
No, I, I totally respect that obviously.

16:03.740 --> 16:09.860
Um, uh, but there's, there's that DLC for guardian of light that you could go get it

16:09.860 --> 16:10.860
right now.

16:10.860 --> 16:11.860
Wasn't that enough?

16:11.860 --> 16:12.860
Wasn't that enough?

16:12.860 --> 16:14.460
Uh, what, what do you do?

16:14.460 --> 16:17.900
So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what, what did you, what did you do?

16:17.900 --> 16:23.140
So I am a software engineer, meaning I programmed the computers that make them do things.

16:23.140 --> 16:27.700
Um, specifically I work in physics and collision and simulation.

16:27.700 --> 16:33.500
So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, uh, that was me.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.500
So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.900
Uh, sometimes you can blame me.

16:36.900 --> 16:37.900
Or when the clothes clip.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.300
When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.300
Okay.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.540
That's a good thing.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.420
You didn't work on one of the games I played this week.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.860
Cause there was that problem all over, not, not Tomb Raider, maybe clear, not Tomb Raider,

16:48.860 --> 16:49.860
but something else.

16:49.860 --> 16:53.380
I was like, wow, like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as

16:53.380 --> 16:54.460
he's playing it.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.300
That tends to happen.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.580
Does that happen when you play other games?

16:57.580 --> 17:00.060
I you're like, this is, this is, I would have done this so different.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.300
I'm always in that zone.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.220
So I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.380
I'm looking at the performance of their physics.

17:05.380 --> 17:10.100
I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm incredibly critical

17:10.100 --> 17:12.500
and sensitive to those issues.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.140
So specifically, what did you do for Tomb Raider?

17:15.140 --> 17:18.100
Was it, was it all that, that you just named like the clothes and some of that?

17:18.100 --> 17:19.100
Yeah.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.820
All the, uh, you know, a lot of the puzzles are physics based.

17:20.820 --> 17:25.260
That was sort of one of the design goals to make it sort of a living realistic world when

17:25.260 --> 17:26.260
it's driven by physics.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.780
It just feels right to your brain when you see it moving.

17:28.780 --> 17:29.780
Well, yeah.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.780
And when characters don't move right, people, you know, that's, that's one of the first

17:32.780 --> 17:37.620
things games will get razzed for is like, like for instance, captain spike and I always

17:37.620 --> 17:42.220
have this great debate about the game ice climber on the NES and I talk about how the

17:42.220 --> 17:43.220
game is amazing.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.220
There's no debate.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.220
What?

17:45.220 --> 17:46.220
There's no debate.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.340
No, there's totally a debate.

17:48.340 --> 17:52.740
And uh, the game is, but the characters jump really weird and it's like you have to get

17:52.740 --> 17:57.180
used to the physics in the game before the game makes any, you know, sense.

17:57.180 --> 18:01.140
So yeah, when physics are wrong, when especially a character's physics are wrong, you feel

18:01.140 --> 18:04.340
it right away and you don't necessarily know what it is, but it just feels wrong to your

18:04.340 --> 18:05.820
brain.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.060
How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?

18:08.060 --> 18:10.260
Like how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?

18:10.260 --> 18:13.260
How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?

18:13.260 --> 18:14.260
About five years ago.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.260
Oh my God.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.260
Yeah.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.260
It's been a while.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.260
So how long did you have to keep that a secret?

18:18.260 --> 18:19.260
Cause they only announced that what?

18:19.260 --> 18:20.380
Two, two and a half years ago.

18:20.380 --> 18:23.020
I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.020
Oh my gosh.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.020
It was that hard.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.900
Um, not really.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.900
I'm pretty antisocial.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.180
That's the key to NDA.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.180
Be a hermit.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.180
Exactly.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.620
You don't go on podcasts for one.

18:38.620 --> 18:42.620
That's a good way to make sure.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.020
How did you get into that?

18:44.020 --> 18:46.260
Like what, or let me take a step back.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.980
What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?

18:49.980 --> 18:53.220
Like obviously you must've kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did, how did

18:53.220 --> 18:54.220
you end up where you're at?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.620
You know, that's a good question.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.500
I've been a science nerd all my life.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.500
I've also been a computer nerd and there was this obvious cross section I didn't see at

19:01.500 --> 19:04.940
the time, but you know, I went to, I went to undergrad for, for computer science and

19:04.940 --> 19:09.540
later I went to grad school and I did some more computer graphics and gaming centric

19:09.540 --> 19:15.780
studies and I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that and I found simulation

19:15.780 --> 19:18.980
was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.300
How'd you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?

19:21.300 --> 19:31.220
Um, I had a ex classmate who worked there as an artist and he got me an interview and

19:31.220 --> 19:35.060
I just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone, you know, straight

19:35.060 --> 19:37.860
out of grad school and it was the perfect position for me.

19:37.860 --> 19:38.860
So I sort of lucked out.

19:38.860 --> 19:43.860
Tell them you know someone who does print material.

19:43.860 --> 19:47.020
Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.020
Um, okay.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.260
Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.

19:50.260 --> 19:53.960
So like, you know, obviously a lot of people are playing this game right now.

19:53.960 --> 19:58.660
I will re I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking

19:58.660 --> 20:02.260
about when it comes to sales and all that, but the game's great.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.260
Okay, that's you.

20:03.260 --> 20:08.660
That's, you know, I even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great

20:08.660 --> 20:11.500
and I think a lot of people feel the same way.

20:11.500 --> 20:17.820
Um, how or when somebody like plays a game like Tomb Raider and you obviously do a lot

20:17.820 --> 20:21.860
with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?

20:21.860 --> 20:25.300
Like is there is there something that like you pay a special attention to detail to this,

20:25.300 --> 20:28.340
but you think people I don't want to say this so that people don't appreciate it, but like

20:28.540 --> 20:31.500
maybe it like goes unnoticed this, this work that you do?

20:31.500 --> 20:34.980
Well, certainly there's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider and you've

20:34.980 --> 20:38.740
got the people who run right through the game and of course those people have to play the

20:38.740 --> 20:40.340
puzzles, which are based on physics.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.860
So that's sort of shoved in their face.

20:41.860 --> 20:42.940
They can't miss that.

20:42.940 --> 20:47.260
But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid

20:47.260 --> 20:50.900
bodies that are around the world to make the, you know, everything come to life.

20:50.900 --> 20:54.460
Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze and that stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of

20:54.500 --> 20:58.700
time on that to make that look good and natural and it makes the whole environment come alive,

20:58.700 --> 21:02.660
but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at, they sort of will just

21:02.660 --> 21:03.660
run by.

21:03.660 --> 21:08.220
And of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and

21:08.220 --> 21:09.900
cranny and so they're going to see all those little things.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.300
They're going to see every detail that's not correct.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.500
That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.980
You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers

21:17.980 --> 21:18.980
and dah, dah, dah.

21:18.980 --> 21:24.540
And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower to do, right?

21:24.540 --> 21:28.100
Although it's a good thing, Laura Croft can't pick flowers or can she?

21:28.100 --> 21:29.100
She can.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.100
Oh my God.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.100
There are plants to pick.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.100
That's right.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.420
I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.

21:34.420 --> 21:39.680
Well, I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks, you mix the green herb.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.500
And all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them

21:43.500 --> 21:44.500
and move.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
I made those.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.940
Nice.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.060
So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.

21:51.060 --> 21:56.100
Like is that when you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that, you know,

21:56.100 --> 21:58.140
overall the reception you're getting is positive.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.220
Like is that is that important for somebody like you?

22:01.220 --> 22:05.460
Like when you look at reviews and that positive affirmation, is that is that something you're

22:05.460 --> 22:07.860
like, oh, I'm so happy to see that.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.540
Or are you like, it doesn't really change anything?

22:10.540 --> 22:11.860
You know, I'm really proud of the game.

22:11.860 --> 22:17.660
I'm really happy with the whole thing and I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.

22:17.660 --> 22:21.780
And I like to tell myself, I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.780
I love praise.

22:23.780 --> 22:28.220
So, I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.

22:28.220 --> 22:30.020
It is great to read those reviews.

22:30.020 --> 22:35.020
And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing and they really like stick in

22:35.020 --> 22:36.020
my craw.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.020
But, uh, sure.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.020
Sure.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.660
It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for the show, like I'll

22:41.660 --> 22:43.260
go on iTunes and they'll be five star reviews.

22:43.260 --> 22:46.100
I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five star review.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.100
And that was awesome.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.780
And then you go to like a one star review where, you know, it's like everybody's screaming

22:50.780 --> 22:55.220
all the time and I'm just like, okay, I'm going to take that.

22:55.220 --> 22:59.820
At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.

22:59.820 --> 23:00.820
Do you remember that one?

23:00.820 --> 23:02.060
Did that really happen?

23:02.060 --> 23:04.180
Yes, that really happened.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.740
What is wrong with people?

23:05.740 --> 23:08.540
This was like after our second year.

23:08.540 --> 23:11.900
So yeah, I know what you mean.

23:11.900 --> 23:15.340
Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?

23:15.340 --> 23:21.220
No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.220
There's something about me you might not know.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.740
I was implying that was your mother.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.540
It was from Rob Robson.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.580
Oh, uh, okay.

23:28.580 --> 23:32.180
So everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes and they're like the death scenes,

23:32.180 --> 23:33.180
the death scenes.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.980
And, and did Tim, did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?

23:35.980 --> 23:36.980
All right.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.820
I, let me, let me ask you about, I think of when I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the

23:40.820 --> 23:42.580
Conan O'Brien review.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.580
Did you see the Conan O'Brien?

23:43.580 --> 23:44.580
I did.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.300
Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?

23:46.300 --> 23:47.300
Oh yeah.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.940
And there's that, there's that part where, you know, they're, they're doing the, the,

23:51.940 --> 23:56.180
the tree thing over and over and over and they're playing it up for laughs like, but

23:56.180 --> 23:57.580
that's kind of like a serious thing.

23:57.580 --> 23:58.580
It is.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.580
But did you, did you notice the, the quality of the laughs?

24:00.580 --> 24:02.180
They weren't just, Oh, that's hilarious.

24:02.180 --> 24:09.180
It was like every time it was first, Oh, then, then laughter like it didn't lose its impact

24:09.180 --> 24:10.780
after they played it 10 times.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.660
People were still cringing at it.

24:12.740 --> 24:16.860
I mean, I've seen that, that hundreds of times and I still cringe when I see it.

24:16.860 --> 24:17.860
It's kind of gross.

24:17.860 --> 24:18.860
Just saying.

24:18.860 --> 24:19.860
Oh yeah.

24:19.860 --> 24:23.620
I think I've made my decision on what I'm getting on Steam.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.420
I thought you already had the Tomb Raider.

24:25.420 --> 24:30.300
No, cause I didn't have the money at the time.

24:30.300 --> 24:34.940
You know, there's, there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of like, I, I, I see

24:34.940 --> 24:35.940
it.

24:35.940 --> 24:40.340
I don't know if it was intentional, but I see elements of like Metroidvania, like that

24:40.340 --> 24:42.980
type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before, but I kind of see it

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
in there now.

24:43.980 --> 24:47.700
Um, do you, do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider?

24:47.700 --> 24:51.460
Cause I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, like, cause clearly you're

24:51.460 --> 24:55.220
wearing a Mass Effect hoodie, but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.220
Yeah, I know.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.220
I know.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.220
I know.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.780
But, uh, since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, do you, do you get inspiration

25:01.780 --> 25:02.780
from other games?

25:02.780 --> 25:06.740
Do you, do you see things in other games that, you know, you, you want to do with Tomb Raider

25:06.740 --> 25:07.740
or?

25:07.740 --> 25:08.740
I do.

25:08.860 --> 25:11.220
I'm not really the one making those decisions.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.780
That's the creative and the design team.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.620
So while there may be games that I like, and I think, Hey, we should, we should take, you

25:17.620 --> 25:19.740
know, take this element from that game because it's awesome.

25:19.740 --> 25:21.640
Cause there's something to learn there.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.920
It's not going to go ignored, but it's really, it's not really my place.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.900
It's not the, it's not the problems I'm trying to solve.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.940
And there are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.

25:31.940 --> 25:32.940
But yes, they do.

25:32.940 --> 25:36.540
They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.

25:36.540 --> 25:41.660
We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.

25:41.660 --> 25:42.660
Oh my God.

25:42.660 --> 25:43.660
It wasn't.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.660
Okay.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.900
So when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.860
And I'm like, it is, it is totally like that movie.

25:48.860 --> 25:53.060
We had some like shot for shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.

25:53.060 --> 25:57.180
We sat like as a studio back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.180
It's so scary.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.660
It scared the crap out of me.

25:59.660 --> 26:00.660
I will never watch that movie again.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.940
I saw that on the big screen.

26:01.940 --> 26:02.940
Okay.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.620
That movie creeped me out so hard.

26:04.620 --> 26:05.620
Oh my gosh.

26:05.700 --> 26:12.180
I still like what Alan called the game though, Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible,

26:12.180 --> 26:13.180
very bad day.

26:13.180 --> 26:14.820
Or whatever that book was.

26:14.820 --> 26:20.940
No, I think he also just called it Girl.

26:20.940 --> 26:25.260
So Girl is the first, the first girl game.

26:25.260 --> 26:29.380
No, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?

26:29.380 --> 26:32.460
And so multiplayer, you know, I do the other show about Warcraft.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.420
We talk about PvE and PvP all the time.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.740
PvP is unpredictable.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.380
You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.180
You know what attacks the, the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to

26:42.180 --> 26:44.420
do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.

26:44.420 --> 26:49.420
Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause like different things when you're planning

26:49.420 --> 26:50.620
environments and things like that?

26:50.620 --> 26:53.620
Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that or similar?

26:53.620 --> 26:55.180
I actually didn't work on multiplayer.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.180
What?

26:56.180 --> 27:01.100
Multiplayer was, was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.

27:01.100 --> 27:05.900
So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.

27:05.900 --> 27:12.020
We worked on single player in Redwood City and then in Montreal, they worked on multiplayer.

27:12.020 --> 27:16.100
So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part

27:16.100 --> 27:18.100
of the active development of that.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
Interesting.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.100
Okay.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.100
Have you played the multiplayer?

27:21.100 --> 27:24.180
I played a little bit of the multiplayer.

27:24.180 --> 27:31.780
I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.180
You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?

27:34.180 --> 27:35.340
I did for a little while.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.260
I tend to bounce around at the studio.

27:37.260 --> 27:38.260
That was good.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.260
Yeah.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.260
I liked Guardian of Light too.

27:40.260 --> 27:41.260
Well, Guardian of Light was more like an arcade-y for me.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.260
Yes, exactly.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.260
I mean, that's not a bad thing.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.660
It's just, you know, this was on Xbox Live Arcade.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.040
This was supposed to happen, right?

27:47.040 --> 27:51.020
So here's the thing though, is that here's what I don't understand about Guardian of

27:51.020 --> 27:54.820
Light and I need help, is that, you know, you have the Guardian of Light game and that's

27:54.820 --> 27:57.260
Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura.

27:57.260 --> 28:02.200
So you've got, is there two Loras now or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light,

28:02.200 --> 28:04.900
you know, was like, it's not really about that anymore.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.420
It's about like Laura or what?

28:06.420 --> 28:09.100
Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.340
We're going to start over.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.340
We're going to create a brand new, you know, a brand new property.

28:14.340 --> 28:16.200
We're going to do everything over.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.300
So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.660
It was a different game.

28:20.660 --> 28:21.820
It was a different universe.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.420
We want a fresh start.

28:23.420 --> 28:26.360
We don't want to be, have any baggage from any other games.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.820
So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.

28:30.820 --> 28:35.420
I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.420
Okay.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.740
Except I think it will be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.740
All right.

28:40.740 --> 28:41.740
Yeah.

28:41.740 --> 28:44.740
Well, I'll stop, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know, you know, when

28:44.740 --> 28:47.900
it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you can't, you do and you don't want

28:47.900 --> 28:48.900
to say.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.100
Let me, let me just turn it over to you for anything general.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.260
Like, is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or, you know,

28:54.260 --> 28:56.940
about your work or what have you?

28:56.940 --> 29:01.020
I really think you guys should all buy it.

29:01.020 --> 29:02.780
Really appreciate that.

29:02.780 --> 29:06.420
Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.

29:06.420 --> 29:10.020
How did you get into just not, not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this,

29:10.020 --> 29:12.020
how did you get into just games?

29:12.020 --> 29:14.060
Why are you like a video gamer?

29:14.060 --> 29:17.540
I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.

29:17.540 --> 29:21.780
We had an Atari 2600 in the house.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.500
No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.700
And then I sort of like, this is mine.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.340
I want to, I want to have this all the time.

29:32.340 --> 29:36.420
And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems and I only got a few.

29:36.420 --> 29:37.540
I got the NES.

29:37.540 --> 29:41.060
They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo and that was the worst thing in the world.

29:41.060 --> 29:46.940
But like the best thing in the world was to go over to like my cousin's house or certain

29:46.940 --> 29:52.580
neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was, that was the coolest shit ever.

29:52.580 --> 29:53.780
So I was a big computer nerd.

29:53.780 --> 29:54.780
I liked to program.

29:54.780 --> 29:59.620
When I first taught myself how to program, it was in Q basic and I, the first things

29:59.620 --> 30:05.660
I did was try to make games and they were horrible, awful, like they weren't even games.

30:05.660 --> 30:11.300
They were just like shapes floating around and weird sounds, but I was trying.

30:11.300 --> 30:15.060
And so I sort of knew my calling from a very young age.

30:15.060 --> 30:16.260
That's awesome.

30:16.260 --> 30:20.340
So that's kind of, you just, you just started, you made your own little games and then it

30:20.340 --> 30:23.380
just kept evolving and evolving and now you work in the industry.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.380
Exactly.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.380
That's awesome.

30:25.380 --> 30:28.140
Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry?

30:28.140 --> 30:30.780
Like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I kind of want

30:30.780 --> 30:31.780
to, I want to work in games.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.780
You have any advice?

30:32.780 --> 30:33.780
Uh, yeah.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.660
Uh, you know, make games.

30:35.660 --> 30:39.380
A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer

30:39.380 --> 30:41.540
so I'm going to go do computer science or something.

30:41.540 --> 30:45.060
But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related

30:45.060 --> 30:50.180
to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers

30:50.180 --> 30:53.780
that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.

30:53.780 --> 30:58.260
So as early as possible, start making games.

30:58.260 --> 30:59.460
They don't have to be great.

30:59.460 --> 31:00.900
You can start modding other games.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.780
You can start scripting within packages.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.940
You can use free engines like Unity.

31:07.940 --> 31:10.340
There's a lot of resources out there.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.880
So make as many games as you can.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.740
Show people that you're passionate about it.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.620
Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

31:17.620 --> 31:21.180
Um, ActDeaf says your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.300
Worst parents ever.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.700
They are the worst parents ever.

31:24.700 --> 31:25.700
Never forgive them for that.

31:25.700 --> 31:26.700
That's not nice.

31:26.700 --> 31:32.100
I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.580
I had to cut a lot of grass.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.580
That's awesome.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.580
Uh, let's see.

31:38.100 --> 31:41.460
BlackWolf says I wrote games in Q Basic 2.

31:41.460 --> 31:45.100
Did you ever play the Gorillaz game in Q Basic?

31:45.100 --> 31:46.100
That was one of the samples.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.460
It was like a game where you just throw bananas at each other.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.460
It was great.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.100
Did you do Q Basic 2, Loki?

31:52.100 --> 31:53.940
I played around with Q Basic.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.460
We like, I don't know.

31:55.460 --> 32:03.340
I change colors of things and, you know, I also have the strategy of setting the speed

32:03.340 --> 32:07.460
of the banana to be super high so that you sort of clip through the buildings.

32:07.460 --> 32:10.460
So you throw it and you get stuck in the middle of the building and you just keep throwing

32:10.460 --> 32:12.660
it in a straight line to the next person.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.740
Ah, the classic tunneling problem.

32:14.740 --> 32:20.220
I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.100
That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.300
Oh, the games I made on my TI-82.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.300
I love that game.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.820
See, I couldn't do any of that shit.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.760
I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends.

32:30.760 --> 32:31.760
I'm with you on this.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.760
Right?

32:32.760 --> 32:33.760
Look where we ended up.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.220
See, now when I get a game, I have to mod it.

32:36.220 --> 32:40.780
I had to drop out of my calculus class because that's all I did was play with my TI-82.

32:40.780 --> 32:46.980
I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game type thing and I got the engine done,

32:46.980 --> 32:49.220
but I mean, the TI-82 sucks.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.940
Well Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?

32:51.940 --> 32:52.940
Yeah.

32:52.940 --> 32:56.820
There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class and by the time he was done,

32:56.820 --> 33:00.780
I was playing a pole position on his graphing calculator.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.780
It was awesome.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.780
Awesome.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.180
Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.

33:04.180 --> 33:05.180
Start small.

33:05.180 --> 33:09.740
You laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to

33:09.740 --> 33:10.740
be creative.

33:10.740 --> 33:15.700
I will say, I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the

33:15.700 --> 33:19.300
basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines, right?

33:19.300 --> 33:22.140
And then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.

33:22.140 --> 33:24.540
If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.

33:24.540 --> 33:25.540
I changed the color.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.540
You know?

33:26.540 --> 33:27.540
So I don't know.

33:27.540 --> 33:28.540
This is me.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.540
Okay.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.540
One more question, then we're going to get into our gaming weeks.

33:30.540 --> 33:35.980
But same thing I asked Spike a minute ago, what is like your favorite video game ever?

33:35.980 --> 33:38.140
You're not allowed to name something you worked on.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.500
Oh, damn it.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.940
I'm taking that off the table right now.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.260
So what's like your favorite video game ever?

33:44.260 --> 33:46.020
You know what I'm really bad at?

33:46.020 --> 33:47.020
Coming up with favorites.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.020
Yeah?

33:48.020 --> 33:49.020
Hmm.

33:49.020 --> 33:54.900
Well, I'm wearing a jacket from Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.980
Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.

33:56.980 --> 33:58.620
So Jamie's like...

33:58.620 --> 33:59.620
That's why we're all friends.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.020
We're great friends because of that.

34:03.020 --> 34:07.820
But and to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Brothers 3.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.580
I'm going to say Super Mario Brothers 3.

34:09.580 --> 34:13.660
Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.

34:13.660 --> 34:14.660
Is this like a thing?

34:14.660 --> 34:16.140
It's a little bit of a thing.

34:16.140 --> 34:19.340
Like Super Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World?

34:19.340 --> 34:20.340
Yeah.

34:20.340 --> 34:23.980
A little bit comes from a place of bitterness for not owning Super Mario World, but...

34:23.980 --> 34:26.420
Oh, so it goes back to that again.

34:26.420 --> 34:33.940
Well Captain Spike, what's your problem with Mario 3 then?

34:33.940 --> 34:37.940
He didn't know in Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.

34:37.940 --> 34:42.140
What's your hatred towards Super Mario Brothers 3?

34:42.140 --> 34:45.660
If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.

34:45.660 --> 34:46.980
Everyone loves it so I hate it.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.940
I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.

34:48.940 --> 34:49.940
Yeah, I knew you were.

34:49.940 --> 34:50.940
That's why I cut you off.

34:50.940 --> 34:53.500
What are your thoughts on Ocarina then?

34:53.500 --> 35:03.460
Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.980
Well you know what guys, I think I'm going to help you guys out here with this whole

35:06.980 --> 35:09.620
Mario Brothers 3 and Mario World thing.

35:09.620 --> 35:14.420
There's really only one way we can solve this and that is to ask the audience, ladies and

35:14.420 --> 35:15.420
gentlemen.

35:15.420 --> 35:23.180
So I'm going to put up a live poll at live.vognetwork.com right now and the question goes like this.

35:23.180 --> 35:29.460
Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.060
I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.

35:32.060 --> 35:36.660
No because this is about the Mario's there.

35:36.660 --> 35:41.620
Remember you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that

35:41.620 --> 35:44.540
pop up right there underneath the chat and you can vote in the poll.

35:44.540 --> 35:50.180
Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.300
Either it was Mario is missing.

35:53.300 --> 35:57.140
Mario typing?

35:57.140 --> 35:58.700
We'll get to the results here momentarily.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.860
Looking at the results as they're coming in, of course it's tied.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.540
I mean you said that, it switched.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.380
Oh Mario World just took the lead.

36:06.380 --> 36:07.860
And then there's someone who's like no one.

36:07.860 --> 36:10.660
Oh look, it flipped again.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.740
Someone did do a no one curve vote.

36:12.740 --> 36:15.580
Yeah, oh Mario 3 just pulled way ahead.

36:15.580 --> 36:16.580
We'll see.

36:16.580 --> 36:17.580
Alright.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.140
We'll get to the results for you here momentarily.

36:19.140 --> 36:23.780
But first I think, first off thank you Tim, you did great for your first podcast.

36:23.780 --> 36:24.980
I learned some stuff.

36:24.980 --> 36:25.980
Thank you.

36:25.980 --> 36:26.980
Thanks for having me.

36:26.980 --> 36:27.980
No problem.

36:27.980 --> 36:28.980
Thanks for dealing with me.

36:28.980 --> 36:29.980
Please.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.220
You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain

36:32.220 --> 36:33.220
Spike, right?

36:33.220 --> 36:34.220
Yes?

36:34.220 --> 36:35.220
Good?

36:35.220 --> 36:36.220
Or no, you're out of here.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.220
Bye.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.220
No, just kidding.

36:38.220 --> 36:39.220
Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.

36:39.220 --> 36:41.500
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

36:41.500 --> 36:43.400
been playing this week.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.220
So Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

36:45.220 --> 36:47.300
I figured out I'm old.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.660
I played DDR last night.

36:49.660 --> 36:52.740
I felt like death warmed over after I was done.

36:52.740 --> 36:55.260
I can't beat an eight footer anymore, Rob.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.780
Wait, I can't do superstar anymore, Rob.

36:57.780 --> 37:03.140
Well, I don't think you're going to be able to just do it the first game either, you know?

37:03.140 --> 37:04.140
You know what you need?

37:04.140 --> 37:05.140
Hmm?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.140
She needs a montage.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.980
I do not need a freaking montage.

37:07.980 --> 37:10.980
It's where you get better in a short amount of time.

37:10.980 --> 37:11.980
That is true.

37:11.980 --> 37:12.980
Gotta have a montage.

37:13.660 --> 37:18.260
I'm actually, though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have

37:18.260 --> 37:19.260
nothing else to do.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.860
I'm unemployed.

37:20.860 --> 37:27.340
So I also, I guess I can say now that I'm playing it, even though I can't say anything

37:27.340 --> 37:34.740
else about it, is I'm playing the beta Final Fantasy 14.

37:34.740 --> 37:39.140
Yeah, they did a partial NDA lift on that tonight, which still doesn't make sense to

37:39.140 --> 37:40.140
me.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.260
You can talk about, what, character creation and Gridania, but you can't talk about anything

37:44.260 --> 37:45.260
else.

37:45.260 --> 37:46.260
I have a cat girl.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.860
And I have a midget.

37:47.860 --> 37:49.020
That's it.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.140
And Gridania is full of trees.

37:52.140 --> 37:53.140
How's that?

37:53.140 --> 37:54.140
You think that works?

37:54.140 --> 37:55.140
It's lovely.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.140
Thank you.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
So it's Windurst.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.460
I don't know why they changed the names of all the characters.

38:00.460 --> 38:02.520
I mean, just keep the races the same.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
Why do you have to change the name?

38:03.520 --> 38:05.940
Are they the Mikote is what the cat people are?

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
Yeah.

38:07.020 --> 38:11.260
Seriously, Taratar or Lala, whatever the hell is.

38:11.260 --> 38:14.860
The first time I saw Lala fell, I misspelled it as falafel.

38:14.860 --> 38:23.380
So now I call them the falafel people, but I know I can't really give my opinion of it,

38:23.380 --> 38:32.940
but it's, I'd say graphically on par with modern.

38:32.940 --> 38:33.940
Which is good.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.940
Definitely.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.100
It's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.

38:36.100 --> 38:40.180
I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in processing, in the processing power

38:40.180 --> 38:42.900
required, it's definitely a big step over a while.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.620
That I'm sure I can say.

38:44.620 --> 38:50.460
So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June, I started playing Phantasy Star

38:50.460 --> 38:56.140
Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, Prince Brightstar.

38:56.140 --> 39:00.520
And I actually, there was a patch that happened after I started playing.

39:00.520 --> 39:08.480
So I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little red head Newman

39:08.480 --> 39:10.060
person chick.

39:10.060 --> 39:14.060
And I want an Oppa Oppa mag.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.060
I don't care.

39:15.060 --> 39:19.800
I worked my ass off to have an Oppa Oppa in the first Phantasy Star Online and god damn

39:19.800 --> 39:25.000
it, I'm going to have another Oppa Oppa and I'm going to have a Master System because

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Sega nerd.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.120
Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid, technically it was my brothers, but

39:30.120 --> 39:35.640
I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.600
And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.

39:39.600 --> 39:43.440
We left Rock Band out, so I did some, I tried singing alone.

39:43.440 --> 39:48.800
I played Minecraft last night trying to get this, someone made the Ocarina of Time map

39:48.800 --> 39:52.160
in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load and I still can't figure out how to get

39:52.160 --> 39:57.240
it to load as its own world, so whatever.

39:57.240 --> 40:04.440
And so instead I just went around in my house digging more gopher holes in my house.

40:04.440 --> 40:09.400
And god what else did I play, I played something else, oh Drunken Robot Pornography.

40:09.400 --> 40:13.160
Which is super awesome, it's like jumping flash on crack, I've been telling everyone

40:13.160 --> 40:15.320
about it.

40:15.320 --> 40:19.480
And I got the indie pack last night.

40:19.480 --> 40:24.720
I've only installed, well it's not really an indie pack because it does have Back to

40:24.720 --> 40:31.880
the Future, all five parts of the Back to the Future series from Telltale, and right

40:31.880 --> 40:37.680
now the minimum pay on it is like five bucks, but if you pay eight, then when the extra

40:37.680 --> 40:41.400
content comes out then you get all that, and you get like, there's another one that's like

40:41.400 --> 40:45.800
cargo something, it looked interesting, it was a neat game.

40:45.800 --> 40:52.160
So I've downloaded a few games, there's that Dungeon Quest or something, it's like a puzzle

40:52.160 --> 40:53.160
game.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.160
But it's sort of a side scrolling combat puzzle game.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.160
Oh the Dungeon Hearts.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.160
Yeah Dungeon Hearts, that's it.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.840
Shane just did a review of that, it just went up on VoG today.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.960
Yeah it was part of the deal, so I mean I spent like eight bucks and got some good games

41:03.960 --> 41:08.760
and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.

41:08.760 --> 41:14.720
And I didn't play any of them yet, I just installed a few of them because I have been

41:14.720 --> 41:17.160
working on projects.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.920
And that's my gaming week.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.920
Before we go to Loki.

41:20.920 --> 41:24.040
One last thing, Dan's been playing Grid 2.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.040
The racing game?

41:25.040 --> 41:26.720
Yes, with his three monitor setup.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.760
He's such a man.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.760
So manly dudely.

41:29.760 --> 41:36.600
I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my tumblr, just to show off what his setup looks like,

41:36.600 --> 41:39.280
so that's it.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.440
Awesome.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.560
Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki.

41:43.560 --> 41:49.720
The results of the live poll, which is better, the winner with 54.17% of the vote, Mario

41:49.720 --> 41:50.720
3.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.920
Hells yeah.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.920
Captain Spike, sorry about it.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.440
I'm going home.

41:57.440 --> 42:01.480
You taking your ball and going home?

42:01.480 --> 42:03.920
Alright so Mario 3 is the winner there.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.400
But there was a couple votes for neither one, jeez.

42:07.400 --> 42:12.960
But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.440
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

42:15.440 --> 42:18.920
I bought stuff too, I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.

42:18.920 --> 42:25.280
Okay so, what the hell, seriously Rockstar Games, during the weekend it's supposed to

42:25.280 --> 42:28.160
be the Steam sale, okay, it's on sale during the weekend.

42:28.160 --> 42:32.080
And then today they're like, guess what, we're pulling fucking double sale, we're marking

42:32.080 --> 42:33.080
down again.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.520
I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.680
I mean it was 25 bucks for all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's 12 bucks for all

42:40.680 --> 42:41.680
the Grand Theft Auto games.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.560
So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.

42:44.560 --> 42:49.240
So I picked that up, and then also the indie bundle as well, haven't really installed anything

42:49.240 --> 42:53.400
other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.240
Still haven't played that though.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.240
Been playing Saints Row the Third on PC, just trying to 100% everything.

42:59.240 --> 43:03.080
Technically according to the game I am 100% right now, because I have all the unlockables

43:03.080 --> 43:04.080
and stuff.

43:04.080 --> 43:10.360
But I need to do all the Saints book stuff, which is really boring from what I remember

43:10.360 --> 43:11.360
the last time.

43:11.360 --> 43:15.120
It took me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because I had all that pretty much

43:15.120 --> 43:19.200
done except for one carjacking, or one car theft mission.

43:19.200 --> 43:23.800
So I have to do it all over again.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.120
I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.

43:27.120 --> 43:30.800
Oh we were talking about that last week, that video was hilarious that you were showing

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
us.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.800
That game is fucking hilarious.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
It's just awesome.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
DM got grossed out.

43:34.800 --> 43:38.960
I just don't know, I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery, I had to

43:38.960 --> 43:40.160
go watch it on YouTube or something.

43:40.160 --> 43:44.200
I managed to, it was kind of gross but funny at the same time.

43:44.200 --> 43:47.240
So I was like, okay, I'm going to take out all the ribs, because that's the only way

43:47.240 --> 43:49.160
I can get to the heart and get these organs out of here.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.400
So I took out all the ribs.

43:50.400 --> 43:53.840
The lung was still stuck though, so I had to jiggle it back and forth, and it made a

43:53.840 --> 43:55.880
squishy sound as you were doing it.

43:55.880 --> 43:59.320
You know, trying to get the lungs out.

43:59.320 --> 44:05.160
So then I got the lung out, and it kind of flung out, so it landed on the floor or something.

44:05.160 --> 44:09.400
And then I got the other lung out, and I did the same thing with, I don't know, something

44:09.440 --> 44:13.000
that was in the bottom, I think it was the liver or something, I can't really tell.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.280
Organ three, I don't know.

44:15.280 --> 44:20.360
Still can't figure out how to get the heart out though, because the stomach and the esophagus

44:20.360 --> 44:26.640
are still in there, and I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.600
So I don't know, I still can't pass that.

44:28.600 --> 44:32.640
So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock, and I assumed that it was a no.

44:32.640 --> 44:33.640
Try pickaxe.

44:33.640 --> 44:34.640
Pickaxe?

44:34.640 --> 44:39.080
I tried the axe, I tried the saw, all I did was kill him.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.640
So I don't know.

44:41.640 --> 44:48.120
I saw someone trying to do that one, and there was a stint that you could insert in, but

44:48.120 --> 44:50.800
this is the one that Dan and I were watching, and we just got through the whole part where

44:50.800 --> 44:53.360
the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.360
Oh, that was hard.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.880
Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there, and I'm like, oh, this is it?

44:56.880 --> 45:00.760
I was like, just swallow some pills, you've got diazepines, so swallow some pills and

45:00.760 --> 45:01.760
calm yourself.

45:01.760 --> 45:05.000
Okay, Dungeon Buster's talking about this game in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

45:05.000 --> 45:07.040
saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.040
The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.920
What is wrong with this game?

45:13.920 --> 45:17.200
Best game ever, or best game ever.

45:17.200 --> 45:20.160
Don't make me go to a live poll.

45:20.160 --> 45:23.240
It's pretty awesome, I mean, it is pretty awesome.

45:23.240 --> 45:28.280
But so yeah, I played a bunch of that, and then actually something I'm gonna try to bring

45:28.280 --> 45:32.800
back that I tried this week, very short notice so no one joined, it's fine, because I still

45:32.800 --> 45:34.160
had fun playing it.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.480
I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.

45:36.520 --> 45:40.360
It's cool, no worries, seriously, it was very short notice, I decided, hey, let's bring

45:40.360 --> 45:41.800
back VoG game night.

45:41.800 --> 45:47.480
So that's what I'm gonna start doing, Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, you know, pick a game.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.280
It doesn't matter, whatever, you can live stream something, I don't care.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.720
I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
Well that's fine.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.880
Well why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VoG losers?

45:54.880 --> 45:57.160
Oh fuck no, I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.120
No, VoG game night will never be Mass Effect 3, I'm sorry, unless I'm out one night and

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
then you can host it.

46:02.120 --> 46:06.440
At any game convention, there's multiple games to pick from, so I'm sure it'll be fine.

46:06.440 --> 46:11.520
So this coming week, I'm gonna do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA, which is fine, because

46:11.520 --> 46:16.360
I haven't actually played that in a while, so I played that for like two or three hours

46:16.360 --> 46:17.880
and it was fun.

46:17.880 --> 46:22.600
I miss that, because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on

46:22.600 --> 46:28.520
the server that we have up, the VoG server, but survival's kind of fun, I mean, for a

46:28.520 --> 46:33.760
while, and then you want to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff, but

46:33.760 --> 46:37.400
for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun, so it was kind of fun to kind of play something

46:37.400 --> 46:41.360
different than just creative mode, and I forgot that you have to eat.

46:41.360 --> 46:48.040
I'm like, oh shit, that's right, you have to do that now, so it was kind of fun.

46:48.040 --> 46:52.000
So I played that, and god, what else?

46:52.000 --> 46:54.080
I know there's gotta be some other shit I played.

46:54.080 --> 46:57.840
Oh, you know, Call of Duty, actually I've been playing Call of Duty Marvel Warfare 3

46:57.840 --> 47:02.760
through the campaign, because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with, we're

47:02.760 --> 47:08.000
trying to get more people in, so played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot

47:08.000 --> 47:14.760
of the campaign, and it's okay, it's kind of comparable, and then I think I played Defiance

47:14.760 --> 47:16.600
one of these nights, which is, it's still fun.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
Good.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.600
Did you watch the show?

47:18.600 --> 47:19.600
Are you watching the show too?

47:19.600 --> 47:22.880
No, I'm not watching the show, it's a sci-fi show, come on, I know where the bar is set

47:22.880 --> 47:23.880
on that, okay?

47:23.880 --> 47:24.880
How rude!

47:24.880 --> 47:26.440
Isn't he rude right now?

47:26.440 --> 47:27.440
Rude?

47:27.440 --> 47:31.000
I'm sorry, sci-fi, purveyors of such wonderful films as Sharktopus.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.560
Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.

47:33.560 --> 47:39.520
No, sci-fi the network, no, I'm not doggin' sci-fi, like, the genre, I'm saying sci-fi

47:39.520 --> 47:40.520
the TV network.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.400
Alright, well that's acceptable.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.400
That's fine.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400
I mean, I just...

47:46.400 --> 47:47.400
Man-skeeto.

47:47.400 --> 47:55.440
I'm sorry, I'm sure it's good, but it's just, I'm not into the world, I mean, if it was

47:55.440 --> 47:58.120
like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better, but I just don't...

47:58.120 --> 48:00.120
You're not excited about Sharknado?

48:01.120 --> 48:03.680
That is, like, who's in Sharknado?

48:03.680 --> 48:06.520
It's like, legit a thing.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.520
It's a real thing, yeah.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.280
Megashark versus Giant Octopus, starring the wonderful Deborah Nielson.

48:11.280 --> 48:15.120
No, here's something that it's kind of, I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least

48:15.120 --> 48:21.600
seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out, Birdemic 2.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.840
That warranted a sequel?

48:22.840 --> 48:27.600
Yeah, the guy thought it was good, and so he made another movie, like, he seriously

48:27.600 --> 48:28.600
thinks it's good.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.120
I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
from it.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.120
Done.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.600
I'm gonna spend another 10,000 in five days.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.600
Rob found it, Sharknado.

48:38.600 --> 48:44.640
Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210, and Tara Reid is the star of

48:44.640 --> 48:45.640
Sharknado.

48:45.640 --> 48:46.640
Is she gonna be the shark?

48:46.640 --> 48:47.640
I am here for that.

48:47.640 --> 48:48.800
Wait, when does this come on?

48:48.800 --> 48:54.080
I don't know, what day is, oh, um, I'm trying to look at IMDB'd if you go.

48:54.080 --> 48:58.280
So what exactly is a Sharknado, is that like a tornado with sharks in it, or?

48:58.280 --> 49:04.820
I, I, Tigerclaw, help me out, I need- Good idea, bad idea.

49:04.820 --> 49:10.560
By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Hoard House multiplayer stream.

49:10.560 --> 49:14.000
Oh yeah, I like, I like doing the live streaming for World War 1.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.720
Where I turn into a very potty mouthed person.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.520
What they need is just do land sharks.

49:19.520 --> 49:24.160
Land sharks, and have like, you know- But it has to have, knock on the door and

49:24.160 --> 49:25.160
go cannygram.

49:25.160 --> 49:29.360
Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.640
That's it, yeah, that was it.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.920
So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
So Minecraft XBLA.

49:34.920 --> 49:39.000
I'll put up, there's gonna be a thread on the forums, hopefully we can put up like a

49:39.000 --> 49:41.920
calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up, and also let me

49:41.920 --> 49:43.480
know what games you want to play.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.800
Not Mass Effect 3.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.960
I will try to make this quick.

49:48.960 --> 49:54.600
I had fun, we went to Golf Land, Spike, Tim and I yesterday, and, well not that there

49:54.600 --> 49:59.220
was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of

49:59.220 --> 50:04.680
songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just

50:04.680 --> 50:07.840
jumping into a set of songs.

50:07.840 --> 50:12.480
But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing

50:12.480 --> 50:14.960
DDR every day like I used to then.

50:14.960 --> 50:19.200
So you know, and I don't work out or anything like that, so it's a little difficult to just

50:19.200 --> 50:21.440
get up there and do it.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.760
But it was fun.

50:23.760 --> 50:27.200
There's a lot about DDR I really miss, so I just wanted to kind of throw that out there

50:27.200 --> 50:29.280
for the long time Bimani fans.

50:29.280 --> 50:33.520
There's one thing I forgot to say by the way, because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly

50:33.520 --> 50:36.240
Crappy Pizza, they had a doodle jump arcade game.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.800
Yeah, they had that at RVGL too, I was surprised.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
Yeah, so anyway.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.640
They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
As you were.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.640
Alright, yeah, yeah.

50:44.640 --> 50:49.960
Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.

50:49.960 --> 50:53.440
We were trying to find four player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect

50:53.440 --> 50:58.560
Dark, Doom, Age of Swing, which somebody commented on Facebook, why are you playing

50:58.560 --> 50:59.560
that?

50:59.560 --> 51:00.560
I'm like, it's four players!

51:00.560 --> 51:01.560
Shut up.

51:01.560 --> 51:05.480
And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four player games.

51:05.480 --> 51:08.160
This random ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.

51:08.160 --> 51:09.920
The THQ published one, yeah.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.200
Yeah, it wasn't bad.

51:11.200 --> 51:14.760
Tetris Evolution, it's years old, but not bad.

51:14.760 --> 51:19.920
Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played, and I wrote a review

51:19.920 --> 51:24.720
of this that you can read at vognetwork.com, and the game is Dead Island Riptide.

51:24.720 --> 51:26.880
And I gave it a D plus on the site.

51:26.880 --> 51:31.680
I didn't, there was a lot about it I didn't really care for, but I want to acknowledge

51:31.680 --> 51:36.840
that I realize there's a lot of people that already know, like, Dead Island Riptide, I

51:36.840 --> 51:38.200
am totally here for this.

51:38.200 --> 51:43.800
Like, I want to dismember zombies in many creative ways, I want to make these new weapons,

51:43.800 --> 51:48.400
I want the lols that come from, you know, the zombie murder fest, and, you know, kind

51:48.400 --> 51:52.880
of like a B movie game, like Sharknado the game, basically, right?

51:52.880 --> 51:56.120
So there's people that are totally going to be into that, and I can respect that.

51:56.120 --> 51:59.360
And you know, this game is really for that crowd.

51:59.360 --> 52:05.240
But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges, like for instances, zombies that,

52:05.240 --> 52:08.660
you know, I would be facing one direction, and I'd suddenly turn, and suddenly when the

52:08.660 --> 52:12.220
zombies in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up, and it would just

52:12.220 --> 52:16.500
fall down, and then get back up again, like, just this weird stuff that would happen.

52:16.500 --> 52:17.500
Well, just kidding.

52:17.500 --> 52:24.740
And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good, and some other, it's all environmental

52:24.740 --> 52:25.740
too, Tim.

52:25.740 --> 52:29.900
Yeah, I mean, the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't, you know, super impressed.

52:29.900 --> 52:33.860
So yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.

52:33.860 --> 52:40.300
I found it to be a bit repetitive, but you know, if you like the first game, this is

52:40.300 --> 52:45.260
more of the same, which for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.

52:45.260 --> 52:48.380
So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.340
I'm not going to tell you.

52:50.340 --> 52:53.380
Go check it out if you're on the bubble.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.500
No.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.660
Get a rental, maybe.

52:56.660 --> 53:00.700
A rental with friends on a night you're all going to drink.

53:00.700 --> 53:04.820
Great idea for Dead Island Riptide.

53:04.820 --> 53:05.820
I guess that's it.

53:05.820 --> 53:06.820
That's really all I want to say about games.

53:06.820 --> 53:09.120
I want to hear about Spike and Tim and their gaming week.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.760
So Captain Spike, what's a gaming week look like for you?

53:12.760 --> 53:15.800
Mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.

53:15.800 --> 53:18.200
I couldn't stand the demo of that game.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.200
What's up?

53:19.200 --> 53:20.200
The demo is awful.

53:20.200 --> 53:25.480
Okay, so what am I missing by not, well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible

53:25.480 --> 53:27.640
demos and it's been a trend recently.

53:27.640 --> 53:32.040
Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.040
What else?

53:33.040 --> 53:34.040
There was another one not that long ago.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.040
It was really bad too.

53:35.040 --> 53:40.880
It was Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter and I played this demo

53:40.880 --> 53:46.040
and I'm like, nope, delete, but you are really into this.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
What am I missing?

53:47.040 --> 53:50.200
Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.

53:50.200 --> 53:55.480
There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point

53:55.480 --> 54:01.040
of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how the enemy behaviors interact

54:01.040 --> 54:04.600
with their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack.

54:04.600 --> 54:05.640
I really like it.

54:05.640 --> 54:10.360
I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game, but the demo is awful.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.400
It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.

54:12.400 --> 54:16.640
It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters and just says, oh, hack them

54:16.640 --> 54:23.120
until they're dead, which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.280
But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.520
I've put in something like 120 hours already.

54:28.520 --> 54:29.520
Wow.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.520
That's commitment.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.520
Yeah.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.520
I'm the kind of guy I usually pick up games.

54:32.520 --> 54:37.560
I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple of hours and never touch it again, which is an awful

54:37.560 --> 54:38.560
thing.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
I don't think that's cool.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.560
You and me both, buddy.

54:40.560 --> 54:43.280
That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.400
It's called Gamer ADD.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.880
You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
Oh, shiny.

54:48.880 --> 54:49.880
Yep.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.880
Yep.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.880
Oh, shit.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
Steam's Tale.

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
Download, download, download.

54:53.880 --> 54:54.880
Yeah.

54:54.880 --> 54:55.880
Yeah.

54:55.880 --> 55:00.720
But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night,

55:00.720 --> 55:07.360
and I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.560
Good times.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.440
You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?

55:11.440 --> 55:12.440
Huge fan.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.440
Yeah?

55:13.440 --> 55:14.440
Yeah.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.440
Okay.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.440
So which one's your favorite out of all the games?

55:18.440 --> 55:20.800
I'm giving you an expected look.

55:20.800 --> 55:21.800
The number series.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.360
I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.360
Okay.

55:24.360 --> 55:25.360
That's one of the two correct answers.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.360
I can forgive you.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.480
I do love two.

55:27.480 --> 55:33.080
The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing

55:33.080 --> 55:36.440
this, and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
Man's ability.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
Yeah.

55:38.440 --> 55:41.360
So you're talking about a Quick Man's level then?

55:41.360 --> 55:42.360
Exactly.

55:42.360 --> 55:43.360
Okay.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.600
What's your favorite of the X?

55:44.600 --> 55:45.600
The first one.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.200
I don't even have to think about that.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.400
I replay it every year.

55:48.400 --> 55:51.480
I gave that to Rob recently.

55:51.480 --> 55:56.440
Ross Seal UT in chat is also a fan of Monster Hunter 3 saying, excuse me, Monster Hunter

55:56.440 --> 56:00.760
3 Ultimate, saying I'm over 70 hours into MH3U so far.

56:00.760 --> 56:01.760
It's a fine game.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.480
You just have to look at the manual and the home menu.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.120
That is something that needs to be pointed out.

56:06.120 --> 56:11.040
All the Wii U games I've gotten so far have manuals in the home menu, not a physical manual.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.840
So read that manual.

56:12.840 --> 56:13.840
Yeah.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.840
That's definitely a good idea.

56:14.840 --> 56:19.380
For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed like the tutorials that used to be in-game

56:19.380 --> 56:21.660
in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.

56:21.660 --> 56:25.340
I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.340
Interesting.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.100
Yeah, it was funny.

56:28.100 --> 56:31.380
Last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was

56:31.380 --> 56:34.380
not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.

56:34.380 --> 56:36.380
I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.

56:36.380 --> 56:37.380
It still has a manual.

56:37.380 --> 56:39.380
Let me go find it.

56:39.380 --> 56:43.340
Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.

56:43.340 --> 56:45.380
So Tim, what's a week in gaming look like for you?

56:45.380 --> 56:46.380
How was your gaming week?

56:46.380 --> 56:47.380
Hmm.

56:47.380 --> 56:50.660
Well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.

56:50.660 --> 56:52.660
It's all casual.

56:52.660 --> 56:53.660
I love it.

56:53.660 --> 56:57.500
It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes to, you know, right before

56:57.500 --> 57:02.340
bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.

57:02.340 --> 57:07.100
I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring

57:07.100 --> 57:10.220
and slow now compared to that.

57:10.220 --> 57:16.380
And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World, the inferior game to Super

57:16.380 --> 57:19.220
Mario Brothers 3 judging you.

57:19.220 --> 57:27.020
We played until I died about 15 times in a row to Matcha Koopa and quit in a fit of rage.

57:27.020 --> 57:30.900
So yeah, I do that if I get too frustrated with something.

57:30.900 --> 57:31.900
So does Rob.

57:31.900 --> 57:33.180
I've done this.

57:33.180 --> 57:34.240
This legitimately happened.

57:34.240 --> 57:39.460
We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.

57:39.460 --> 57:43.780
So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what,

57:43.780 --> 57:44.780
I'm done.

57:44.780 --> 57:45.780
I got ten minutes.

57:45.780 --> 57:46.780
They'll show.

57:46.780 --> 57:47.780
Out.

57:47.780 --> 57:51.420
And I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter

57:51.420 --> 57:52.420
as well.

57:52.420 --> 57:57.940
I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.

57:57.940 --> 58:03.340
It's pretty daunting to just sort of plop you in the game.

58:03.340 --> 58:08.540
And there's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying in terms of the interface,

58:08.540 --> 58:14.980
the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really

58:14.980 --> 58:16.220
artificial.

58:16.220 --> 58:21.780
But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.

58:21.780 --> 58:25.860
Like it really did in some way sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set

58:25.860 --> 58:26.860
of armor.

58:26.860 --> 58:28.600
I wanted to kill that next monster.

58:28.600 --> 58:32.620
So I did have a lot of fun with it, despite the frustrations.

58:32.620 --> 58:38.100
I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into

58:38.100 --> 58:39.100
it.

58:39.100 --> 58:41.380
I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.

58:41.380 --> 58:42.380
Oh, really?

58:42.380 --> 58:43.380
Yeah.

58:43.380 --> 58:44.380
Oh, wow.

58:44.380 --> 58:46.540
Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.

58:46.540 --> 58:47.580
Oh my gosh.

58:47.580 --> 58:48.700
Having a manual probably helped.

58:48.700 --> 58:50.820
I didn't look at the manual.

58:50.820 --> 58:52.820
Spike was my manual.

58:52.820 --> 58:56.460
And even then with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.

58:56.460 --> 59:00.060
That's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.

59:00.060 --> 59:03.780
ActDeft in our chat room asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?

59:03.780 --> 59:07.540
I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of

59:07.540 --> 59:08.540
Fighters fan?

59:08.540 --> 59:09.780
I am.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.900
Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.

59:11.900 --> 59:13.900
Oh, that's where that came from.

59:13.900 --> 59:14.900
Yeah.

59:14.900 --> 59:15.900
Got it.

59:15.900 --> 59:18.580
Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer or...

59:18.580 --> 59:23.060
Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones

59:23.060 --> 59:24.060
I have already.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.060
Okay.

59:25.060 --> 59:26.900
Next time you come in town, bring them.

59:26.900 --> 59:28.900
I have a Neo Geo.

59:28.900 --> 59:29.900
Okay.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.300
Actually, the last game I bought was KOF 2000.

59:32.300 --> 59:33.300
Excellent.

59:33.300 --> 59:34.300
Yeah.

59:34.300 --> 59:37.420
I loved that Neo Geo back for you from Tokyo.

59:38.300 --> 59:39.300
That was awful.

59:39.300 --> 59:40.300
Thank you, though.

59:40.300 --> 59:41.820
There was one that came out that was awful, though.

59:41.820 --> 59:42.820
What was that KOF...

59:42.820 --> 59:43.820
Was it 12?

59:43.820 --> 59:44.820
It wasn't...

59:44.820 --> 59:45.820
I mean, yeah.

59:45.820 --> 59:46.820
It was basically unfinished.

59:46.820 --> 59:47.820
Yeah.

59:47.820 --> 59:48.820
My Shiranui wasn't even in it.

59:48.820 --> 59:50.060
How do you do that?

59:50.060 --> 59:51.060
It was awful.

59:51.060 --> 59:59.340
And it was the one where both Kyo and Iori were powered down.

59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.340
It was not a good one.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.340
All right.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:06.180
Well, if that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, then let's get into some actual gaming

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.180
news.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.220
Let's get into the show.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.220
That's all right.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.220
We've had some good chat so far.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.220
I'm just gonna quickly say housekeeping.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.260
Don't forget to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.380
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.780
We talked about the GamerX panel.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.900
Did we get the link in our chat room?

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.900
I don't think we did yet.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.900
Slidekick did for us, though.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.900
Slidekick did.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900
Thank you very much.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.980
Because all your upvotes, we need them to make that panel happen.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.780
So please check that out.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.580
And plan on coming out and saying hi.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.580
All right.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.900
Let's get into some gaming news for the week.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.980
And I think Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.340
What's going on in the gaming world?

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:47.500
So Microsoft's gonna finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.620
Was really supposed to happen, I guess, this month, and now it's May.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:57.820
So May 21st, 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, or 6 p.m. UK.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.700
And that's all we know.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.260
Except there's rumors.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.740
A source.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.140
Told Polygon some few things.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.140
I love sources.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.140
It's always a source.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.140
Always a source.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.140
Yeah, right.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.140
All right.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.140
Why not?

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.620
For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit, too.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.620
Come on.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.620
Let's do it.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.540
So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:31.860
First off, you know, saying that yes, system will be always online.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.820
However, it's not as bad as it sounds.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.940
And you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.260
do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff that sounds very

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.300
similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.740
And you'll be able to share those on the web.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:00.940
And then also that it's gonna, the online only part of it, it is gonna have basically

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:07.900
kind of a check for your games, but they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.700
whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.700
Oh, gee.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:19.700
Yes, leave it in the hands of them.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:24.840
That to me sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.220
So if live goes down, you can't play that game.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.180
If their server goes down, you can't play that game.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.180
Your internet goes down.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.180
You can't play that game.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.180
I don't know.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.180
It sounds lame.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.180
Yeah.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.660
I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.520
Now it's just, it's a new spin on the same rumor and it's kind of like, I'm kind of sick

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:52.940
about theorizing on this one because I think also with so much fallout from that guy on

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.620
Twitter and the fact that, you know, we thought we were going to hear about this in April

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:01.460
and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:06.620
So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.620
Exactly.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.020
And they say one of the other things that's gonna change is the way achievements are working.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:16.380
They're saying they're gonna basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.380
or anything.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.460
It'd make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.740
Like say they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.740
or something they can.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.900
Or download the DLC and make it the more achievements.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.900
Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:38.100
And then also they're saying that the friends list size is gonna increase.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100
Oh, finally.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.340
The cap is going to be removed.

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.340
Finally.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.340
It's about time.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.540
That was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2, yes, I remember

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.540
that.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.540
Yeah.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:54.420
So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.900
That one I believe, for what it's worth, I believe that one.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:06.180
That seems legit, yes.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:11.940
So yeah, I mean, I'm not even gonna bother debating this stuff to death because we've

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
done it already.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:19.020
And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.420
probably gonna have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.420
Of course.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.580
Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:33.140
the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.140
We got shit.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.140
We got you that news.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.180
No shit, they changed.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180
They always do.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.980
I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.820
Do you think they know the name?

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.420
I still don't think they know the name.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.420
Xbox something.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.420
Yeah.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.380
I think it's gonna be an Xbox something.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.420
My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back, I think with PlayStation, that's

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.420
another thing.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.660
I mean, that's kind of, yeah, I think they're gonna call it PlayStation 4, it's a safe bet.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:07.980
But in the case of Nintendo, they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:12.340
And you might remember at E3, that signage, none of the signage said Wii U. Besides that

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.700
logo at their press conference, it all was new Nintendo console, da da da.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.020
So this Xbox, they may still be, I mean, Hey, you gotta have a new name for this console.

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.860
You gotta go out in like two seconds here.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.860
I don't know.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.860
How about Chuck?

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.860
Is that what you're gonna do with it?

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860
Wii U.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.860
I'm just chucking in the trash.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.860
Stop.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:36.300
Have you already, you've made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.300
word?

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300
No, I was just being a smart ass.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.300
Oh, okay.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.300
That's fair enough.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:46.660
Um, I knew if I put this out there already before, if it's, if it's got a sort of like

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.980
online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:55.140
You know, if it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all, if I'm not

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:59.180
connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console because I'm not connected to the

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:03.940
internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.440
So it doesn't benefit me.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.160
I don't have no, I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.940
keep the console I have and have no problems with it.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940
I just thought of a good name.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940
Hmm.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940
The ex tesseract.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:20.680
Um, I, and I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing too, is that, you know,

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.940
what's the trade off because we know what PlayStation four is bringing to the table.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.300
We know it will play use games.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.800
We know it doesn't require that ping and all this stuff.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.200
And you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference, why am I going to

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.540
opt for X box, whatever's more strict system?

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.620
What's the benefit, what's going to be the trade off.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:43.480
And the other thing too, is if these are the only way they could get away with something

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.420
like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.240
And then, then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, Oh, I have to buy, I

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.320
have to, I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system, you know, then I guess I'll

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.960
buy a Wii U or something.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.280
And until it's like, ah, yay.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.540
But no, I mean, seriously, I don't know.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.540
I don't know.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.520
They have this, honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.520
or whatever.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520
Cause they just won't talk about it.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520
Of course.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.520
Yeah.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520
I mean, they're not going to say, Hey, there's DRM on this.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.500
We're going to have to read between the lines on that.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.540
It depends if they take questions from the press or not, which I kind of think the executives

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:26.220
will have to, they'll have to address it, but I think they'll, they'll have to talk

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.220
to investors.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.020
I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.580
on Twitter.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:36.100
So anyhow, uh, let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.640
This is a reality right now.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.620
It's the new pizza hut app available on the Xbox three 60.

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.620
Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720
Yeah.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720
Well you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.520
Uh, well you can actually order pizza online from your three 60.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.880
I haven't done this yet, but uh, what I love about it is that it's got that same cross

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:04.960
bar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has, you know what I mean?

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.680
Like even if they have connect functionality, I bet it does.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.200
Like I just, let me, let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.980
I wish it had like the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.660
Like I want mayonnaise on my pizza.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.660
You never know.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.660
You never know.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.660
Same one.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.380
Remember the, uh, the old anti piracy ads from like five or 10 years ago, you wouldn't

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:31.560
down, you wouldn't download a pizza slash pizza.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560
Now you can.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.560
Exactly.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.560
It's a reality.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560
Awesome.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.020
Uh, so yeah, you can order online, uh, through the app and I guess, I guess you, I haven't

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.240
done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.200
I have ordered a pizza online.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.520
You know, I think a lot of us have done that.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.960
I imagine it's really not that much different than that.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.040
Um, so why not?

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.640
And I like this quote from Larry Erb, uh, in an interview with Polygon.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.880
He's major Nelson, of course.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.440
Uh, we're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.800
If you look at our audience, they love pizza.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.260
I mean, who doesn't?

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.400
It has international appeal and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:17.300
with the Xbox brand, you know, right back there with the Mountain Dew and the Doritos

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300
all sitting on the table.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.460
I feel like that's a backhanded compliment.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.660
I really want a Cheetos app now.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.580
Hey, you got two Cheetos games.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.580
Okay.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.580
That's enough.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580
Or Doritos.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.900
Dash of Destruction.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.900
Come on.

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.900
Where were you?

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.900
All right.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.660
So yeah, uh, you can order a pizza through your Xbox now, but honestly I like, I know

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.660
a lot of people are giggling, cackling, but technically, couldn't you fire up Internet

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.240
Explorer on your Xbox?

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.280
Go to pizza.com and you could have already done this.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280
It's just funny.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.280
They made an actual app for it.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.440
Does Pizza Hut.com have any sort of flash or HTML5 because it won't fucking work on

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440
Internet Explorer.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440
Perhaps.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.200
For the record, as we've been talking about in chat, there will be ways to download your

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.320
food because they've already got biological printers.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.480
What's to say they're not going to have food printers at week?

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.280
It's it's the, um, the, what is it from Star Trek?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Replicators.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280
The replicator.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.020
Stop the whirl over to get off.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020
And you can.

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020
This is amazing.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020
You like food.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.580
What is that supposed to mean?

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.260
I'm about to read my story and then go get more pizza.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.620
Hey, I can print delicious non-down loaded pizza.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:29.020
Hey, I can print stuff on paper with biological stuff right now.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.020
I only print one color.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.540
You don't need to know what you do at home.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:39.220
I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.380
Anyhow.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.000
I want a replicator so I can go T L gray hot.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.800
Even though I really hate Earl gray tea.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.960
I would like to tell you dungeon buster that Ron, the Romulan ale that you used to buy

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.960
at the Star Trek experience was lame.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
Just get a warp core breach.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.480
You won't feel your feet.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.080
Okay.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.080
More news.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.080
Dark Sire.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.080
Yeah.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Yeah.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080
So Nintendo, while you read this, I'm going to go get tea.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080
Hey Rob, get me some pizza too, please.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.080
Thank you.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.080
Hearts.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.520
Do I look like your bitch?

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.540
I just want to get served.

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.540
Oh, you're about to get served.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.540
You're about to get served.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540
Hearts.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540
Love you.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.540
Mean it.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.540
Okay.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.420
Anyway, so, um, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.820
They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.940
new presentation style who they're, uh, so that they're focusing on the software lineup

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:39.720
for the US market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and, uh,

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.420
another closed hands on event for the gaming media.

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:52.440
So yeah, they're like, E3, no, also, um, from the last Nintendo direct, they were, uh, putting

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.120
out release dates for a Wii U and a Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.820
Party and the Legend of Zelda linked to the past sequel, which I totally want.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:08.840
Uh, but they're, uh, just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.780
can be disappointed in increments.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:15.740
I just, they did this last year with their, they had the press conference and then they

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:21.780
have three Nintendo directs and it just such a waste of time.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.460
It was just so, it wasn't like there's a ton of information.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:29.000
It's just they drug it on for so long.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about 3DS.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.440
Oh, and this one's about the Wii U, oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440
older kids.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.080
And this one's about our press conference.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:46.220
It's like, uh, yeah, well, it says that they're actually trying to be, um, I guess a little

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:51.760
more direct with how they're giving the information, but, uh, I don't know.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.040
It just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.580
And especially since Rob said earlier, the, the feel of E3 has changed.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:05.460
It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be is turned into a,

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.460
look at our ads.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.380
Look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:14.440
You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.900
I think they just don't have anything new to show.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.940
Um, I mean, it's not, you don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:21.940
Yes, I do.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.280
This is a make or break year for Nintendo.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.280
Yeah.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.280
For as far as that we use.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.720
And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.320
Oh, fantastic.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.040
I think they're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.120
We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.360
would be the same conversation.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
Yeah.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.540
And it took them a year to, to pull it around and a price drop almost immediately.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.080
And who's to say that's not going to happen again?

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.740
I don't think it's going to happen again.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.180
Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.400
It's because their 3DS is doing well and they're making plenty of profit from that.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.780
So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.580
I kind of get like, this was one of those articles, I read it, it was all over Twitter

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.260
and I was like, wow, that's really weird.

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.260
And then I go, well, you know, that makes a lot of sense.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.300
Like people really just, you know, they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:20.100
And I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.240
They don't have a new console to show.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.960
They only want to show games.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.840
And you, you said it yourself a minute ago, people don't want to sit through all this

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.820
other crap that they don't care about.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.480
Give me the information targeted at me.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480
Thank you very much.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480
Good night.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480
But they don't do that with the Nintendo Directs.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.960
They, I think they drag on, I don't know, whatever.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.080
I would rather just see press release links to trailers done.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.400
I don't need to hear you about your fucking crap about, you know, the 25 year anniversary

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
of Luigi.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:52.660
Especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh, by the way,

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.140
we won't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced,

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:02.460
you know, Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS, but we have DLC for a Mario game.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.460
Sweet.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.460
That's sort of Luigi.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.520
That's like almost like a new game, but not.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.260
See we understand online because we put out DLC.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.260
We're hip.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.260
We're cool.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.260
We're just like those other consoles.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.260
Love us.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:21.280
So that's, I just don't think that they have anything new to show because look at it.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.280
Okay.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.280
The stuff that they're talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.280
yet.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.680
We're talking like third quarter when that stuff's finally hitting the market.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:36.980
So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Windwaker

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.840
and maybe one more game, but that's it.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.080
They don't really have much to announce.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.780
Are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or, you know, they

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.380
have 3DS games, which if, you know, they have a ton of 3DS games coming out, so no worries

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380
there.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.340
But as far as the Wii U goes, they don't really have anything to show.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:59.340
Spike, I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.340
very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.340
What, do you think Loki's on the right track?

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:11.280
Well, I mean, you know, we, we know that they have a Mario universe as we're all expecting

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.780
it to be called and Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:22.100
floor at E3 and, you know, they said they're going to show the new Smash Brothers game

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:25.360
in video and picture form.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.060
So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:34.060
I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:40.500
I kind of have to agree after the flop-tasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.000
You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.120
a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo land of all things,

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.560
but still at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions,

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.560
I guess.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:01.560
They did talk about boobs and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.040
Sad commentary on games.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.620
That sounds like my house.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.160
You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.160
Eventually.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160
No, seriously.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.580
I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo is they fucking, they talk of big game, like

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.720
how we're going to target the core audience.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.580
We're going to target those older, you know, people that want to play games, you know,

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.580
on the Wii U and stuff.

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.780
And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game, Mario.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:30.460
I mean, Mario sells it's, you know, for everybody, I guess, but there are no real, I don't think

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.460
they take it seriously.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.220
They just kind of, you know, this time around they say, okay, listen, we're not going to

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.360
put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.000
of shine, I guess.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.480
And then, wow, that, that, that, you know, amazing Spider-Man game from last year really

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.480
shown on your console and, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.300
Woo, that, that's awesome now coming out in March, you know, it's the definitive version

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.300
now because it's...

01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.840
Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:06.640
I still think that, uh, they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.760
Sega is.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.060
I think they're going to lose on it.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.180
I wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.300
Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.580
Same time Sega has done, taken a lot of risks on the Wii, I mean, look at, they put out

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:22.300
Mad World and stuff and Mad World is a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.700
didn't sell very well.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.860
And also the Conduit was another Sega game that they put out, I think that was Sega.

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.540
I think that was Sega.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.320
But, once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.720
I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.760
But they own the IP, they are part of the licensing for the game to exist.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.120
But Nintendo's bankrolling it, Platinum's been very open about the fact that without

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.800
Nintendo's involvement this game just wouldn't exist.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.400
There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.580
It's enough for me.

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:05.700
But I think that, as much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.820
Wii U because honestly the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table, oh yeah,

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.980
we have a tablet, yay.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:18.900
But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:23.900
I'm just saying there's a lot of people who would have been into it.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.940
I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.320
I think it's going to be fine come holidays.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.880
Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.720
I hope so.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.720
I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:42.340
there's no reason for me to buy that system.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.080
There's nothing that really wowed me about it.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.240
The 3DS is like, oh hey, 3D games set without glasses, that's kind of cool.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.280
Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.880
It's like, it's not that big a deal to me.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:20:00.100
The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.500
We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.500
a new thing.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:11.740
I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:17.300
the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.740
There's the PSP, but that's it.

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:27.240
It's the PSP, I'm sorry, the Vita, but who owns the Vita, and the 3DS.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:33.000
But the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.440
a brand new generation of consoles, and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware-wise

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.160
as the others, which is going to make multi-platform development difficult.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.840
And also when we consider, though, that they're saying that now a lot of the market's kind

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.960
of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing, and so if

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.900
you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:02.180
because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine, or, you know, they can buy a

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.180
3DS.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.160
All right, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before,

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160
let's move on with the stories.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:16.240
All right, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about more Wii U stuff.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.160
As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:25.720
In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about three and a half million units,

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:31.160
and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:36.720
They are targeting, though, for the next fiscal year, nine million units, so they're really

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.080
going to have to pick up the pace if that's going to happen.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:47.680
I want to say that they've only sold, I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:56.760
few months, and I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:04.080
And of course, 3DS is doing, you know, is rocking, they're up to 31.09 million units,

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:11.200
and the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.400
That's a lot of systems.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.520
That's got to disappoint them that they've only been able to sell three point, almost

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.880
three and a half million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.640
That's no penetration.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:36.000
And on top of that, Satoru Iwata, he is now the CEO, or the Nintendo of America CEO.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.040
And just to be clear, Reggie Fils-Aime was not overthrown or anything like that, he's

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.960
still there.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.720
I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together, so that the two don't

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.240
operate in different silos, that's my thought, is a corporate move like this, but...

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.580
Well, Iwata's been definitely more upfront, you know, he's been kind of the figure in

01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.180
all those Nintendo Directs and stuff, so...

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.780
It just wouldn't be the same without Reggie.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:03.820
Well, he's still there, you know, he's not...

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.900
And his jaw.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:09.900
Let me quickly cover this, this was already referenced a little bit ago, and I think a

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:13.260
lot of you guys kind of knew this already, Captain Spike mentioned a little bit ago,

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.680
Nintendo was, said before, Mario 3D, Mario Kart Wii U, they're going to be at the E3

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.200
show this year, but kind of the news in this is that there was a press release this week

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.640
from Nintendo of America and Nintendo Europe that said these games are slated in the next

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.240
few months, so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U, these are not titles

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.080
to be shown for 2014, these are titles to be shown for the holiday release.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.920
Running down the list real quick, just so we're clear, these are games that Nintendo

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.840
says in the next few months, Mario Kart for Wii U, Super Mario Brothers for Wii U, Wii

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.600
Fit for Wii U, which has kind of fallen off the radar, but that's kind of one of those

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.560
games, they were pitching that in the beginning, and it disappeared, so it's kind of another

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.440
one of those games that, you know, oh, now you see it, now you don't, but Wii Fit could

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.560
be interesting, depending on what they do with it, that could be an interesting game

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:07.120
changer, Pikmin, which we knew, that's happening, Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:14.280
I'm assuming that's Wind Waker, and Link to the Past, and Mario and Luigi on the 3DS,

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:19.680
and Pokemon X and Y obviously, so that's, you're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.400
lineup right there. I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's,

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:28.720
you know, that's in a nutshell. That better not be another new Super Mario Brothers game.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.280
Well like, oh no, I think it's gonna be a Wii, like you were saying a minute ago, kind

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.800
of like a Galaxy type thing. Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.680
to doing the, you know, sort of one new title per generation, and just expanding those with

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:47.800
DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC. I just hope it's not another new Super Mario

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:54.080
Brothers game. Or anything that resembles that. I think because, I think the Luigi DLC should

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.800
tell you it's not another Super Mario games, because why would they waste all the effort

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.120
to do that, to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:09.080
new game! I just, I don't see that happening. Because? It's gonna be a 3D Mario, whether

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:15.160
it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque, or Sunshine for fuck's sake, it's gonna be

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:22.160
something in that vein. Sunshine, lol. I could see them doing it though. I mean, just, why

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.040
not a new Luigi game then? Because we can do DLC and just easily just shoehorn it into

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.460
the. Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi, maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:36.040
or something, like maybe that's the twist. And no one will buy it. This whole fucking

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.040
thing. No one will buy it. This whole thing has, what do you mean no one will buy Super

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.560
Luigi Galaxy? Okay, one person will buy it, but no one else will buy it. Are you smoking

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.880
because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period. If

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:55.400
they are, if, I'm not talking about just re-skinned with Luigi, I'm talking about a new game in

01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.720
that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi,

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.760
and that's the joke. That's why you haven't seen anything else, because the bombshell's

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.280
gonna get dropped at E3. No one should make jokes when your system's suffering like that.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.280
This is not time for joking, this is time for kicking ass.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280
Ah, I'm done. Dark Sakura, save me.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280
Are you spent, Rob?

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280
I'm spent.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.280
I found the contest that I'm gonna be in now.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280
Oh?

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:28.280
Well, you found it for me, but I'm gonna do it. Because Rob does all my hard work for me.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.280
Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.280
As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280
That works.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:42.280
Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:50.280
character for it to be the face of the company. You know, not Sonic, just a new mascot. And

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:57.280
the contest is open through June 9th this year, and it has to be an original character

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:05.280
and there's a link on, I can get the link later, but it's also not just limited to the

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.280
Japanese audience, it's worldwide, which I'm gonna get the hell out of this. So basically,

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:20.280
they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on a Nico Nico, but that's

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:28.280
what the mascot's for, it's for the show. So, I'm not giving you guys my ideas. No.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:35.280
But they want something unique, something fun, something that's gonna, you know, basically

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:41.280
fit what they're trying to do. Because the show is, I'm trying to find something in,

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.280
basically it's just gonna be more of a fan show. And there's translations for the rules

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:53.280
up, so you just need a Nico Nico account, and there is an English version on the website

01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:02.280
to sign up for that. And so I will, let me get the URL, if you go to, it's actually S-E-I-G-A

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:09.280
dot Nico video, N-I-C-O video dot J-P, there should be a link from there, and I will post

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.280
the link in the chatroom for people here. Because maybe Sega will hire me.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.280
Got a great idea for a Sega character. It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black,

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.280
and he's got guns. Oh, shut up.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280
Well, uh, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas, because coming up in part B of

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.280
Orange Lawn's radio tonight, we are going to do a list list. I can't participate, Rob.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.280
Why not? Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.280
Tough shit. Oh, and he's gonna be named Shadow. Shadow the Hedgehog.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:47.280
Here's the deal, the topic for tonight's list list, mascot we most want to gift to Sega

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.280
on behalf of O-L-R. So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of O-L-R.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.280
Don't send your answers yet, just think about it, we'll come back to this in part B.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.280
By the way, a little bit more to this, is if you want to find those translated rules,

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.280
look for Yakuza Fan at NeoGaf.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.280
Alright. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.280
Do we gotta? Mm-hmm. Okay. We gotta.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:15.280
Girl. Well, this week, there's Deadly Premonition, the director's cut on PlayStation 3,

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:24.280
and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita. Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network,

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:28.280
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. That's really the only game you need to buy.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.280
Thank you for that review. Alright.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.280
Oh, I wasn't laughing at that.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.280
Oh, what were you laughing at? Oh, because everybody's shouting out their answers in chat right now.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:46.280
Wait, guys, wait. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases that are coming out in Japan.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:53.280
I gotta be honest, I'm sizing up the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. I don't really see anything for Japan this week.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:59.280
I'm guessing it's kind of a slower period over there right now, but I don't see any releases till May 16th.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:09.280
Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds? Is it just a dry spell this week? Wii U? Question mark?

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.280
No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week. You know why? Why?

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.280
It's because they're afraid. You know what they're afraid of?

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:23.280
Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto 5 on the 30th. That's right.

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.280
That's all you need to do that day. It's my wedding anniversary, and I'm going out and eating lunch,

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:32.280
but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:37.280
Didn't we get you a shirt that said game over? Are you gonna make Nelly watch them with you?

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.280
Should I? Yes, I should. Does she get into it? No. No? She could care less.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.280
I would think she'd think it's hilarious. You know what? We need to pick the most violent game,

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.280
violent bloody gory game ever and have Nelly and your mom review it.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.280
My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.280
That would be the best review ever.

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:00.280
I'm not positive, but I believe that in Japan, Tomb Raider comes out this week? The Japanese version?

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.280
It was last week. It was on my list last week, yes.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.280
I can't have President Cat. Nice try though with the plug.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:09.280
Yeah, I try. In case my bosses are listening.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:14.280
By the way, I was trying to explain President Cat to somebody the other day, and I was like,

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.280
but it's not really President. It's more of a delinquent in charge.

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:23.280
I found a game coming out on May 9th. That's the closest game release. That's like two weeks.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:30.280
It's on the PSP. Cud Wafter, converted edition, comes out on the PSP.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.280
And the box art is just a girl, and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.280
She's just waiting, like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.280
That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.280
A chick with her arms folded, waiting.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.280
Can you say the name of that again?

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.280
K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R. To me it's Cud Wafter, but it's probably Cud Wafter.

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280
It's German.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.280
Oh, that almost sounded dirty.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:02.280
Everything in German sounds dirty. You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.280
Cud Wafer. It's about crackers that cows chew on.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.280
Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.280
I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:18.280
So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob. What's up with me?

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.280
Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.280
Girl! Hold on. Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.280
They're your links!

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.280
I blame you! I blame you for everything.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.280
Oh, Slidekick looked up what this is.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.280
Cud Wafter or whatever.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.280
It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key.

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:43.280
Released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.280
So I guess it's the PSP version.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.280
And the cover sounded like what?

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.280
Oh, yeah. When I first looked at that I was like, oh, she's gonna get naked.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.280
Oh, it's a moe game.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.280
She looks too young.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.280
That button on her head is like huge.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.280
I was just thinking, does she smell like kudzu? No.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.280
And fifth dream in our chat room says, Cunt Waiter.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.280
I've had a few of those.

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.280
I worked for one of those.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280
You win.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280
Alright, moving on.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:21.280
On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280
I was still thinking about getting it.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.280
Injustice Gods Among Us. Game is fucking weird.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.280
Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.280
Now I'm thinking of The Doctor.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.280
Cause he wears a fez. Fezzes are cool.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.280
You're dying to comment on something, Kevin Spike.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.280
Oh, say it.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.280
No, no, um.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.280
Cunt Waiter.

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.280
Injustice is actually really good. That's all.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.280
I didn't, I just thought that Wonder Woman's hair looked weird.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.280
So you're gonna hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280
You know.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.280
It's DC. I hate everything.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.280
You know, Jaime, there are, there is DLC that could probably fix that.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.280
I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.280
Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280
No.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280
Then she would be awesome.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.280
Okay, okay, I will stop and say this.

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.280
I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.280
Although, I cannot read anything Batman related that Gail Simone doesn't write.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.280
She is my hero.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.280
But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.280
There.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280
My one nod to DC.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.280
That's it.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.280
Alright.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.280
So.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.280
Movies.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.280
Sony likes movies, right?

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.280
So Sony said, hey.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.280
Why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.280
Sound like a fantastic idea?

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.280
Well, it is.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.280
According to them.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.280
Ratchet and Clank.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.280
Coming to theaters in 2015.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:55.280
And it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.280
And I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.280
And I guess they produced.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.280
CG was a flick.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.280
Escape from Planet Earth.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.280
I have no idea what the fuck that is.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280
But they made that movie.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280
So.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.280
They've made a movie before.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:15.280
And then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280
Becoming a movie as well.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.280
Except it's direct to video because you know obviously a game this important.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.280
That never had a sequel.

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.280
Cannot be going to the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.280
And so direct the.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.280
Video it goes.

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.280
Also being done by Blockade Entertainment.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.280
What are you laughing at over there?

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280
Kudwafter.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280
Stop it.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.280
That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.280
Today's word is Kudwafter.

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280
Oh boy.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.280
I don't know.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280
Heavenly Sword.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.280
It just.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.280
I guess.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.280
Because God of War would have been too good.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.280
I don't really know why.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.280
I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.280
Like a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that you know.

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280
Uwe Boll would do.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.280
I mean cause.

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.280
I don't know if he's made any movies lately.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.280
No I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.280
Yeah he's laughing all the way to the bank.

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.280
Cause he's banked a lot of money.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.280
Ratchet and Clank sounds like he could be cute though.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.280
That I think could work.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.280
Anime is the way to go.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.280
Yeah.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.280
I mean after all.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.280
Angry Birds are getting the movie.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.280
I don't know how.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.280
How?

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280
They have cartoons.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.280
They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.280
But they'll do well in the Middle East.

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.280
Alright.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.280
I'm done by leaving.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.280
One more story for you guys.

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.280
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280
This has to do with Twin Gal.

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.280
Speaking of classic games.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280
Twin Galaxies.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.280
They've been around forever.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.280
They would do the video tapes and track the scores.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280
They've been like shut down for about six.

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280
Well I shouldn't say shut down.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.280
But they've been on a break from the actual score tracking for about six months.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.280
They've been doing some transitions.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.280
But now they're up and running again.

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.280
But here's the thing.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.280
Under their new system you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.280
Which you know it doesn't make sense though.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.280
Because like legitimately they're looking through all the footage.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.280
You know and they're watching it.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.280
Hours at a time.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.280
That's hours at a time.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280
That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra.

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.280
Review mine first and eat my barbecue sauce.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.280
Perhaps.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.280
$25 for one submission.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.280
$60 for three submissions.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.280
$75 for five submissions.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.280
But I believe based on the length that might count as more than one submission.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.280
So go read this.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.280
Go read.

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.280
What did you say over there?

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.280
That bears repeating.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.280
Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280
That's what she said.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.280
Okay thank you very much.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
Alright.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
Anyhow.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.280
Each video can only do one game.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.280
Although you can do more than one score in the video.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.280
That makes no sense to me.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.280
Unless it was two different settings maybe.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.280
Because like why would you show one score and then a better score.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.280
Like just do the one score.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.280
Anyway.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.280
Whatever.

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.280
So there you go.

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280
Twin Galaxies.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.280
You can submit your score for $25.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280
I don't know.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.280
There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.280
that it's not quite as respectable anymore.

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.280
That happens with any company.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.280
And also apparently that I don't know if their database crashed or something.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.280
But they lost some of the scores.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280
It did.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.280
But I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:42.280
They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.280
So I guess they got some of it back.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.280
But I'm glad that still exists.

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.280
Because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.280
And they're still playing them.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280
People are still breaking Donkey Kong score records.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.280
So I'm glad something like this exists.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280
Alright.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.280
Well speaking of classic games.

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.280
Every week here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.280
and visit the classic game of the week.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.280
This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.280
and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:26.280
And then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.280
Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.280
Okay, I can't even do it, Rob.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280
I can't do it.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.280
Because you have to start the music.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.280
Fair enough.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.280
Here's the music.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.280
And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.280
How has this never been the classic game of the week?

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280
I have no fucking clue.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280
This has been a joke forever on OLR.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.280
I love this song.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.280
Well, I was going to put in Ridge Racer.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.280
And I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.280
Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.280
And Dan isn't playing this shit out of Daytona.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.280
So I hear doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo in my nightmares.

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.280
Wait, you mean you hear this?

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.280
You know what, I have a napkin and I can make it into Elise Eleven.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.280
Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song.

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.280
Because that would be the most hilarious.

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:21.280
There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.280
And he just looks like he's having the time of his life.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:30.280
Like, it's better than chocolate and getting laid, I guess.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.280
But it was pretty funny.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.280
Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.280
And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.280
Let me play a little bit of that.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.280
We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280
Oh no no no.

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.280
Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.280
And it's not because it's a bad game.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.280
If it was a bad game, it would not be on my Classic Game of the Week list.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.280
I worked for Namco Arcade.

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.280
We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.280
I had a Pac-Man hat.

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:10.280
I had a Polaroid camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.280
And I had, like, ten Tekken 3 shirts.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.280
Like, the arcade only ones.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.280
I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.280
And it would always be in loud attract mode.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.280
Do do do do do do do do.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.280
I'm like, can we, can I take an axe to it?

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280
Can I break it?

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.280
Can we just say that some redneck came in and sat on it?

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.280
Because, I mean, it's Alabama, no one cares.

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.280
So, um, I wanted it to die just because of the attract.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.280
The only other attract that was as annoying as that came close was Time Crisis 2.

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.280
Oh, that was an awful one.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.280
The voice acting was hideous.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280
Oh my god.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280
So anyway, anyway, anyway.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.280
Back to the game.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.280
It is a racing game.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.280
It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.280
I mean, AM2 gave us freakin' Burning Rangers.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.280
Hi, same guy singing, by the way.

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:09.280
Um, so, uh, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.280
And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.280
It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board, which is easily emulated now.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.280
And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:33.280
It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped, so it gave it more of a realistic feel.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.280
Excepted the serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280
Oh, look, there's a mountain.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.280
Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.280
You know?

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.280
But, um, they did re-release the game as, um, oh, one thing I actually have to say.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.280
It's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.280
So that's pretty crazy.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.280
Given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:03.280
Um, so it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.280
They, um, took out the vocals.

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.280
It just has, like, some sort of generic singing over it.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.280
Like, it was some background vocal.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.280
But the main lyric part of it is gone.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.280
It's like you're playing karaoke mode.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280
So it's just not the same.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:19.280
So you are, um, in a stock car called the Hornet.

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.280
And you have to race, um, you know, three tracks.

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.280
Uh, either automatic or manual.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.280
You know, choose your transmission.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:32.280
And, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.280
You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.280
You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.280
And there were deluxe cabinets.

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:48.280
Because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:50.280
And this was when I was still living in Alabama.

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280
And my mom lived in Phoenix.

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.280
We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas.

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.280
And they had the full multi-car setup.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.280
And I was like, oh.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:01.280
It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.280
So I was completely in heaven.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.280
And I, I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:11.280
And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:14.280
So, um, I loved it then.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.280
Hated it when I worked at an arcade.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.280
So, yeah, it, it was really awesome.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:27.280
Um, and they, uh, actually, um, came out before there was the Daytona USA museum.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.280
But it had, um, all that attached to it.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:38.280
Um, there, uh, I think it was that, um, it became out at Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.280
Uh, so basically, um, yeah, this, um, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:51.280
Um, and like I said, it lost the vocal tracks because of the licensing.

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:58.280
Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturday 1995 and to Windows in 1996.

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.280
It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:06.280
And, um, clipped pretty, pretty nasty.

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:09.280
It was not the best version.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.280
Um, however, it handled well.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.280
And they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with 32X.

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.280
At least we got Space Harrier, right?

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:28.280
So, uh, there were, um, eight tracks, including the original three from the arcade and two additional tracks, um, from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.280
And then there were final three and that was, um, for the Dreamcast version.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.280
The Dreamcast version was pretty good.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.280
They completely, uh, redid all of the graphics.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.280
The pop-up was removed.

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.280
Um, the cars had transparent glass, higher poly.

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:50.280
It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280
Just saying.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.280
I guess you can't have it all, huh?

01:45:53.280 --> 01:46:00.280
Um, they did, um, an arcade faithful port for, um, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.280
And it has widescreen, high-def, eight-player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.280
Uh, more content with different challenges.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:17.280
Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode, singing, roaring start.

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.280
Because he's awesome.

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.280
Because my husband's a big dork.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280
Dan, you're awesome.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.280
Dan's not even listening. He's watching Chair of Swords.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:27.280
With the German chocolate cake and mystique.

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.280
Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.280
Yeah.

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.280
Yeah.

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.280
So, do do do do do you.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.280
And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.280
Well, do do do do do do you.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.280
Anyway, anyway.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:52.280
Um, so yeah, you had, um, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:47:02.280
You had, um, the redder blue and yellow and the black version depending on, uh, what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:09.280
Um, and, uh, basically, like I was saying, the, um, now the singer.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:17.280
And this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2, um, doing, uh, the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well.

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.280
And, uh, it was, uh, Takinobu Mitsuyoshi who was, uh, doing the singing.

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:27.280
And the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.280
Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:36.280
Um, and, uh, Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game.

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.280
Because I want to fry Sky High.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:51.280
So, uh, in the arcade version also used, um, a Yamaha sound chip that, uh, completely just, uh, redid and, you know, made the music sound really good, really professional.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:48:00.280
But they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the, um, music was actually, uh, synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:07.280
So, yeah, it's, uh, Daytona USA and I'm not doing it again.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.280
I'm done.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.280
I will.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.280
Oh.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:16.280
By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighters Megamix.

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280
Awesome.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.280
There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.280
Good pick.

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.280
It's about time, honestly.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.280
I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.280
Super Mario Brothers 3.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.280
I think she did it a long time ago.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280
I think I've done it.

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280
And World.

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.280
She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280
And we're on 502?

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.280
No, no.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.280
200 and something, I think.

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280
Something like that.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280
You've had several segments.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280
It's changed a few times.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.280
Classic game of the week started around 200 and something.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.280
But we stopped doing, uh, website of the week when I did, um, one site twice.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.280
Yeah.

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.280
Because I couldn't really think of anything.

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.280
What was the site?

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:53.280
You did one classic game twice and that didn't stop you.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.280
What did I do?

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.280
You did Final Fantasy VI twice.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.280
But, I mean, if you're gonna do any game twice, like-

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.280
Okay, one was three, one was six.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.280
There, I did versions.

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.280
Don't judge me.

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.280
Fair enough.

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.280
I don't wanna do Sega Rally because it's very hard, easy left.

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280
Wait.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280
Maybe.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280
All right, look.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.280
Uh, long show.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.280
We've got, we gotta take a break.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.280
We're gonna come back.

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280
We have rapid fire news.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280
Fugal Question of the Week coming as well.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.280
Uh, some more news stories for you guys.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.280
And, as we promised, listless, what mascot are we gonna gift to Sega just out of the

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.280
goodness of our hearts?

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.280
What do you, what do you, the listeners, want us to gift to Sega, uh, for their mascot competition?

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:31.280
Uh, we will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep right back with more of Orange

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.280
Lounge Radio right after this.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:46.280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this, I almost said Friday

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.280
night.

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.280
Aw, I wish the weekend was starting over.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.280
Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:59.280
And, uh, join in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at gamebuoy.org.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.280
Ahoy.

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.280
Ahoy.

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.280
We were talking, we were talking about, you and I were, I won't spoil it on the show,

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.280
but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're gonna get into

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.280
on your show, and some, I was like, oh, that's real good.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:11.280
That's real good.

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.280
So, if I try, if I don't steal them for OLR 503.

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.280
Rude.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.280
And ignorant.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.280
I would never, I would never.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.280
Uh, also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280
What up?

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280
Are you having a good time?

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.280
Is it more fun than you thought it would?

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.280
It's less terrifying than I imagined.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280
Yeah?

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.280
Yeah.

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.280
It looks like it's in, like, literally, literally the corner of my apartment.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:36.280
And not, like, a studio with lights everywhere.

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.280
Like, people think that, like, this show, because it's so damn old, people think that

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.280
we have, like, this recording space.

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.280
Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.280
you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:50.280
No tea, no shade.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:53.280
All tea, all tea.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.280
That we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.

01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:59.280
No, it's, it's pretty, pretty chill.

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.280
I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.280
You can, you can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.280
I'm not going to tell anyone.

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280
Please, please don't spread that rumor.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.280
I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.280
has room for O.L.R.

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.280
Actually, we're looking at, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.280
Oh my God, let's all get a big house.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.280
Oh my God, I'd kill you all.

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.280
No.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.280
I wasn't talking, I said my Rob.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.280
Been there, done that.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.280
I lived with Loki before.

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.280
Been there, done that.

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.280
That's actually.

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.280
You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:35.280
With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:36.280
I want to make that clear.

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.280
The only reason, you know, he got married and blah, blah, blah.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.280
And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.280
That would be a challenge, would be a challenge.

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.280
All right.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.280
By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.280
I just have to say.

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:51.280
Actually, yeah, Nellie's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh late and I got to say

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:52.280
cute, cute kid.

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:56.280
I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just that I'm being reminded consistently

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.280
on Facebook this week.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.280
Cute, cute kid.

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:00.280
For the record, I have to say this.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.280
I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:09.280
He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.280
Looking at comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says,

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.280
the OLR beach house.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:25.280
That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.280
Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.280
I will cut a bitch.

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.280
Dark Tetsuya says, move into the fort.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.280
Yes, we talked about that some time ago.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:38.280
Code Man says, OLR real world.

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.280
There would definitely be some drama.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.280
Start getting real.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:45.280
If Jamie and I lived in the same house, like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.280
I like that.

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.280
Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.280
Wait, what's that tip?

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:54.280
Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.280
Rehab from tacos, maybe.

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.280
You know what?

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.280
I don't do drugs already.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.280
Rob Roberts, My Strange Addiction.

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.280
Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.280
We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.280
Your guys' cycle would line up.

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.280
Fuck off.

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.280
Hearts.

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:19.280
Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.280
I'm so precious.

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.280
I think maybe we already did sync up.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:25.280
Alright.

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:30.280
You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Brothers.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:34.280
Super Mario Brothers Crossover is a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Brothers levels.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:44.280
But you get to play them as not only Super Mario or Luigi or Zelda or Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff.

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.280
So now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating 3 years.

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.280
And they've got a pretty interesting...

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:56.280
I didn't know that this game existed, but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special.

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.280
It's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.280
Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that.

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.280
And barrels and all sorts of cool stuff.

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.280
So that's the newest update.

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.280
It's going to be levels out of that game.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:11.280
And they have a whole bunch of other game types.

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:16.280
Because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.280
And so you can be playing with all the different characters from Castlevania and stuff.

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:24.280
It just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff.

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.280
It's really interesting.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:28.280
But if you want to check it out...

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.280
It looks like explodingrabbit.com is where you're going to be able to find that game, of course.

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.280
I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming soon, though.

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.280
But they have a trailer for it.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:41.280
How are they pushing that?

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.280
I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.280
It's still coming in March.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.280
Yeah. Well, no Kickstarters ever on time.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.280
But yeah, there's...

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.280
How's your Ouya?

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.280
Did you get your Ouya?

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:57.280
My Ouya right now is chilling in...

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.280
Where was it? It's in the Bay Area right now.

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.280
Just outside of Fremont.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.280
Daily City?

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.280
Fucking Fremont!

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:07.280
No, seriously!

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.280
It's in my living room, by the way.

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.280
Seriously. Fucking Fremont. You know why?

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.280
Not even Fremont. Fremont's out of this.

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.280
It's a close bystander.

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.280
No, seriously. Fucking Daily City or whatever.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.280
It's at the Cow Palace.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.280
Whatever it is.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.280
Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.280
It's been sitting there since Thursday.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:27.280
Not moving. At all.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.280
I like the traffic.

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.280
Yes. But you see, it's like it went...

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.280
It keeps getting worse.

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.280
First off, it took forever for them to ship it.

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.280
They shipped it by boat.

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:41.280
Look, we could do a three hour show of you bitching about your Ouya.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.280
No, no, no. Hold on.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.280
I'm with him on this one. They haven't shipped mine out yet either.

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.280
No, no. Listen. Here's how it's going.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.280
So they shipped it by boat.

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:51.280
First off, they picked DHL.

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.280
DHL. The quality shipper.

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.280
The only worse shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:57.280
For the record,

01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.280
Dan was playing a racing game and there were DHL stickers

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:01.280
and I totally thought of you.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:03.280
Well, it better not be a DHL car

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.280
because that car would be moving fucking slow.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.280
This is a damn heated Loki.

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.280
So they shipped it DHL.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.280
DHL and then the strategic

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.280
mailing thing, they passed

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.280
it off to the United States Postal Service.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.280
Which, from my experience

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.280
shipping eBay stuff,

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.280
they always scan those packages

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.280
and they totally never

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.280
just go weeks

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.280
at a time without, hey,

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.280
here's where your package is.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.280
I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.280
Otherwise, I don't know where it is.

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.280
Because it shouldn't take

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.280
a whole weekend

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.280
from Thursday

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.280
to go two hours

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.280
in distance.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:45.280
Are you done?

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:47.280
I'm done.

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.280
So, there was a new game coming

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.280
from Take-Two.

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.280
XCOM, or at least

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.280
The Bureau, XCOM

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.280
Declassified. It was that first person

01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.280
XCOM game that no one wanted

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.280
and now it's a third person XCOM game

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.280
that some people might want.

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.280
And it's a squad based shooter.

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.280
So, yeah.

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.280
It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.280
to figure out how the XCOM

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.280
Bureau, I guess,

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.280
was created or something. I don't know.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.280
And last but not least,

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.280
the Indoroyale Lunar Bundle

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.280
as we were talking about earlier,

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.280
purchasing. Pretty great deal

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.280
if you pay

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.280
what you want.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:29.280
$6 gets you the game.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.280
$8 gets you some additional stuff

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.280
including the Reawakening

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:35.280
album, which is from

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.280
some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.280
artist TJK. And then also

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.280
in this bundle you get some

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.280
cool stuff including Back to the Future.

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.280
You know, the whole Telltale game.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.280
Nice. And Dungeon Hearts

01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.280
Carve Commander and

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.280
let's see

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.280
what else.

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.280
P.I.D. was the other game.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:57.280
So, I bought it. It's pretty awesome.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.280
So, check it out.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.280
Alrighty.

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:03.280
Let's move on and talk about the Wii U virtual

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.280
console. We've kind of referenced this already

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:07.280
in the show. If you didn't know, that Wii U

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.280
update is out. Yes, it does make a lot

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.280
of stuff on the console faster. So, you know,

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:13.280
here's a reason to turn on your Wii U

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:15.280
if you beat Zombie U

01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:17.280
and Mario U a couple months ago and you really

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.280
haven't had a reason.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.280
Fire it up, download the update, and you can

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.280
check out some of these virtual console games. Balloon Fight,

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.280
Donkey Kong Jr.,

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.280
Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch Out,

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.280
F-Zero, Super Mario World, and

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.280
of course, Ice Climbers.

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.280
All available on virtual console.

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:35.280
And, yeah,

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:37.280
even though I said

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.280
when we first announced

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.280
the virtual console on Wii U, I wasn't gonna do this.

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.280
I did it. I paid the $1.50

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.280
to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.280
I gotta say, it runs really nice.

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:49.280
Like, I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:51.280
I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.280
And, like, how could a 20-year-old game

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.280
be that different? But I'm telling you, with the

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:57.280
HDMI, without me having to consistently

01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.280
change the proportions on the television,

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.280
with the audio coming out of

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.280
the Wii U pad as well as the TV,

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:05.280
it works great. So,

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.280
you know, alright. I was wrong

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.280
when I first judged virtual console a few months ago.

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:11.280
Fine. Alright.

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.280
Speaking of things that are available on

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.280
Nintendo platforms and PC and so forth,

01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.280
Scribblenauts. There's a new Scribblenauts

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:19.280
and supposedly it's titled

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:21.280
Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that's not an

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.280
official revelation. That's something that's

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.280
floating out there. Apparently, it's supposed

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.280
to be some type of crossover with DC

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.280
Comics, hence the name Unmasked.

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.280
Oh, I'm sure Dark Soccer is all about this.

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.280
I'm not gonna play it.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:35.280
Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.280
supposed to be out on PC,

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:39.280
Wii U, and 3DS, so it's

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.280
definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.280
I remember the last

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:45.280
Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U,

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.280
so this would make an interesting fit.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.280
It would be a very interesting step

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.280
for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.280
is part of WB Games, it does

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.280
make sense. So,

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.280
curiosity piqued. We'll say that.

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.280
Also, this

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.280
rumor's going around. I don't

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.280
know how much weight I give this. It could certainly

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.280
be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.280
is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.280
5 for next generation consoles next

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.280
month. Now, did this originate

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.280
with an analyst, that

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.280
infamous games analyst that always says

02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:17.280
because if so, then this holds absolutely

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.280
no weight. It's not coming out next gen.

02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.280
It's not, and here's why. It's because

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.280
they're gonna do a PC. They will do a PC

02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:25.280
version later on, just like they did with 4,

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:27.280
and they're gonna do that probably with the next

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.280
gen consoles at the same time. Here's my other

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.280
problem with this article. They say the announcement

02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.280
is supposed to be coming during an upcoming

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.280
investor event on May 16th.

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.280
They don't make announcements. They don't do that

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:39.280
at investor events. Investor events are

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.280
not the place to pull back the curtain and say

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:43.280
the investor event is to talk about

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.280
here's what's happened in the

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:47.280
past, here's where we are currently, here's

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.280
our plan for the future in broad

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.280
terms, not in these types of specifics.

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.280
That's the big problem I have

02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:55.280
with this that's going around right now. I don't think

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.280
that, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to

02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.280
spend the additional time to make a

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.280
next gen version of the game when they have a current

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.280
gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.280
Unless, unless someone

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:07.280
paid them big money to make it

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.280
an exclusive to their console. I still

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:11.280
don't think they would do that because even if they

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.280
still do, even if they brought out

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:15.280
the game, they're gonna do a PC version at the same

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.280
time because why bother? If you're gonna

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.280
develop a higher res version of the game, you might as

02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:21.280
well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.280
in PCs. Unless someone

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.280
bought it off. That's always

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.280
a possibility on the table. Someone bought

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.280
it off. It's always on the table.

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.280
Well if that were the case then it would be coming out exclusive

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:33.280
you know like for one system like the Xbox

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.280
360 was for a while and

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.280
the PS3 version came out and PC.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:39.280
But I just, I don't see

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.280
that happening. Did they date Grand Theft Auto 5?

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:43.280
Did they date it? It's September

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:45.280
17th. Well then yeah I guess we are too

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:47.280
far along for them to change that at this point.

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.280
I was gonna say there's no reason they can't

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.280
yank it and say, delay the first quarter

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:53.280
in this version. Oh I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:55.280
that happens. I will cut a bitch.

02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:57.280
I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.280
No I will fucking

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.280
kill somebody.

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.280
Virtually people.

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.280
Allegedly. It's Grand Theft Auto of course

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.280
you will kill somebody digitally.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.280
He'll kill a hooker. No I think

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.280
I will have to

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.280
I will have to kill somebody. Don't say that

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.280
in this world Loki you don't

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:17.280
say that. They already deleted how many times

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.280
I can't wait any longer. Just get ready.

02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.280
I can't wait any longer. Get ready to sharpen the purple

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:23.280
dildo. Wait wrong game.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.280
I can't wait any longer. It's been

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.280
so long. I need my Grand Theft Auto.

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.280
You need a therapist.

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:31.280
I need Grand Theft Auto.

02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:33.280
Alright Dark Sakura.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.280
Alright I gotta

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.280
get my story up. Okay.

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:39.280
Sorry my throat's a little

02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.280
alley right now. Okay well

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.280
we have some download content for

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.280
Revengeance. We have Blade Wolf and it's

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.280
going to be out in May in Japan

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:49.280
on the 9th of May. We don't

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.280
have a western date yet but

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:53.280
I would assume that it would have to be somewhere

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.280
near there and it's going to be a thousand

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.280
yen. So

02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.280
we're looking at maybe a

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.280
ten dollar DLC

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.280
when we get it.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.280
In other news.

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:07.280
Close window. Thank you. There is

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.280
going to be a sequel to River City

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.280
Ransom and

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.280
there is a crowd funding

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.280
thing open for it.

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:17.280
They want to make it an official

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.280
River City Ransom.

02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:21.280
They're working with the River City Ransom

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.280
EX developer Million to do

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.280
the actual sequel.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:27.280
They're hoping it's going to be

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.280
August 2014.

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:31.280
They've got a placeholder website out

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:33.280
for this right now. Just to throw a little background

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.280
into this. I think the reason why they say

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:37.280
actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:39.280
I think but it's not

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.280
the same people. So you kind of

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.280
have the two groups

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.280
now. The ones on Kickstarter.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:47.280
Are they doing another Nekketsu

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.280
game on 3DS?

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.280
I think so. Yeah.

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.280
One of the actual Kunio games?

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.280
Yes. Honestly that will be far superior.

02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:57.280
Yup.

02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:59.280
Actually.

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.280
The shade. The shade of it all.

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.280
You know what? It's just true.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.280
Because you cannot

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.280
like ok super

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:09.280
you played dodgeball and super dodgeball right?

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:11.280
They're actual Kunio games. You've played

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:13.280
knock off dodgeball games right? Were they as good?

02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:15.280
No. Is anything going to

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:17.280
top the original hot blooded

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.280
downtown fight?

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.280
The Neo Geo one was great.

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.280
You know what the best version of that

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.280
was? PC Engine. Had voice acting.

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:27.280
Ok.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.280
Did you ever play the PC Engine version? Yes.

02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:31.280
Isn't that adorable? They're so cute.

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:33.280
Anyway. Like when you go

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.280
into the little restaurants they actually say

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.280
speak to you politely and

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.280
bow to you and everything. It's awesome.

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:41.280
Ok so TKX

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:43.280
is going to be a remake of

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.280
Tempest 2000. Yes. TXK.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.280
Whatever. TXK.

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.280
You know what Rob? I'm so excited.

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.280
I'm dyslexic. I have

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:53.280
excited on set dyslexia.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.280
Thank you.

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:57.280
I'm quaking a little bit

02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.280
right now. Shaking. Crying.

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.280
Maybe your

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:03.280
super zapper needs to recharge.

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.280
Super zapper recharge.

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.280
Ok for anyone who lives under a rock

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.280
or who has been living

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.280
under a rock or in a cave or under the sea

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:13.280
Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best

02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:15.280
games in the universe. Even as

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:17.280
frustratingly difficult as

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.280
it can be. It's all because of the music. Because nothing

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.280
else matters. And it came out on the Jaguar

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.280
which was the only good game on the Jaguar

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.280
next to what?

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.280
Alien vs. Predator? No that wasn't even

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.280
very good either. For the time.

02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.280
Yeah. But it was still the best game

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:33.280
that ever came out on the Jaguar. Hands down.

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:35.280
Yeah. It was the only reason to

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.280
own a Jaguar. And then it came out on Saturn.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.280
And then I actually did play

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:41.280
the Jaguar version of Tempest 3000 that was

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.280
the proto. It was not bad.

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.280
So anyway. So yeah. This is basically

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:47.280
a remake of Tempest 2000.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:49.280
And that's it.

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.280
I am all about this as well. K.X.T.

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.280
K.X.T.

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.280
K.X.T.

02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:59.280
Alright.

02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.280
Let's take a chance

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.280
to go to the FUGL

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:05.280
question of the week.

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.280
Take

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:13.280
Facebook.

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.280
Take Google.

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:17.280
Slam them together and you get FUGL.

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.280
And we ask a question on our FUGL

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.280
Facebook and Google communities every week.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.280
This week is about movies.

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:25.280
And I'm going to apologize in advance. I'm not going to have enough time

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.280
to read all the answers because we're running along tonight.

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:29.280
We still have a list list. But

02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:31.280
I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities.

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:33.280
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.280
and Google Plus to see all the answers

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.280
in full. There's some news

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:39.280
this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.280
Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.280
How do you feel about video game movies?

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:45.280
Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.280
Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:49.280
Should Hollywood be making more video game movies

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.280
or less?

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:53.280
Let's take a look at some of the answers

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:55.280
on Google Plus.

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:57.280
ActDeaf says

02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:59.280
Video game movies as of recent have been

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.280
hit or miss for the masses.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.280
But it will be a while for us to see a critically acclaimed

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.280
video game movie. I don't think it either

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.280
hurts that bad or helps that much for the industry.

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.280
Both ways, they're

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.280
just easy money makers for everyone

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.280
involved mostly. But as of recent

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.280
Hollywood has seen how to make video game

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:17.280
movies work somewhat. So I'll keep an eye on that

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.280
Ratchet and Clank movie. Especially if it's animated

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.280
since that's the only way I can see that one working.

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.280
Flaco Jones

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.280
which by the way, I want to congratulate

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.280
Flaco Jones. He's now officially staffed

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.280
for VOG. His first movie

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.280
review went up and he's got

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:33.280
another article that's posted during the week.

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:35.280
He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.280
perspective.

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:39.280
In the written form. So that'll be

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:41.280
great. So congrats Flaco.

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.280
And that's also going to be a very

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.280
interesting change for the game.

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.280
Because as you know, staff of VOG

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.280
don't go on the regular leaderboards.

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.280
So Flaco has been winning every month.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.280
So, hmm

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:55.280
now things are going to get interesting.

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.280
But anyhow, Flaco says as long as they bring something

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.280
unique to the table, I have no problem with more

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:01.280
video game movies. The issue arises

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.280
when the video game property is already so similar

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.280
to a popular movie genre. Like what's

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:07.280
the difference between a Call of Duty film and just

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.280
some generic military action movie.

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.280
I don't know if the bad movies hurt the games.

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.280
It puts them into the public eye which at least means

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.280
more games I would think.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:17.280
Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:19.280
in an ideal situation you need a

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:21.280
writer, director, and producer

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.280
all having good track records

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:25.280
working together as a team.

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:27.280
That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:29.280
Perry Presents Halo.

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.280
Love it.

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.280
Let's do a few answers from

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.280
Facebook as well. Critical Myth

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:39.280
whose podcast talks a lot about movies

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.280
and TV shows and that stuff and he does

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.280
a lot of the book reviews for our site.

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:45.280
Critical Myth says I love the

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.280
R&C games but the last two

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.280
have been less than stellar so I'm actually

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:51.280
hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.280
to revitalize the franchise. But in general

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.280
terms I think it always comes down to the creative

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.280
minds behind the production. Do they understand

02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.280
the IP and what a film adaptation

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.280
can bring to the table that the game itself does not?

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.280
And is the game suited to a film

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.280
style narrative?

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.280
Pete Caruno says some game

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.280
franchises lend themselves very well

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.280
to film adaptations even though the execution

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.280
has pretty much always been awful.

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.280
Ratchet and Clank really doesn't strike me as the

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.280
kind of game that ought to have a film made of it

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.280
unless they're really that desperate for money?

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.280
And lastly on Facebook

02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.280
Andy R. says as a Playstation fan

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.280
I was pretty happy about the news but I'm

02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.280
concerned as well. Hollywood doesn't have

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.280
a great track record and I do think it hurts us

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:31.280
when they poorly adapt a game. I can see

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:33.280
a non-gamer saying this was based on a game

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.280
no wonder it was so bad

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.280
when we know that games can be a great medium

02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.280
for storytelling. As for more or less

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.280
there are plenty of games I would love to see as

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.280
movies so I wouldn't mind more than

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.280
more once they figure out how to make them

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.280
without sucking. You know that's a very

02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:49.280
interesting comment and I kind of

02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:51.280
want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here

02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:53.280
in studio is he theorizes

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:55.280
there that if the movie is

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.280
so bad it's going to make people go

02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:59.280
well no wonder because it's a

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:01.280
game and the game probably sucks too.

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.280
So can the movies actually do harm

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:05.280
to video gaming when they're

02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.280
really terrible?

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.280
I honestly think it also really depends

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:11.280
on the audience too because there's been a lot

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.280
of really good Japanese adaptations

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.280
that wouldn't fly over

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.280
here for the general audience because

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.280
of that quirkiness that's a part

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.280
of Japanese

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.280
game movie versions.

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:25.280
And people

02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:27.280
here want either it to be

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.280
super cutesy or super

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.280
gritty, realistic, have an edge to it

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.280
and I don't really see it.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:35.280
It would really depend on the IP.

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.280
I don't know which came first the Alone in the Dark

02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:41.280
movie or the

02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.280
Alone in the Dark game

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.280
by Atari. Like the last

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.280
one. Because I

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.280
don't remember which one hurt what.

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:51.280
I'm sure Tara Reid being a scientist didn't help.

02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.280
Oh stop.

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:55.280
Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.280
Well you know

02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:59.280
I think that they're largely

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.280
mediocre at best.

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:03.280
I think it's kind of telling when you have

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.280
recent movie games like Prince of

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.280
Persia and the general perception

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:09.280
is still oh game movies are getting

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:11.280
better.

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.280
So they're mostly crap but I

02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.280
don't think they hurt.

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.280
Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.280
that exists and that movie was awful.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.280
See also Super Mario Brothers with

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.280
Bob Hoskins. Hey, hey.

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.280
Kylie was in it. No

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.280
it was in Street Fighter yes.

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.280
Sorry I thought you meant the Mario movie.

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:31.280
The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.280
good. But I feel so bad

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.280
for dearly departed Raul Julia

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.280
for that being his last movie.

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.280
Although I have seen him in some really crappy

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.280
movies. And you guys even forgot that there was another

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:43.280
Street Fighter movie. Yeah there was the

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:45.280
Chun-Li, that horrible Chun-Li thing.

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.280
Didn't Bison

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.280
cause harm with

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.280
psychic powers to a woman in a way

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.280
that I don't really feel appropriate describing?

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.280
Well you know what I didn't see it and

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.280
I don't really want to.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.280
I was really drunk but I feel like I was offended

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:01.280
and that takes a lot.

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.280
I'm going to stick with the

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.280
ties that bind the best Street Fighter thing that came

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.280
out. That's the only thing in my universe.

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.280
The thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.280
Yeah that was really good.

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:13.280
So Tim what do you think? If they end up

02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:15.280
doing this new Mass Effect movie do you think

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.280
it's going to do justice to the games?

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.280
I don't

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.280
think it will do justice to the games. I think it will be

02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:23.280
something completely different. It might be good, it might be bad.

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:25.280
In general I think

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.280
video game movies have been pretty hit or miss.

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:29.280
But I'm pretty hopeful because I look at

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.280
something like the comic book industry

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.280
which they made a lot of

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.280
stinker comic book movies.

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.280
But eventually Hollywood and the comic

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:39.280
industry figured out how to do that.

02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:41.280
And there have been some stellar comic book games.

02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:43.280
So I have hope that in the future

02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:45.280
they sort of solve that problem

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.280
for games

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:49.280
translating over to movies as well.

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.280
That's a good point.

02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:53.280
I tend to agree with the other person that talked about

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.280
how if the right people with the right

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:57.280
passion are behind it

02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.280
it has the potential to do very well.

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.280
Which you know anything Uwe Boll

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:03.280
touched you're like oh girl no.

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.280
I feel that

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:07.280
I'm assuming Sony is going to be

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:09.280
publishing the movie.

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.280
It's studios that they pick

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:13.280
to do these licenses.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.280
I would assume that they're going to be

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.280
up to their standards

02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.280
because it is

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.280
their properties that they're playing with.

02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:23.280
I would think that they wouldn't just let anything

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.280
come to market.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.280
I don't know.

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:29.280
They've done some tie-ins and stuff

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.280
with different EA properties

02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:33.280
like some anime movies and I don't think those were that

02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:35.280
bad.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.280
Shane in our chat

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.280
room who of course has a thing or two to say

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:41.280
about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.280
the Mass Effect movie should be because

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:45.280
we all have our different stories and shepherds.

02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:47.280
Prince Brightstar says

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:49.280
frankly I think Mass Effect would be better as a Saturday

02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:51.280
morning cartoon picturing the April

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.280
Fool's 12th well there was the anime

02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:55.280
just saying. You know what actually I have

02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:57.280
did I tell you I got that?

02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:59.280
It wasn't terrible.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.280
I hate

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.280
admitting that it wasn't terrible.

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:05.280
The ending of it

02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:07.280
totally was like

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.280
you know all the stuff

02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:11.280
that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:13.280
gut and make you vomit your feelings?

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.280
Yeah it did that too.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.280
Alright.

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:19.280
To register participation for this week's

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:21.280
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.280
use the passphrase

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:25.280
yogurt. Let's do a couple

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.280
more news stories. We've got Listless coming up but first

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.280
Loki.

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:31.280
I'm sorry I forgot

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.280
to say at the end of the FUGL segment please

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.280
read the rest of the answers. I really skipped

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:37.280
a lot tonight because of time. Sorry.

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:39.280
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.280
Google Plus search for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.280
Sorry Loki go ahead. So EA has had

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:45.280
some more layoffs. They haven't really said

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:47.280
who was laid off.

02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:49.280
Apparently

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.280
I guess

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:53.280
there was an eternal memo that leaked out

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.280
basically

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:57.280
saying that you know at the beginning of their fiscal

02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:59.280
year

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.280
they're cutting some of their operations.

02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:03.280
Core marketing

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.280
functions have been consolidated

02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:07.280
under their new COO.

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.280
I

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.280
guess they're just restructuring it looks like.

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:13.280
And

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:15.280
also

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:17.280
with that there was a rumor that EA

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.280
partners label is closing.

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.280
And that includes you know all those

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.280
other

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.280
you know developers out there that are bringing different

02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.280
titles. There's you know of course the crisis series

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:29.280
Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.280
Returns, Bulletstorm,

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:33.280
Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:35.280
And I guess I

02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:37.280
wonder if that would affect Fuse. But of course

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:39.280
Fuse is just right around the corner so I'm sure that game

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.280
will still come out. But we may see

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.280
a lot less

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.280
I guess

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.280
not necessarily

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.280
experimental titles but titles that aren't

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.280
they aren't positive

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.280
would do well. Like new properties

02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:55.280
like Mirror's Edge or something like that.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.280
You know Alice

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:59.280
thought that would have done okay but

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:01.280
apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows of the dam.

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.280
Suda is

02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:05.280
hard to

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:07.280
it's more niche

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.280
so it's

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:11.280
I'm surprised. And then last but not least

02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:15.280
SimCity

02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:17.280
You know there's always bad news

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.280
when I mention SimCity. It got a patch

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.280
it fixed some bugs.

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.280
Godzilla is attacking

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.280
the city!

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:27.280
Well

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:29.280
SimCity 2.0

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.280
came out. It fixed

02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:33.280
a few bugs

02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:35.280
and unfortunately created a bunch of other

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.280
bugs.

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:39.280
So yeah

02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:41.280
lots of weird stuff.

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:43.280
We're pathing problems still.

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:45.280
Apparently the problem was sewage backing

02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:47.280
up. So

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:49.280
your towns are literally full of shit now.

02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:51.280
All sorts of

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:53.280
sinking problems.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.280
Yeah they actually have this group of people

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.280
on Reddit

02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.280
putting together a list of stuff that's

02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:01.280
wrong with it now.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.280
So that kind of sucks.

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.280
It's still a work in progress.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:07.280
And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.280
those bugs.

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:11.280
I guess.

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.280
No tea no shade.

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.280
Alright.

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.280
Anything else you want to

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:19.280
share about SimCity?

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:21.280
SimCity 4

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:23.280
apparently is on sale right now. You can get it for

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:25.280
really cheap. So if you want to play a great SimCity game

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.280
there you go.

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.280
And it's offline.

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:31.280
Moving on. I think this is

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:33.280
fascinating. A patent that Apple filed in

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.280
2009.

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.280
What the patent is all about is that

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:39.280
you have a path that you might take in

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.280
a video game. And what's

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:43.280
fascinating about this is that in

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:45.280
the patent filing they

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:47.280
freaking use these mock ups of mass effect

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:49.280
screenshots. And it even says

02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:51.280
name. John Sheppard. Origin

02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:53.280
colonist. And like a little mock up of what they

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.280
look like and everything. That's the first thing that made me

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.280
go is this like a joke or a troll or

02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:59.280
you know. LOL games journalism

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:01.280
thing. I don't know. But since it's floating around

02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:03.280
out there I will report on it because I think this is a

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.280
fascinating idea.

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:07.280
The patent office

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:09.280
did grant Apple this patent. And it was

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.280
made public. And

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:13.280
it would go like this. Like let's say

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:15.280
in mass effect you make all

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:17.280
these different choices. Or let me take a game that

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:19.280
you know Loki would actually play

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.280
like Walking Dead. Like the

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.280
Walking Dead games.

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.280
Well the Telltale ones are really good.

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:27.280
Let's say you go through the Walking Dead games

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.280
you make your different choices and obviously they have

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:31.280
a big impact. Well the trick about this

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:33.280
patent is that at the end after

02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.280
you've developed your character played the game. So imagine

02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:37.280
you play a game like Walking Dead at the end

02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:39.280
you can use this system that

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.280
Apple patented and you get a

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.280
single issue comic

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:45.280
that is filled with the

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.280
choices that you made in the game. And the dialogue

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:49.280
and the screenshots. And you could export it

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.280
assumably to like a PDF that you could

02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:53.280
then later read on your tablet or your

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:55.280
mobile device or what have you.

02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:57.280
So like imagine Jamie could have her femshep

02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:59.280
and romance garis and all this and she gets

02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:01.280
her very own. Cause that's the only point

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.280
of playing mass effect. Well that is all you

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:05.280
do right? Yes.

02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:07.280
So you get your comic book. And strip

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:09.280
mine planets. And you know Dark Sakura

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:11.280
presents Shakerian Sunday

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.280
and it's something she can

02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:15.280
get on her iPad

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.280
and read it. And it's like oh it's

02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:19.280
it's me and my garis.

02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:21.280
I am not that bad.

02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:23.280
Are you sure? I don't have the moe pillow.

02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:27.280
But you thought about it.

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:29.280
No I didn't. Did you see how expensive

02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:31.280
it was?

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:33.280
I love how that

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:35.280
was the reason. Look at me.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:37.280
That was the reason. I don't have money

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:39.280
for a pillow.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:41.280
And besides I didn't really care for the art that much.

02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:43.280
Alright actually very popular

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:45.280
in our chat room. ActDeaf says

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.280
this thing Rob is talking about is fucking awesome.

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.280
SG100Matt says this sounds like a good idea.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.280
ActDeaf says where do I throw my money

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.280
to?

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.280
Queen Simeon in our chat says that's

02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.280
like the little personalized vanity books

02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:59.280
back when I was a kid. Oh yeah

02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.280
like the choose your own adventure stuff

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.280
where like it would be you in the story.

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:05.280
Don't they sell that at the fair or something like that?

02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:07.280
They brought back choose your own adventure.

02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:09.280
Yeah Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:11.280
I miss those but I used to skip to the end

02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:13.280
to see what the best

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:15.280
because there's only like one path fits.

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:17.280
Right.

02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:19.280
Where you don't sneeze horrifically

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.280
in the middle of a show.

02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:23.280
Twice.

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.280
You know what?

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:29.280
Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:31.280
No that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.280
I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's

02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:35.280
I think.

02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:37.280
Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:39.280
What were you going to say about the vanity books?

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.280
I forget.

02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:43.280
Alright.

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.280
And thank you.

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:47.280
Alright.

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:49.280
This is a good idea.

02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:51.280
Yeah the vanity books

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:53.280
is a really good comparison but in this day and age

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:55.280
where you just crank it all out digitally

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.280
into a 99 cent PDF or something

02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:59.280
I think it's a great

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:01.280
as corny as this is going to sound

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:03.280
it would be a great memory

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.280
of your gaming experience.

02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:07.280
Because like you know a game like Mass Effect

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.280
you know again I hate to keep using this as an example

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:11.280
but it's such a good example.

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:13.280
It takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect

02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.280
and then maybe you're sitting here for two years

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.280
waiting for the sequel to come out.

02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:19.280
Well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:21.280
that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.280
oh let me read my little comic

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.280
that I had generated at the end and remember

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:27.280
about my character and my choices.

02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:29.280
People do that anyway it's called fan fiction.

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:31.280
It's called Tumblr.

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:33.280
No no no.

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:35.280
I think that's a pretty accurate statement.

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:37.280
It's called Tumblr.

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:39.280
So did Apple try to patent Tumblr is that what we're saying?

02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:41.280
Alright.

02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:43.280
Let's go to something

02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:45.280
that's going to need a patent here.

02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:47.280
It's tonight's Listless.

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:57.280
Alright for those of you guys that have never been here

02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:59.280
for Listless before let me tell you how it works.

02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:01.280
We're going to go around

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:03.280
well first the point of this whole thing

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:05.280
is that we are going to come up with

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:07.280
the definitive list.

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.280
No arguments, no exceptions.

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:11.280
We're going to solve a great

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:13.280
question in gaming right now

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:15.280
with this highly scientific process.

02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:17.280
And the way it's going to work we're going to all go around the room

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:19.280
there's five of us tonight so it's like a super Listless

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:21.280
Super Mario Listless.

02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:23.280
We're going to go around the room tonight

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:25.280
and each of us are going to name three

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:27.280
things for the list. We're going to nominate them for the list.

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.280
But then the exciting part

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:31.280
is we go around the room and each person

02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:33.280
will strike one item that is

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:35.280
not worthy of the list.

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.280
And remember our new twist as of the last time

02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:39.280
we did this should a host have

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:41.280
two of their items eliminated from the list

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.280
the third item gets

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:45.280
immunity so that way it does

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.280
not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:49.280
So and then

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:51.280
the chat room will vote on their top

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:53.280
and we will get the one, two, and three.

02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:55.280
The definitive list.

02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:57.280
So here it is. Chatters if you want to help out tonight

02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:59.280
start yelling your answers in

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.280
chat now. The topic tonight

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:03.280
mascot we most want

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.280
to gift to Sega

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:07.280
on behalf of OLR. Earlier in the show

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.280
we talked about Sega

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.280
Sega is looking for your

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:13.280
mascot in a nutshell. I mean I'm really

02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:15.280
cutting corners here but they're looking for your

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.280
mascot ideas and they could use them

02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:19.280
in a future press conference.

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:21.280
So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.280
and VOG and all that. So here we go

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.280
going around the room

02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:27.280
and giving our list

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:29.280
of the

02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:31.280
mascots we'd most like to see.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:33.280
Ladies first DarkSakura your number

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:35.280
three answer tonight. What

02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:37.280
mascot would you most like to gift

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:39.280
Sega? Master System

02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:41.280
the Sega robot.

02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:47.280
And what would Master System the Sega robot be?

02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:49.280
He'd be a cute robot

02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:51.280
but he wouldn't be like mecha sonic because that would be

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:53.280
too derivative. He'd just be a cute

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.280
little chibi robot or maybe

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:57.280
powerful like one of the Robo-Eleste

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:59.280
robots.

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.280
Because Robo-Eleste needs more love

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:03.280
that game was awesome shut up.

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:05.280
I'm with you on that. But his name would be

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:07.280
Master System. Alright.

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:09.280
Because the Master System hello.

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:11.280
Alright.

02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:13.280
Let's go around. Loki how about your

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:15.280
number three answer tonight for the list.

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:17.280
That's easy President Cat.

02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:19.280
Why? Because it's

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:21.280
President Cat. Well that is a very

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:23.280
OLR thing and is being shouted by a lot of people in chat.

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:25.280
So President Cat. So I thought we had to pick something

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:27.280
original. Not necessarily.

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:29.280
Well who said President Cat has to

02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:31.280
be that same President Cat? Since

02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.280
clearly that game company didn't give

02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:35.280
a fuck about our idea.

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.280
And you

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:39.280
might remember the translation was something like what

02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.280
Boss Cat we said President Cat. No

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:43.280
Sukeban is like a female delinquent

02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:45.280
and Shacho is like a

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:47.280
company president. You're like a female delinquent.

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:49.280
Shut you know what Rob?

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.280
What? I'm going to hit you in the face with a yo-yo.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:53.280
And the only people

02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:55.280
who would get that are people who actually sell Sukeban

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.280
Deca.

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.280
Alright.

02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:01.280
SSG 100

02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:03.280
Matt had a really good suggestion.

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:05.280
I will do my

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:07.280
number three answer then. My number three

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:09.280
answer for the list is well here's

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:11.280
the thing. Okay so on the Bobby

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.280
Black Wolf show he has an unofficial

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:15.280
mascot called Clicky the pen.

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:17.280
But if I were to try to steal

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:19.280
that on behalf of OLR

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.280
he might get very mad and threaten to sue.

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:23.280
So my number three answer tonight is

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.280
Dicky the pen.

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.280
Dicky the pen

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.280
is awesome.

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:31.280
Get it?

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:33.280
Dicky the pen

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:35.280
is awesome.

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:37.280
Just

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:39.280
think about that one for a little bit. Alright hey

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:41.280
Spike who's over there frowning at my

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:43.280
answer. What is your

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.280
number three answer for the list of

02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.280
mascot you'd like to gift to Sega? I'd like to

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:49.280
gift to Sega Rob Roberts

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.280
in a Bjork swan dress.

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:53.280
Okay.

02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:55.280
Do I have to

02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.280
do I have to sing like her?

02:25:57.280 --> 02:25:59.280
You have to have the egg purse too.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.280
I'm a

02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:03.280
fountain of love

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:05.280
in the

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:07.280
shade of love

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:09.280
I feel so bad for your listeners.

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.280
I'm

02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:13.280
just singing Bjork.

02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:15.280
Alright.

02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:17.280
Lastly

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:19.280
but not leastly with the number three item

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.280
for the list tonight. Tim what is your contribution

02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:23.280
to the list? Well since I think that

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:25.280
crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad

02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:27.280
I think a good mascot for them would be

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:29.280
a 32x with a frowny face.

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:31.280
So a regular 32x.

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:33.280
A 32x

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.280
with a frown face.

02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:37.280
Alright.

02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:39.280
Let's go to the number two answers.

02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:41.280
Jamie.

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.280
Well keep in mind I'm not doing mine in any particular

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:45.280
order I'm just doing them in the order I want to list them in.

02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:47.280
Fine. Segata Sanshiro the second.

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:49.280
Somebody

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.280
in chat said that earlier I think.

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:53.280
Yeah but they actually said Segata

02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.280
Sanshiro but since I'm being original it's

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:57.280
Segata Sanshiro

02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:59.280
the second. It's

02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.280
ATA.

02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:03.280
Segata Sanshiro

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.280
the second. Alright.

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.280
And if you

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:09.280
don't have seen it look up the Segata Sanshiro

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.280
videos after the show.

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.280
Alright. Loki your number two

02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:15.280
answer tonight. A forklift.

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:23.280
And why would their mascot be a

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:25.280
forklift? Did you not play Shenmue?

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.280
Oh okay I get it yeah yeah yeah.

02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:33.280
I think you can even incorporate it into like new

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:35.280
I thought there was going to be a joke there about

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.280
like moving things into the warehouse

02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:39.280
but alright fine.

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:41.280
Whatever however you want to take it.

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.280
It's funny in multiple formats.

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.280
I think the joke was how you didn't get it.

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:47.280
I just I'm sorry my

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:49.280
brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue

02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:51.280
out of all the video games in the world. It should always

02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:53.280
think of Shenmue.

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.280
I apologize.

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.280
Alright my number two answer tonight.

02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:59.280
Let's see I'm gonna take

02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:01.280
this one from chat because it's so good

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:03.280
and I didn't really like the answer that I had written

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:05.280
but I think a great mascot on behalf

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.280
of Orange Lounge Radio would be

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:09.280
Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.280
would be their mascot.

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.280
You are awful.

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.280
I approve but you're awful.

02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:17.280
It's a long running

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:19.280
OLR joke Spike. Just smile

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.280
and nod. Alright Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.280
from S.H.O.N. and I'm out is my number two

02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:25.280
answer for the list. So Captain

02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:27.280
Spike what is your number two answer for the list?

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:29.280
So I don't know your memes or anything

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:31.280
so I'm just gonna go with Dark Sakura

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:33.280
in a sailor suit.

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.280
Can I at least have a gun?

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.280
Sure. Yay!

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.280
Dark Sakura in a sailor

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.280
suit and a gun.

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:45.280
Why?

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:47.280
Because look at her that would be badass.

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:49.280
I thought it was a Duffy thing. Actually

02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:51.280
you know what? I love

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.280
Duffy! I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.

02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:55.280
Oh! Oh sure! Sure when you don't

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:57.280
get my references that's okay.

02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:59.280
I don't get your references and that's a crime

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:01.280
against gaming.

02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:03.280
Yep. By the way

02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:05.280
little factoid my very first cosplay

02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:07.280
ever was Sailor Venus.

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:09.280
That's awesome.

02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:11.280
This skirt was way too short.

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:13.280
Alright

02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.280
let's go to Spike. In the name of the moon

02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.280
I will fuck you up. Let's go to

02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:19.280
Tim's number two answer. Tim

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:21.280
what is your number two answer for the list? It was actually

02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:23.280
really similar to Spike's and we did not plan it

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:25.280
that way but it was

02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.280
the entire like all three OLR

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:29.280
hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.

02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:31.280
I don't have that much hair.

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:33.280
Can Loki be Jean?

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:35.280
Yeah

02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:37.280
Loki can be Jean. Rob has to be the other witch.

02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:39.280
What was her?

02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:41.280
Yeah no.

02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:43.280
He can be the little girl.

02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:45.280
The little young virgin.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.280
No! I will not be a little girl.

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:49.280
I'm not you. You be Jean.

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:51.280
He be the little girl. Oh okay I'm sexy right?

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.280
I guess.

02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:55.280
You'll be wearing a breastplate.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.280
I didn't say yes I just said I guess.

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.280
Alright so far the

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:01.280
list of mascots we will give to Sega.

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:03.280
Master System the Sega robot.

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:05.280
President Kat. Dickey the pen.

02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.280
Rob Robertson

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:09.280
a Bjork swan dress.

02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:11.280
32X with a frowny face.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:13.280
Segata Sanshiro the second.

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:15.280
A forklift. Non-silon occupied

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.280
Caprica. Dark Sakura in a sailor

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:19.280
suit and a gun. All

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:21.280
OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:23.280
This is the worst list ever. Hey I'm already wearing the glasses.

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:25.280
I just like how everyone assumed I would

02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:27.280
be Bayonetta so thank you.

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:29.280
The only way I would

02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:31.280
wear high heels is if they had guns on them.

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:33.280
Number one

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:35.280
answers for the list.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:37.280
Here we go.

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:39.280
Dark Sakura.

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.280
Oppa Oppa's retarded cousin Oppai Oppai that looks like a huge

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:43.280
boob.

02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:45.280
That was oddly specific.

02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:47.280
Oppai

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:49.280
is boob in Japanese.

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.280
So it would be

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:53.280
I won't use the R

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.280
word in the answer. I will say

02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:57.280
Oppa Oppa's Oppai huge boob

02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.280
cousin. It's O-P-P-A-I by the way.

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:01.280
Oppai!

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:03.280
Oppai Oppai.

02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:05.280
Yeah. Instead of Oppa Oppa.

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:07.280
Because we all know that Fantasy

02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:09.280
Zone is awesome.

02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:11.280
Okay. There we go.

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:13.280
Loki your number one

02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:15.280
answer. Ooh La La.

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:17.280
Because

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:19.280
why not? But Ooh La La

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:21.280
is already a Sega character. But she's not

02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:23.280
a mascot. Yeah she does mascot stuff.

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.280
Kinda. Alright fine.

02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:27.280
Space Michael Jackson.

02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:29.280
Space Michael.

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.280
Here we go.

02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:33.280
Nah we don't need a

02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:35.280
topless Ooh La La. It's a video game character.

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:37.280
Apollo Smiles has already been everywhere topless

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:39.280
so don't worry about it. Hey come on. I'll put it

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:41.280
but it's getting taken down.

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:45.280
Oh Rob.

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.280
I'm already taking down one of yours.

02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:49.280
If I can't have that

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:51.280
you know

02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:53.280
I'm gonna instead of a game character

02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:55.280
I want a game to be an actual

02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:57.280
the Japanese table flipping game.

02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:59.280
The arcade game.

02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:01.280
It should just be a big table being flipped over.

02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:03.280
Have you played that? It's awesome.

02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:05.280
No I want to play it. It looks awesome.

02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.280
That emote icon could just be their new mascot.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:09.280
I love Chiggers Forever for saying

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.280
Dame Edna.

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.280
Hello my puppets.

02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:15.280
Have you heard about my blast

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:17.280
processing?

02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:19.280
That's it.

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.280
I have to redo the

02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:23.280
pandaren meme and have it say

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.280
blast processing.

02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:27.280
Alright. I'm stealing X Defers

02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:29.280
meme. The sad thing is like 98%

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:31.280
of the audience just isn't gonna understand.

02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.280
But for the

02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:35.280
2% that do. You're welcome.

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:37.280
You know what? I'll do it for us.

02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:39.280
Captain Spike. Your number one answer.

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.280
Well I've done

02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.280
one for Rob and I've done one for Dark

02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:45.280
Sakura. So I'm gonna go with Loki in a

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:47.280
banana hammock with a giant

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:49.280
purple dildo bat.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.280
You should've just

02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:55.280
done as Tingle.

02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.280
Unfortunately. No no

02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:59.280
Loki you were the one that wanted

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:01.280
to get past Tingle. So

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:03.280
Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:05.280
bat is on the list.

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.280
And I can actually cosplay that in

02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:09.280
Saint's Row.

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.280
Alright.

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:13.280
One more.

02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:15.280
One more here.

02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:17.280
From Tim to add to the list.

02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:19.280
Last chance to get something on the list. Oh wait no I didn't do

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:21.280
my number one did I? No you didn't. Oh shit.

02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:23.280
Alright then my number one answer.

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:25.280
My number one answer would be

02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:27.280
now my number one answer is

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.280
inspired by the fact. I don't know if you guys know this. It's been

02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:31.280
San Francisco in the Sega building. They're

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:33.280
no longer there in the Sega building. You know what company moved

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:35.280
in in their place?

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.280
Was Zynga. So my

02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:39.280
number one answer or mascot is Zeke

02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:41.280
the Zynga killer. And he's a coyote

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:43.280
that eats dogs.

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:45.280
You're a horrible person

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:47.280
Rob. I approve. Oh he only eats

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.280
Zynga dogs. Don't worry. Okay well then he can eat the

02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:51.280
Zynga dog.

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:53.280
My number one answer

02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:55.280
is Zeke the Zynga killer. Alright.

02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.280
Last but not leastly. Tim

02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.280
your number one answer. My

02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:01.280
number one answer is a

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:03.280
terrifying amalgamation of all of

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.280
Sonic's shitty friends.

02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:07.280
Like

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:09.280
some

02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:11.280
vaguely Sonic shaped character

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.280
that's pink like the girl

02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:15.280
Amy and has

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:17.280
Knuckles' hands and

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.280
a gun.

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:21.280
So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?

02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:23.280
Yeah Sonic Gestalt. Thank you.

02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:25.280
Alright. But it would have to be called SBO

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:27.280
cause that was the weirdest name. Alright sorry guys

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.280
this is a highly scientific process.

02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:31.280
I'm gonna run down the list but here's some items that didn't

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:33.280
make the list from chat. I'm really surprised

02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:35.280
with some of these. SJ100Matt the giggling

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.280
lesbians didn't make the list tonight.

02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:39.280
Chigurh said Dame Edna

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.280
which we said.

02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:43.280
Who was talking about the singer from D-Light?

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:45.280
It was when

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.280
he brought up Ulala.

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.280
The whole lawsuit and everything like that. Lady

02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:51.280
Miss Keira Kirby. Let's

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.280
see. I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.280
Nobody said Ferret. That surprised

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:57.280
me as well.

02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:59.280
Let's see

02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:01.280
what else did we say? Peep the Peep jouster

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:03.280
says SJ100Matt. Needs

02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.280
more Rappy says Prince Brightstar.

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.280
We didn't name a ferret because

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:09.280
we respect the ferret too much.

02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:11.280
Alright. But guys

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:13.280
this list is too big. It's time

02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:15.280
to thin it down a little bit so we have to

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:17.280
go around the list. Since there's so many

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.280
people please let me know if you got two of your items

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:21.280
eliminated cause I don't know who said what at this point.

02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:23.280
So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.280
Here we go. Master System

02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:27.280
the Sega Robot. President

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:29.280
Cat. Dickey the Pen.

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:31.280
Rob Robertson a Bjork swan

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:33.280
dress. A 32X

02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:35.280
with a frowny face.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.280
Segata Sanshiro the second.

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.280
A forklift. Non-silent

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:41.280
occupied Caprica. Dark Sakura

02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:43.280
in a sailor suit and a gun.

02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:45.280
All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.280
Oppa Oppa's Oppai Oppai

02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:49.280
huge boob cousin.

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.280
Table flipping arcade game.

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.280
Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo back.

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:55.280
Zeke the Zynga killer.

02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:57.280
And an amalgamation of all of Sonic's

02:35:57.280 --> 02:35:59.280
shitty friends.

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:01.280
However this list is too big.

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.280
Dark Sakura. Which of these is not worthy

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.280
of the list? Just because

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.280
it's old and

02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:09.280
played out by non-silent

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:11.280
occupied Caprica. Non-silent

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:13.280
occupied Caprica. It has been stricken

02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.280
from the list. It might have stayed if it was a bottle of

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:17.280
Propel. Loki

02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.280
which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.280
I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:23.280
so...

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:25.280
I knew that was happening. Loki in a banana

02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:27.280
hammock with a purple dildo back. It has been stricken

02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.280
from the list. Spike

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:31.280
Oh wait no I'll go next. Me

02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:33.280
which one am I going to strike from the list?

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.280
I'm sorry

02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:37.280
Dark Sakura but I'm going to remove

02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:39.280
Segata Sanchiro the 2nd

02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.280
because you know what

02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:43.280
a copy of something that's already out there is

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.280
too easy. Oh that's right that would be too much

02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:47.280
awesome for the universe. But then who are they going to

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:49.280
base Segata 2 off of?

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:51.280
I know. Why didn't

02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:53.280
we not have... except it would be nothing but bad

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:55.280
decisions. Hey not my problem. Hey hey

02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:57.280
kids not my problem. It has been

02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.280
stricken from the list.

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.280
Spike which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:03.280
I don't understand Dickey the pen

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.280
and so I don't wish to see it.

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.280
Alright. You know what we should have

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:09.280
said? We should have said

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:11.280
crap and now I just

02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:13.280
forgot it. Nevermind. Alright Dickey

02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:15.280
the pen. It has been stricken from the list.

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:17.280
This means Zeke the Zynga killer

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.280
has immunity. It's my last answer that's there.

02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:21.280
So I think all that's left

02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:23.280
though is Tim. So Tim

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:25.280
which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:27.280
Um

02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:29.280
am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:31.280
Yes you can if you must. 32X with a frowny

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:33.280
face is super depressing.

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:35.280
A 32X with a frowny

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.280
face. Tim has decided you know

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:39.280
what I'm not feeling it anymore.

02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:41.280
I would rather see an amalgamation of all

02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:43.280
sonic shitty friends. So it has

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:45.280
been stricken from the list. It should have the little

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:47.280
quote bubble that says kill me.

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:49.280
I remembered what it is. I remembered what the

02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:51.280
suggestion that we should have done was. What?

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.280
Pepsi man. Oh.

02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:55.280
Pepsi man.

02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.280
Alright guys

02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:59.280
that means it is time to

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.280
vote in tonight's list list. I'm going to

02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:03.280

System the Sega Robot. President

02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:15.280
Cat. Rob Roberts in a Bjork

02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:17.280
swan dress. That stayed.

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:19.280
Yes.

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:21.280
Forklift. Dark Sakura in a

02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:23.280
suit and a gun. All O.L.R.

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:25.280
hosts a Bayonetta cosplay.

02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:27.280
That stayed. Yes.

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.280
Hey I can only eliminate one.

02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:31.280
Oppa Oppas. Oppai Oppai

02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:33.280
huge boob cousin.

02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:35.280
Table flipping arcade game. Zeke

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:37.280
the Zynga killer. And an

02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:39.280

02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:47.280
And to answer that question I see in

02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:49.280
chat right now from BS JasonXV

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:51.280
why aren't we using the vognetwork.com

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:53.280
poll for this? All I'm going to

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.280
say is soon.

02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:57.280
But not tonight.

02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:59.280
Alright so

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:01.280
send those votes in

02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:03.280
right now. We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little

02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:05.280
later in the show. Hey SSJ100 Matt

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:07.280
I don't think that Konami would want to let go

02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:09.280
of their awesome lie-in to Sega.

02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:11.280
Alright

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:13.280
while I tally up those votes

02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:15.280
I think we're going to take a- Dude I miss Pepsi man

02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:17.280
those commercials were hilarious.

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:19.280
Yes. Alright while I tally up those

02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:21.280
votes we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.280
Oh fuck. Every week you guys send us

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:25.280
emails to mailbag

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:27.280
at orange lounge radio dot com and Dark

02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.280
Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:31.280
every week and dives in. What the hell is this shit?

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:33.280
And picks out some of her favorite

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:35.280
emails to read. It's all

02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:37.280
sticky. At least it's not

02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:39.280
powdery. Dark Sakura what

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:41.280
emails are you going to read tonight?

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:43.280
Okay I approve of how this one started. It's

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:45.280
from Degenerate Johnny. Greetings

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:47.280
and Salutations. Which I have

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:49.280
to do the Christian Slater voice from

02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:51.280
Heathers. Greetings

02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.280
and Salutations O.L. Army. It's the one

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.280
and only Degenerate Johnny. I wanted to

02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:57.280
email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack

02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:59.280
of strong female lead characters in video games.

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:01.280
I'm not sure if you've had the chance to

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:03.280
watch Anita Sarcasians

02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:05.280
I know I pronounced that wrong

02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:07.280
Kickstarter video discussing the

02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:09.280
damsel in distress trope in games. But it

02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:11.280
mentions the same topic. If you have not

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:13.280
I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.

02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.280
While I do agree that feminism

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:17.280
is moving at a snail's pace

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:19.280
the lack of diversity is becoming less common

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:21.280
than it was ten years ago. Today we

02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:23.280
see three dimensional character

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.280
development for both genders of all sexual

02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:27.280
orientations. Such as Toni Prince

02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.280
GTA 4, Samantha Trainor and Mass Effect 3.

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:31.280
We even see strong female

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:33.280
leads who evolve significantly throughout

02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:35.280
certain game series such as a

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:37.280
young naive independent summoner who

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:39.280
learns how to become independent with

02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:41.280
goals of her own. Yes I'm a guy that

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:43.280
played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:45.280
10-2. 10-2 Rob!

02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:47.280
Big whoop. Wanna fight

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:49.280
about it? No I'm not judging you.

02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:51.280
No hate, no hate. The great thing

02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.280
about interactive entertainment is that it promotes

02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:55.280
individualism over traditionalism. Therefore

02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:57.280
the player is free to accept others regardless

02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:59.280
of their race, religion, gender and sexual

02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:01.280
orientation.

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:03.280
It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:05.280
society but I believe that

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.280
both the feminism

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:09.280
and homosexual movement will progress

02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:11.280
faster once the traditionalist

02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:13.280
members of the Baby Boomer generation

02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:15.280
retwire, retire

02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:17.280
from the professional world. Although

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:19.280
I won't be present for tonight's show

02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:21.280
I'm heading a card game tournament.

02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:23.280
Kick their ass. I'm interested

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:25.280
in hearing your thought on this.

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:27.280
Congratulations on 502 episodes

02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:29.280
O.L. Army

02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:31.280
Knight Degenerate Johnny.

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:33.280
You, yeah?

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:35.280
This

02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:37.280
is the thing about progress.

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:39.280
When people get it in their head

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:41.280
that progress needs to happen, it will

02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:43.280
happen.

02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:45.280
Like you said, the old guard's gonna

02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.280
die out.

02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:49.280
Any other thoughts?

02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:51.280
I'm gonna admit

02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:53.280
I'm furiously counting votes over here so

02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:55.280
can you summarize real quick for me?

02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.280
Basically, there's

02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:59.280
a lot more diversity in video games. We're seeing

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:01.280
more strong female leads come out

02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:03.280
and that basically the old

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:05.280
head up their ass

02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:07.280
Baby Boomer traditionalist people are gonna die out.

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:09.280
Well they're not really playing video games

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.280
anyway. No. But I worry about

02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:13.280
when I see these articles about how people believe

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:15.280
that strong female leads won't

02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:17.280
sell. That makes me

02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:19.280
sick. Or the statistic that 18% of

02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:21.280
people are playing femshep.

02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.280
We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:25.280
You know what really surprised me

02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.280
about that is just about every bit of the

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.280
fandom I've seen has been

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:31.280
surrounding a female shepherd.

02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:33.280
Maybe once

02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:35.280
or twice we'll see like a

02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:37.280
thicc with a male shepherd or

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:39.280
fanart of broshep.

02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:41.280
So I'm just saying.

02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:43.280
Alright.

02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:45.280
Okay.

02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:47.280
Someone we haven't heard from in a while, Rob.

02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:49.280
Hi OLR crew.

02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:51.280
My email is directed towards Skye who asked

02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.280
a simple question on episode 501.

02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:55.280
What's coming to Playstation Vita?

02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:57.280
The answer to that is found on Reddit where

02:42:57.280 --> 02:42:59.280
users compiled a list of upcoming games

02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.280
even those without set release dates. Here's

02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:03.280
the link so you can skim through the list.

02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:05.280
I don't care. I mean.

02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:07.280
Hold on.

02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:09.280
I freaking read it.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.280
Guacamelee.

02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.280
Which I kind of want to play.

02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:15.280
Hold on. It's super good.

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.280
Sorry. Draw Slasher.

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:19.280
Soulcalibur Broken Destiny.

02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:21.280
Zombie Tycoon 2.

02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.280
Velocity Ultra.

02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.280
Muramasa Rebirth.

02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:27.280
Jak and Daxter. Dragon's Crown.

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:29.280
Kill... Dragon's Crown.

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:31.280
Tearaway. Batman. Arc and Origins.

02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:33.280
Blackgate.

02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:35.280
Final Fantasy X-2 HD.

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:37.280
Divekick.

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:39.280
A bunch of Oddworld stuff. Malicious Rebirth.

02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:41.280
There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but

02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:43.280
I still don't think that... Ooh! There's an

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.280
Ys game on here too.

02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:47.280
But I don't know

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.280
that it's going to be enough to really save it unless

02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:51.280
they can

02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:53.280
pull a miracle out of their ass.

02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:55.280
Also, Skye, you have dabbled

02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:57.280
with games from your...

02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:59.280
Have you dabbled with games from your PlayStation Plus

02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:01.280
collection? It seems a little unusual that you

02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.280
haven't brought up games from Plus

02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:05.280
that you haven't tried out before in

02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:07.280
the How Was Your Gaming Week segments. I'm interested

02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:09.280
to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea

02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.280
3, The Cave, Closure, and others. I did

02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:13.280
buy Closure. Funny enough,

02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:15.280
I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3

02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:17.280
ready to play. I just didn't get to it this week.

02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:19.280
Because I had that other game to review.

02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:21.280
Yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.

02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:23.280
The Cave, specifically. I was

02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:25.280
curious in checking out, so

02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:27.280
hopefully next week. I did get

02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:29.280
Closure, by the way, on Steam. I just haven't

02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:31.280
played it yet. So many games,

02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:33.280
so little time. But thank you for the

02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:35.280
feedback on the Vita.

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:37.280
And we'll see what comes

02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:39.280
at E3. I'm sure it's going to be a huge

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:41.280
thing as well. Okay, the end of this email.

02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:43.280
I want some Pinkberry, the Nasty

02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:45.280
Canasta. Who doesn't? I want some

02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:47.280
Pinkberry. Okay,

02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:49.280
this one's kind of long. Hello

02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:51.280
OLR.

02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:53.280
So, sorry, by the way, guys,

02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:55.280
if I sound awful, I had an allergic

02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:57.280
reaction earlier.

02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:59.280
I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago.

02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:01.280
Basic set. I have been having

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:03.280
a somewhat good time with it. I'm already,

02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:05.280
I've already,

02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:07.280
I guess that should be got four games.

02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:09.280
Super Mario Bros. U, Monster Hunter 3

02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:11.280
Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and

02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:13.280
Justice Gods Among Us. Fun system that the

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:15.280
touchpad is taking a lot more

02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:17.280
getting used to. I'll probably not

02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:19.280
have, not be buying a lot of

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:21.280
non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got

02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:23.280
pro controller or classic controller support.

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:25.280
But it's proving to

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:27.280
be not the embarrassing waste of time

02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.280
I thought it would be when the system came out.

02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:31.280
I'm hoping and fully expecting the system

02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:33.280
to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:35.280
Speaking of, it seems that

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.280
Nintendo bullying out of the huge

02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:39.280
dick-waving contest that is

02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:41.280
the mega press conference. Oh,

02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.280
bowing out, sorry.

02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:45.280
Yeah, we covered that earlier.

02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:47.280
Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional

02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:49.280
conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.

02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:51.280
The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.

02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:53.280
However, it's sad that the gaming

02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:55.280
media is quick to bash on Nintendo.

02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:57.280
Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:59.280
I was always under the impression that we

02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:01.280
won the games.

02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.280
Sorry.

02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.280
How much of it do you guys

02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:07.280
feel it's just the people wanting to

02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:09.280
shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics

02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:11.280
horror choice versus legitimate concerns about

02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:13.280
the company? I think there's

02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:15.280
a lot of bandwagon bashing, but

02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:17.280
I

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:19.280
my thing with press conferences or release

02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:21.280
of information, I don't give a shit how they

02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:23.280
do it as long as they do something

02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:25.280
and we find out what it is. I only care about the information.

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:27.280
I don't care how they put it out.

02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:29.280
I just care that they do.

02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:31.280
That's me.

02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:33.280
I understand that in this cost-conscious

02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:35.280
world we're living in, especially for

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:37.280
a company that hasn't necessarily been meeting

02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:39.280
their goals, they want to scale

02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:41.280
back on some of the pomp and circumstance,

02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:43.280
especially when they always seem to get shit on for it.

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:45.280
So, you know,

02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:47.280
why not change the game

02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:49.280
at this point if you're them?

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:51.280
Anyway.

02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:53.280
Back to the

02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:55.280
I need to actually

02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:57.280
pick this instead of email.

02:46:57.280 --> 02:46:59.280
Lastly, my next

02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:01.280
hardware purchase is coming around July

02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:03.280
and that is the Retron 5.

02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:05.280
I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles,

02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:07.280
but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure

02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:09.280
maximum compatibility

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:11.280
and the 720p

02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:13.280
upscaling, save states, and full button

02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.280
customization for any controller you use on the thing.

02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:17.280
That brings me to the question,

02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:19.280
where do you guys stand on retro gaming?

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:21.280
Do you want all the modern

02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:23.280
accoutrements that are offered by emulators

02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:25.280
and will be offered by the Retron 5,

02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:27.280
or are you guys intolerant of any deviation

02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:29.280
from the original play limitations?

02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:31.280
Me, I can go either way, though with

02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.280
five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be

02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:35.280
a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES,

02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:37.280
Genesis all at once, and if only they can add in

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:39.280
support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.

02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:41.280
Anyway, that's it for the email. Thanks for reading.

02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:44.280
This is my thought about it,

02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:46.280
because given that I am in a position of both,

02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:48.280
you did not put in the

02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:50.280
do not give a shit category,

02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:52.280
because it all depends on my mood.

02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:54.280
It depends on how much I feel

02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:56.280
like digging through boxes

02:47:56.280 --> 02:47:58.280
to pull out one of the

02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:00.280
Super Nintendos and plug it in

02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:02.280
and then where to find our copy of

02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:04.280
Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid

02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:06.280
or, you know,

02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:08.280
I prefer to play things

02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:10.280
on the original console.

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:13.280
If I had the perfect vault,

02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:15.280
if we had everything hooked back up again,

02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:17.280
switch boxes and everything,

02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.280
yeah, I would be totally playing it

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:21.280
on the original console,

02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:23.280
because I can safely say I likely have

02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:25.280
the original console.

02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:27.280
But, if it's a quick thing,

02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:29.280
or I want to play like a

02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:31.280
Sega Densetsu 3, and there's an amazing

02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:33.280
fan translation out, but I don't have a ROM

02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:35.280
burner, then I'll play the emulator.

02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:37.280
I'm not really picky.

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:39.280
If it's the only way I have to play it,

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:42.280
You have multiple Super Nintendos?

02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:44.280
Do you not?

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:46.280
I still have none.

02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:48.280
It's a shame that's carried out through my

02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:50.280
adult life.

02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:52.280
There's one over there in our house, too.

02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:54.280
I saw it, and I was jealous.

02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:56.280
No, we actually just bought

02:48:56.280 --> 02:48:58.280
I think our fourth Super Nintendo,

02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:00.280
or fourth or fifth,

02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:02.280
because we found a box of games

02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:04.280
and a SNES for 50 bucks

02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:06.280
at Goodwill, and one of the games in there

02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:08.280
was Pocky and Rocky 2,

02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.280
which was unboxed

02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:12.280
for about 150 bucks on eBay.

02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:14.280
We're going to be selling it.

02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:16.280
That's like that chick that found the

02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:18.280
copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store

02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:20.280
and she's making bank off it.

02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:22.280
Just the whole reason is that

02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:24.280
as much as we love the game, it's not going to be

02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:26.280
one that we're going to play a lot.

02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:28.280
If we're looking at the collection,

02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:30.280
I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play

02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:32.280
Dracula X.

02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:34.280
Which is the correct choice to make.

02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:36.280
You know what I wish they would translate?

02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.280
And like, Re-Burn on a CD is

02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:40.280
well, Sapphire was a great game,

02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:42.280
but Emerald Dragon

02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:44.280
was an RPG

02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:46.280
that came out on

02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:48.280
PC Engine Duo.

02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:50.280
You just named a game I've never played!

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.280
Holy shit!

02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:54.280
Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.

02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:56.280
Okay, yeah, but I mean,

02:49:56.280 --> 02:49:58.280
I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:00.280
One of my friends that for a little while

02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:02.280
worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:04.280
She wouldn't lend it to me.

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:06.280
You're going to Japan? Let me borrow it!

02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:08.280
Let me say this quickly about

02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:10.280
the back to the email with the emulators and all that.

02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:12.280
I really do like

02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:14.280
the retro gaming

02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:16.280
when it's done right.

02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:18.280
Sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:20.280
I kind of wish companies in this day and age

02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:22.280
would do more, especially because

02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:24.280
we've shifted from

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:26.280
sitting next to each other in the same room

02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:28.280
to a lot of internet play.

02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:30.280
I've bitched about this on the show before.

02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:32.280
Virtual Console would be ten times

02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.280
better and more people would feel the enhanced

02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:36.280
value if you could play it online.

02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:38.280
If you could use that cam in your Wii U

02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:40.280
optionally, to see your friend

02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:42.280
while you're screwing him over in Ice Climber

02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:44.280
or whatever it is you're playing.

02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.280
Or a better game.

02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:48.280
Like the Capcom Arcade

02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:50.280
Cabinet Collection is actually pretty good,

02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:52.280
because you can do the internet and all that.

02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:54.280
I think the interface could be a heck of a lot better.

02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:56.280
I really liked Game Room.

02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:58.280
I really...

02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:00.280
I loved Game Room.

02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:02.280
It gave them that more time and nurtured it

02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:04.280
just a little more.

02:51:04.280 --> 02:51:06.280
I feel like Game Room could have been it.

02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:08.280
And I'm really disappointed that they pulled the plug

02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:10.280
as fast as they did on that.

02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:12.280
I mean, maybe it just wasn't gaining the support.

02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:14.280
I don't know, but maybe they just needed better games.

02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:16.280
Some of the games they put out at the end

02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:18.280
should have been out in the beginning.

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:20.280
Which they never did put out officially.

02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:22.280
But if they've been sitting on Sunset Riders

02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:24.280
the whole time, why didn't they put that out in the beginning

02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:26.280
instead of some of the...

02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:28.280
not that the 2600 games are bad, don't get me wrong.

02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:30.280
It was really disappointing.

02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:32.280
But, you know, like Virtual Console on 3DS

02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:34.280
pretty rad that we can fire up

02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:36.280
a two-player game.

02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:38.280
Again, I'm going to use Ice Climber as an example.

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:40.280
But, you know, we can do that anywhere.

02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:42.280
We could sit in the car and play

02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:44.280
Ice Climber on 3DS.

02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:46.280
Excuse me, versus,

02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:48.280
thanks to Virtual Console.

02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:50.280
I love that.

02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:52.280
I would like to just see that pushed forward

02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:54.280
a little faster, because the technology is

02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:56.280
there to get it online and all that.

02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:58.280
Anyhow, that's my thoughts.

02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:00.280
We have another email.

02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:02.280
Alright.

02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:04.280
That was from RawStillUT.

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:06.280
The last email.

02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:08.280
Howdy, y'all!

02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:10.280
Howdy, y'all!

02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:12.280
Howdy.

02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:14.280
I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox

02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:16.280
official store today and marveled at all the shit

02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:18.280
you can buy there. Seriously, look it up.

02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:20.280
There's an astounding variety of items

02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:22.280
with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste

02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:24.280
your money on.

02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:26.280
Is there an equivalent store for WOW memorabilia?

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:28.280
eBay.

02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:30.280
Is there a place online where I can

02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:32.280
blow my money on a wide variety of WOW shit?

02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:34.280
I mean, a sticker with your

02:52:34.280 --> 02:52:36.280
flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.

02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:38.280
That thing you use

02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:40.280
to get around in real life on the thing you use

02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:42.280
to get around in the real world?

02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:44.280
That would be awesome.

02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:46.280
Stay black, redertainment trainer.

02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:50.280
You know...

02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:52.280
There's the Jinx store.

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:54.280
I think Geek has a lot of WOW stuff.

02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:56.280
Yeah.

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:58.280
I don't know if there's a

02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:00.280
Blizzard company store.

02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:02.280
Jinx is kind of like one of their official

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:04.280
vendors.

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:06.280
They do a lot of that stuff.

02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:08.280
They're always at BlizzCon.

02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:10.280
That's like JYNX, right?

02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:12.280
I believe so.

02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:14.280
Like the drag queen?

02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:16.280
Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.

02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:18.280
I was going to say too

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:20.280
that I think if you look on Etsy

02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:22.280
there's a lot of fan-made

02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:24.280
items that are really good.

02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:26.280
And I know

02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:28.280
that there are people

02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:30.280
out there who will...

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:32.280
There's artists out there who will do commissioned

02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:34.280
work of your character and your mount.

02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:36.280
And she's talking to you right now.

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:38.280
But

02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:40.280
it's possible. You can even make this stuff yourself.

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:42.280
It's not that hard.

02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:44.280
There's a program that I was doing

02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:46.280
a WOW comic in for a while.

02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:48.280
It was like the World of Warcraft viewer.

02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:50.280
Where it has all the mounts.

02:53:50.280 --> 02:53:52.280
It has hidden stuff.

02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:54.280
It has...

02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:56.280
Oh, fuck what's dude's name at Icecrown.

02:53:56.280 --> 02:53:58.280
Lich King?

02:53:58.280 --> 02:54:00.280
The current Lich King.

02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:02.280
Arthas? Or Bolvar?

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:04.280
Yeah. There's actually

02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:06.280
a picture of him on fire.

02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:08.280
Not standing on the throne.

02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:10.280
He's just standing there on fire.

02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:12.280
And he's called Lavaman.

02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:14.280
You can have him.

02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:16.280
You can have old, actual Warcraft things.

02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:18.280
And the ability to make the stickers.

02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:20.280
I was also going to suggest, honestly,

02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:22.280
if your mall has a hot topic,

02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:24.280
well, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.

02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:26.280
But if you're wanting

02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:28.280
props and things

02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:30.280
or stuff to put on your wall,

02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:32.280
check with cosplay

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:34.280
distributors.

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:36.280
Because you can get stuff there too.

02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:38.280
I know people who make weapons.

02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:40.280
Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.

02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:42.280
Or what's that printer

02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:44.280
that you've... It's like a couple grand

02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:46.280
home 3D printer.

02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:48.280
MakerBot? Yeah, MakerBot.

02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:50.280
I think people have done

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:52.280
insignias and things for MakerBot.

02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:54.280
You can also buy a monthly membership

02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:56.280
to TechShop and use their fancy ones.

02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:58.280
I think that, actually, the school I go to now

02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:00.280
is going to be getting a 3D printer

02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:02.280
in the next couple years.

02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:04.280
For the art design lab.

02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:06.280
Alright.

02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:08.280
If that's it for the emails tonight.

02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:10.280
Yes, indeed it is.

02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:12.280
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:14.280
It's a chance for us to be angsty.

02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:16.280
Because, you know, for

02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:18.280
502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst

02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:20.280
on this show.

02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:36.280
My FU goes to the pizza, actually.

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.280
To Papa Murphy's Pizza in general.

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:40.280
Because this is actually the third time

02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:42.280
I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's Pizza.

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:44.280
And it's been a different kind of pizza

02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:46.280
every time.

02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:48.280
And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to

02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:50.280
swell, my throat itched.

02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:52.280
I'm so sorry because it's so good.

02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:54.280
I'm not complaining about how delicious

02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:56.280
the pizza was, but

02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:58.280
I was sitting here having... By the way, thank you for that.

02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:00.280
I was sitting here, like,

02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:02.280
literally having one of those,

02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:04.280
like, weird

02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:06.280
allergic reactions with the rash and everything.

02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:08.280
And I'm like, oh my god. Well, thank god

02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:10.280
Tim brings us drugs.

02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:12.280
You're welcome.

02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:14.280
But, I mean...

02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:16.280
This is the third time

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:18.280
I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's in Reactiswood.

02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:20.280
So, I don't think I'll be eating

02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:22.280
here again.

02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:24.280
Lucky.

02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:26.280
Lucky, United States Postal Service for just

02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:28.280
chilling on my package.

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:30.280
Instead of just, you know...

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:32.280
Usually that's what you want people to do.

02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:34.280
No, you don't want them to

02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:36.280
chill. You want them to fucking move around.

02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:38.280
You want them to be

02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:40.280
getting close to, you know,

02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:42.280
delivering the package.

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:46.280
And said no.

02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:48.280
They're just like...

02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:50.280
You want them to make that delivery.

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:52.280
Exactly. Make the delivery.

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:54.280
Get moving!

02:56:56.280 --> 02:56:58.280
I want my... Ooh, yeah!

02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:04.280
FU did the crappy heat

02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:06.280
here in Sacramento today.

02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:08.280
Because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market.

02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:10.280
But it was just too hot.

02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.280
We'll go bargain hunting for

02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:14.280
video games in October.

02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:16.280
Exactly. With those two

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:18.280
Sega prototype systems.

02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:20.280
They're going for like multi grand

02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:22.280
on eBay. Bought for a dollar.

02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:24.280
Yeah, I know, right?

02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:26.280
Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?

02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:28.280
Because that's where Trader Dan's was.

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:30.280
So, you're going to have a really hard time

02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:32.280
finding the good game sales at the flea market.

02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:34.280
I hope some of the flea market is still out.

02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:36.280
I bet Trader Dan

02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:38.280
started back up on eBay, though.

02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.280
I would bet.

02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:42.280
CaptainSpike, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:46.280
Tim, for

02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:48.280
preferring Super Mario Bros. 3

02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:50.280
to Super Mario World, and

02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:52.280
RageQuitting on me when we played Super Mario World.

02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:54.280
And you for making me play

02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:56.280
Ice Climber.

02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:58.280
Deal with it.

02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:00.280
Alright, Tim,

02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:02.280
do you have any FUs of the week?

02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:04.280
I do. It was a related note.

02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:06.280
Fuck you, Magikoopa.

02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:08.280
I am done with your shit.

02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:10.280
Fair enough.

02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:12.280
Alright.

02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:14.280
Let us

02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:16.280
do a couple more stories

02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:18.280
then we're going to open up the Skypline for a little bit.

02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:20.280
We are running super long tonight, though.

02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:22.280
So, I'm sorry. I might have to abbreviate

02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:24.280
some of the end of the show here.

02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:26.280
Let's at least get these new stories out of the way. Low key.

02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:28.280
Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened.

02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:30.280
And some of your big franchises

02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:32.280
have gone to, well, mainly Nordic Games.

02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:34.280
They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.

02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:36.280
And five of five games?

02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:38.280
Guess what they get drawn to life.

02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:40.280
So, yeah.

02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:42.280
Gearbox actually got a hold

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:44.280
of the

02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:46.280
Homeworld franchise.

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:48.280
The one that they were trying to

02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:50.280
buy via crowdfunding.

02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:52.280
And Nordic Games

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:54.280
actually has been working with THQ

02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:56.280
for a while now.

02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:58.280
Talking sequels and they're hopefully

02:58:58.280 --> 02:59:00.280
going to get the same developers back on board.

02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:02.280
Also, they purchased

02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:04.280
MX vs ATV and Titan Quest

02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:06.280
for the other two franchises they bought.

02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:08.280
And then THQ sold all this money

02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:10.280
to a lot of people.

02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:12.280
Including Double Fine.

02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:14.280
Codemasters for F1.

02:59:14.280 --> 02:59:16.280
And

02:59:16.280 --> 02:59:18.280
hell, they even own

02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:20.280
Ruben

02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:22.280
some money.

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:24.280
Different, I guess,

02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:26.280
bonuses or whatever. Employee obligations,

02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:28.280
they said.

02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:30.280
One more

02:59:30.280 --> 02:59:32.280
story for you guys tonight.

02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:34.280
And I think this is very interesting. It's one of those things

02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:36.280
I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner.

02:59:36.280 --> 02:59:38.280
But, you know, lately

02:59:38.280 --> 02:59:40.280
we've talked about a lot of crappy games.

02:59:40.280 --> 02:59:42.280
Or, I shouldn't say that necessarily they're crappy

02:59:42.280 --> 02:59:44.280
games, because there's still people that love them.

02:59:44.280 --> 02:59:46.280
But, games that get a crappy

02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:48.280
reputation based on the

02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:50.280
internet. Games such as

02:59:50.280 --> 02:59:52.280
Game City. Mass Effect 3

02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:54.280
in the ending.

02:59:54.280 --> 02:59:56.280
Aliens Colonial Marines. Duke Nukem Forever.

02:59:56.280 --> 02:59:58.280
Well, you know what? Before all of that

02:59:58.280 --> 03:00:00.280
there was ET, the

03:00:00.280 --> 03:00:02.280
extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:04.280
But see,

03:00:04.280 --> 03:00:06.280
when I was seven it wasn't as bad

03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:08.280
as everyone made it out to be. But the most frustrating thing

03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:10.280
was you always fell in the damn pit, right?

03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:12.280
Well, here's the interesting thing.

03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:14.280
A hacker went back

03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:16.280
and fixed some of the problems people have

03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:18.280
with the game. And now people are like

03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:20.280
this game's not so bad. It's kind of fun.

03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:22.280
So what were the things that were changed?

03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:24.280
Well, for one, they made ET an actual

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:26.280
ET color instead of, you know,

03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:28.280
that green. And most

03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:30.280
importantly, they fixed the

03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:32.280
falling in the pit all the time. Instead of one

03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:34.280
pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different

03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:36.280
collision detection, which makes it far

03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:38.280
less frustrating. You're not always

03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:40.280
falling in that stupid pit.

03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:42.280
So, now just so you guys know

03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:44.280
Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game

03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:46.280
and he was really rushed

03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:48.280
over time. As a lot of the movie tie-in games

03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:50.280
were at the time, he only had

03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:52.280
months to make it. Same thing happened with Pac-Man

03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:54.280
and why that turned out so bad, too.

03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:56.280
Isn't that funny? Pac-Man was awful.

03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:58.280
Isn't that funny how some things never seem to change?

03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:00.280
When it's rushed too much.

03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:02.280
We would think we'd learn from history.

03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:04.280
But anyway, yeah, so

03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:06.280
according to

03:01:06.280 --> 03:01:08.280
Warshaw himself, he said, I was either

03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:10.280
the golden child selected to do the project or

03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:12.280
I was the only one stupid enough to take on the challenge.

03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:14.280
You know, he did Yars

03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:16.280
Revenge too, which was a great, great game.

03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:18.280
But anyway,

03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:20.280
Neocomputer.org is

03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:22.280
the one that made the project that

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:24.280
tried to fix some of E.T.'s problems.

03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:26.280
And I believe

03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:28.280
the project ended up getting

03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:30.280
done by David Richardson

03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:32.280
who goes by the handle recompile.

03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:34.280
And that's pretty cool.

03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:36.280
From Atari age. He single-handedly,

03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:38.280
I guess, maybe this started the discussion

03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:40.280
there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.

03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:42.280
And fixed the well,

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:44.280
fixed the difficulty settings.

03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:46.280
So, like, not every step

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:48.280
will drain your energy.

03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:50.280
And some of this stuff. So, uh,

03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:52.280
yeah, pretty cool. And it even, like, showed

03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:54.280
tutorial videos and how they did it.

03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:56.280
Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself,

03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:58.280
they give you the addresses and what the

03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:00.280
change in the hex editor.

03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:02.280
I bet somebody like you is like, well, I know you don't hack a lot of

03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:04.280
Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fast.

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:06.280
The one that's already done. You can download the ROM, I think.

03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:08.280
Yeah, yeah.

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:10.280
But very cool.

03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:12.280
It's almost like how people

03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:14.280
will hack SimCity to play offline.

03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:16.280
Or fix, you know, alien colonial

03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:18.280
marines. But, you know, some of the stuff in there.

03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:20.280
It's just funny. Alright, so

03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:22.280
there you go. That's it for the

03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:24.280
official stories we have tonight. Let me know,

03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:26.280
let me open up the Skype line.

03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:28.280
1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on

03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:30.280
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one

03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:32.280
word. If you want to go ahead and give us a call,

03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:34.280
that would be awesome.

03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:36.280
If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:38.280
tonight, or something you think we missed, what you've

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:40.280
been playing, that's why you have a question for Captain Spike,

03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:42.280
or Tim, and want to talk about

03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:44.280
whatevers, give us a call.

03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:46.280
Say hello. 1877 Game O-L-R,

03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:48.280
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:50.280
Last minute stories, alright? So, in the

03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:52.280
same vein of Metal Gear Solid,

03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:54.280
and the sequels to that, and

03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:56.280
going with different voice actors, the

03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:58.280
next Arkham City game is

03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:00.280
not going to have the same Batman

03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:02.280
voice. They're going with someone younger.

03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:04.280
Deal breaker. So, I have

03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.280
Kevin Conroy will not be reprising Batman.

03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:08.280
I've, and some

03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:10.280
people are really frowning at the new Batman having

03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:12.280
multiplayer. I don't think

03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:14.280
that, again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with

03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:16.280
the bathwater and say, Batman sucks because

03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:18.280
they're adding multiplayer to it, because like Mass Effect

03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:20.280
3, it was fine. I really love the multiplayer

03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:22.280
Mass Effect 3. But I

03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:24.280
understand where people have some great reservations,

03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:26.280
especially hearing it's a new studio, and now all this

03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:28.280
other, like, it kind of sounds like they're trying

03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:30.280
to do this one on the cheap.

03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:32.280
That is a big concern.

03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:34.280
So,

03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:36.280
you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?

03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:38.280
I do agree.

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:40.280
Which is, because, Arkham

03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:42.280
City is so fucking good.

03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:44.280
Like, this next game,

03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:46.280
to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be

03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:48.280
a step above that. When you hear things like this,

03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:50.280
you kind of go, not sure

03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:52.280
if, want?

03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:54.280
We'll see. I'm sure E3 is going to answer

03:03:54.280 --> 03:03:56.280
a lot of that. Anything else?

03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:58.280
1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype,

03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:00.280
Orange Launch Radio, if you want to call. All one word.

03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:02.280
Not really, but there's been some

03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:04.280
Kickstarter projects I've been looking at, like, for example,

03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:06.280
Anne, which is kind of a cross between

03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:08.280
like, a Metroidvania game and

03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:10.280
like, Gradius. So you get to fly around

03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:12.280
the ship, and you get to also,

03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:14.280
I guess it's more like Blaster Master.

03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:16.280
You get to fly around a ship, or you get to go outside

03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:18.280
on foot and stuff.

03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:20.280
And it looks kind of cool.

03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:22.280
Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says,

03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:24.280
the reason why the new Batman game has a younger

03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:26.280
version actor is because the game takes place

03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:28.280
years before Arkham Asylum. It's a prequel.

03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:30.280
That's why they went with somebody younger.

03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:36.280
That's an excuse.

03:04:36.280 --> 03:04:38.280
He's a voice actor.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:40.280
He's played younger Batman

03:04:40.280 --> 03:04:42.280
in different, you know, animated series

03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:44.280
and what have you. He's been doing this voice a long time.

03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:46.280
He's very good. They also didn't hear

03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:48.280
your mic off or something?

03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:50.280
He's done a teenage

03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:52.280
Bruce Wayne, and did a wonderfully

03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:54.280
believable job.

03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:56.280
Alright, we got a phone call here. Hi, you're on Orange

03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:58.280
Radio. Who's this?

03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:00.280
Dartitsouria. Hey, Dartitsouria.

03:05:00.280 --> 03:05:02.280
What's up, buddy?

03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:04.280
Hey.

03:05:04.280 --> 03:05:06.280
Oh, not a whole lot.

03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:08.280
I'm just, you know, hanging in there.

03:05:08.280 --> 03:05:10.280
Well, what'd you want to

03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:12.280
call us about tonight?

03:05:12.280 --> 03:05:14.280
Well, I had a, uh,

03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:16.280
hang on, let me mute my...

03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:18.280
Are you here?

03:05:18.280 --> 03:05:20.280
Did you forget to mute your radio before

03:05:20.280 --> 03:05:22.280
you called in?

03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:24.280
Yeah, I was trying to.

03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:26.280
Sorry. No, I had a, uh,

03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:28.280
so I have a

03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:30.280
Steam key for La Mulana.

03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:32.280
I want to donate to the show.

03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:34.280
Heck yeah.

03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:36.280
Wait, didn't

03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:38.280
Dark Sakura have dibs on that?

03:05:38.280 --> 03:05:40.280
Something? La Mulana on Steam?

03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:42.280
Yeah.

03:05:42.280 --> 03:05:44.280
Because I was like, if she ain't taking it,

03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:46.280
I'm taking it. Shit, I want to play it.

03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:48.280
I came super close to buying it until I remembered.

03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:50.280
Oh, there you go.

03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:52.280
Well, as much as I would love

03:05:52.280 --> 03:05:54.280
to give a key away to the listener, uh,

03:05:54.280 --> 03:05:56.280
to the listeners, um, I think we want to

03:05:56.280 --> 03:05:58.280
kind of keep it for ourselves. Sorry, but

03:05:58.280 --> 03:06:00.280
I want to play. Only because you rave about

03:06:00.280 --> 03:06:02.280
it so much. Yeah. Do we want to play it for

03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:04.280
ourselves?

03:06:04.280 --> 03:06:06.280
Yeah. Why should we all be

03:06:06.280 --> 03:06:08.280
playing La Mulana?

03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:12.280
Well, it's a fun game.

03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:14.280
It's like, like, you know,

03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:16.280
those old school games were

03:06:16.280 --> 03:06:18.280
tough, but, you know.

03:06:18.280 --> 03:06:20.280
Yeah.

03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:22.280
La Mulana, isn't La Mulana, like,

03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:24.280
asshole Mario hard?

03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:26.280
Uh,

03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:28.280
it can be, but let's get the hang of it.

03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:30.280
It's just, it's just memorizing

03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:32.280
patterns, just like old MegaMakers. You know what?

03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.280
I will be magnanimous

03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:36.280
and donate

03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:38.280
that code to you.

03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:40.280
Yay!

03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:42.280
Alright, uh,

03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:44.280
Dark Tetsuya, I, I, I,

03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:46.280
thank you very much for, for donating

03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:48.280
the code to us and feeding our gaming

03:06:48.280 --> 03:06:50.280
addiction further.

03:06:50.280 --> 03:06:52.280
ActDeft in the chat room says, La

03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:54.280
Mulana is your Mass Effect.

03:06:54.280 --> 03:06:56.280
True? I bet he

03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:58.280
doesn't have Turians. Yeah, I suppose so.

03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:00.280
Alright.

03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:02.280
Well, Dark Tetsuya, is there anything else you want to talk about,

03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:04.280
talk, talk with us about tonight?

03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:06.280
Uh,

03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:08.280
just had a question.

03:07:08.280 --> 03:07:10.280
Yeah.

03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:12.280
So, um, so I was planning

03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:14.280
on, uh, Best Gets 3. Yeah?

03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:16.280
Right.

03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:18.280
I kind of need, uh, Episode 169

03:07:18.280 --> 03:07:20.280
to finish

03:07:20.280 --> 03:07:22.280
working on it.

03:07:22.280 --> 03:07:24.280
Oh, for, um,

03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:26.280
uh, is this, this is the, um,

03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:28.280
the, is this the DDR step file

03:07:28.280 --> 03:07:30.280
stuff?

03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:32.280
Oh, no, that's the, uh,

03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:34.280
Best Hits compilation.

03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:36.280
So, best hits. Oh!

03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:38.280
So you, you need Episode 169?

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:40.280
You don't have that? I think he said 159.

03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:42.280
Uh-uh. Alright,

03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:44.280
we'll have to find it. If I don't have it,

03:07:44.280 --> 03:07:46.280
then I'm sure Misty or Angel's got to have

03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:48.280
it, or maybe somebody else has

03:07:48.280 --> 03:07:50.280
a, I will look for it,

03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.280
but there is an episode in the past

03:07:52.280 --> 03:07:54.280
that is gone forever. There is a missing

03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:56.280
episode that's completely gone, because

03:07:56.280 --> 03:07:58.280
we weren't able to save it that night. And we were

03:07:58.280 --> 03:08:00.280
too drunk to remember. There might actually be two.

03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:02.280
So, there are a couple gaps

03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:04.280
that you're going to find that, unfortunately,

03:08:04.280 --> 03:08:06.280
they're gone forever.

03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:08.280
Not a big deal.

03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:10.280
Alright. Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, we're going to let you go to get

03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:12.280
more calls, but take care, okay?

03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:14.280
Alright.

03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:16.280
Sorry, he had some type of echo going on

03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:18.280
in the background. It kind of made it hard for me

03:08:18.280 --> 03:08:20.280
to hear. I think he didn't really mute the computer.

03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:22.280
Or he had the TV on in the background.

03:08:22.280 --> 03:08:24.280
He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.

03:08:24.280 --> 03:08:26.280
And, uh... Damn that show.

03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:28.280
Listen to us at the

03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:30.280
same time. By the way, though, I did find a character

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:32.280
I like. Daenerys.

03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:34.280
Because she sets people on fire.

03:08:34.280 --> 03:08:36.280
And she inquires

03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:38.280
about the location of her dragons.

03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:40.280
1877 GameOLR

03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:42.280
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:44.280
if you want to give us a call. Loki, can you talk again?

03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.280
I'm talking.

03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:48.280
And my mic is not working.

03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:50.280
Why is your mic just suddenly stopped working?

03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:52.280
That's weird. Because your board

03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:54.280
is possessed. Maybe it just

03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:56.280
needs to be dusted. It is kind of...

03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:58.280
I wonder if our board might

03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:00.280
just be... I mean, we've had that board

03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:02.280
six years now.

03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:04.280
It was a

03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:06.280
damn expensive board. It should last.

03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:08.280
I know. I'm just saying.

03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:10.280
That's the reality. We might need something else.

03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:12.280
Well, maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.

03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:14.280
The contacts need to be...

03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:16.280
We'll work on it. Live Radio.

03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:18.280
Ain't it a blast? Because we didn't learn

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:20.280
that we were going to have audio problems

03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:22.280
until, like, Bobby's

03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:24.280
call tonight. Yeah, really, right?

03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:26.280
Alright. I'm going to

03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:28.280
just leave it open a little longer for another call.

03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:30.280
1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype,

03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:32.280
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us

03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:34.280
a call. I'm going to quickly try

03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:36.280
to comb the Twitter topics at Twitter.com

03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:38.280
slash O-L-R.

03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:40.280
TigerClaw is sending us a tweet.

03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:42.280
Eve Online getting a TV show based

03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:44.280
on real player stories.

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:46.280
Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is

03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:48.280
doing? But yeah, Eve Online

03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:50.280
of course is an MMO that's been around for a

03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.280
while. It's that whole

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:54.280
space one. Isn't that the one where

03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:56.280
they had all that loot of

03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:58.280
game time cards that were

03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:00.280
on a ship and the ship exploded and it's like

03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:02.280
all that money is just gone?

03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:04.280
So yeah, Eve Online going to get a TV

03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:06.280
show based on the stories in game. That's pretty cool.

03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:08.280
Can you imagine if they turned

03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:10.280
fanfic into TV shows? Because that's

03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:12.280
essentially what they're saying here. Oh no, they did it.

03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:14.280
Well, I don't know.

03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:16.280
They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.

03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:18.280
I was going to say

03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:20.280
that. Except for

03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:22.280
creepy Shega.

03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:24.280
Yeah, that really upset me.

03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:26.280
That was so date rapey. Oh my god.

03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:28.280
I felt dirty watching

03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.280
it on YouTube.

03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:32.280
Just

03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:34.280
filthy.

03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:36.280
Let's see, also at Twitter.com

03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:38.280
slash O-L-R

03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.280
a tweet from

03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:42.280
ActDeaf. The third Skullgirls

03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:44.280
DLC character voting has ended.

03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:46.280
The fans chose Eliza, an

03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:48.280
Egyptian based character.

03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:50.280
You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the

03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:52.280
Brony community. I'm not surprised

03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:54.280
that ActDeaf's reporting on this. That's a

03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:56.280
big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot

03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:58.280
actually. Brony? No, Skullgirls.

03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:00.280
Oh, Skullgirls? Yeah. Well. There's a

03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:02.280
big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.

03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:04.280
That was a great alliance that they made.

03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:06.280
Let's be real. So,

03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:08.280
that's Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash

03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:10.280
O-L-R.

03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:12.280
Nobody's calling.

03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:14.280
Nobody wants to say hi. How sad.

03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:16.280
Come on, call us.

03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:18.280
We won't yell at you much.

03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:20.280
Fifth Dream in Chats is that's who they voted

03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:22.280
for.

03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:24.280
So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting

03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:26.280
a Kickstarter. Oh, wait. Here.

03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:28.280
Wait, no. She read that during the

03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:30.280
rapid fire news. Yeah. I just want to remind

03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:32.280
everybody to kickstart it when it actually

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:34.280
comes online. But it's not the real thing.

03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:36.280
Who cares?

03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:38.280
It has to be Kunio where it's nothing

03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:40.280
else. Also, My Sleep looks awesome.

03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:42.280
I kickstarted that one.

03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:44.280
Among the Sleep, it's the one where it's a

03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:46.280
survivor horror. The horror game

03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:48.280
where you play as a two year old. From the

03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:50.280
perspective of a two year old. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:52.280
I would play the hell out of that. Kickstarting

03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:54.280
right now. They need money. You know what?

03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:56.280
I actually found a Kickstarter since

03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:58.280
we don't have the one yet for Understanding

03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:00.280
Video Games. I'm actually

03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:02.280
except I think it's already over was contributing

03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:04.280
to a Dr. Demento album.

03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:06.280
Like another big compilation

03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:08.280
in honor of Dr. Demento's birthday.

03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:10.280
I thought it only had like two days left on it

03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:12.280
a couple days ago. But I love

03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:14.280
Dr. Demento. So, whatever.

03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:18.280
Alright. Well, our listeners are being

03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:20.280
shy tonight. Oh, come on. Give them one more chance.

03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:22.280
Alright, one more chance. I'll leave it open a little

03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:24.280
bit longer here.

03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:26.280
Oh, I didn't do

03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:28.280
Thank you. This is how we can fill time.

03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:30.280
Listless results.

03:12:30.280 --> 03:12:32.280
Thank you. Yeah, I did.

03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:34.280
I wasn't paying attention.

03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:36.280
Everybody's out of it tonight. These sound

03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.280
problems just snowballed

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:40.280
into LOL. Alright, let's go over

03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:42.280
listless results tonight.

03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:46.280
You know why I didn't do listless results? Because in my

03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:48.280
head, I already know. I already tabulated them up.

03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:50.280
Alright, here we go. We don't live in your

03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:52.280
head, thank God. Here it is. The

03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:54.280
definitive list as voted on by the listeners.

03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:56.280
Mascot, we are going to donate to

03:12:56.280 --> 03:12:58.280
Sega in a close fourth

03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:00.280
place, worth mentioning. Master

03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:02.280
System, the Sega robot. In a very close

03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:04.280
fourth place. Yay. In third

03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:06.280
honestly, the way the listeners

03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:08.280
voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to

03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:10.280
say. So, I cannot argue with

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:12.280
this at all. Number three.

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:14.280
The number three answer for Mascot, we

03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:16.280
will donate to Sega. An amalgamation

03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:18.280
of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:20.280
It's the one I would have voted

03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:22.280
for. There it is, number three.

03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:24.280
Number two,

03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:26.280
as voted by the listeners.

03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:28.280
President Cat. Yay.

03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:30.280
Fair enough, fair enough. We love you, Reena.

03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:32.280
And the number one

03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:34.280
answer of Mascot, we

03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:36.280
will, and I don't know how we're going to do this,

03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:38.280
maybe I can get somebody to put together a little

03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:40.280
clip art, something for us. We can actually send this

03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:42.280
to Sega, like a nice little envelope.

03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:44.280
The number one answer that we

03:13:44.280 --> 03:13:46.280
will gift on behalf of OLR,

03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:48.280
a forklift, ladies

03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:50.280
and gentlemen, a forklift.

03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:54.280
I approve. Does the

03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:56.280
forklift have a name? A forklift one out of

03:13:56.280 --> 03:13:58.280
all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?

03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:00.280
Really? And Loki.

03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:02.280
Forky.

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:04.280
Forky the Forklift.

03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:06.280
You know what? Can't

03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:08.280
I'll draw it. Can't the name be Q-Q-Q-Q

03:14:08.280 --> 03:14:10.280
so it's 4Q the Forklift?

03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:12.280
Oh my god,

03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:14.280
that's great.

03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:16.280
4Q the Forklift. And then he comes

03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:18.280
into that song.

03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:20.280
No, that's Taku.

03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:22.280
Alright, there it is,

03:14:22.280 --> 03:14:24.280
your winner of the list tonight. Don't give that

03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:26.280
disapproving

03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:28.280
It's funny and you know it.

03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:30.280
It's my default look.

03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:32.280
You're so mean.

03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:34.280
Sometimes

03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:36.280
I wish it were a TV show. DungeonBuster wants

03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:38.280
to see the forklift fight the Daytona

03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:40.280
car. I don't know, the forklift

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:42.280
would fight dirty.

03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:44.280
It would just get under the car and flip it.

03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:46.280
But the Daytona

03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:48.280
car has the power of AM2 behind it.

03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:52.280
Perfect Q-Q-Q-Q.

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:54.280
Alright, again, the Skypline

03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:56.280
not lighting up. What's up with y'all?

03:14:56.280 --> 03:14:58.280
So I'm gonna close it. Sorry

03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:00.280
maybe Skype screwed up.

03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:02.280
Everything else is screwed up on tonight's show. Why not

03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:04.280
Skype? Alright. Well

03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:06.280
that is about gonna wrap it up for another episode

03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:08.280
of Orange Lawns Radio. But before we go around and get

03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:10.280
all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests

03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:12.280
for being here tonight. Tim,

03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:14.280
I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.

03:15:14.280 --> 03:15:16.280
I'm glad

03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:18.280
to have you do it.

03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:20.280
And I'm glad that you liked my gift.

03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:22.280
Yes, thank you very much.

03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:24.280
I'm gonna slap you when we get home tonight.

03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:26.280
Whoa.

03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.280
Isn't that a little TMI?

03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:30.280
Come on you guys.

03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:32.280
But good luck with

03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:34.280
whatever it is you guys are working on next.

03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:36.280
And thanks for talking about

03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:38.280
how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.

03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:40.280
Sure, it was my pleasure.

03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:42.280
Do you have any questions on Twitter or anything you might

03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:44.280
if listeners want to follow you further or whatever?

03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:46.280
Sure, TimTRP

03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:48.280
at Twitter.

03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:50.280
I'm sort of TimTRP at everything because I have no

03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:52.280
imagination.

03:15:52.280 --> 03:15:54.280
If you have any more questions for me or questions about

03:15:54.280 --> 03:15:56.280
getting into the game industry or whatever, I'm happy

03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:58.280
to talk to you about it.

03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:00.280
Alright, awesome. I'll be sure to give you my resume.

03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:02.280
CaptainSpike

03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:04.280
it's about fucking time you came back to the show.

03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:06.280
Thanks for being here. I literally haven't seen you

03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:08.280
in years. Even if you are so mean to me

03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:10.280
all of the time. But that's alright.

03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:12.280
I am mean to you all the time.

03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:14.280
It's like my second favorite thing to do.

03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:16.280
But it comes out of a place of love, or at least

03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:18.280
it better.

03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:20.280
Okay, we can go with that.

03:16:20.280 --> 03:16:22.280
You dick. Alright.

03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:24.280
Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear

03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:26.280
your own show.

03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:28.280
Which I take back every nice thing I said about it

03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:30.280
earlier in the show.

03:16:30.280 --> 03:16:32.280
It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:34.280
tonight. But on the off chance

03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:36.280
anyone does care

03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:38.280
Gamebuoy.org

03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:40.280
Gaming news and views that aren't on your radar

03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:42.280
but maybe should be. We'd really

03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:44.280
appreciate the hits. And I just

03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:46.280
want to say so much. Thank all three of you

03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:48.280
so much for having me here tonight. It's actually

03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:50.280
been quite a bit of fun and I really

03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:52.280
do wish it hadn't been like seven years since

03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:54.280
the last time I was on. Well, make

03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:56.280
better and come back on a more regular basis

03:16:56.280 --> 03:16:58.280
at some point. I would love to.

03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:00.280
Fantastic. Love it. Alright.

03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:02.280
Well, we're going to go around

03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:04.280
and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up

03:17:04.280 --> 03:17:06.280
shop tonight. Um, Loki

03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:08.280
who doesn't have a microphone. Loki, do you

03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:10.280
have a final thought tonight? I wish my microphone

03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:12.280
worked.

03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:14.280
Fair enough. Uh, Dark Soccer, your final

03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:16.280
thought tonight. My throat feels like a desert.

03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:18.280
Uh, and my final thought

03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:20.280
tonight is Haters to the left.

03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:22.280
Uh.

03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:24.280
Captain

03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:26.280
Spike, your final thought tonight.

03:17:28.280 --> 03:17:30.280
I hate you so much.

03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:32.280
And last but not

03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:34.280
least, Tim, your final thought tonight.

03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:36.280
Um,

03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:38.280
I just ate some potato chips that taste

03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:40.280
like they're Doritos and they taste

03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:42.280
like Doritos

03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:44.280
tacos and in the computer science

03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:46.280
world we call that recursion.

03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:48.280
Recursive

03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:50.280
chips. Love

03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:52.280
it. Thank you guys so much for downloading

03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:54.280
and listening to our show or listening to it live or however

03:17:54.280 --> 03:17:56.280
you participate. Thank you for being a part of

03:17:56.280 --> 03:17:58.280
Orange Lounge Radio. If you like what you heard,

03:17:58.280 --> 03:18:00.280
all we ask is tell a friend or two about

03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:02.280
the show because we don't have, you know, $35,000

03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:04.280
to promote our show. No tea, no

03:18:04.280 --> 03:18:06.280
shade. All tea, all shade. Shade that wave.

03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:08.280
I'm totally judging right now.

03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:10.280
Uh, but, uh, we would really appreciate it.

03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:12.280
Leave a five star review on iTunes.

03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:14.280

03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:20.280
a game you guys. Uh, spread

03:18:20.280 --> 03:18:22.280
good in the gamer community. Do some good.

03:18:22.280 --> 03:18:24.280
