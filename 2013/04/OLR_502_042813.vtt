WEBVTT

00:14.877 --> 00:19.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.382
[SPEAKER_04]: More video games are set to become movies.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.723
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you really get pizza delivered with your 360?

00:31.943 --> 00:37.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.727 --> 00:40.069
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.729 --> 00:47.554
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:47.734 --> 00:50.776
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:51.036 --> 00:51.557
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

00:51.837 --> 00:52.717
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:53.798 --> 00:54.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Sated.

00:55.379 --> 00:56.780
[SPEAKER_06]: Sated or satiated?

00:56.800 --> 00:57.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Sated.

00:57.961 --> 00:59.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did have pizza.

01:00.262 --> 01:01.683
[SPEAKER_01]: But wouldn't that be... Oh, whatever.

01:02.004 --> 01:02.304
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:03.745 --> 01:05.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Grammar specifics aside.

01:06.546 --> 01:09.568
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to tell Prince Brightstar, I've been playing PSO2.

01:10.829 --> 01:12.710
[SPEAKER_06]: What did he ask?

01:12.790 --> 01:13.210
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.953
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so I was just affirming that, yes, I did get everything to work.

01:17.553 --> 01:19.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:19.494 --> 01:20.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?

01:21.184 --> 01:26.405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I have to repatch my game and redo the translations and blah, and I've had other stuff to play.

01:27.685 --> 01:29.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:30.266 --> 01:30.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

01:30.766 --> 01:31.346
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Loki?

01:31.646 --> 01:32.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.

01:32.326 --> 01:32.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

01:33.266 --> 01:34.007
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new with you?

01:34.387 --> 01:35.207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm collecting drugs.

01:35.547 --> 01:36.647
[SPEAKER_08]: You're collecting drugs?

01:37.307 --> 01:43.128
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm finishing my pickups on the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.

01:43.969 --> 01:45.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I see what you did there.

01:45.309 --> 01:45.629
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:46.709 --> 01:47.530
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:10.567 --> 02:23.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 98% of you, this is all new Please say hello, everybody, to From the GameBooey.org podcast Say hello to Captain Spike Hi Hi, how are you, Spike?

02:24.196 --> 02:25.557
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing pretty good, thank you for having me

02:26.005 --> 02:26.926
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

02:27.566 --> 02:31.790
[SPEAKER_06]: And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim.

02:32.290 --> 02:32.670
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

02:32.931 --> 02:33.511
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Tim?

02:33.991 --> 02:35.072
[SPEAKER_00]: I am quaking in my boots.

02:35.152 --> 02:36.693
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first podcast ever.

02:36.814 --> 02:37.374
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really?

02:37.654 --> 02:37.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

02:38.014 --> 02:38.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, you're like...

02:41.397 --> 02:45.379
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also Rob's first podcast.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.520
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've stolen your guest virginity.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.121
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose so.

02:50.221 --> 02:51.921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about that.

02:51.961 --> 02:55.423
[SPEAKER_06]: You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.

02:56.123 --> 02:59.365
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, like every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.

02:59.625 --> 03:04.647
[SPEAKER_06]: No disrespect to those who are doing podcasts, but like Captain Spike, I'm calling myself an idiot.

03:05.007 --> 03:08.308
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really surprising.

03:09.149 --> 03:09.869
[SPEAKER_06]: You've never done this before.

03:13.376 --> 03:14.697
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll be gentle, I promise.

03:14.937 --> 03:15.257
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

03:15.377 --> 03:16.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you're welcome.

03:17.578 --> 03:18.279
[SPEAKER_06]: Break out the feathers.

03:18.579 --> 03:24.522
[SPEAKER_06]: So before we get into how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys about the things you guys do.

03:24.602 --> 03:25.643
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to start with Spike.

03:26.103 --> 03:30.226
[SPEAKER_06]: So a few years ago, I know you came on OLR like seven years ago.

03:30.266 --> 03:31.766
[SPEAKER_06]: That was back when I lived with Extifer, right?

03:32.447 --> 03:33.267
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure was, yeah.

03:33.427 --> 03:34.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember what we even talked about then?

03:36.189 --> 03:37.470
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

03:37.830 --> 03:38.670
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you and I meet?

03:39.291 --> 03:39.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell the listeners.

03:40.219 --> 03:40.819
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.942
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, we were on a message board.

03:45.002 --> 03:47.223
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an IRL meetup party.

03:47.303 --> 03:52.866
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like an hour.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't smoke, guys.

03:54.647 --> 03:55.107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad for you.

03:55.127 --> 03:56.008
[SPEAKER_05]: No, smoking is bad.

03:56.028 --> 03:56.588
[SPEAKER_06]: So we quit.

03:56.648 --> 03:57.229
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to ask.

03:57.249 --> 03:58.569
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the Djarams, right?

03:58.709 --> 03:59.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.

03:59.610 --> 04:00.090
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, death.

04:00.871 --> 04:01.811
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's anything other.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.633
[SPEAKER_06]: So fast forward to today.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.614
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got your podcast now.

04:07.654 --> 04:08.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about Game Boy.

04:08.415 --> 04:08.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

04:10.415 --> 04:13.658
[SPEAKER_05]: I host the Gamebuoy.org video game podcast.

04:14.239 --> 04:28.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of niche genres that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.

04:30.143 --> 04:40.773
[SPEAKER_06]: I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast and obviously I'm not being rude with that but it is so easy to do it now but surely you kind of have to take that step like why do I want to do a podcast?

04:40.793 --> 04:42.835
[SPEAKER_06]: So why Captain Spike did you want to do a podcast?

04:43.618 --> 04:57.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and you know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this, but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.

04:57.910 --> 04:58.290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

04:58.610 --> 05:06.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, you know, we started Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do.

05:07.658 --> 05:08.418
[SPEAKER_06]: And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.

05:08.458 --> 05:08.879
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

05:11.115 --> 05:12.596
[SPEAKER_05]: No, all tea, all shade.

05:12.976 --> 05:14.557
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it for free.

05:14.697 --> 05:16.058
[SPEAKER_05]: We spend money on it.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.398
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, we're not getting paid.

05:17.699 --> 05:17.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

05:18.679 --> 05:20.720
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like that you guys have a niche.

05:20.960 --> 05:27.264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had people ask me before because we have had this podcast a long, long, long, long time.

05:27.544 --> 05:32.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, hey, Rob, how do I start a podcast?

05:32.486 --> 05:36.769
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going to warn you, it's a very â€“

05:37.749 --> 05:40.431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people in this pool, and people have peed in this pool.

05:40.451 --> 05:43.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of gross.

05:43.053 --> 05:45.194
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff, but you've got to find your niche.

05:45.375 --> 05:48.096
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?

05:48.136 --> 05:49.798
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?

05:50.178 --> 05:51.619
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get me noticed, right?

05:51.979 --> 05:54.661
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys have your niche, and I think it's fun.

05:54.701 --> 06:00.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you guys don't just talk about under-the-radar news, but I notice you kind of theme a lot of your episodes.

06:00.785 --> 06:05.989
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way, I noticed.

06:06.009 --> 06:06.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

06:06.297 --> 06:18.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but we really wanted to have sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.

06:20.265 --> 06:20.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

06:21.225 --> 06:24.307
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's you and, what do you call him on the show?

06:24.327 --> 06:24.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I know his real name.

06:25.007 --> 06:26.748
[SPEAKER_06]: What's his first mate, Slidekick?

06:26.788 --> 06:29.010
[SPEAKER_05]: That is first mate, Slidekick, yeah.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you guys have been buds forever, right?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.653
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years, nearly.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

06:35.359 --> 06:39.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Slykick's my frenemy in the WoW podcasting community, so that's always a lot of fun.

06:39.302 --> 06:43.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.

06:44.406 --> 06:45.667
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have episodes on my phone.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.450
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were the subscriber!

06:49.470 --> 06:50.410
[SPEAKER_06]: That was me!

06:50.991 --> 06:52.992
[SPEAKER_05]: You were their Legion of Fan.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.175
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when I ran out of history podcasts.

06:56.795 --> 06:58.817
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, there's always this one.

06:59.217 --> 07:01.179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.020
[SPEAKER_01]: People were like, what are you on?

07:04.401 --> 07:08.164
[SPEAKER_06]: But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick because I was in chat and everything.

07:09.485 --> 07:09.985
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so mean.

07:11.266 --> 07:13.907
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me talk about you as a gamer.

07:13.948 --> 07:18.370
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously you must have been into all the music games and stuff like we were because you were on the show at that time.

07:20.092 --> 07:21.993
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into gaming at all?

07:22.473 --> 07:23.794
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you start playing video games?

07:24.715 --> 07:25.695
[SPEAKER_06]: What hooked you into this?

07:25.755 --> 07:26.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you a gamer?

07:27.376 --> 07:48.060
[SPEAKER_05]: um why am I a gamer um my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games so I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know the old Irem game I think it was Irem I don't know and uh after that you know got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there

07:49.093 --> 07:49.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.835
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite video games ever?

07:51.935 --> 07:54.577
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your favorite things that have ever been done?

07:55.818 --> 07:57.439
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario World and Bayonetta

07:58.748 --> 08:01.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.

08:01.210 --> 08:07.575
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has some of the best situational awareness in a 3D action game that I've ever seen.

08:08.036 --> 08:08.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

08:08.896 --> 08:14.521
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction and what have you.

08:14.641 --> 08:17.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.

08:17.983 --> 08:23.047
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next to Bayonetta.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.248
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I think that's great.

08:24.288 --> 08:26.270
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't usually dare to name

08:27.010 --> 08:46.049
[SPEAKER_06]: For all practical purposes, a current game I mean, I know it's a couple years old at this point But a current generation game as a classic But no, I think that's great I think it's super well designed And I think that Super Mario World is certainly the best designed 2D platformer So you must have been excited about Virtual Console this week?

08:46.365 --> 08:51.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first thing I did was download it and play it until my second player rage quit on me.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.347
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, but Magic Koopa?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.247
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is crap.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, what else do I want to ask you about games?

09:00.948 --> 09:06.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Bayonetta 2, then, and this whole it's exclusive for Nintendo.

09:06.529 --> 09:08.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you at with Nintendo?

09:08.230 --> 09:09.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your head at?

09:09.050 --> 09:14.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks, and it's a kiddie thing, and da-da-da-da-da.

09:15.091 --> 09:17.112
[SPEAKER_06]: But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2.

09:17.312 --> 09:18.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your head at with that?

09:18.353 --> 09:20.854
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.

09:21.615 --> 09:29.720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably also a bad business choice.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.302
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from, so I'm happy.

09:35.030 --> 10:01.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to our chatroom, we always have the other guests on our show The live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show And looking at our chatroom, we see some comments such as Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Bayonetta rocks Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers Once you had the NES version, you'd blow right through the entire game

10:02.210 --> 10:02.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely true.

10:03.212 --> 10:03.713
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

10:03.933 --> 10:06.938
[SPEAKER_06]: And then does it lose something, though, once you play it on the console?

10:07.138 --> 10:09.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, can you go back and play it in the arcade now that you've just beat it?

10:10.626 --> 10:14.327
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I mean, you know, I didn't really want to either.

10:14.567 --> 10:21.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages of Nintendo Fun Club, Nintendo Power, you know.

10:23.289 --> 10:23.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

10:24.609 --> 10:25.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

10:25.469 --> 10:31.911
[SPEAKER_06]: And going to RossDLUT says, Arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain quarters.

10:31.971 --> 10:32.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they were.

10:33.411 --> 10:34.231
[SPEAKER_06]: I always think of that.

10:34.972 --> 10:39.393
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember Wayne's World, which turned 20 years old apparently this month?

10:40.033 --> 10:42.474
[SPEAKER_06]: How old does that make you feel and me feel right now, right?

10:42.534 --> 10:44.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing that Wayne's World is 20 years old, right?

10:44.894 --> 10:53.197
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade, and the guy goes, yeah, we just got this new game, and when you kill the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.

10:53.537 --> 10:55.378
[SPEAKER_06]: The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.

10:55.418 --> 10:56.158
[SPEAKER_06]: He never shows up.

10:57.551 --> 11:01.503
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm like oh that's like so old arcade machine like I love it.

11:01.604 --> 11:04.793
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up there with the boss of Carnival being named Token Taker.

11:08.529 --> 11:37.656
[SPEAKER_06]: uh let's see and um Slagkick in chat uh agreeing with Tim apparently saying Magikoopa is a ratchet hoe there you go thank you Slagkick alright um so if people want to check out your podcast which I do recommend it's a great listen even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I don't know I'd like to see you do it more often but no pressure what's with that what you're being so rude that's a compliment I am a guest no that's a compliment that means I want more of it alright how's that a bad thing

11:37.916 --> 11:38.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

11:38.316 --> 11:38.616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

11:38.756 --> 11:39.357
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

11:39.457 --> 11:40.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell everybody how they can listen to your show.

11:40.737 --> 11:41.858
[SPEAKER_01]: Good things come to those who wait.

11:41.998 --> 11:42.438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

11:43.499 --> 11:47.021
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to GameBooey.org.

11:47.801 --> 11:50.862
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we're also on iTunes, GameBooey Podcast.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard to miss.

11:53.544 --> 11:55.605
[SPEAKER_06]: And the art actually looks like a little Game Boy.

11:55.925 --> 11:56.685
[SPEAKER_06]: But Booey.

11:57.025 --> 11:57.426
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

11:57.606 --> 11:57.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Booey.

11:59.505 --> 11:59.885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

12:00.065 --> 12:00.426
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

12:00.866 --> 12:01.126
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

12:03.268 --> 12:05.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.

12:07.190 --> 12:17.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you have a lot of timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might be outdated, you've got a good chunk that's timeless.

12:17.557 --> 12:20.299
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is one of your best episodes out of the ones you've done so far?

12:20.419 --> 12:24.462
[SPEAKER_06]: If I need to go back and find a good conversation, which one would you recommend most?

12:25.276 --> 12:50.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock Infinite, a game which, as a game, I was kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms of games.

12:51.505 --> 12:57.994
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that for a couple hours and I was really happy with how it came out despite it being unpleasantly long.

13:00.888 --> 13:01.328
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

13:01.368 --> 13:04.491
[SPEAKER_06]: This show's really unpleasantly long, most every week, so it's all good.

13:06.513 --> 13:11.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also had a pretty in-depth discussion on LGBT issues in games.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.561
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually going to do a follow-up on that this summer, so I'm very excited.

13:15.861 --> 13:20.445
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good part to plug the GamerX panel that is coming up.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.769
[SPEAKER_06]: GamerX is, what, the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?

13:25.329 --> 13:34.977
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted on right now at GamerConnect.com And our panel is Podcast X Zone, right?

13:35.598 --> 13:49.029
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody, it's going to be, I'm representing OLR And we're hopefully getting some folks from Horde House too, and then of course Game Buoy Podcast The Koopa Club guys out of Chicago are coming out, they're going to be there

13:49.629 --> 13:52.651
[SPEAKER_06]: and Game Bar I think has representation, right?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I leaving anybody out so far?

13:54.872 --> 13:55.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Those shows?

13:55.653 --> 14:00.375
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it, although we are in talks with a couple other podcasts for representation.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Podcast X Zone at GamerConnect.

14:03.197 --> 14:03.737
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be fun.

14:04.117 --> 14:07.959
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear they're announcing the guests for GamerCon later tonight, so that's exciting.

14:07.979 --> 14:09.160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a fun show.

14:11.132 --> 14:11.573
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

14:12.193 --> 14:19.017
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.

14:19.137 --> 14:24.081
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we were taping live on Bobby Blackwolf, my usual mic died.

14:24.541 --> 14:32.526
[SPEAKER_06]: So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.568
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just we had to do a last-minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear us at all.

14:36.688 --> 14:38.149
[SPEAKER_01]: We replaced Rob with a pod person.

14:38.269 --> 14:38.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

14:39.150 --> 15:06.679
[SPEAKER_06]: well I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming up as usual and I just don't have the time like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like I'll try to make it a little louder but um hopefully it won't sound too terrible when I listen back to it later because Shane's messaging me in the chat like you're gonna hate listening to this later because you sound off that's probably accurate all right um anyhow let's move on uh Tim

15:07.739 --> 15:08.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

15:08.179 --> 15:09.500
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a podcast.

15:09.580 --> 15:09.980
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.561
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you're coming on our show the first time.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a brand new world.

15:16.202 --> 15:17.302
[SPEAKER_06]: You work in the games industry.

15:17.502 --> 15:17.762
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

15:17.962 --> 15:18.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do you work for?

15:18.822 --> 15:20.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I work for Crystal Dynamics.

15:20.343 --> 15:22.463
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would we know out of Crystal Dynamics?

15:23.104 --> 15:24.844
[SPEAKER_06]: We just released a game called Tomb Raider.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think I've heard of that.

15:26.265 --> 15:26.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

15:26.705 --> 15:27.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

15:27.545 --> 15:30.206
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you guys do that Matt Cross game that never came out?

15:31.146 --> 15:32.186
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Crystal Dreams.

15:34.227 --> 15:35.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, do you get that?

15:35.428 --> 15:37.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Do people get confused with the other companies?

15:37.889 --> 15:40.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know Telltale and Traveler's Tales all the time.

15:41.471 --> 15:43.552
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.

15:43.732 --> 15:46.494
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gotten a lot of people who wonder, who are you?

15:46.634 --> 15:51.697
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll say something like Tomb Raider, or I'll say Legacy of Kain, and suddenly they're like, oh, are you going to make a new Legacy of Kain?

15:53.518 --> 15:55.079
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the most common question.

15:55.179 --> 15:55.459
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you?

15:56.821 --> 15:57.683
[SPEAKER_00]: No comment!

15:58.764 --> 15:59.125
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

15:59.245 --> 15:59.946
[SPEAKER_00]: And Deade.

16:00.046 --> 16:00.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.111
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no, I totally respect that, obviously.

16:05.955 --> 16:08.139
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's that DLC for Guardian of Light.

16:08.239 --> 16:08.860
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.

16:09.381 --> 16:10.162
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go get it right now.

16:10.182 --> 16:10.743
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that enough?

16:10.923 --> 16:11.925
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that enough for you people?

16:14.474 --> 16:17.576
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what did you do?

16:17.897 --> 16:35.071
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a software engineer, meaning I program the computers that make them do things Specifically, I work in physics and collision and simulation So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, that was me So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?

16:36.052 --> 16:37.934
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can blame me Or when the clothes clip?

16:38.494 --> 16:40.356
[SPEAKER_06]: When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me Okay

16:41.460 --> 17:08.253
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a good thing you didn't work on one of the games I played this week because there was that problem all over not not Tomb Raider let me be clear not Tomb Raider but something else I was like wow like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as he's playing it that tends to happen does that happen when you play other games you're like this is this is I would have done this so different I'm always in that zone so I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at I'm looking at the performance of their physics I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm

17:08.853 --> 17:09.273
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

17:36.164 --> 17:36.804
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

18:05.768 --> 18:07.949
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?

18:08.009 --> 18:10.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?

18:10.209 --> 18:12.270
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?

18:12.990 --> 18:14.031
[SPEAKER_00]: About five years ago.

18:14.191 --> 18:14.791
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

18:14.891 --> 18:15.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a while.

18:16.191 --> 18:17.592
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did you have to keep that a secret?

18:17.612 --> 18:20.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they only announced that, what, two, two and a half years ago?

18:20.473 --> 18:22.934
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.

18:23.014 --> 18:23.594
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.

18:24.794 --> 18:25.294
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that hard?

18:26.675 --> 18:27.435
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.256
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty antisocial, so...

18:31.886 --> 18:33.967
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key to NDAs.

18:34.148 --> 18:34.748
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a hermit.

18:35.128 --> 18:35.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

18:36.729 --> 18:38.430
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go on podcasts for one.

18:38.450 --> 18:38.971
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, no.

18:39.091 --> 18:39.931
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to make sure.

18:39.951 --> 18:42.233
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very out of character.

18:42.633 --> 18:43.694
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into that?

18:43.954 --> 18:45.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take a step back.

18:46.175 --> 18:50.078
[SPEAKER_06]: What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?

18:50.198 --> 18:54.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you must have kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did you end up where you're at?

18:54.841 --> 18:55.601
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

18:55.942 --> 18:58.763
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a science nerd all my life, but I've also been a computer nerd.

18:59.323 --> 19:01.965
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this obvious cross-section I didn't see at the time.

19:02.265 --> 19:10.129
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to undergrad for computer science, and later I went to grad school, and I did some more computer graphics and gaming-centric studies.

19:10.789 --> 19:18.253
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that, and I found simulation was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.772
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?

19:22.554 --> 19:29.702
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an ex-classmate who worked there as an artist, and he got me an interview.

19:30.463 --> 19:38.572
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone straight out of grad school, and it was the perfect position for me, so I sort of lucked out.

19:39.488 --> 19:41.090
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them you know someone who does print material.

19:43.712 --> 19:48.957
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.

19:48.977 --> 19:50.979
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.

19:51.179 --> 19:53.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, a lot of people are playing this game right now.

19:55.123 --> 20:00.829
[SPEAKER_06]: I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking about when it comes to sales and all that, but

20:01.209 --> 20:02.930
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's great, okay?

20:02.990 --> 20:03.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

20:04.371 --> 20:10.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great, and I think a lot of people feel the same way.

20:12.497 --> 20:21.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Or when somebody plays a game like Tomb Raider, and you obviously do a lot with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?

20:22.283 --> 20:30.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something that you pay a special attention to detail to this, but you think people... I don't want to say necessarily that people don't appreciate it, but maybe it goes unnoticed, this work that you do?

20:31.789 --> 20:32.630
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.871
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider.

20:34.891 --> 20:36.751
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got the people who run right through the game.

20:37.352 --> 20:40.333
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, those people have to play the puzzles, which are based on physics.

20:40.353 --> 20:41.854
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of shoved in their face.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.514
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't miss that.

20:42.934 --> 20:50.437
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid bodies that are around the world to make everything come to life.

20:50.797 --> 20:52.538
[SPEAKER_00]: Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze.

20:53.058 --> 20:56.560
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of time on that to make that look good and natural.

20:56.980 --> 21:11.853
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes the whole environment come alive but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at they sort of will just run by and of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and cranny and so they're going to see all those little things they're going to see every detail that's not correct

21:12.233 --> 21:15.414
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.

21:15.454 --> 21:18.575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers and da-da-da.

21:18.655 --> 21:21.575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower.

21:23.216 --> 21:23.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

21:24.396 --> 21:27.177
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it's a good thing Laura Croft can't pick flowers.

21:27.237 --> 21:27.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Or can she?

21:27.657 --> 21:28.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss that?

21:28.077 --> 21:28.497
[SPEAKER_00]: She can.

21:28.617 --> 21:28.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

21:29.077 --> 21:30.398
[SPEAKER_06]: There are plants to pick.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.078
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

21:32.678 --> 21:34.339
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.

21:34.399 --> 21:37.099
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks.

21:37.239 --> 21:38.460
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix the green herb.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.942
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them and move.

21:44.462 --> 21:45.062
[SPEAKER_00]: I made those.

21:45.882 --> 21:46.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

21:47.903 --> 21:51.184
[SPEAKER_06]: So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.

21:51.984 --> 22:00.987
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that overall the reception you're getting is positive is that important for somebody like you?

22:01.448 --> 22:05.509
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at reviews and that positive affirmation is that something you're like

22:06.423 --> 22:07.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm so happy to see that.

22:07.864 --> 22:10.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are you like, eh, it doesn't really change anything?

22:10.507 --> 22:11.808
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really proud of the game.

22:11.868 --> 22:14.050
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with the whole thing.

22:14.070 --> 22:16.352
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.

22:17.613 --> 22:22.577
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to tell myself I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest, I love praise.

22:23.197 --> 22:23.397
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

22:25.639 --> 22:28.301
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.842
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to read those reviews.

22:29.962 --> 22:32.423
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing.

22:33.104 --> 22:35.625
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really, like, stick in my craw.

22:36.286 --> 22:37.847
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh... Sure, sure.

22:38.207 --> 22:41.129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for this show.

22:41.429 --> 22:43.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'll go on iTunes and there'll be five-star reviews.

22:43.270 --> 22:46.272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five-star review.

22:46.352 --> 22:46.952
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was awesome.

22:46.972 --> 22:51.295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go to, like, a one-star review where, you know, it's like, everybody's screaming all the time.

22:51.335 --> 22:53.637
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna...

22:54.597 --> 22:55.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that.

22:55.598 --> 22:58.399
[SPEAKER_01]: At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.

22:59.780 --> 23:00.641
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that one?

23:01.141 --> 23:02.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Did that really happen?

23:02.121 --> 23:02.522
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.262
[SPEAKER_05]: That really happened.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.483
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with people?

23:05.683 --> 23:07.144
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like after our second year.

23:08.485 --> 23:11.887
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I know what you mean.

23:11.947 --> 23:14.488
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?

23:15.069 --> 23:15.329
Yes.

23:17.987 --> 23:19.548
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.308
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something about me you might not know.

23:23.669 --> 23:24.749
[SPEAKER_06]: I was implying that was your mother.

23:24.769 --> 23:26.090
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from Rob Robson.

23:28.090 --> 23:31.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes.

23:31.111 --> 23:33.512
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, the death scenes, the death scenes.

23:33.932 --> 23:35.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?

23:37.013 --> 23:41.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you about... When I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the Conan O'Brien review.

23:42.515 --> 23:43.656
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the Conan O'Brien review?

23:43.696 --> 23:43.916
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

23:43.956 --> 23:44.597
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hilarious.

23:44.617 --> 23:46.258
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?

23:46.319 --> 23:47.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

23:48.581 --> 23:55.106
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's that part where they're doing the tree thing over and over and over, and they're playing it up for laughs.

23:56.027 --> 23:57.449
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of like a serious thing.

23:57.609 --> 24:00.531
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but did you notice the quality of the laughs?

24:00.591 --> 24:02.153
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't just, oh, that's hilarious.

24:02.253 --> 24:07.277
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like every time, it was first, oh, then laughter.

24:07.297 --> 24:07.698
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24:07.958 --> 24:09.360
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:29.449 --> 24:57.041
[SPEAKER_06]: um you know there's there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of um like I I I see it I don't know if it was intentional but I see elements of like Metroidvania like that type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before but I kind of see it in there now um do you do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider because I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day like because clearly you're wearing a Mass Effect hoodie but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt yeah I know I know I know but uh

24:58.703 --> 25:02.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day, do you get inspiration from other games?

25:02.570 --> 25:06.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see things in other games that you want to do with Tomb Raider?

25:07.657 --> 25:10.540
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, however, I'm not really the one making those decisions.

25:11.121 --> 25:12.923
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the creative and the design team.

25:13.743 --> 25:24.574
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there may be games that I like and I think, hey, we should take this element from that game because it's awesome, because there's something to learn there, it's not going to go ignored, but it's not really my place.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the problems I'm trying to solve.

25:27.297 --> 25:30.861
[SPEAKER_00]: There are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.

25:31.881 --> 25:32.542
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, they do.

25:32.602 --> 25:35.963
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.

25:36.523 --> 25:41.645
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.

25:42.145 --> 25:46.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it wasn't... Okay, so when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.

25:46.847 --> 25:48.787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, it is totally like that movie.

25:48.847 --> 25:52.869
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some shot-for-shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.

25:53.069 --> 25:56.790
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat, as a studio, back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so scary.

25:58.091 --> 25:59.371
[SPEAKER_00]: It scared the crap out of me.

26:00.031 --> 26:02.072
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that on the big screen, okay?

26:02.712 --> 26:04.573
[SPEAKER_01]: That movie creeped me out so hard.

26:04.693 --> 26:05.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.495
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like what Alan called the game, though.

26:08.695 --> 26:12.737
[SPEAKER_01]: Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible, very bad day.

26:13.737 --> 26:14.958
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever that book was.

26:15.058 --> 26:16.959
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think he also just called it Girl.

26:17.379 --> 26:17.519
Yeah.

26:20.129 --> 26:25.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so girl is the first, the first girl game.

26:25.314 --> 26:28.377
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?

26:28.998 --> 26:32.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so multiplayer, you know, I, I do the other show about Warcraft.

26:32.681 --> 26:34.303
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about PV and PVP all the time.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.444
[SPEAKER_06]: PVP is unpredictable.

26:35.764 --> 26:38.387
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.

26:38.427 --> 26:43.631
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what attacks the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.

26:44.392 --> 26:50.658
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause different things when you're planning environments and things like that?

26:50.678 --> 26:52.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that?

26:53.461 --> 26:55.203
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually didn't work on multiplayer.

26:55.283 --> 26:55.543
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

26:55.663 --> 27:00.368
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiplayer was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.

27:01.109 --> 27:05.854
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.

27:05.954 --> 27:07.956
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on single player in Redwood City.

27:08.516 --> 27:12.017
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in Montreal they worked on multiplayer.

27:12.037 --> 27:17.298
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part of the active development of that.

27:17.558 --> 27:18.318
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

27:18.819 --> 27:19.179
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

27:19.539 --> 27:20.519
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you played the multiplayer?

27:21.499 --> 27:23.140
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little bit of the multiplayer.

27:23.380 --> 27:28.901
[SPEAKER_00]: I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people, but...

27:31.723 --> 27:34.044
[SPEAKER_06]: You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?

27:34.344 --> 27:35.344
[SPEAKER_00]: I did for a little while.

27:35.384 --> 27:36.765
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to bounce around at the studio.

27:37.165 --> 27:37.645
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.

27:38.005 --> 27:39.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I liked Guardian of Light too.

27:39.065 --> 27:41.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Guardian of Light was more like arcade-y for me.

27:41.646 --> 27:42.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

27:42.746 --> 27:43.606
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's not a bad thing.

27:43.626 --> 27:45.587
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on Xbox Live Arcade.

27:45.607 --> 27:46.567
[SPEAKER_06]: This was supposed to happen, right?

27:47.007 --> 27:49.168
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing, though.

27:49.608 --> 27:56.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I don't understand about Guardian of Light, and I need help, is that you have the Guardian of Light game, and that's Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura,

27:58.071 --> 28:06.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there two Loras now, or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light, it's not really about that anymore, it's about Laura or what?

28:06.395 --> 28:08.997
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.

28:09.057 --> 28:10.237
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start over.

28:10.277 --> 28:13.999
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create a brand new property.

28:14.019 --> 28:15.880
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do everything over.

28:16.180 --> 28:19.262
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.583
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different game.

28:20.683 --> 28:21.684
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different universe.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.224
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a fresh start.

28:23.424 --> 28:26.026
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have any baggage from any other games, so.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.378
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.

28:31.099 --> 28:34.461
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.

28:34.661 --> 28:35.902
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

28:36.242 --> 28:39.424
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I think it would be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.

28:40.344 --> 28:40.644
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

28:40.744 --> 28:40.924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

28:41.425 --> 28:48.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know when it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you do and you don't want to say.

28:48.328 --> 28:50.949
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess let me just turn it over to you for anything general.

28:51.089 --> 28:55.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or about your work or what have you?

28:57.033 --> 28:59.896
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think you guys should all buy it.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.958
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd really appreciate that.

29:03.139 --> 29:06.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.

29:07.824 --> 29:09.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this.

29:10.006 --> 29:11.428
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into just games?

29:11.808 --> 29:13.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you a video gamer?

29:14.232 --> 29:17.496
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.738
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an Atari 2600 in the house.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.322
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.

29:24.502 --> 29:26.324
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.

29:27.205 --> 29:29.387
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I sort of, like, this is mine.

29:30.067 --> 29:32.290
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have this all the time.

29:32.330 --> 29:34.352
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems.

29:35.112 --> 29:35.913
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got a few.

29:36.493 --> 29:37.354
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the NES.

29:37.514 --> 29:40.436
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo, and that was the worst thing in the world.

29:43.258 --> 29:50.904
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing in the world was to go over to my cousin's house or certain neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was the coolest shit ever.

29:52.565 --> 29:53.806
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a big computer nerd.

29:53.846 --> 29:54.746
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked to program.

29:54.967 --> 30:01.091
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first taught myself how to program, it was in QBasic, and the first things I did was try to make games.

30:01.712 --> 30:02.292
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were horrible.

30:02.392 --> 30:04.734
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

30:23.769 --> 30:24.129
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

30:24.329 --> 30:24.790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

30:24.810 --> 30:31.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry, like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I want to work in games.

30:31.653 --> 30:32.253
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice?

30:33.714 --> 30:34.855
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

30:34.935 --> 30:35.455
[SPEAKER_00]: Make games.

30:35.815 --> 30:41.478
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer, so I'm going to go do computer science or something.

30:41.518 --> 30:53.224
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.

30:53.784 --> 30:56.886
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as early as possible, start making games.

30:58.287 --> 30:59.168
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be great.

30:59.488 --> 31:00.909
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start modding other games.

31:00.949 --> 31:04.772
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start scripting within packages.

31:04.812 --> 31:06.813
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use free engines like Unity.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.335
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of resources out there.

31:10.376 --> 31:12.277
[SPEAKER_00]: So make as many games as you can.

31:12.897 --> 31:14.318
[SPEAKER_00]: Show people that you're passionate about it.

31:15.479 --> 31:20.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo?

31:20.964 --> 31:22.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Worst parents ever.

31:22.345 --> 31:23.946
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the worst parents ever.

31:24.606 --> 31:25.527
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forgive them for that.

31:25.547 --> 31:26.348
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not nice.

31:27.549 --> 31:31.992
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.

31:32.232 --> 31:33.473
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cut a lot of grass.

31:35.515 --> 31:36.075
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

31:36.956 --> 31:40.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, looking at Blackwolf says, I wrote games in QBasic too.

31:42.551 --> 31:43.332
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

31:58.846 --> 32:00.607
[SPEAKER_08]: The Classic Tunneling Problem

32:14.873 --> 32:29.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed Oh, the games I made on my TI-82 See, I couldn't do any of that shit I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends

32:30.819 --> 32:31.599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you on this one

32:46.025 --> 32:49.050
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the engine done, but I mean, a TI-82 sucks.

32:49.150 --> 32:52.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?

32:52.555 --> 32:59.946
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class, and by the time he was done, I was playing Pole Position on his graphing calculator.

33:00.808 --> 33:01.268
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.

33:01.429 --> 33:01.689
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

33:02.233 --> 33:04.014
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.

33:04.074 --> 33:04.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Start small.

33:04.635 --> 33:10.278
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to be creative.

33:10.599 --> 33:21.386
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines and then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.

33:22.127 --> 33:24.528
[SPEAKER_06]: If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.

33:24.568 --> 33:25.249
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed the color.

33:25.609 --> 33:26.249
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

33:26.329 --> 33:26.770
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me.

33:27.610 --> 33:49.132
[SPEAKER_06]: um okay one more question then we're gonna get into our gaming weeks but uh same thing I asked uh Spike a minute ago what is like your favorite video game ever you're not allowed to name something you worked on oh damn it I'm taking that off the table right now so what so what what's like your favorite video game ever you know what I'm really bad at coming up with favorites yeah hmm well I I

33:51.593 --> 33:54.775
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a jacket for Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.

33:55.036 --> 33:56.376
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.

33:56.877 --> 33:59.378
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jamie's like... That's why we're all friends.

33:59.818 --> 34:03.080
[SPEAKER_00]: We're great friends because of that.

34:03.321 --> 34:06.663
[SPEAKER_00]: And to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Bros.

34:06.683 --> 34:06.663
3.

34:06.823 --> 34:09.104
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say Super Mario Bros.

34:09.384 --> 34:09.104
3.

34:09.544 --> 34:11.706
[SPEAKER_05]: Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.

34:13.371 --> 34:13.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

34:13.771 --> 34:14.932
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 vs. Super Mario World

34:33.948 --> 34:37.070
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't own Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.

34:37.410 --> 34:41.272
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your hatred towards Super Mario Bros.

34:41.632 --> 34:41.272
3?

34:42.132 --> 34:44.773
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.

34:45.573 --> 34:46.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone loves it, so I hate it.

34:47.074 --> 34:48.895
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.

34:49.135 --> 34:49.795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I knew you were.

34:49.835 --> 34:50.736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I cut you off.

34:50.996 --> 34:52.336
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts on Ocarina, then?

34:54.157 --> 35:00.420
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all, except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.

35:03.362 --> 35:03.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 3

35:26.278 --> 35:28.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario World or neither one.

35:28.700 --> 35:29.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.

35:32.082 --> 35:36.445
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because this is about the Marios there.

35:36.505 --> 35:43.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that pop up right there underneath the chat.

35:43.670 --> 35:44.510
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can vote in the poll.

35:44.550 --> 35:45.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is better?

35:45.531 --> 35:48.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one?

35:49.193 --> 35:49.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.

35:49.974 --> 35:50.334
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither.

35:50.354 --> 35:51.515
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Mario is missing.

35:53.136 --> 35:53.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario typing?

35:53.877 --> 35:53.917
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

35:57.148 --> 35:57.688
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.

36:24.867 --> 36:25.207
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

36:25.287 --> 36:25.987
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.

36:26.067 --> 36:27.368
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for dealing with me.

36:27.948 --> 36:28.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

36:28.668 --> 36:32.849
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain Spike, right?

36:33.049 --> 36:33.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

36:34.149 --> 36:34.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, you're out of here.

36:34.890 --> 36:35.090
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

36:35.170 --> 36:37.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.

36:38.670 --> 36:38.931
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

36:39.211 --> 36:42.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

36:43.372 --> 36:44.712
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

36:45.365 --> 36:46.526
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out I'm old.

36:47.508 --> 36:49.189
[SPEAKER_01]: I played TDR last night.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.733
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like death warmed over after I was done.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.816
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't beat an 8-footer anymore, Rob.

36:56.037 --> 36:57.679
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do Superstar anymore, Rob.

36:58.079 --> 37:02.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to just do it the first game either, you know?

37:03.105 --> 37:03.746
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you need.

37:04.687 --> 37:05.588
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs a montage.

37:06.648 --> 37:07.888
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not need a freaking montage.

37:07.928 --> 37:10.869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where you get better in a short amount of time.

37:10.989 --> 37:12.729
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta have a montage.

37:13.649 --> 37:19.030
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have nothing else to do.

37:19.110 --> 37:19.950
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm unemployed.

37:20.811 --> 37:34.193
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also I guess I can say now that I'm playing it even though I can't say anything else about it is I'm playing the beta of Final Fantasy XIV.

37:35.270 --> 37:35.790
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Windhurst.

37:58.382 --> 37:58.842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say graphically...

38:28.934 --> 38:35.796
[SPEAKER_01]: On par with modern... Which is good, because it's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.

38:35.816 --> 38:42.117
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in the processing power required, it's definitely a big step over WoW.

38:42.777 --> 38:43.917
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm sure I can say.

38:44.578 --> 38:47.778
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June.

38:48.979 --> 38:54.900
[SPEAKER_01]: I started playing Phantasy Star Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, PrinceBrightStar.

38:56.000 --> 39:12.815
[SPEAKER_01]: and I actually there was a patch that happened after I started playing so I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little redhead Newman person chick and I want an OPA OPA mag

39:14.150 --> 39:14.591
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

39:14.831 --> 39:25.585
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked my ass off to have an Opa Opa in the first Fantasy Storm Online and goddammit I'm gonna have another Opa Opa and I'm gonna have a Master System because I'm a Sega nerd.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.655
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid.

39:28.895 --> 39:32.676
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, it was my brother's, but I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.

39:34.077 --> 39:34.657
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just saying.

39:35.537 --> 39:39.338
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.

39:39.559 --> 39:42.980
[SPEAKER_01]: We left Rock Band out, so I did some... I tried singing alone.

39:43.680 --> 39:54.724
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Minecraft last night, trying to get this... Someone made the Ocarina of Time map in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load, and I still can't figure out how to get it to load as its own world, so whatever.

39:55.684 --> 40:03.388
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, so instead I just went around in my house building, digging more gopher holes in my house.

40:04.328 --> 40:05.669
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, God, what else did I play?

40:05.689 --> 40:06.429
[SPEAKER_01]: I played something else.

40:06.810 --> 40:10.912
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, Drunken Robot Pornography, which is super awesome.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.272
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like jumping flash on crack.

40:12.532 --> 40:13.533
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been telling everyone about it.

40:14.533 --> 40:19.196
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I, um, got the indie pack last night.

40:19.316 --> 40:21.077
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've only installed, uh,

40:21.937 --> 40:23.038
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the Future Back to the Future

40:42.927 --> 40:43.948
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked interesting.

40:43.968 --> 40:44.828
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a neat game.

40:45.749 --> 40:47.050
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've downloaded a few games.

40:47.430 --> 40:51.433
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that Dungeon Quest or something.

40:51.493 --> 40:52.273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a puzzle game.

40:52.794 --> 40:54.915
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's sort of a side-scrolling combat puzzle game.

40:54.935 --> 40:55.675
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Dungeon Hearts.

40:55.896 --> 40:56.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dungeon Hearts.

40:56.656 --> 40:57.337
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

40:57.457 --> 40:58.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane just did a review of that.

40:58.617 --> 40:59.638
[SPEAKER_06]: It just went up on VOG today.

40:59.798 --> 41:01.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was part of the deal.

41:01.579 --> 41:07.803
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I spent like eight bucks and got some good games and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.

41:08.604 --> 41:08.764
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

41:10.345 --> 41:11.386
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play any of them yet.

41:11.406 --> 41:15.609
[SPEAKER_01]: I just installed a few of them because I have been working on projects.

41:17.090 --> 41:18.852
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my gaming week.

41:19.753 --> 41:20.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we go to Loki.

41:20.873 --> 41:21.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

41:21.274 --> 41:21.694
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing.

41:22.194 --> 41:22.915
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been playing Grid 2.

41:23.996 --> 41:24.496
[SPEAKER_06]: The racing game?

41:24.817 --> 41:26.358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with his three monitor setup.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.199
[SPEAKER_06]: He's such a man.

41:28.700 --> 41:29.800
[SPEAKER_01]: So manly, doodly.

41:30.381 --> 41:36.366
[SPEAKER_01]: I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my Tumblr just to show off what his setup looks like.

41:36.386 --> 41:36.606
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

41:38.240 --> 41:45.306
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it Awesome Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki The results of the live poll Which is better?

41:45.406 --> 41:58.577
[SPEAKER_06]: The winner with 54.17% of the vote Mario 3 Hells yeah Captain Spike Sorry about it I'm going home You're taking your ball and going home?

42:01.480 --> 42:02.922
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Mario 3 is the winner there.

42:03.863 --> 42:06.406
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was a couple votes for neither one.

42:06.446 --> 42:06.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

42:07.348 --> 42:11.112
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.

42:12.935 --> 42:14.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

42:15.598 --> 42:16.799
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought stuff too.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.281
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.

42:19.192 --> 42:20.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, what the hell?

42:21.513 --> 42:22.954
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, Rockstar Games.

42:24.035 --> 42:26.276
[SPEAKER_08]: During the weekend, it's supposed to be the Steam sale, okay?

42:26.296 --> 42:27.637
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on sale during the weekend.

42:28.057 --> 42:29.918
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today, they're like, guess what?

42:29.938 --> 42:31.179
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pulling fucking double sale.

42:31.599 --> 42:32.800
[SPEAKER_08]: We're marking it down again.

42:32.820 --> 42:36.382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.

42:36.542 --> 42:41.525
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was $25 for, you know, all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's $12 for all the Grand Theft Auto games.

42:41.865 --> 42:43.646
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.

42:45.086 --> 42:46.067
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked that up.

42:46.127 --> 42:47.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the indie bundle as well.

42:48.128 --> 42:51.770
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really installed anything other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

42:51.790 --> 42:54.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't played that though.

42:54.552 --> 42:58.814
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Saints Row the 3rd on PC just trying to 100% everything.

42:58.914 --> 43:03.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, according to the game, I am 100% right now because I have all the unlockables and stuff.

43:05.818 --> 43:10.800
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to do all the Saints book stuff which is really boring from what I remember the last time.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it pissed me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because

43:14.062 --> 43:19.206
[SPEAKER_08]: I had all that pretty much done except for one carjacking or one car theft mission.

43:20.987 --> 43:22.168
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to do it all over again.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.510
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.

43:26.550 --> 43:29.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we were talking about that last week.

43:29.392 --> 43:30.473
[SPEAKER_06]: That video was hilarious.

43:30.553 --> 43:32.494
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is fucking hilarious.

43:32.855 --> 43:33.795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just awesome.

43:33.815 --> 43:34.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan got grossed out.

43:35.376 --> 43:36.317
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know.

43:36.677 --> 43:38.739
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery.

43:38.779 --> 43:40.180
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to go watch it on YouTube or something.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.101
[SPEAKER_08]: I managed to... It was...

43:42.301 --> 43:42.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

44:12.961 --> 44:13.401
[SPEAKER_08]: Organ 3.

44:14.062 --> 44:14.422
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

44:15.142 --> 44:17.082
[SPEAKER_08]: Still can't figure out how to get the heart out, though.

44:17.102 --> 44:21.203
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the stomach and the esophagus are still in there.

44:21.464 --> 44:25.165
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.

44:26.585 --> 44:27.145
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.045
[SPEAKER_08]: I still can't pass that.

44:28.546 --> 44:33.167
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock and assumed that it was... Try pickaxe.

44:34.087 --> 44:34.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Pickaxe?

44:34.647 --> 44:36.048
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried the axe.

44:36.188 --> 44:37.268
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried the saw.

44:37.708 --> 44:38.468
[SPEAKER_08]: All I did was kill him.

44:39.008 --> 44:40.829
[SPEAKER_08]: So... I don't know.

44:41.915 --> 44:47.040
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw someone trying to do that one and there was a stint that you could insert in.

44:47.200 --> 44:53.307
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that Dan and I were watching and we just got through the whole part where the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.

44:53.735 --> 44:54.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was hard.

44:54.355 --> 44:56.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there and I'm like, oh, this is it.

44:56.696 --> 44:58.036
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, just swallow some pills.

44:58.056 --> 44:59.477
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got diazepam.

44:59.497 --> 45:01.458
[SPEAKER_01]: So swallow some pills and calm yourself.

45:01.718 --> 45:07.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Dungeon Buster is talking about this game in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.

45:07.039 --> 45:09.680
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.

45:09.980 --> 45:11.321
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with this game?

45:13.727 --> 45:15.328
[SPEAKER_01]: Best game ever or best game ever.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make me go to a live poll.

45:20.111 --> 45:21.052
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome.

45:21.693 --> 45:22.693
[SPEAKER_08]: It is pretty awesome.

45:23.154 --> 45:25.535
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I played a bunch of that.

45:26.896 --> 45:29.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, something I'm going to try to bring back that I tried this week.

45:30.198 --> 45:31.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Very short notice so no one joined.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.601
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine because I still had fun playing it.

45:34.261 --> 45:36.143
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.

45:36.163 --> 45:36.744
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's cool.

45:36.804 --> 45:37.284
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.

45:37.324 --> 45:39.206
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it was very short notice.

45:39.226 --> 45:41.729
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided, hey, let's bring back VOG Game Night.

45:41.769 --> 45:43.130
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm going to start doing.

45:43.170 --> 45:47.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, pick a game.

45:47.475 --> 45:47.915
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

45:47.935 --> 45:48.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

45:48.136 --> 45:48.917
[SPEAKER_08]: You can live stream something.

45:48.937 --> 45:49.297
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

45:49.357 --> 45:51.840
[SPEAKER_01]: I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.

45:51.860 --> 45:52.220
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's fine.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.803
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VOG listeners?

45:54.983 --> 45:55.503
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fuck no.

45:55.543 --> 45:56.504
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.

45:57.145 --> 45:57.285
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

45:57.525 --> 45:59.185
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG Game Night will never be Mass Effect 3.

45:59.225 --> 45:59.545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

45:59.625 --> 46:01.586
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless I'm out one night and then you can host it.

46:02.166 --> 46:06.207
[SPEAKER_06]: At any game convention there's multiple games to pick from so I'm sure it'll be fine.

46:07.187 --> 46:17.289
[SPEAKER_08]: This coming week I'm going to do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA which is fine because I haven't actually played that in a while so I played that for two or three hours and it was fun.

46:17.969 --> 46:24.670
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss that because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on the server that we have of the VOG server but

46:26.269 --> 46:27.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Survival is kind of fun.

46:27.490 --> 46:33.155
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for a while, then you wanted to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff.

46:33.196 --> 46:35.618
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun.

46:35.638 --> 46:39.001
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of fun to kind of play something different than just creative mode.

46:39.902 --> 46:41.003
[SPEAKER_08]: And I forgot that you have to eat.

46:41.443 --> 46:42.864
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, shit, that's right.

46:43.105 --> 46:44.986
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to do that now.

46:45.747 --> 46:46.648
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of fun.

46:48.029 --> 46:49.811
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played that and...

46:51.530 --> 46:51.970
[SPEAKER_08]: God, what else?

46:52.050 --> 46:53.731
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's got to be some other shit I played.

46:54.231 --> 46:55.672
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Call of Duty.

46:55.752 --> 47:02.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I've been playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 through the campaign because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with.

47:02.716 --> 47:04.037
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to get more people in.

47:04.977 --> 47:08.959
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot of the campaign.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.240
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's okay.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of comparable.

47:12.261 --> 47:16.524
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think I played Defiance one of these nights, which is still fun.

47:16.944 --> 47:17.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

47:17.364 --> 47:17.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you watch the show?

47:17.924 --> 47:18.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you watching the show, too?

47:18.684 --> 47:19.524
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not watching the show.

47:19.564 --> 47:20.325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sci-fi show.

47:20.345 --> 47:21.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

47:21.805 --> 47:23.645
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where the bar's set on that, okay?

47:23.705 --> 47:24.366
[SPEAKER_08]: How rude!

47:24.686 --> 47:25.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't he rude right now?

47:26.406 --> 47:26.786
[SPEAKER_08]: Rude?

47:26.946 --> 47:27.446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

47:27.506 --> 47:28.006
[SPEAKER_08]: Sci-fi.

47:28.026 --> 47:31.167
[SPEAKER_08]: Purveyors of such wonderful films as, you know, Shark the Puss.

47:31.427 --> 47:33.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.

47:33.507 --> 47:34.628
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sci-fi the network.

47:34.668 --> 47:38.168
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not dogging sci-fi, like, the genre.

47:38.249 --> 47:40.669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying sci-fi the TV network.

47:40.689 --> 47:42.069
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that's acceptable.

47:43.330 --> 47:43.690
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

47:44.470 --> 47:45.070
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just...

47:46.550 --> 47:47.270
[SPEAKER_05]: Manskito.

47:50.092 --> 47:50.492
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

47:51.572 --> 47:54.854
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's good, but I'm not into the world.

47:54.914 --> 47:57.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it was like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better.

47:58.115 --> 47:59.476
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not excited about Sharknado?

48:02.444 --> 48:03.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's in Sharknado?

48:03.585 --> 48:06.548
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a legit thing.

48:06.588 --> 48:11.493
[SPEAKER_00]: Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus starring the wonderful Debra Gibson.

48:11.513 --> 48:19.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's something that I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out.

48:19.902 --> 48:20.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Birdemic 2.

48:21.523 --> 48:22.465
[SPEAKER_00]: That warranted a sequel?

48:22.885 --> 48:23.085
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

48:23.406 --> 48:24.387
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy thought it was good.

48:25.108 --> 48:26.350
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he made another movie.

48:26.811 --> 48:28.413
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, he seriously thinks it's good.

48:28.633 --> 48:32.558
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money from it.

48:33.239 --> 48:33.580
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.

48:34.301 --> 48:35.122
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna spend another 10,005 days.

48:37.512 --> 48:38.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob found it, Sharknado.

48:38.353 --> 48:45.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210 and Tara Reid is the star of Sharknado.

48:45.719 --> 48:46.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she going to be the shark?

48:46.440 --> 48:47.321
[SPEAKER_06]: I am here for that.

48:47.421 --> 48:48.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, when does this come on?

48:48.942 --> 48:50.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

48:52.445 --> 48:53.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look at IMDB to figure out.

48:53.967 --> 48:55.788
[SPEAKER_08]: So what exactly is a Sharknado?

48:55.848 --> 48:58.851
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that like a tornado with sharks in it?

48:59.031 --> 49:00.152
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw, help me out.

49:00.312 --> 49:01.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea, bad idea.

49:04.796 --> 49:10.700
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Horde House multiplayer stream.

49:12.121 --> 49:12.801
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

49:12.881 --> 49:13.842
[SPEAKER_06]: I like doing the live streaming.

49:13.862 --> 49:17.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I turn into a very potty-mouthed person.

49:17.645 --> 49:19.186
[SPEAKER_08]: What they need is just do Landsharks.

49:19.366 --> 49:24.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Landsharks and have, like, you know... But it has to be, like... Knock on the door and go, Candy Graham.

49:25.154 --> 49:29.259
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.362
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.725
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.

49:33.885 --> 49:34.866
[SPEAKER_08]: So Minecraft XBLA.

49:35.547 --> 49:37.229
[SPEAKER_08]: There's gonna be a thread on the forums.

49:38.090 --> 49:41.415
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we can put up a calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up.

49:41.475 --> 49:42.776
[SPEAKER_08]: And also let me know what games you want to play.

49:43.437 --> 49:43.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Mass Effect 3.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.160
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try to make this quick.

49:49.801 --> 49:50.501
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun.

49:50.561 --> 49:53.022
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to Golfland, Spike, Tim and I yesterday.

49:53.703 --> 50:06.028
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, not that there was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just jumping into a set of songs.

50:06.368 --> 50:06.708
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

50:07.768 --> 50:14.470
[SPEAKER_06]: But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing DDR every day like I used to then.

50:14.910 --> 50:17.330
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and I don't work out or anything like that.

50:17.430 --> 50:20.771
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little difficult to just get up there and do it.

50:21.271 --> 50:22.772
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was fun.

50:23.672 --> 50:25.172
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot about DDR I really miss.

50:25.432 --> 50:28.833
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to kind of throw that out there for the longtime Bomani fans.

50:29.153 --> 50:30.634
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one thing I forgot to say, by the way.

50:30.875 --> 50:31.035
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

50:31.215 --> 50:34.158
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.

50:34.618 --> 50:35.939
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Doodle Jump arcade game.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they had that at RVGL, too.

50:38.021 --> 50:38.502
[SPEAKER_06]: I was surprised.

50:38.702 --> 50:39.723
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

50:39.943 --> 50:42.305
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.

50:42.626 --> 50:42.946
[SPEAKER_01]: As you were.

50:42.966 --> 50:44.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, yeah.

50:44.367 --> 50:49.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.

50:49.932 --> 50:54.777
[SPEAKER_06]: We were trying to find four-player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect Dark, Doom...

50:55.425 --> 50:57.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Aegis Wing, which somebody commented on Facebook.

50:57.726 --> 50:58.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you playing that?

50:58.626 --> 50:59.646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it's four players.

50:59.986 --> 51:00.346
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

51:01.526 --> 51:04.667
[SPEAKER_06]: And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four-player games.

51:05.407 --> 51:07.988
[SPEAKER_06]: This random-ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.

51:08.128 --> 51:10.048
[SPEAKER_06]: The THQ published one, yeah.

51:10.248 --> 51:10.888
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't bad.

51:11.168 --> 51:12.089
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris Evolution.

51:12.129 --> 51:14.269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's years old, but not bad.

51:15.409 --> 51:18.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played.

51:19.288 --> 51:38.267
[SPEAKER_06]: and I wrote a review of this that you can read at vognetwork.com and the game is Dead Island Riptide and I gave it a D plus on the site I didn't there was a lot about it I didn't really care for but I want to acknowledge that I realize there's a lot of people that already know like Dead Island Riptide I am totally here for this like

51:38.687 --> 51:40.409
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:59.207 --> 52:01.948
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges.

52:02.848 --> 52:07.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for instance, zombies that, you know, I would be facing one direction and I'd suddenly turn.

52:08.089 --> 52:12.690
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly when the zombie's in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up and it would just fall down.

52:12.970 --> 52:13.770
[SPEAKER_06]: And then get back up again.

52:13.850 --> 52:16.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just this weird stuff that would happen.

52:16.370 --> 52:17.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just kidding.

52:17.470 --> 52:21.671
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good.

52:22.131 --> 52:25.132
[SPEAKER_06]: And some other, it's all environmental too, Tim.

52:25.152 --> 52:25.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

52:25.792 --> 52:29.214
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't super impressed.

52:29.854 --> 52:33.816
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.

52:33.956 --> 52:35.536
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it to be a bit repetitive.

52:37.277 --> 52:41.059
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if you like the first game, this is more of the same.

52:41.499 --> 52:45.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.

52:45.201 --> 52:48.022
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.

52:48.442 --> 52:51.884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to tell you, go check it out if you're on the bubble.

52:52.501 --> 52:56.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.

53:15.854 --> 53:17.935
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't stand the demo of that game.

53:17.995 --> 53:18.555
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

53:18.655 --> 53:19.835
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo is awful.

53:20.055 --> 53:25.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what am I missing by not... Well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible demos.

53:26.017 --> 53:27.237
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been a trend recently.

53:27.637 --> 53:30.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.

53:31.959 --> 53:32.259
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

53:32.279 --> 53:33.379
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another one not that long ago.

53:33.399 --> 53:34.179
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really bad too.

53:34.459 --> 53:38.961
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we got this Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter.

53:39.421 --> 53:42.922
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played this demo and I'm like, nope.

53:42.942 --> 53:43.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

53:44.082 --> 53:45.923
[SPEAKER_06]: Delete, but you are really into this.

53:45.943 --> 53:46.583
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I missing?

53:46.863 --> 53:49.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.

53:50.144 --> 54:04.168
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how sort of the enemy behaviors interact with sort of their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack and

54:04.924 --> 54:05.605
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like it.

54:05.645 --> 54:08.129
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game.

54:09.150 --> 54:10.312
[SPEAKER_05]: But the demo is awful.

54:10.352 --> 54:12.354
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.

54:12.415 --> 54:17.462
[SPEAKER_05]: It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters, and just says, oh, hack them until they're dead.

54:18.122 --> 54:21.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.

54:22.988 --> 54:25.249
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.

54:25.289 --> 54:28.151
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put in something like 120 hours already.

54:28.271 --> 54:28.691
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

54:29.531 --> 54:30.272
[SPEAKER_06]: That's commitment.

54:30.512 --> 54:35.534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm the kind of guy who usually picks up games, I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple hours, and never touch it again.

54:36.475 --> 54:37.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is an awful thing.

54:37.895 --> 54:38.916
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's cool.

54:39.036 --> 54:39.996
[SPEAKER_05]: You and me both, buddy.

54:40.317 --> 54:42.438
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.

54:43.258 --> 54:44.859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Gamer ADD.

54:45.379 --> 54:47.880
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.

54:48.020 --> 54:48.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shiny.

54:49.321 --> 54:49.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

54:49.981 --> 54:50.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

54:50.781 --> 54:51.742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit, Steam Stale?

54:52.638 --> 54:53.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Download, download, download, download.

54:54.380 --> 54:54.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

54:55.061 --> 54:55.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

54:55.781 --> 55:00.125
[SPEAKER_05]: But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night.

55:00.646 --> 55:07.012
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.

55:08.493 --> 55:08.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

55:09.454 --> 55:11.016
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?

55:11.216 --> 55:11.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge fan.

55:12.077 --> 55:12.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

55:12.777 --> 55:12.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

55:13.138 --> 55:15.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so which one's your favorite out of all the games?

55:19.354 --> 55:20.615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you an expectant look.

55:20.775 --> 55:21.595
[SPEAKER_05]: The number series.

55:21.876 --> 55:23.297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.

55:23.437 --> 55:24.918
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's one of the two correct answers.

55:24.938 --> 55:25.378
[SPEAKER_01]: I can forgive you.

55:26.259 --> 55:27.240
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love two.

55:27.480 --> 55:37.287
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing this and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash Man's ability.

55:39.129 --> 55:40.770
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about Quick Man's level then?

55:41.371 --> 55:41.851
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

55:42.612 --> 55:43.772
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what's your favorite of the X?

55:44.613 --> 55:45.134
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one.

55:45.994 --> 55:47.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have to think about that.

55:47.255 --> 55:48.116
[SPEAKER_05]: I replay it every year.

55:49.329 --> 55:50.269
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave that to Rob recently.

56:13.004 --> 56:14.286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's definitely a good idea.

56:14.766 --> 56:21.215
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed the tutorials that used to be in-game in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.

56:21.936 --> 56:24.960
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.

56:26.066 --> 56:26.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

56:27.187 --> 56:34.153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was funny last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.

56:34.553 --> 56:36.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.

56:36.375 --> 56:37.335
[SPEAKER_06]: It still has a manual.

56:37.395 --> 56:38.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go find it.

56:40.258 --> 56:42.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.

56:43.340 --> 56:45.322
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, what's a weekend gaming look like for you?

56:45.382 --> 56:46.023
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

56:46.610 --> 56:50.533
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.

56:51.054 --> 56:51.634
[SPEAKER_00]: All casual.

56:52.815 --> 56:53.216
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

56:53.396 --> 57:01.062
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes right before bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.

57:02.403 --> 57:08.388
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring and slow now compared to that.

57:10.090 --> 57:14.093
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World.

57:15.354 --> 57:16.997
[SPEAKER_00]: the inferior game to Super Mario Bros.

57:17.257 --> 57:29.777
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 judging you we played until I died about 15 times in a row to Magic Koopa and quit in a fit of rage so yeah I do that if I get too frustrated with something

57:30.879 --> 57:31.480
[SPEAKER_06]: So does Rob.

57:32.561 --> 57:33.021
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done this.

57:33.121 --> 57:34.222
[SPEAKER_06]: This legitimately happened.

57:34.262 --> 57:39.266
[SPEAKER_06]: We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.

57:39.447 --> 57:43.830
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what?

57:43.870 --> 57:44.231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

57:44.871 --> 57:45.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I got 10 minutes.

57:45.472 --> 57:45.852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show.

57:46.092 --> 57:46.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Out.

57:48.064 --> 57:51.985
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter as well.

57:53.365 --> 57:57.506
[SPEAKER_00]: I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.

57:57.907 --> 57:58.827
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty daunting.

57:59.387 --> 58:02.248
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of plop you in the game.

58:03.428 --> 58:07.009
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying.

58:07.429 --> 58:15.635
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the interface, the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really artificial.

58:16.055 --> 58:21.659
[SPEAKER_00]: But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.

58:21.759 --> 58:26.322
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really did in some ways sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set of armor.

58:26.382 --> 58:28.023
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to kill that next monster.

58:28.603 --> 58:31.145
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did have a lot of fun with it despite the frustrations.

58:32.711 --> 58:38.335
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into it.

58:38.476 --> 58:41.078
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.

58:42.118 --> 58:42.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

58:42.719 --> 58:43.359
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

58:43.379 --> 58:46.402
[SPEAKER_01]: Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.

58:46.482 --> 58:47.122
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.

58:47.483 --> 58:48.584
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a manual probably helped.

58:49.124 --> 58:50.125
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look at the manual.

58:50.705 --> 58:51.746
[SPEAKER_00]: Spike was my manual.

58:52.527 --> 58:56.069
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.

58:56.470 --> 58:58.571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.

59:00.072 --> 59:03.914
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in our chatroom asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?

59:03.994 --> 59:08.156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of Fighters fan?

59:08.456 --> 59:08.817
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

59:09.657 --> 59:11.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.

59:12.018 --> 59:12.959
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's where that came from.

59:13.419 --> 59:13.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

59:13.799 --> 59:15.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

59:15.340 --> 59:18.201
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer?

59:18.982 --> 59:23.944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones I have already.

59:23.964 --> 59:24.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

59:24.269 --> 59:25.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

59:44.624 --> 59:46.866
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't, I mean, yeah, it was basically unfinished.

59:47.467 --> 59:48.888
[SPEAKER_05]: My Shiranui wasn't even in it.

59:48.928 --> 59:49.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you do that?

59:50.049 --> 59:51.030
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awful.

59:51.070 --> 59:57.977
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the one where, was it both Kyo and Iori were powered down?

59:59.338 --> 01:00:00.059
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a good one.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.559
[SPEAKER_06]: All your upvotes, we need them.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.501
[SPEAKER_06]: to make that panel happen.

01:00:29.941 --> 01:00:33.103
[SPEAKER_06]: So please check that out and plan on coming out and saying hi.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:36.526
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:39.749
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.

01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:40.890
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in the gaming world?

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.354
[SPEAKER_08]: So Microsoft's going to finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:48.256
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.211
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rumors!

01:01:04.873 --> 01:01:09.257
[SPEAKER_08]: A source told Polygon some few things.

01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:12.140
[SPEAKER_08]: I love sources.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.301
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a source.

01:01:13.441 --> 01:01:14.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a source.

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:15.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right, right.

01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:16.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:20.488
[SPEAKER_06]: For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit too.

01:01:20.568 --> 01:01:20.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.829
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.

01:01:22.269 --> 01:01:26.110
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.171
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, you know, saying that, yes, system will be always online.

01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:35.572
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's not as bad as it sounds.

01:01:35.752 --> 01:01:44.893
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff.

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:49.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds very similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:02:15.271
[SPEAKER_08]: and you'll be able to share those on the web and then also that it's gonna the online only part of it it is gonna have basically kind of a check for your games but it's gonna they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not oh gee that let yes leave it in the hands of them

01:02:19.504 --> 01:02:29.611
[SPEAKER_08]: That, to me, sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff, so... If live goes down, you can't play that game.

01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:32.974
[SPEAKER_08]: If their server goes down, you can't play that game.

01:02:34.074 --> 01:02:35.836
[SPEAKER_08]: Your internet goes down, you can't play that game.

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:38.598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it sounds lame.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:48.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going... Now it's just this new spin on the same rumor, and it's kind of like... I'm kind of sick about theorizing on this one, because I think...

01:02:49.145 --> 01:03:00.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, with so much fallout from that guy on Twitter and the fact that we thought we were going to hear about this in April and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.

01:03:01.418 --> 01:03:06.223
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.

01:03:06.323 --> 01:03:06.703
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

01:03:06.904 --> 01:03:10.787
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say one of the other things that's going to change is the way achievements are working.

01:03:10.927 --> 01:03:16.373
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying they're going to basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:21.278
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to say make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.

01:03:21.358 --> 01:03:26.182
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, say, they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level or something.

01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:28.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Or download the DLC and get the more achievements.

01:03:28.785 --> 01:03:30.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:38.253
[SPEAKER_08]: and then also they were saying that the friends list size is going to increase.

01:03:38.854 --> 01:03:39.594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, finally!

01:03:39.634 --> 01:03:40.835
[SPEAKER_08]: The cap is going to be removed.

01:03:40.935 --> 01:03:41.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally!

01:03:42.297 --> 01:03:42.917
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time.

01:03:43.698 --> 01:03:46.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2.

01:03:46.841 --> 01:03:47.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I remember that.

01:03:48.962 --> 01:03:51.124
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.188
[SPEAKER_06]: That one I believe.

01:03:55.428 --> 01:03:57.450
[SPEAKER_06]: For what it's worth, I believe that one.

01:03:59.389 --> 01:04:02.693
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems legit, yes.

01:04:06.158 --> 01:04:06.879
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I mean...

01:04:08.922 --> 01:04:12.566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even going to bother debating this stuff to death because we've done it already.

01:04:12.626 --> 01:04:23.235
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're probably going to have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:23.635
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:32.223
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:34.965
[SPEAKER_08]: We got you that news.

01:04:35.085 --> 01:04:36.626
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit, they changed.

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:41.030
[SPEAKER_06]: I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:43.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they know the name?

01:04:43.952 --> 01:04:45.653
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't think they know the name.

01:04:47.394 --> 01:04:48.996
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox something.

01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:52.779
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be an Xbox something.

01:04:53.539 --> 01:04:56.001
[SPEAKER_06]: My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:59.944
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with PlayStation that's another thing.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.345
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going to call it PlayStation 4.

01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:02.146
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a safe bet.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:22.555
[SPEAKER_06]: but in the case of Nintendo they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference and you might remember at E3 that signage none of the signage said Wii U besides that logo at their press conference it always new Nintendo console so this Xbox they may still be I mean hey you gotta have a new name for this console you gotta go out in like two seconds here how about Chuck?

01:05:22.595 --> 01:05:24.656
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what you're gonna do with it?

01:05:26.077 --> 01:05:31.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U I'm just chucking in the trash stop

01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:36.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official word?

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:37.352
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just being a smartass.

01:05:37.412 --> 01:05:37.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:38.413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair enough.

01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:43.818
[SPEAKER_08]: I've put this out there already before.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:50.402
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's got any sort of online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:57.486
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all if I'm not connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console.

01:05:57.726 --> 01:06:02.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm not connected to the internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:05.430
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't benefit me.

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:12.035
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or keep the console I have and have no problems with it.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:12.755
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought of a good name.

01:06:14.016 --> 01:06:14.796
[SPEAKER_01]: The X-Tesseract.

01:06:16.477 --> 01:06:22.021
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing, too, is that, you know, what's the trade-off?

01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know what PlayStation 4 is bringing to the table.

01:06:24.923 --> 01:06:26.244
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it will play used games.

01:06:26.284 --> 01:06:30.987
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it doesn't require the ping and all this stuff and, you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference.

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:37.231
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever's more strict system, what's the benefit?

01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:39.252
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to be the trade-off?

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:46.435
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing, too, is if these are... The only way they could get away with something like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.

01:06:47.356 --> 01:06:52.038
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, oh, I have to buy... I have to.

01:06:52.158 --> 01:06:54.559
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.681
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, then I guess I'll buy a Wii U or something.

01:06:57.901 --> 01:07:00.062
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nintendo's like, ah, yay!

01:07:00.222 --> 01:07:00.502
[SPEAKER_08]: But no.

01:07:00.822 --> 01:07:02.243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, I don't know...

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:05.108
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:07:06.849 --> 01:07:12.911
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only or whatever because they just won't talk about it.

01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:15.311
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to say, hey, there's DRM on this.

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:16.892
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to read between the lines on that.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.773
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends if they take questions from the press or not.

01:07:20.822 --> 01:07:23.484
[SPEAKER_06]: which I kind of think the executives will have to.

01:07:23.744 --> 01:07:24.665
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have to address it.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.847
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll have to talk to investors.

01:07:26.887 --> 01:07:30.470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened on Twitter.

01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:32.532
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow.

01:07:33.192 --> 01:07:35.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.

01:07:36.055 --> 01:07:37.456
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a reality right now.

01:07:37.576 --> 01:07:40.738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the new Pizza Hut app available on the Xbox 360.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?

01:07:45.082 --> 01:07:48.805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:54.170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can actually order pizza online from your 360.

01:07:54.290 --> 01:08:03.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done this yet, but what I love about it is that it's got that same crossbar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has.

01:08:03.658 --> 01:08:05.259
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:08:05.279 --> 01:08:07.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it have Kinect functionality?

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:08.161
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it does.

01:08:08.582 --> 01:08:13.946
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.

01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:16.689
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it had the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.

01:08:16.989 --> 01:08:18.150
[SPEAKER_01]: I want mayonnaise on my pizza.

01:08:18.604 --> 01:08:19.265
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:19.845
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

01:08:20.326 --> 01:08:24.109
[SPEAKER_00]: Same when you remember the old anti-piracy ads from like five or ten years ago.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:27.212
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't download a pizza.

01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:30.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash pizza.

01:08:31.557 --> 01:08:32.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can.

01:08:32.898 --> 01:08:33.739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a reality.

01:08:35.629 --> 01:08:35.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:41.312
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, you can order online through the app.

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:46.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.

01:08:46.315 --> 01:08:47.616
[SPEAKER_06]: I have ordered a pizza online.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.477
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of us have done that.

01:08:49.537 --> 01:08:51.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine it's really not that much different than that.

01:08:52.638 --> 01:08:53.899
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not?

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:58.061
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like this quote from Larry Erb in an interview with Polygon.

01:08:58.561 --> 01:08:59.542
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Major Nelson, of course.

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:03.403
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.

01:09:03.563 --> 01:09:05.684
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at our audience, they love pizza.

01:09:05.904 --> 01:09:07.265
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who doesn't?

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:13.708
[SPEAKER_06]: It has international appeal, and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well with the Xbox brand.

01:09:14.687 --> 01:09:16.368
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:40.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizzahot.com

01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:04.217
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be ways to download your food because they've already got biological printers.

01:10:04.237 --> 01:10:05.758
[SPEAKER_01]: What's to say they're not going to have food printers?

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:09.681
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the... What is it from Star Trek?

01:10:09.701 --> 01:10:10.181
[SPEAKER_01]: The Replicator.

01:10:10.201 --> 01:10:11.122
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have Replicators.

01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:11.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop the world.

01:10:11.823 --> 01:10:12.183
[SPEAKER_01]: This is amazing.

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:13.484
[SPEAKER_01]: You like food.

01:10:16.966 --> 01:10:20.887
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.

01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:21.547
Anyhow.

01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:43.065
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a replicator so I can go tea, Earl Grey, hot.

01:10:43.905 --> 01:10:45.486
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I really hate Earl Grey tea.

01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:46.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Too hot!

01:10:46.846 --> 01:10:51.907
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to tell you, Dungeon Buster, that the Romulan ale that you used to buy at the Star Trek Experience was lame!

01:10:53.888 --> 01:10:54.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get a warp core breach.

01:10:54.968 --> 01:10:55.809
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't feel your feet.

01:10:56.109 --> 01:10:56.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

01:10:56.649 --> 01:10:56.889
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:10:58.029 --> 01:10:58.990
[SPEAKER_06]: More news, DarkSakura.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:00.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.891
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Nintendo is... While you read this, I'm gonna go get tea.

01:11:03.191 --> 01:11:04.831
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob, get me some pizza, too, please.

01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:05.252
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:06.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts...

01:11:07.165 --> 01:11:08.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I look like your bitch?

01:11:09.608 --> 01:11:10.530
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get served.

01:11:12.232 --> 01:11:13.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're about to get served.

01:11:14.015 --> 01:11:15.176
[SPEAKER_06]: You're about to get served.

01:11:16.058 --> 01:11:17.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts, love you, mean it.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.401
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, anyway.

01:11:18.922 --> 01:11:23.909
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.

01:11:24.326 --> 01:11:30.488
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a new presentation style.

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:34.429
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're focusing on the software lineup for the U.S.

01:11:34.509 --> 01:11:42.551
[SPEAKER_01]: market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and another closed hands-on event for the gaming media.

01:11:43.371 --> 01:11:44.732
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're like, E3!

01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:46.202
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:11:48.223 --> 01:12:02.446
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, from the last Nintendo Direct, they were putting out release dates for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario Party and the Legend of Zelda Link to the Past sequel, which I totally want.

01:12:03.866 --> 01:12:11.068
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody can be disappointed in increments.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.383
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... They did this last year with... They had the press conference and then they had three Nintendo Directs.

01:12:17.643 --> 01:12:21.525
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just... Such a waste of time.

01:12:21.785 --> 01:12:24.667
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just so... It wasn't like there was a ton of information.

01:12:24.687 --> 01:12:28.509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just they drug it on for so long.

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:31.291
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about the 3DS.

01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:36.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and this one's about the Wii U. Oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for older kids.

01:12:36.594 --> 01:12:38.655
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one's about our press conference.

01:12:39.095 --> 01:12:39.335
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:48.050
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it says that they're actually trying to be, I guess, a little more direct with how they're giving the information.

01:12:49.389 --> 01:12:59.078
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, it just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3, and especially since Rob said earlier, the feel of E3 has changed.

01:12:59.579 --> 01:13:03.222
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be.

01:13:03.602 --> 01:13:09.408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turned into, look at our ads, look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.

01:13:10.368 --> 01:13:14.012
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.361
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they just don't have anything new to show.

01:13:18.522 --> 01:13:20.783
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:21.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

01:13:21.824 --> 01:13:24.385
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a make or break year for Nintendo.

01:13:24.725 --> 01:13:24.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:13:25.045 --> 01:13:25.866
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as that Wii U is concerned.

01:13:25.886 --> 01:13:29.008
[SPEAKER_08]: And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?

01:13:29.948 --> 01:13:31.829
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fantastic.

01:13:31.869 --> 01:13:34.610
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.

01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:41.214
[SPEAKER_06]: We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it would be the same conversation.

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:48.362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it took them a year to pull it around, and a price drop almost immediately.

01:13:48.443 --> 01:13:50.043
[SPEAKER_08]: And who's to say that's not going to happen again?

01:13:51.144 --> 01:13:52.104
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to happen again.

01:13:53.645 --> 01:13:55.045
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.

01:13:55.085 --> 01:13:59.187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because their 3DS is doing well, and they're making plenty of profit from that.

01:13:59.327 --> 01:14:02.288
[SPEAKER_08]: So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.

01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:29.457
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like this was one of those articles I read it it was all over Twitter and I was like wow that's really weird and then I go well you know that makes a lot of sense like people really just you know they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences and I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed they don't have a new console to show they only want to show games and you you said it yourself a minute ago people don't want to sit through all this other crap that they don't care about and

01:14:29.677 --> 01:14:31.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me the information targeted at me.

01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:32.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:33.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

01:14:45.544 --> 01:15:02.275
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the 25 year anniversary of Luigi no one gives a shit, especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh by the way, we don't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS but we have DLC for a Mario game!

01:15:03.275 --> 01:15:04.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

01:15:04.155 --> 01:15:05.056
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of Luigi.

01:15:05.076 --> 01:15:08.037
[SPEAKER_08]: That's almost like a new game, but not.

01:15:08.457 --> 01:15:11.718
[SPEAKER_08]: See, we understand online because we put out DLC.

01:15:12.178 --> 01:15:13.098
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hip, we're cool.

01:15:13.398 --> 01:15:14.839
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just like those other consoles.

01:15:15.199 --> 01:15:15.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Love us.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.261
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think they have anything new to show.

01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:26.323
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff they were talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out yet.

01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:29.644
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking third quarter when that stuff is finally hitting the market.

01:15:30.624 --> 01:15:36.536
[SPEAKER_08]: So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Wind Waker.

01:15:37.238 --> 01:15:39.242
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe one more game, but...

01:15:40.307 --> 01:16:03.856
[SPEAKER_08]: that's it they don't really have much to announce are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or you know they have 3DS games which if you know they have a ton of 3DS games coming out so no worries there but as far as the Wii U goes they don't really have anything to show Spike I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show what do you think of Loki's on the right track

01:16:05.236 --> 01:16:12.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you know, we know that they have a Mario Universe, as we're all expecting it to be called.

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:17.310
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the floor at E3.

01:16:18.351 --> 01:16:19.753
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they said they're going to show...

01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:24.536
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Smash Brothers game in video and picture form.

01:16:25.357 --> 01:16:29.079
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.943
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.

01:16:33.963 --> 01:16:39.046
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of have to agree after the floptasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.

01:16:40.509 --> 01:16:49.953
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo Land, of all things.

01:16:50.033 --> 01:16:53.935
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions, I guess.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.517
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did talk about boosts and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.

01:17:01.538 --> 01:17:03.018
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad commentary on games.

01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:03.979
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like my house.

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.340
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:07.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:08.981
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:10.761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo.

01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:14.282
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk a big game like how we're going to target the core audience.

01:17:14.623 --> 01:17:20.325
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to target those older people that want to play games on the Wii U and stuff.

01:17:20.465 --> 01:17:23.326
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game.

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:23.866
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario.

01:17:24.346 --> 01:17:25.427
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Mario sells.

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:28.149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, for everybody, I guess.

01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:31.352
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are no real... I don't think they take it seriously.

01:17:31.432 --> 01:17:39.838
[SPEAKER_08]: They just kind of... You know, this time around, they said, okay, listen, we're not going to put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind of shine, I guess.

01:17:39.938 --> 01:17:40.439
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, pfft.

01:17:41.159 --> 01:17:46.904
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that amazing Spider-Man game from last year really shone on your console.

01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:50.066
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.

01:17:50.486 --> 01:17:50.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:52.988
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome now, coming out in March.

01:17:53.129 --> 01:17:53.389
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

01:17:53.889 --> 01:18:00.535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the definitive version now because it's... Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:05.620
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.

01:18:06.601 --> 01:18:07.081
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega is.

01:18:08.823 --> 01:18:09.724
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to lose on it.

01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:13.212
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.

01:18:13.352 --> 01:18:15.135
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.

01:18:15.155 --> 01:18:17.798
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, Sega has taken a lot of risks on the Wii.

01:18:17.838 --> 01:18:23.266
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look, they put out Mad World and stuff, and Mad World's a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game that didn't sell very well.

01:18:23.686 --> 01:18:27.191
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, The Conduit was another Sega game that they put out.

01:18:27.231 --> 01:18:27.832
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was Sega.

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:30.053
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was Sega.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:31.113
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know.

01:18:31.733 --> 01:18:34.674
[SPEAKER_08]: But once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.

01:18:35.414 --> 01:18:39.755
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?

01:18:39.775 --> 01:18:40.536
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not publishing it.

01:18:40.676 --> 01:18:41.636
[SPEAKER_05]: But they own the IP.

01:18:41.696 --> 01:18:44.537
[SPEAKER_05]: They are part of the licensing for the game to exist.

01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:46.197
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nintendo's bankrolling it.

01:18:46.277 --> 01:18:52.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Platinum's been very open about the fact that without Nintendo's involvement, this game just wouldn't exist.

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.001
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.

01:18:58.402 --> 01:18:59.222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's enough for me.

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:02.584
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

01:19:02.644 --> 01:19:09.227
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a Wii U because honestly, the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table.

01:19:09.347 --> 01:19:11.208
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we have a tablet, yay.

01:19:11.888 --> 01:19:18.031
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.

01:19:18.992 --> 01:19:21.993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, there's a lot of people who would have been into it.

01:19:23.979 --> 01:19:25.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.541
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be fine come holidays.

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:31.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.

01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:35.525
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

01:19:35.845 --> 01:19:42.149
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that there's no reason for me to buy that system.

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:43.830
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing that really wowed me about it.

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.671
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3DS is like, oh, hey, 3D games without glasses.

01:19:46.691 --> 01:19:47.432
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

01:19:48.052 --> 01:19:51.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.215
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that big a deal.

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:59.663
[SPEAKER_01]: The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.

01:20:00.063 --> 01:20:05.190
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really a new thing.

01:20:05.555 --> 01:20:16.620
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.601
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's the PSP, but that's it.

01:20:18.741 --> 01:20:21.182
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the PSP and the Vita.

01:20:21.362 --> 01:20:22.603
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the Vita.

01:20:23.684 --> 01:20:24.324
[SPEAKER_00]: But who owns a Vita?

01:20:25.225 --> 01:20:42.746
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 3DS but the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching a brand new generation of consoles and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware wise as the others which is going to make multi-platform development difficult but neither was the Wii

01:20:43.146 --> 01:20:51.190
[SPEAKER_08]: And also when you consider though that they're saying that now a lot of that's, you know, the market's kind of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:55.993
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well?

01:20:56.033 --> 01:20:59.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine.

01:21:00.075 --> 01:21:02.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, they can buy a 3DS.

01:21:03.437 --> 01:21:06.919
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before, let's move on with the stories.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.301
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so let's see.

01:21:10.421 --> 01:21:18.064
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit about where we used to... As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:29.008
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about 3.5 million units, and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:43.264
[SPEAKER_08]: um they are targeting though for the next fiscal year nine million units so they're really gonna have to pick up the pace if that's gonna happen um i want to say that they've only sold um

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.141
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last few months.

01:21:50.202 --> 01:21:54.244
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.746
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, 3DS is rocking.

01:21:58.907 --> 01:22:02.068
[SPEAKER_08]: They're up to 31.09 million units.

01:22:03.949 --> 01:22:08.431
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.

01:22:08.451 --> 01:22:09.271
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of systems.

01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:41.199
[SPEAKER_08]: that's gotta disappoint them that they've only been able to sell 3. almost 3.5 million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there that's no penetration and on top of that Satoru Iwata he is now the CEO the Nintendo of America CEO and just to be clear Reggie Fils-AimÃ© was not overthrown or anything like that he's still there yeah yeah

01:22:43.047 --> 01:22:47.990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together so that the two don't operate in different silos.

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:50.571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my thought as a corporate move like this.

01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:53.652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Wanda's been definitely more up front.

01:22:54.033 --> 01:22:58.175
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been kind of the figure in all those Nintendo Directs and stuff.

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:00.583
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:58.031
[SPEAKER_06]: so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U these are not titles to be shown for 2014 these are titles to be shown for the holiday release running down the list real quick just so we're clear these are games that Nintendo says in the next few months Mario Kart for Wii U Super Mario Brothers for Wii U Wii Fit for Wii U which has kind of fallen off the radar but that's kind of one of those games they were pitching that in the beginning and it disappeared so it's kind of another one of those games that you know oh now you see it now you don't but Wii Fit could be interesting depending on what they do with it

01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.932
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be an interesting game changer.

01:24:00.753 --> 01:24:01.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Pikmin.

01:24:01.513 --> 01:24:02.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is August.

01:24:02.353 --> 01:24:03.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we knew that's happening.

01:24:04.014 --> 01:24:06.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.

01:24:07.016 --> 01:24:08.137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm assuming that's Wind Waker.

01:24:08.157 --> 01:24:10.998
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Wind Waker and the new... Link to the Past.

01:24:11.018 --> 01:24:11.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Link to the Past.

01:24:12.059 --> 01:24:15.621
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mario and Luigi on the 3DS and Pokemon X and Y, obviously.

01:24:15.741 --> 01:24:15.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:24:16.341 --> 01:24:20.424
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's... You're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday lineup right there.

01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:25.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's, you know... That's in a nutshell.

01:24:25.587 --> 01:24:27.388
[SPEAKER_08]: That better not be another new Super Mario Bros.

01:24:27.408 --> 01:24:27.588
[SPEAKER_08]: game.

01:24:29.179 --> 01:24:33.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I think it's going to be like you were saying a minute ago, kind of like a Galaxy type thing.

01:24:34.165 --> 01:24:44.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick to doing the sort of one new title per generation and just expanding those with DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC.

01:24:46.239 --> 01:24:48.122
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope it's not another new Super Mario Bros.

01:24:48.162 --> 01:24:48.342
[SPEAKER_08]: game.

01:24:50.126 --> 01:24:52.328
[SPEAKER_08]: or anything that resembles that.

01:24:52.548 --> 01:25:03.635
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Luigi DLC should tell you it's not another Super Mario X game because why would they waste all the effort to do that to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a new game.

01:25:03.735 --> 01:25:06.937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that happening.

01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:14.002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a 3D Mario, whether it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque or Sunshine for fuck's sake.

01:25:14.863 --> 01:25:15.844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be something of that vein.

01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:17.965
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunshine Lowell.

01:25:20.026 --> 01:25:21.047
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see them doing it, though.

01:25:21.307 --> 01:25:24.709
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just... Why not a new Luigi game, then?

01:25:24.929 --> 01:25:30.533
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can do DLC and just easily shoehorn it into the... Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi.

01:25:30.573 --> 01:25:33.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy or something.

01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:33.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's the twist.

01:25:34.035 --> 01:25:35.176
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one will buy it.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:36.316
[SPEAKER_06]: No one will buy it.

01:25:36.497 --> 01:25:39.799
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole thing has let... What do you mean no one will buy Super Luigi Galaxy?

01:25:39.819 --> 01:25:40.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:25:40.539 --> 01:25:42.220
[SPEAKER_06]: One person will buy it, but no one else will buy it.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you smoking crank?

01:25:43.962 --> 01:25:48.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period.

01:25:48.885 --> 01:25:52.788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about just reskin with Luigi.

01:25:52.848 --> 01:26:00.413
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about a new game in that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi.

01:26:00.713 --> 01:26:01.434
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the joke.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:06.076
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you haven't seen anything else because the bombshell is going to get dropped at E3.

01:26:06.216 --> 01:26:08.357
[SPEAKER_08]: No one should make jokes when your system is suffering like that.

01:26:09.238 --> 01:26:10.318
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not time for joking.

01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:15.321
[SPEAKER_08]: This is time for kicking ass.

01:26:15.562 --> 01:26:16.002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

01:26:16.202 --> 01:26:16.922
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, save me.

01:26:17.303 --> 01:26:18.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you spent, Rob?

01:26:18.323 --> 01:26:18.883
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm spent.

01:26:19.224 --> 01:26:21.045
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a contest that I'm going to be in now.

01:26:22.305 --> 01:26:22.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh?

01:26:22.686 --> 01:26:24.267
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you found it for me, but I'm going to do it.

01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:27.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Rob does all my hard work for me.

01:26:28.009 --> 01:26:29.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.

01:26:31.298 --> 01:26:33.880
[SPEAKER_01]: As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:34.520
[SPEAKER_06]: That works.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:43.966
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new character to be the face of the company.

01:26:44.926 --> 01:26:46.407
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not Sonic, just...

01:26:46.927 --> 01:27:06.834
[SPEAKER_01]: A new mascot And the contest is open through June 9th this year And it has to be an original character And there's a link on I can get the link later But it's also not just limited to the Japanese audience It's worldwide

01:27:07.546 --> 01:27:18.912
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm gonna get the hell out of this so basically they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on Nico Nico

01:27:19.614 --> 01:27:21.275
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what the mascot's for.

01:27:21.335 --> 01:27:22.195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the show.

01:27:22.855 --> 01:27:25.577
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not giving you guys my ideas.

01:27:26.737 --> 01:27:27.677
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:27:28.378 --> 01:27:37.461
[SPEAKER_01]: But they want something unique, something fun, something that's going to basically fit what they're trying to do.

01:27:37.501 --> 01:27:38.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the show...

01:27:39.643 --> 01:27:59.416
[SPEAKER_01]: is uh i'm trying to find something and basically it's yeah just going to be um more of a fan show and there's translations for the rules up so uh you just need a Nico Nico account and there is an english version um on the website to sign up for that and so i will uh let me get the url if you go to uh

01:28:00.973 --> 01:28:08.477
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually seiga.nicovideo.jp There should be a link from there.

01:28:08.577 --> 01:28:10.739
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will post the link in the chat room for people here.

01:28:11.499 --> 01:28:13.801
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe Sega will hire me.

01:28:14.821 --> 01:28:16.422
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a great idea for a Sega character.

01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:19.724
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black and he's got guns.

01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:21.125
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up.

01:28:21.721 --> 01:28:31.533
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas because coming up in part B of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, we are going to do a list list.

01:28:32.134 --> 01:28:33.816
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't participate, Rob.

01:28:33.936 --> 01:28:34.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

01:28:34.336 --> 01:28:35.999
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.

01:28:36.179 --> 01:28:36.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Tough shit.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and he's going to be named Shadow.

01:28:39.642 --> 01:28:40.483
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadow of the Hedgehog.

01:28:40.563 --> 01:28:41.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the deal.

01:28:41.423 --> 01:28:49.248
[SPEAKER_06]: The topic for tonight's list is mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.

01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:52.170
[SPEAKER_06]: So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.

01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:53.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't send your answers yet.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:53.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think about it.

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:56.452
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll come back to this in part B. By the way, a little bit more to this.

01:28:57.393 --> 01:29:01.555
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find those translated rules, look for Yakuza fan at NeoGAF.

01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:07.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:29:07.763 --> 01:29:08.403
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we gotta?

01:29:09.564 --> 01:29:09.944
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta.

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:17.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this week, there's Deadly Permission, The Director's Cut on PlayStation 3, and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita.

01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:26.856
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

01:29:27.416 --> 01:29:28.697
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really the only game you need to buy.

01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:33.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Game ga arimasen

01:30:02.555 --> 01:30:05.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds?

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just a dry spell this week?

01:30:07.784 --> 01:30:08.365
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U?

01:30:09.126 --> 01:30:09.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:14.527
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week.

01:30:14.928 --> 01:30:15.448
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:15.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

01:30:16.449 --> 01:30:17.250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they're afraid.

01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:18.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Know what they're afraid of?

01:30:18.911 --> 01:30:22.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto V on the 30th.

01:30:23.115 --> 01:30:23.556
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

01:30:23.816 --> 01:30:25.197
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you need to do that day.

01:30:25.457 --> 01:30:32.644
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my wedding anniversary and I'm going out and eating lunch, but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.

01:30:32.987 --> 01:30:35.128
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get you a shirt that said game over?

01:30:35.308 --> 01:30:37.129
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to make Nellie watch them with you?

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:38.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I?

01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.851
[SPEAKER_08]: Does she get into it?

01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:40.291
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:30:40.571 --> 01:30:40.751
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

01:30:41.112 --> 01:30:42.112
[SPEAKER_08]: She could care less.

01:30:42.152 --> 01:30:43.613
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think she'd think it's hilarious.

01:30:43.633 --> 01:30:49.316
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pick the most violent, bloody, gory game ever and have Nellie and your mom review it.

01:30:50.777 --> 01:30:53.719
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.

01:30:54.673 --> 01:30:55.894
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the best review ever.

01:31:18.877 --> 01:31:21.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a game coming out on May 9th.

01:31:21.578 --> 01:31:22.719
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the closest game release.

01:31:22.799 --> 01:31:23.579
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like two weeks.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the PSP.

01:31:26.321 --> 01:31:30.483
[SPEAKER_06]: Cud Wafter Converted Edition comes out on the PSP.

01:31:31.143 --> 01:31:35.166
[SPEAKER_06]: And the box art is just a girl and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.

01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:36.206
[SPEAKER_06]: She's just waiting.

01:31:36.886 --> 01:31:38.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.

01:31:38.988 --> 01:31:43.350
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.

01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:45.251
[SPEAKER_06]: A chick with her arms folded waiting.

01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:45.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:31:46.369 --> 01:31:47.489
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say the name of that again?

01:31:48.650 --> 01:31:54.411
[SPEAKER_06]: K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R To me it's Kudwafter, but it's probably Kud... Wafter.

01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:55.292
[SPEAKER_01]: It's German.

01:31:56.152 --> 01:31:57.912
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that almost sounded dirty.

01:31:58.953 --> 01:32:00.413
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in German sounds dirty.

01:32:00.713 --> 01:32:02.534
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.

01:32:03.014 --> 01:32:03.794
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudwafer.

01:32:03.874 --> 01:32:07.555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about, you know, crackers that cows chew on.

01:32:07.835 --> 01:32:11.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.322
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:17.084
[SPEAKER_01]: So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob.

01:32:17.244 --> 01:32:17.824
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with me?

01:32:19.145 --> 01:32:20.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.

01:32:20.686 --> 01:32:21.027
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl!

01:32:22.568 --> 01:32:22.888
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

01:32:22.988 --> 01:32:24.629
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.

01:32:26.531 --> 01:32:27.311
[SPEAKER_06]: They're your links!

01:32:27.852 --> 01:32:28.532
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame you!

01:32:28.712 --> 01:32:29.473
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame you for everything.

01:32:32.461 --> 01:32:34.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Slagkick looked up what this is.

01:32:36.105 --> 01:32:37.367
[SPEAKER_06]: Kudwafter or whatever.

01:32:37.467 --> 01:32:43.734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key, released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.

01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:45.115
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's the PSP version.

01:32:45.195 --> 01:32:47.378
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cover sounded like one.

01:32:48.059 --> 01:32:48.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:51.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when I first looked at that, I was like, oh, she gonna get naked.

01:32:53.392 --> 01:32:54.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's a moe game.

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:56.155
[SPEAKER_08]: She looks too young.

01:32:56.175 --> 01:32:59.398
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that button on her head is, like, huge.

01:32:59.638 --> 01:33:02.200
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking, does she smell like Kudzu?

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:02.581
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:33:03.341 --> 01:33:09.507
[SPEAKER_06]: And FifthDream in our chatroom says, cunt waiter, I've had a few of those.

01:33:13.002 --> 01:33:16.166
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for one of the... I'm just gonna... You win.

01:33:16.527 --> 01:33:17.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

01:33:17.768 --> 01:33:21.032
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

01:33:21.733 --> 01:33:22.895
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still thinking about getting it.

01:33:22.975 --> 01:33:24.256
[SPEAKER_01]: Injustice Gods Among Us.

01:33:24.437 --> 01:33:25.278
[SPEAKER_01]: Game is fucking weird.

01:33:25.878 --> 01:33:29.002
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.

01:33:29.803 --> 01:33:30.945
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm thinking of the Doctor.

01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:32.962
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:51.058
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?

01:33:51.078 --> 01:33:51.438
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

01:33:51.638 --> 01:33:52.438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's DC.

01:33:52.518 --> 01:33:53.458
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate everything.

01:33:53.858 --> 01:33:58.579
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Jamie, there is DLC that could probably fix that.

01:33:58.639 --> 01:34:00.380
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:02.680
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey?

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:02.740
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:34:04.281 --> 01:34:05.281
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she would be awesome?

01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:08.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will stop and say this.

01:34:08.682 --> 01:34:14.123
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman, although I cannot read anything Batman-related that Gail Simone doesn't write.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:16.111
[SPEAKER_01]: She is my hero.

01:34:16.471 --> 01:34:20.315
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.

01:34:21.557 --> 01:34:21.777
[SPEAKER_01]: There.

01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:23.539
[SPEAKER_01]: My one nod to DC.

01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:28.905
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

01:34:29.955 --> 01:34:33.317
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so, movies.

01:34:33.897 --> 01:34:35.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony likes movies, right?

01:34:35.478 --> 01:34:40.541
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sony said, hey, why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?

01:34:40.821 --> 01:34:42.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Sound like a fantastic idea?

01:34:42.682 --> 01:34:43.583
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is.

01:34:44.503 --> 01:34:44.984
[SPEAKER_08]: According to them.

01:34:45.924 --> 01:35:10.027
[SPEAKER_08]: Ratchet and Clank coming to theaters in 2015 and it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment and I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment and I guess they produced CG was a flick Escape from Planet Earth I have no idea what the fuck that is but they made that movie so they've made a movie before

01:35:11.903 --> 01:35:35.822
[SPEAKER_08]: uh and then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to becoming a movie as well except it's direct-to-video because you know obviously a game this important that never had a sequel cannot be going in the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is and so direct-to-video it goes also being done by Blockade Entertainment what are you laughing at over there?

01:35:35.842 --> 01:35:36.683
[SPEAKER_01]: stop it

01:35:40.063 --> 01:35:41.963
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.

01:35:43.924 --> 01:35:45.784
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's word is Kudwafter.

01:35:49.745 --> 01:35:50.305
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

01:35:50.325 --> 01:35:51.265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:35:51.305 --> 01:35:52.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Heavenly Sword?

01:35:52.786 --> 01:35:59.087
[SPEAKER_08]: It just... I guess because God of War would have been too good?

01:35:59.107 --> 01:36:01.168
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know why.

01:36:01.828 --> 01:36:05.048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword, though.

01:36:05.068 --> 01:36:07.769
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that, you know...

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:10.438
[SPEAKER_08]: Uwe Boll would do.

01:36:10.818 --> 01:36:14.100
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because... He says, I don't know if he's made any movies lately.

01:36:17.242 --> 01:36:19.623
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.

01:36:20.323 --> 01:36:22.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's laughing all the way to the bank.

01:36:22.565 --> 01:36:24.766
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's banked a lot of money.

01:36:26.967 --> 01:36:28.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Ratchet and Clank sounds like it could be cute, though.

01:36:28.848 --> 01:36:30.349
[SPEAKER_06]: That, I think, could work.

01:36:30.389 --> 01:36:31.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime is the way to go, yeah.

01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:35.132
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, after all, Angry Birds are getting a movie.

01:36:35.272 --> 01:36:35.432
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.929
[SPEAKER_08]: How?

01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.572
[SPEAKER_08]: They have cartoons.

01:36:39.932 --> 01:36:43.037
[SPEAKER_01]: They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.

01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:45.921
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'll do well in the Middle East.

01:36:47.803 --> 01:36:49.024
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done, bye

01:37:12.944 --> 01:37:31.723
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing, under their new system, you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed Which, you know, it does make sense though, because legitimately they're looking through all the footage And they're watching it, and that takes hours at a time That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra Review mine first, and eat my barbecue sauce

01:37:31.943 --> 01:37:33.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

01:37:33.926 --> 01:37:38.532
[SPEAKER_06]: $25 for one submission, $60 for three submissions, $75 for five submissions.

01:37:38.873 --> 01:37:42.378
[SPEAKER_06]: But I believe based on the length, that might count as more than one submission.

01:37:42.618 --> 01:37:43.940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

01:37:44.701 --> 01:37:46.223
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you say over there?

01:37:46.804 --> 01:37:47.565
[SPEAKER_01]: That bears repeating.

01:37:48.305 --> 01:37:49.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.

01:37:50.107 --> 01:37:51.128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

01:37:51.288 --> 01:37:51.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:58.474
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, each video can only do one game, although you can do more than one score in the video.

01:37:58.494 --> 01:37:59.515
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes no sense to me.

01:37:59.815 --> 01:38:01.656
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it was two different settings, maybe.

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:05.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why would you show one score and then a better score?

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:06.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do the one score.

01:38:07.701 --> 01:38:08.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

01:38:09.403 --> 01:38:09.863
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

01:38:11.024 --> 01:38:11.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Twin Galaxies.

01:38:11.865 --> 01:38:13.766
[SPEAKER_06]: You can submit your score for $25.

01:38:16.028 --> 01:38:16.388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:38:16.689 --> 01:38:24.274
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership that it's not quite as respectable anymore.

01:38:27.636 --> 01:38:28.837
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens with any company.

01:38:28.857 --> 01:38:33.661
[SPEAKER_08]: And also apparently, I don't know if their database crashed or something, but they lost some of the scores.

01:38:34.281 --> 01:38:37.443
[SPEAKER_06]: It did, but I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.

01:38:38.384 --> 01:38:42.367
[SPEAKER_06]: They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.

01:38:43.988 --> 01:38:45.349
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess they got some of it back.

01:38:50.616 --> 01:39:10.396
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm glad that still exists because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there and they're still playing them people are still breaking Donkey Kong score records so I'm glad something like this exists alright well speaking of classic games every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week

01:39:12.714 --> 01:39:25.717
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part of the show where DarkSakura is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours and then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.

01:39:26.438 --> 01:39:27.938
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?

01:39:29.538 --> 01:39:31.199
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no, I can't even do it, Rob.

01:39:31.259 --> 01:39:33.660
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it because you have to start the music.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:34.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.200
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the music for the classic game of the week.

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.081
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.

01:39:44.184 --> 01:39:45.986
[SPEAKER_06]: How has this never been the classic game of the week?

01:39:46.026 --> 01:39:46.927
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no fucking clue.

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:48.028
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a joke forever on OLR.

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:48.508
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this song.

01:39:48.568 --> 01:39:49.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no fucking clue.

01:39:49.269 --> 01:39:52.372
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was gonna put in Ridge Racer, and I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?

01:39:52.392 --> 01:39:54.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I done... Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.

01:39:54.474 --> 01:40:00.180
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan has been playing the shit out of Daytona, so I hear do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do in my nightmares.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you mean you hear this?

01:40:05.205 --> 01:40:05.545
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

01:40:05.645 --> 01:40:08.167
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a napkin and I can make it into at least 11.

01:40:09.048 --> 01:40:16.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song because that would be the most hilarious thing ever.

01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:23.479
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live and he just looks like he is having the time of his life.

01:40:23.979 --> 01:40:27.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's better than chocolate and...

01:40:29.508 --> 01:40:30.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting Laid, I guess.

01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:32.671
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was pretty funny.

01:40:32.931 --> 01:40:34.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.

01:40:34.492 --> 01:40:38.575
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.

01:40:38.635 --> 01:40:39.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me play a little bit of that.

01:40:39.596 --> 01:40:43.879
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.

01:40:47.422 --> 01:40:47.962
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.

01:40:48.563 --> 01:40:51.405
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.

01:40:51.665 --> 01:40:53.026
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because it's a bad game.

01:40:53.066 --> 01:40:56.349
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was a bad game, it would not be on my classic game of the week list.

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:58.230
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for an Amco arcade.

01:40:59.111 --> 01:41:04.076
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.

01:41:04.716 --> 01:41:09.981
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Pac-Man hat, I had a Polar camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.

01:41:10.742 --> 01:41:14.365
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like 10 Tekken 3 shirts, like the arcade only ones.

01:41:14.865 --> 01:41:18.609
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.

01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:21.371
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would always be in loud attract mode.

01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:23.972
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was an awful one.

01:41:45.549 --> 01:41:48.373
[SPEAKER_01]: The voice acting was hideous.

01:41:48.754 --> 01:41:49.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

01:41:49.795 --> 01:41:51.838
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, back to the game.

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.260
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a racing game.

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.604
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.

01:41:57.867 --> 01:42:00.248
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, AM2 gave us freaking Burning Rangers.

01:42:00.888 --> 01:42:02.269
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, same guy singing by the way.

01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:08.851
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.

01:42:09.571 --> 01:42:13.192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.

01:42:14.013 --> 01:42:17.174
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board.

01:42:17.634 --> 01:42:19.475
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is easily emulated now.

01:42:20.515 --> 01:42:25.436
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.

01:42:25.916 --> 01:42:33.138
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped so it gave it more of a realistic feel.

01:42:33.579 --> 01:42:37.400
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it had serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.260
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, there's a mountain.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.181
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.

01:42:40.961 --> 01:42:41.241
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

01:42:42.082 --> 01:42:52.526
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did re-release the game as... Oh, one thing I actually have to say, it's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.

01:42:52.987 --> 01:42:57.429
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty crazy, given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.

01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:03.473
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.

01:43:04.033 --> 01:43:05.855
[SPEAKER_01]: They took out the vocals.

01:43:06.675 --> 01:43:10.878
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has some sort of generic singing over it, like it was some background vocal.

01:43:11.358 --> 01:43:14.401
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main lyric part of it, it's like you're playing karaoke mode.

01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:15.942
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just not the same.

01:43:16.602 --> 01:43:26.029
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are in a stock car called the Hornet, and you have to race three tracks, either automatic or manual.

01:43:26.129 --> 01:43:27.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose your transmission.

01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:32.952
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.

01:43:32.972 --> 01:43:35.032
[SPEAKER_01]: You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.

01:43:35.052 --> 01:43:39.694
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.

01:43:40.014 --> 01:43:48.257
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were deluxe cabins because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.

01:43:48.857 --> 01:43:51.498
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when I was still living in Alabama and my mom lived in Phoenix.

01:43:52.118 --> 01:43:57.681
[SPEAKER_01]: We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas and they had the full multi-car setup.

01:43:57.801 --> 01:43:59.461
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh.

01:43:59.842 --> 01:44:01.642
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.

01:44:02.543 --> 01:44:07.485
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was completely in heaven and I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.

01:44:08.305 --> 01:44:11.406
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.

01:44:12.067 --> 01:44:12.547
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um...

01:44:14.289 --> 01:44:16.310
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it then, hated it when I worked at an arcade.

01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.391
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was really awesome.

01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:32.694
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually came out before there was the Daytona USA Museum, but it had all that attached to it.

01:44:34.115 --> 01:44:38.256
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was that it came out as Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:51.732
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p, and like I said, it lost the vocal charts because of the licensing.

01:44:52.112 --> 01:44:56.434
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturn in 1995, and Twindos in 1996.

01:44:59.615 --> 01:45:07.301
[SPEAKER_01]: It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second, and clipped pretty nasty.

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:09.683
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not the best version.

01:45:11.184 --> 01:45:16.828
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it handled well, and they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with the 32X.

01:45:16.949 --> 01:45:19.390
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we got space here, you're right.

01:45:20.371 --> 01:45:34.933
[SPEAKER_01]: so there were 8 tracks including the original 3 from the arcade and 2 additional tracks from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition and then there were final 3 and that was for the Dreamcast version which the Dreamcast version was pretty good

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:40.373
[SPEAKER_01]: They completely redid all of the graphics.

01:45:40.453 --> 01:45:42.175
[SPEAKER_01]: The pop-up was removed.

01:45:42.515 --> 01:45:45.058
[SPEAKER_01]: The cars had transparent glass, higher poly.

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:50.263
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.

01:45:50.283 --> 01:45:51.645
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:54.466
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you can't have it all, huh?

01:45:54.506 --> 01:46:00.650
[SPEAKER_01]: They did an arcade faithful port for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:01.531 --> 01:46:06.474
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has widescreen, high def, 8 player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.

01:46:08.075 --> 01:46:09.936
[SPEAKER_01]: More content with different challenges.

01:46:09.976 --> 01:46:17.701
[SPEAKER_01]: Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode singing Roaring Start.

01:46:18.481 --> 01:46:19.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he's awesome.

01:46:20.117 --> 01:46:21.417
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my husband's a big dork.

01:46:21.437 --> 01:46:22.458
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, you're awesome.

01:46:22.818 --> 01:46:23.658
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's not even listening.

01:46:23.698 --> 01:46:24.738
[SPEAKER_01]: He's watching Chair of Swords.

01:46:25.819 --> 01:46:27.799
[SPEAKER_01]: With the German chocolate cake and Mystique.

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:32.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so... Yeah.

01:46:32.861 --> 01:46:33.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:46:33.961 --> 01:46:35.382
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do-do-do-do-do-do you.

01:46:39.363 --> 01:46:41.664
[SPEAKER_06]: And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.

01:46:41.744 --> 01:46:43.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do-do-do-do-do-do you.

01:46:46.423 --> 01:46:47.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anyway.

01:46:49.284 --> 01:46:52.466
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you had, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.

01:46:52.506 --> 01:47:02.251
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the red or blue and yellow and the black version, depending on what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.

01:47:05.826 --> 01:47:31.470
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically, like I was saying, now the singer and this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2 doing the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well and it was Takenobu Mitsuyoshi who was doing the singing and the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode

01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:38.577
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game because I want to fry Sky High.

01:47:40.951 --> 01:48:01.937
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the arcade version also used a Yamaha sound chip that completely just redid, made the music sound really good, really professional, but they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the music was actually synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.

01:48:02.077 --> 01:48:05.378
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's Daytona USA.

01:48:05.818 --> 01:48:07.258
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not doing it again.

01:48:08.238 --> 01:48:08.738
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.

01:48:09.019 --> 01:48:09.319
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

01:48:09.559 --> 01:48:09.719
Oh...

01:48:12.992 --> 01:48:16.794
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighter's Mega Mix.

01:48:17.094 --> 01:48:17.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:48:18.675 --> 01:48:21.917
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.

01:48:22.697 --> 01:48:23.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Good pick.

01:48:23.898 --> 01:48:24.879
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time, honestly.

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:27.060
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:28.361
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Mario Bros.

01:48:28.581 --> 01:48:28.361
3.

01:48:29.241 --> 01:48:31.002
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she did it a long time ago.

01:48:31.703 --> 01:48:32.203
[SPEAKER_01]: And World.

01:48:32.823 --> 01:48:35.705
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.

01:48:35.765 --> 01:48:36.245
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on 502?

01:48:36.585 --> 01:48:38.847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, 200-something, I think.

01:48:38.887 --> 01:48:39.587
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.

01:48:39.927 --> 01:48:40.988
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had several segments.

01:48:41.069 --> 01:48:41.989
[SPEAKER_06]: It's changed a few times.

01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:43.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week started around 200 something.

01:48:43.551 --> 01:48:48.136
[SPEAKER_01]: But we stopped doing Website of the Week when I did one site twice.

01:48:48.456 --> 01:48:48.697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:48:48.937 --> 01:48:49.898
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I couldn't really think of any.

01:48:49.918 --> 01:48:50.559
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the site?

01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:53.562
[SPEAKER_06]: You did one Classic Game twice, and that didn't stop you.

01:48:53.982 --> 01:48:54.543
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do?

01:48:54.763 --> 01:48:56.025
[SPEAKER_06]: You did Final Fantasy VI twice.

01:48:56.085 --> 01:48:59.268
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if you're going to do any game twice... Okay, one was three, one was six.

01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:00.670
[SPEAKER_01]: There, I did versions.

01:49:01.210 --> 01:49:01.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge me.

01:49:02.907 --> 01:49:06.349
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do Sega Rally because it's very hard easy left.

01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:07.809
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, maybe.

01:49:07.889 --> 01:49:08.449
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, look.

01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Long show.

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:11.531
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to take a break.

01:49:11.591 --> 01:49:12.251
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to come back.

01:49:12.331 --> 01:49:13.392
[SPEAKER_06]: We have rapid fire news.

01:49:13.732 --> 01:49:15.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Fugle Question of the Week coming as well.

01:49:15.733 --> 01:49:16.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Some more news stories for you guys.

01:49:16.853 --> 01:49:18.254
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we promised, list lists.

01:49:18.634 --> 01:49:22.316
[SPEAKER_06]: What mascot are we going to gift to Sega just out of the goodness of our hearts?

01:49:22.376 --> 01:49:26.477
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you the listeners want us to gift to Sega for their mascot competition?

01:49:27.318 --> 01:49:29.839
[SPEAKER_06]: We will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:49:30.922 --> 01:49:33.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:49:40.766 --> 01:49:47.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this, I almost said Friday night.

01:49:48.089 --> 01:49:49.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish the weekend was starting over.

01:49:49.469 --> 01:49:52.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.

01:49:53.431 --> 01:49:58.873
[SPEAKER_06]: And joined in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at GameBuoy.org.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:01.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Ahoy.

01:50:01.747 --> 01:50:10.250
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about, you and I were talking, I won't spoil it on the show, but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're going to get into on your show, and I was like, oh, that's real good.

01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:11.150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's real good.

01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:14.291
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't steal them for OLR 503.

01:50:14.671 --> 01:50:15.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Rude.

01:50:16.212 --> 01:50:16.972
[SPEAKER_06]: And ignorant.

01:50:17.112 --> 01:50:18.152
[SPEAKER_06]: I would never, I would never.

01:50:18.852 --> 01:50:22.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.

01:50:22.774 --> 01:50:23.174
[SPEAKER_06]: What up?

01:50:23.474 --> 01:50:24.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having a good time?

01:50:24.374 --> 01:50:25.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it more fun than you thought it would?

01:50:25.354 --> 01:50:26.755
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less terrifying than I imagined.

01:50:26.915 --> 01:50:27.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

01:50:27.435 --> 01:50:27.615
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

01:50:27.695 --> 01:50:30.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it helps that it's like in, like, literally...

01:50:30.476 --> 01:50:36.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally the corner of my apartment and not like a studio with lights everywhere.

01:50:36.859 --> 01:50:41.722
[SPEAKER_06]: People think that this show, because it's so damn old, people think that we have this recording space.

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:49.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.

01:50:49.626 --> 01:50:50.407
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

01:50:50.847 --> 01:50:52.668
[SPEAKER_06]: All tea, all tea.

01:50:53.548 --> 01:50:57.451
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:59.252
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's pretty chill.

01:50:59.472 --> 01:51:03.134
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.

01:51:03.535 --> 01:51:06.697
[SPEAKER_06]: You can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:07.777 --> 01:51:08.598
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell anyone.

01:51:08.618 --> 01:51:09.839
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't spread that rumor.

01:51:09.859 --> 01:51:15.963
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that has room for OLR.

01:51:16.083 --> 01:51:18.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.

01:51:18.744 --> 01:51:20.165
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, let's all get a big house.

01:51:21.306 --> 01:51:22.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, I'd kill you all.

01:51:26.557 --> 01:51:27.637
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't talking about that.

01:51:27.737 --> 01:51:28.157
[SPEAKER_01]: I said about Rob.

01:51:28.178 --> 01:51:28.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Been there, done that.

01:51:28.978 --> 01:51:29.978
[SPEAKER_06]: I lived with Loki before.

01:51:30.078 --> 01:51:32.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Been there, done that.

01:51:32.359 --> 01:51:33.919
[SPEAKER_01]: You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.

01:51:33.999 --> 01:51:35.840
[SPEAKER_06]: With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:36.700
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make that clear.

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.281
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason, you know, he got married and blah-de-blah.

01:51:39.501 --> 01:51:42.101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.

01:51:42.121 --> 01:51:43.022
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a challenge.

01:51:44.322 --> 01:51:47.243
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.

01:51:47.263 --> 01:51:47.983
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say.

01:51:48.343 --> 01:51:50.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yeah, Nelly's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh lately.

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:52.885
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, cute, cute kid.

01:51:52.905 --> 01:51:57.086
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just I'm being reminded consistently on Facebook this week.

01:51:57.446 --> 01:51:58.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Cute, cute kid.

01:51:58.566 --> 01:51:59.747
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I have to say this.

01:51:59.927 --> 01:52:03.908
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.

01:52:04.628 --> 01:52:09.050
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.

01:52:11.461 --> 01:52:17.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, the OLR beach house?

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:25.129
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.

01:52:25.509 --> 01:52:28.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.

01:52:29.131 --> 01:52:29.912
[SPEAKER_01]: I will cut a bitch.

01:52:30.992 --> 01:52:32.854
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says move into the fort.

01:52:32.974 --> 01:52:34.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we talked about that some time ago.

01:52:34.895 --> 01:52:37.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman says OLR real world.

01:52:38.698 --> 01:52:40.279
[SPEAKER_06]: There would definitely be some drama.

01:52:40.299 --> 01:52:41.179
[SPEAKER_01]: Start getting real.

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:45.102
[SPEAKER_06]: If Jamie and I lived in the same house like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.

01:52:46.583 --> 01:52:50.646
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband would murder one of us.

01:52:50.666 --> 01:52:53.148
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what's that, Tim?

01:52:54.509 --> 01:52:56.010
[SPEAKER_00]: Rehab from tacos, maybe?

01:52:57.151 --> 01:52:58.592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do drugs already.

01:52:58.672 --> 01:52:59.813
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob Roberts, my strange addiction.

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.

01:53:02.715 --> 01:53:05.037
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.

01:53:05.057 --> 01:53:06.998
[SPEAKER_05]: Your guys' cycle would line up.

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:10.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck off.

01:53:12.062 --> 01:53:12.322
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts.

01:53:13.698 --> 01:53:19.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.

01:53:19.602 --> 01:53:21.183
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

01:53:21.403 --> 01:53:24.125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe we already did sync up.

01:53:25.025 --> 01:53:25.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:53:26.426 --> 01:53:30.889
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Bros.

01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.710
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario Bros.

01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:32.310
[SPEAKER_08]: Crossover.

01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:34.732
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Bros.

01:53:34.752 --> 01:53:41.516
[SPEAKER_08]: levels, but you get to play them as not only Super Mario, or Luigi, or Zelda, or...

01:53:42.797 --> 01:54:07.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff so now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating three years and they've got a pretty interesting I didn't know that this game existed but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special that has it's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and like Donkey Kong like they have Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that and barrels and all sorts of cool stuff so that's the newest update is going to be levels out of that game

01:54:08.642 --> 01:54:33.090
[SPEAKER_08]: and they have a whole bunch of other you know game types um you know because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks and so you can be playing with all the different characters from you know Castlevania and stuff it just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff it's really interesting but if you want to check it out um looks like uh explodingrabbit.com is where you're gonna be able to find that game of course

01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:36.392
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming.

01:54:36.512 --> 01:54:37.032
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, though.

01:54:37.412 --> 01:54:38.373
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have a trailer for it.

01:54:40.374 --> 01:54:41.375
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they pushing that?

01:54:41.515 --> 01:54:45.497
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.

01:54:45.737 --> 01:54:47.038
[SPEAKER_05]: That was supposed to be in March.

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:48.079
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:54:48.399 --> 01:54:51.521
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no Kickstarter is ever on time.

01:54:51.801 --> 01:54:52.881
[SPEAKER_08]: How's your Ouya?

01:54:52.901 --> 01:54:53.622
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your Ouya?

01:54:54.358 --> 01:54:57.919
[SPEAKER_08]: My OUYA right now is chilling in, where was it?

01:54:58.079 --> 01:55:00.279
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the Bay Area right now.

01:55:01.399 --> 01:55:02.580
[SPEAKER_08]: Just outside of Fremont.

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:04.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Daily City?

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:05.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Fremont.

01:55:06.561 --> 01:55:07.361
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

01:55:07.481 --> 01:55:08.981
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my living room, by the way.

01:55:09.001 --> 01:55:10.561
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, fucking Fremont.

01:55:10.581 --> 01:55:11.222
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

01:55:12.442 --> 01:55:13.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even Fremont.

01:55:13.122 --> 01:55:13.802
[SPEAKER_08]: Fremont's out of this.

01:55:13.882 --> 01:55:15.963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, it's a close by standard.

01:55:15.983 --> 01:55:18.583
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, seriously, fucking Daily City or whatever.

01:55:18.603 --> 01:55:19.283
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the Cow Palace.

01:55:19.383 --> 01:55:19.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever it is.

01:55:21.364 --> 01:55:22.644
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.

01:55:22.884 --> 01:55:27.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's been sitting there since Thursday, not moving at all.

01:55:28.369 --> 01:55:29.110
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the traffic.

01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:34.414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but you see, it keeps getting worse.

01:55:34.634 --> 01:55:36.796
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, it took forever for them to ship it.

01:55:37.036 --> 01:55:39.338
[SPEAKER_08]: They shipped it by boat.

01:55:39.439 --> 01:55:43.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we could do a three-hour show of you bitching about your OUYA.

01:55:43.122 --> 01:55:44.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with him on this one.

01:55:44.063 --> 01:55:45.604
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't shipped mine out yet either.

01:55:45.684 --> 01:55:46.785
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, listen, here's how it's going.

01:55:47.165 --> 01:55:48.286
[SPEAKER_08]: So they shipped it by boat.

01:55:49.367 --> 01:55:50.469
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, they picked DHL.

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.813
[SPEAKER_08]: DHL, the quality shipper.

01:55:53.274 --> 01:55:55.718
[SPEAKER_08]: The only worst shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.

01:56:01.687 --> 01:56:04.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it better not be a DHL car because that car would be moving fucking slow.

01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:06.131
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a damn heated Loki.

01:56:07.192 --> 01:56:08.353
[SPEAKER_08]: So they shipped it DHL.

01:56:08.754 --> 01:56:26.250
[SPEAKER_08]: DHL and then the strategic mailing thing, they passed it off to the United States Postal Service, which, from my experience shipping eBay stuff, they always scan those packages and they totally never just go weeks at a time without...

01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:28.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, here's where your package is.

01:56:28.711 --> 01:56:31.051
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.

01:56:31.271 --> 01:56:32.712
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I don't know where it is.

01:56:33.372 --> 01:56:42.454
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it shouldn't take a whole weekend from Thursday to go two hours in distance.

01:56:43.875 --> 01:56:44.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you done?

01:56:45.015 --> 01:56:45.295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

01:56:47.344 --> 01:56:50.665
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a new game coming from Take-Two.

01:56:51.785 --> 01:56:55.906
[SPEAKER_08]: XCOM, or at least the Bureau, XCOM Declassified.

01:56:55.966 --> 01:57:02.428
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that first-person XCOM game that no one wanted, and now it's a third-person XCOM game that some people might want.

01:57:03.648 --> 01:57:04.808
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a squad-based shooter.

01:57:05.769 --> 01:57:06.529
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

01:57:07.209 --> 01:57:14.131
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series to figure out how the XCOM Bureau, I guess, was created or something.

01:57:14.751 --> 01:57:15.071
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:57:15.691 --> 01:57:15.811
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:57:16.431 --> 01:57:42.837
[SPEAKER_08]: and last but not least the Indie Royale Lunar Bundle as we were talking about earlier purchasing pretty great deal if you buy you pay what you want $6 gets you the game $8 gets you some additional stuff including the Reawakening album which is from some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune artist TJK and then also in this bundle you get some cool stuff including Back to the Future

01:57:43.597 --> 01:57:58.842
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole Telltale game and Dungeon Hearts, Cargo Commander and let's see what else PID was the other game so I bought it, it's pretty awesome so check it out

01:58:00.968 --> 01:58:03.870
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty, let's move on and talk about the Wii U Virtual Console.

01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.832
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of referenced this already in the show.

01:58:06.072 --> 01:58:08.013
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't know, that Wii U update is out.

01:58:08.374 --> 01:58:18.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it does make a lot of stuff on the console faster, so here's a reason to turn on your Wii U if you beat Zombie U and Mario U a couple months ago and you really haven't had a reason.

01:58:19.262 --> 01:58:22.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire it up, download the update, and you can check out some of these virtual console games.

01:58:22.684 --> 01:58:23.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Balloon Fight...

01:58:24.145 --> 01:58:33.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Donkey Kong Jr., Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch-Out, F-Zero, Super Mario World, and of course, Ice Climbers, all available on Virtual Console.

01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:41.376
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, even though I said, you know, when we first announced the Virtual Console on Wii U, I wasn't going to do this.

01:58:42.236 --> 01:58:42.636
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it.

01:58:42.716 --> 01:58:45.438
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid the $1.50 to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.

01:58:45.498 --> 01:58:47.339
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, it runs really nice.

01:58:47.479 --> 01:58:49.620
[SPEAKER_06]: I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:51.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.

01:58:51.161 --> 01:58:54.322
[SPEAKER_06]: And how could a 20-year-old game be that different?

01:58:54.362 --> 01:59:04.468
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm telling you, with the HDMI, without me having to consistently change the proportions on the television, with the audio coming out of the Wii U pad as well as the TV, it works great.

01:59:04.608 --> 01:59:06.369
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, alright.

01:59:06.809 --> 01:59:09.370
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wrong when I first judged Virtual Console a few months ago.

01:59:10.071 --> 01:59:10.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

01:59:10.951 --> 01:59:11.872
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:59:28.246 --> 01:59:29.487
[SPEAKER_06]: hence the name Unmasked.

01:59:29.587 --> 01:59:31.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure DarkSakura is all about this.

01:59:31.248 --> 01:59:32.249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to play it.

01:59:33.049 --> 01:59:38.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave, supposed to be out on PC, Wii U, and 3DS.

01:59:38.873 --> 01:59:40.834
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.

01:59:41.615 --> 01:59:46.898
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the last Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U, so this will make an interesting fit.

01:59:47.238 --> 01:59:53.802
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be a very interesting step for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts is part of WB Games, it does make sense.

01:59:54.123 --> 01:59:56.744
[SPEAKER_06]: So curiosity peaked.

01:59:56.965 --> 01:59:57.425
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll say that.

01:59:58.422 --> 02:00:00.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, this rumor's going around.

02:00:01.124 --> 02:00:02.525
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much weight I give this.

02:00:02.745 --> 02:00:09.670
[SPEAKER_06]: It could certainly be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto V for next-generation consoles next month.

02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:17.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, did this originate with an analyst, that infamous games analyst that always says, because if so, then this holds absolutely no weight.

02:00:17.915 --> 02:00:19.276
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not coming out next-gen.

02:00:19.596 --> 02:00:20.797
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, and here's why.

02:00:20.837 --> 02:00:27.942
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they're going to do a PC, they will do a PC version later on, just like they did with 4, and they're going to do that probably with the next-gen consoles

02:00:28.742 --> 02:00:30.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my other problem with this article.

02:00:30.424 --> 02:00:35.328
[SPEAKER_06]: They say the announcement is supposed to be coming during an upcoming investor event on May 16th.

02:00:35.848 --> 02:00:36.729
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't make announcements.

02:00:47.017 --> 02:00:51.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our plan for the future in broad terms, not in these types of specifics.

02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:54.923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the big problem I have with this that's going around right now.

02:00:54.943 --> 02:01:03.370
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to spend the additional time to make a next-gen version of the game when they have a current-gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.

02:01:04.571 --> 02:01:08.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless someone paid them big money to make it an exclusive to their console.

02:01:08.773 --> 02:01:15.577
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't think they would do that because even if they brought out the game, they're going to do a PC version at the same time.

02:01:15.637 --> 02:01:16.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Because why bother?

02:01:16.498 --> 02:01:21.721
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to develop a higher-res version of the game, you might as well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out on PCs.

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:24.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless someone bought it off.

02:01:24.662 --> 02:01:26.623
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always a possibility on the table.

02:01:26.823 --> 02:01:27.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone bought it off.

02:01:27.844 --> 02:01:28.885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always on the table.

02:01:29.545 --> 02:01:30.126
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:01:50.824 --> 02:01:53.907
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if that happens.

02:01:54.607 --> 02:01:55.488
[SPEAKER_08]: I will cut a bitch.

02:01:55.748 --> 02:01:57.830
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.

02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:00.512
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I will fucking kill somebody.

02:02:01.132 --> 02:02:03.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Virtually, people.

02:02:03.354 --> 02:02:03.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Allegedly.

02:02:04.175 --> 02:02:05.055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Grand Theft Auto.

02:02:05.096 --> 02:02:07.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course he will kill somebody digitally.

02:02:07.517 --> 02:02:08.798
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll kill a hooker.

02:02:08.918 --> 02:02:12.141
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think I will have to kill somebody.

02:02:12.301 --> 02:02:14.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say that in this world, Loki.

02:02:14.983 --> 02:02:15.884
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't say that.

02:02:16.044 --> 02:02:16.404
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:36.031
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I gotta get my story up.

02:02:36.171 --> 02:02:36.371
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

02:02:37.752 --> 02:02:39.453
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my throat's a little owie right now.

02:02:39.974 --> 02:02:40.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

02:02:40.894 --> 02:02:43.556
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have some download content for Revengeance.

02:02:43.636 --> 02:02:47.318
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Blade Wolf, and it's going to be out in May in Japan.

02:02:47.779 --> 02:02:55.804
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 9th of May, we don't have a Western date yet, but I would assume that it would have to be somewhere near there, and it's gonna be 1,000 yen.

02:02:57.025 --> 02:03:01.668
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at maybe a $10 DLC when we get it.

02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.869
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news,

02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:05.831
[SPEAKER_01]: Close window.

02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:06.331
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

02:03:06.852 --> 02:03:09.814
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be a sequel to River City Ransom.

02:03:10.675 --> 02:03:14.618
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a crowdfunding thing open for it.

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.982
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make it an official River City Ransom.

02:03:19.302 --> 02:03:25.047
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working with the River City Ransom EX developer million to do the actual sequel.

02:03:25.227 --> 02:03:28.030
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're hoping it's going to be August 2014.

02:03:29.351 --> 02:03:31.933
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got a placeholder website out for this right now.

02:03:32.386 --> 02:03:40.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to throw a little background into this, I think the reason why they say actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS, I think, but it's not the same people.

02:03:40.728 --> 02:03:43.729
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of have the two groups now.

02:03:44.289 --> 02:03:49.111
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they doing another Neketsu game on 3DS?

02:03:49.891 --> 02:03:50.651
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so, yeah.

02:03:50.791 --> 02:03:52.432
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the actual Kunio games?

02:03:53.172 --> 02:03:53.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:03:54.002 --> 02:03:55.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that will be far superior.

02:03:57.264 --> 02:03:57.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

02:03:57.584 --> 02:03:57.984
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.

02:03:59.425 --> 02:04:01.266
[SPEAKER_06]: The shade, the shade of it all.

02:04:01.666 --> 02:04:02.226
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

02:04:02.306 --> 02:04:09.069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just true, because you cannot... Like, okay, you played Dodgeball and Super Dodgeball, right?

02:04:09.129 --> 02:04:10.070
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actual Kunio games.

02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:12.411
[SPEAKER_01]: You've played knockoff Dodgeball games, right?

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they as good?

02:04:13.391 --> 02:04:13.611
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

02:04:14.532 --> 02:04:18.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anything going to top the original hot-blooded downtown fight?

02:04:19.214 --> 02:04:20.915
[SPEAKER_06]: The Neo Geo one was great.

02:04:22.113 --> 02:04:22.253
[SPEAKER_01]: TXK

02:04:45.899 --> 02:04:47.199
[SPEAKER_01]: TXK, whatever, TXK.

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.140
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob?

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.200
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:49.940
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dyslexic.

02:04:50.741 --> 02:04:53.601
[SPEAKER_01]: I have excited onset dyslexia.

02:04:54.242 --> 02:04:54.582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:57.863
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quaking a little bit right now.

02:04:58.363 --> 02:04:58.983
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaking, crying.

02:05:00.564 --> 02:05:02.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe your super zapper needs to recharge.

02:05:03.545 --> 02:05:04.925
[SPEAKER_01]: Super zapper recharge.

02:05:05.585 --> 02:05:07.506
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, for anyone who lives under a rock...

02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:32.827
[SPEAKER_01]: who has been living under a rock or in a cave or under the sea Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best games in the universe even as frustratingly difficult as it can be it's all because of the music because nothing else matters and it came out on the Jaguar which was the only good game on the Jaguar next to what Alien vs. Predator no that wasn't even very good either for the time yeah but it was still the best game that ever came out on the Jaguar hands down

02:05:33.482 --> 02:05:34.563
[SPEAKER_01]: KXT KXT

02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:04.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's take a chance to go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

02:06:13.984 --> 02:06:17.107
[SPEAKER_06]: Take Facebook, take Google, slam them together and you get Fugle.

02:06:17.287 --> 02:06:21.471
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ask a question on our Fugle Facebook and Google communities every week.

02:06:21.631 --> 02:06:22.993
[SPEAKER_06]: And this week is about movies.

02:06:23.413 --> 02:06:24.594
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to apologize in advance.

02:06:24.614 --> 02:06:27.217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to have enough time to read all the answers because we're running long tonight.

02:06:27.237 --> 02:06:27.977
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have a list list.

02:06:28.918 --> 02:06:35.845
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see all the answers in full.

02:06:36.846 --> 02:06:40.730
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some news this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.

02:06:41.150 --> 02:06:42.652
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about video game movies?

02:06:43.072 --> 02:06:45.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.

02:06:45.475 --> 02:06:47.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?

02:06:47.337 --> 02:06:50.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Should Hollywood be making more video game movies or less?

02:06:51.622 --> 02:06:54.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at some of the answers on Google+.

02:06:55.558 --> 02:06:56.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says,

02:07:22.564 --> 02:07:25.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaco Jones, which by the way, I want to congratulate Flaco Jones.

02:07:25.987 --> 02:07:28.188
[SPEAKER_06]: He's now officially staffed for VOG.

02:07:28.608 --> 02:07:33.512
[SPEAKER_06]: His first movie review went up, and he's got another article he's posting during the week.

02:07:33.832 --> 02:07:39.816
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film perspective, in the written form, so that'll be great.

02:07:40.637 --> 02:07:41.577
[SPEAKER_06]: So congrats, Flaco.

02:07:42.118 --> 02:07:49.062
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's also going to be a very interesting change for the game, because as you know, staff of VOG don't go on the regular leaderboards.

02:07:49.442 --> 02:07:51.364
[SPEAKER_06]: So Flaco has been winning every month.

02:07:52.004 --> 02:07:54.365
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hmm, now things are going to get interesting.

02:07:55.105 --> 02:07:56.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but anyhow, Flacco says,

02:08:15.153 --> 02:08:24.996
[SPEAKER_06]: and Red Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says in an ideal situation you need a writer, director and producer all having good track records working together as a team.

02:08:25.416 --> 02:08:28.657
[SPEAKER_06]: That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler Perry Presents Halo.

02:08:32.458 --> 02:08:32.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

02:08:34.309 --> 02:08:36.090
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do a few answers from Facebook as well.

02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:43.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth, whose podcast talks a lot about movies and TV shows and that stuff, and he does a lot of the book reviews for our site.

02:08:43.855 --> 02:08:52.501
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth says, I love the RNC games, but the last two have been less than stellar, so I'm actually hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason to revitalize the franchise.

02:08:52.881 --> 02:08:56.724
[SPEAKER_06]: But in general terms, I think it always comes down to the creative minds behind the production.

02:08:56.804 --> 02:09:01.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they understand the IP and what a film adaptation can bring to the table that the game itself does not?

02:09:01.927 --> 02:09:04.109
[SPEAKER_06]: And is the game suited to a film-style narrative?

02:09:05.710 --> 02:09:13.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete Garuno says, Some game franchises lend themselves very well to film adaptations, even though the execution has pretty much always been awful.

02:09:13.594 --> 02:09:19.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank really doesn't strike me as the kind of game that ought to have a film made of it, unless they're really that desperate for money.

02:09:20.438 --> 02:09:26.122
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, on Facebook, Andy R says, As a PlayStation fan, I was pretty happy about the news, but I'm concerned as well.

02:09:26.522 --> 02:09:27.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

02:09:46.777 --> 02:09:51.979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very interesting comment, and I kind of want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here in the studio.

02:09:52.700 --> 02:10:01.523
[SPEAKER_06]: He theorizes there that if the movie is so bad, it's going to make people go, well, no wonder, because it's a game, and the game probably sucks too.

02:10:01.943 --> 02:10:06.245
[SPEAKER_06]: So can the movies actually do harm to video gaming when they're really terrible?

02:10:07.616 --> 02:10:23.159
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think it also really depends on the audience too because there's been a lot of really good Japanese adaptations that wouldn't fly over here for the general audience because of that quirkiness that's a part of Japanese game movie versions.

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:33.002
[SPEAKER_01]: People here want either it to be super cutesy or super gritty, realistic, have an edge to it and I don't really see it.

02:10:33.562 --> 02:10:34.882
[SPEAKER_01]: It would really depend on the IP.

02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:44.073
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, which came first, the Alone in the Dark movie or the Alone in the Dark game by Atari?

02:10:44.793 --> 02:10:45.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the last one.

02:10:47.094 --> 02:10:48.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't remember which one hurt what.

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:51.335
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure Tara Reid, being a scientist, didn't help.

02:10:51.435 --> 02:10:52.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, stop.

02:10:53.636 --> 02:10:55.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?

02:10:56.325 --> 02:11:00.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I think that they're largely, you know, mediocre at best.

02:11:01.248 --> 02:11:09.633
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of telling when you have recent movie games like Prince of Persia and the general perception is still, oh, game movies are getting better.

02:11:11.133 --> 02:11:14.095
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they're mostly crap, but I don't think they hurt.

02:11:15.336 --> 02:11:19.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise that exists, and that movie was awful.

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:22.060
[SPEAKER_05]: See also Super Mario Brothers with Bob Hoskins.

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:22.800
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey.

02:11:23.901 --> 02:11:24.641
[SPEAKER_01]: Kylie was in it.

02:11:25.057 --> 02:11:26.578
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was in Street Fighter, yes.

02:11:27.778 --> 02:11:28.959
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I thought you meant the Mario movie.

02:11:28.979 --> 02:11:36.642
[SPEAKER_01]: The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super... But I feel so bad for dearly departed Raul Julia for that being his last movie.

02:11:37.603 --> 02:11:39.724
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have seen him in some really crappy movies.

02:11:39.764 --> 02:11:42.285
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys even forgot that there was another Street Fighter movie.

02:11:42.905 --> 02:11:45.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was that horrible Chun-Li thing.

02:11:45.588 --> 02:11:45.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:53.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Bison cause harm with psychic powers to a woman in a way that I don't really feel appropriate describing?

02:11:53.297 --> 02:11:54.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

02:11:54.438 --> 02:11:57.001
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it, and I don't really want to.

02:11:57.161 --> 02:12:00.425
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really drunk, but I feel like I was offended, and that takes a lot.

02:12:02.004 --> 02:12:05.627
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick with the Ties That Bind, best Street Fighter thing that came out.

02:12:06.187 --> 02:12:09.349
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing in my universe, the thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.

02:12:10.170 --> 02:12:11.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was really good.

02:12:11.751 --> 02:12:12.772
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, what do you think?

02:12:12.832 --> 02:12:17.835
[SPEAKER_06]: If they end up doing this new Mass Effect movie, do you think it's going to do justice to the games?

02:12:19.016 --> 02:12:20.717
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it'll do justice to the games.

02:12:20.737 --> 02:12:22.158
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be something completely different.

02:12:22.258 --> 02:12:23.299
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be good, it might be bad.

02:12:24.239 --> 02:12:28.282
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I think video game movies have been pretty hit or miss, but I'm pretty hopeful that...

02:12:28.622 --> 02:12:41.108
[SPEAKER_00]: because I look at something like the comic book industry, which they made a lot of stinker comic book movies, but eventually Hollywood and the comic industry figured out how to do that, and there have been some stellar comic book games.

02:12:41.248 --> 02:12:48.592
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have hope that in the future they sort of solve that problem for games translating over to movies as well.

02:12:48.612 --> 02:12:49.092
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

02:12:49.112 --> 02:12:50.053
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point.

02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:58.783
[SPEAKER_06]: I tend to agree with the other person that talked about how if the right people with the right passion are behind it, it has the potential to do very well.

02:12:59.683 --> 02:13:02.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, you know, anything Uwe Boll touched, you're like, oh, girl.

02:13:02.824 --> 02:13:08.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I feel that, I mean, considering this, I'm assuming Sony's going to be publishing the movie.

02:13:09.066 --> 02:13:13.027
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's studios that they picked to do these licenses.

02:13:13.207 --> 02:13:14.948
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume that they're going to be...

02:13:16.228 --> 02:13:24.294
[SPEAKER_08]: up to their standards because I mean it is their properties that they're playing with and I would think that they wouldn't just let anything come to market.

02:13:25.696 --> 02:13:26.036
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:13:27.237 --> 02:13:33.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they've done like what some tie-ins and stuff with different like EA properties like some anime movies and I don't think those were that bad.

02:13:36.744 --> 02:13:45.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane in our chat room who of course has a thing or two to say about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how the Mass Effect movie should be because we all have our different stories and shepherds.

02:13:46.371 --> 02:13:50.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Prince Brightstar says, Frankly, I think Mass Effect will be better as a Saturday morning cartoon.

02:13:50.733 --> 02:13:52.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Picturing the April Fool's 12th.

02:13:52.034 --> 02:13:53.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was the anime.

02:13:54.055 --> 02:13:54.655
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

02:13:54.835 --> 02:13:56.336
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, did I tell you I got that?

02:13:56.456 --> 02:13:56.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

02:13:57.397 --> 02:13:57.797
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned.

02:13:57.817 --> 02:13:59.278
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't terrible.

02:14:00.398 --> 02:14:01.259
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

02:14:01.279 --> 02:14:03.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate admitting that it wasn't terrible.

02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:13.144
[SPEAKER_01]: The ending of it totally was like, you know all the stuff that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the gut and make you vomit your feelings?

02:14:13.725 --> 02:14:14.365
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did that too.

02:14:17.498 --> 02:14:21.840
[SPEAKER_06]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the passphrase, yogurt.

02:14:24.862 --> 02:14:26.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do a couple more news stories.

02:14:26.042 --> 02:14:27.643
[SPEAKER_06]: We got listless coming up, but first, Loki.

02:14:28.444 --> 02:14:28.644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:14:29.224 --> 02:14:30.705
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'm sorry.

02:14:31.005 --> 02:14:34.487
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to... I always say at the end of the Fugle segment, please read the rest of the answers.

02:14:34.627 --> 02:14:36.388
[SPEAKER_06]: I really skipped a lot tonight because of time.

02:14:36.408 --> 02:14:36.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:14:37.088 --> 02:14:39.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google Plus.

02:14:39.969 --> 02:14:41.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:41.210 --> 02:14:41.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

02:14:41.630 --> 02:14:41.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:44.051
[SPEAKER_08]: So EA has had some more layoffs.

02:14:44.592 --> 02:14:46.853
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't really said who was laid off.

02:14:47.473 --> 02:15:01.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, I guess there was an internal memo that leaked out, basically saying that at the beginning of their fiscal year, they're cutting some of their operations.

02:15:02.685 --> 02:15:06.928
[SPEAKER_08]: Core marketing functions have been consolidated under their new COO.

02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:11.511
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're just restructuring, it looks like.

02:15:12.952 --> 02:15:13.133
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

02:15:15.405 --> 02:15:19.047
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with that, there's a rumor that EA Partners' label is closing.

02:15:19.547 --> 02:15:24.590
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes all those other developers out there.

02:15:24.610 --> 02:15:25.530
[SPEAKER_08]: They're bringing different titles.

02:15:26.191 --> 02:15:33.014
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, The Crisis Series, Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness Returns, Bulletstorm, Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.

02:15:34.675 --> 02:15:36.856
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess, I wonder if that would affect Fuse.

02:15:36.876 --> 02:15:39.918
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, Fuse is just right around the corner, so I'm sure that game will still come out.

02:15:39.998 --> 02:15:44.080
[SPEAKER_08]: But we may see a lot less, I guess...

02:15:46.511 --> 02:15:52.633
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily experimental titles, but titles that aren't positive would do well.

02:15:52.693 --> 02:15:55.254
[SPEAKER_08]: Like new properties like Mirror's Edge or something like that.

02:15:55.955 --> 02:16:01.757
[SPEAKER_08]: Alice thought that would have done okay, but apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows.

02:16:03.037 --> 02:16:07.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Suda is hard to... It's more niche.

02:16:07.719 --> 02:16:09.220
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised.

02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:13.782
[SPEAKER_08]: And then last but not least, SimCity.

02:16:14.362 --> 02:16:14.542
[SPEAKER_08]: This is

02:16:16.312 --> 02:16:18.332
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there's always bad news when I mention SimCity.

02:16:18.673 --> 02:16:19.373
[SPEAKER_08]: It got a patch!

02:16:19.413 --> 02:16:20.413
[SPEAKER_08]: It fixed some bugs!

02:16:21.113 --> 02:16:24.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Godzilla is attacking the city!

02:16:25.014 --> 02:16:25.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

02:16:28.014 --> 02:16:29.955
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, SimCity 2.0 came out.

02:16:30.835 --> 02:16:35.576
[SPEAKER_08]: It fixed a few bugs and unfortunately created a bunch of other bugs.

02:16:35.656 --> 02:16:36.096
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

02:16:37.816 --> 02:16:39.317
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

02:16:39.997 --> 02:16:40.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of weird stuff.

02:16:41.077 --> 02:16:42.977
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pathing problems still.

02:16:43.297 --> 02:16:45.518
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the problem was sewage backing up.

02:16:46.438 --> 02:16:49.300
[SPEAKER_08]: So, your towns are literally full of shit now.

02:16:50.761 --> 02:16:52.162
[SPEAKER_08]: All sorts of syncing problems.

02:16:53.183 --> 02:16:59.807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they actually have this group of people on Reddit putting together a list of stuff that's wrong with it now.

02:17:01.008 --> 02:17:02.109
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of sucks.

02:17:02.889 --> 02:17:04.030
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a work in progress.

02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:07.652
[SPEAKER_06]: And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making those bugs.

02:17:09.314 --> 02:17:09.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

02:17:12.307 --> 02:17:13.368
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

02:17:15.569 --> 02:17:18.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else you want to share about SimCity?

02:17:20.792 --> 02:17:22.693
[SPEAKER_08]: SimCity 4 apparently is on sale right now.

02:17:22.713 --> 02:17:23.854
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get it for really cheap.

02:17:24.154 --> 02:17:26.615
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to play a great SimCity game, there you go.

02:17:27.496 --> 02:17:28.156
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's offline.

02:17:29.977 --> 02:17:31.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, I think this is fascinating.

02:17:31.858 --> 02:17:33.199
[SPEAKER_06]: A patent that Apple filed in 2009.

02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:40.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what the patent is all about is that you have a path that you might take in a video game.

02:17:40.621 --> 02:17:48.463
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting, what's fascinating about this is that in the patent filing, they freaking use these mock-ups of Mass Effect screenshots.

02:17:48.543 --> 02:17:54.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and it even says name, John Shepard, origin, colonist, and like a little mock-up of what they look like and everything.

02:17:54.404 --> 02:17:57.745
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing that made me go, is this like a joke or a troll or a, you know...

02:17:58.465 --> 02:17:58.766
[SPEAKER_06]: L.O.L.

02:17:58.806 --> 02:17:59.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Games Journalism thing?

02:17:59.667 --> 02:18:00.007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:18:00.048 --> 02:18:04.834
[SPEAKER_06]: But since it's floating around out there, I will report on it because I think this is a fascinating idea.

02:18:05.676 --> 02:18:10.042
[SPEAKER_06]: The Patent Office did grant Apple this patent and it was made public.

02:18:11.112 --> 02:18:32.658
[SPEAKER_06]: and it would go like this like let's say you you know in Mass Effect you you make all these different choices or let me take a game that you know Loki would actually play like Walking Dead okay like the Walking Dead games they well the Telltale ones are really good like let's say you go through the Walking Dead games you make your different choices and obviously they have a big impact well the trick about this patent is that at the end

02:18:33.058 --> 02:18:34.842
[SPEAKER_06]: After you've developed your character, played the game.

02:18:34.862 --> 02:18:36.425
[SPEAKER_06]: So imagine you play a game like Walking Dead.

02:18:36.465 --> 02:18:43.939
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end, you can use this system that Apple patented and you get a single issue comic that is

02:18:44.722 --> 02:18:45.162
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:21.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes Okay, so you get your comic book And Strip Mine Planets And DarkSakura presents Shakerian Sunday And it's something she can get on her iPad and read it And it's like, oh, it's me and my Garrus I am not that bad Are you sure?

02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:29.645
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the Moe pillow But you thought about it No, I didn't Did you see how expensive it was?

02:19:32.734 --> 02:19:33.897
[SPEAKER_06]: I love how that was the reason.

02:19:33.917 --> 02:19:34.439
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at me!

02:19:35.101 --> 02:19:35.863
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the reason.

02:19:36.183 --> 02:19:37.888
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have money for a pillow!

02:19:39.733 --> 02:19:41.117
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides, I didn't really care for the art that much.

02:19:42.656 --> 02:19:47.919
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:20:07.341 --> 02:20:09.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.

02:20:09.483 --> 02:20:15.347
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss those, but I used to skip to the end to see what the best... Because there's only like one path that's... Right.

02:20:17.708 --> 02:20:20.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you don't sneeze horrifically in the middle of a show.

02:20:21.311 --> 02:20:21.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Twice.

02:20:25.313 --> 02:20:25.994
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

02:20:27.235 --> 02:20:28.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.

02:20:28.716 --> 02:20:30.337
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.

02:20:30.357 --> 02:20:30.877
[SPEAKER_06]: That was cute.

02:20:31.918 --> 02:20:33.619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's, I think.

02:20:34.119 --> 02:20:35.740
[SPEAKER_06]: Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.

02:20:36.041 --> 02:20:36.321
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

02:20:36.341 --> 02:20:36.381
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

02:20:39.622 --> 02:20:41.003
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say about the Vanity Books?

02:20:41.123 --> 02:20:41.663
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget.

02:20:41.683 --> 02:20:42.064
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:20:43.825 --> 02:20:44.445
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.

02:20:44.525 --> 02:20:44.865
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

02:20:45.666 --> 02:20:47.747
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:20:48.127 --> 02:20:49.088
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good idea.

02:20:49.268 --> 02:21:05.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Vanity Books is a really good comparison, but in this day and age where you just crank it all out digitally into a 99-cent PDF or something, I think it's a great, like, as corny as this is going to sound, it would be a great memory of your gaming experience.

02:21:05.765 --> 02:21:35.207
[SPEAKER_06]: because like you know a game like Mass Effect you know again I hate to keep using this as an example but it's such a good example it takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect and then maybe you're sitting here for two years waiting for the sequel to come out well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself oh let me read my little comic that I had generated at the end and remember about my character and my choices people do that anyway it's called fan fiction it's called Tumblr it's called Tumblr yeah no no no you're actually that's a pretty accurate statement it's called Tumblr

02:21:36.522 --> 02:21:37.984
[SPEAKER_06]: So did Apple try to patent Tumblr?

02:21:38.024 --> 02:21:38.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we're saying?

02:21:40.247 --> 02:21:42.029
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:21:42.269 --> 02:21:44.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to something that's going to need a patent here.

02:21:44.812 --> 02:21:47.055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tonight's Listless.

02:21:55.233 --> 02:21:59.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, for those of you guys that have never been here for Listless before, let me tell you how it works.

02:22:00.056 --> 02:22:07.100
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go around, oh, well first the point of this whole thing is that we are going to come up with the definitive list.

02:22:07.521 --> 02:22:08.961
[SPEAKER_06]: No arguments, no exceptions.

02:22:09.062 --> 02:22:14.865
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to solve a great question in gaming right now with this highly scientific process.

02:22:14.885 --> 02:22:17.427
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it's going to work, we are going to all go around the room.

02:22:17.447 --> 02:22:19.568
[SPEAKER_06]: There's five of us tonight, so it's like a Super Listless.

02:22:20.068 --> 02:22:20.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Listless.

02:22:21.449 --> 02:22:26.391
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go around the room tonight and each of us are going to name three things for the list.

02:22:26.411 --> 02:22:27.592
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to nominate them for the list.

02:22:27.912 --> 02:22:34.715
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the exciting part, we go around the room and each person will strike one item that is not worthy of the list.

02:22:35.095 --> 02:22:43.919
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember our new twist as of the last time we did this, should a host have two of their items eliminated from the list, the third item gets immunity.

02:22:44.239 --> 02:22:47.561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way it does not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.

02:22:48.141 --> 02:23:08.352
[SPEAKER_06]: so uh and then the chat room will vote on their top and we will get the one two and three the definitive list so here it is chatters if you want to help out tonight start yelling your answers in chat now the topic tonight mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR earlier in the show we talked about Sega

02:23:09.392 --> 02:23:12.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega is looking for your mascot in a nutshell.

02:23:12.635 --> 02:23:18.840
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm really cutting corners here, but they're looking for your mascot ideas and they could use them in a future press conference.

02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:22.343
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR and VOG and all that.

02:23:22.763 --> 02:23:23.383
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.

02:23:24.544 --> 02:23:30.707
[SPEAKER_06]: Going around the room and giving our list of the mascots we'd most like to see.

02:23:31.227 --> 02:23:34.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies first, DarkSakura, your number three answer tonight.

02:23:34.708 --> 02:23:37.709
[SPEAKER_06]: What mascot would you most like to gift Sega?

02:23:38.650 --> 02:23:40.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Master System, the Sega robot.

02:23:44.692 --> 02:23:46.773
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would Master System, the Sega robot be?

02:23:48.068 --> 02:23:52.092
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be a cute robot, but he wouldn't be like MechaSonic because that would be too derivative.

02:23:52.512 --> 02:23:58.537
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd just be a cute little chibi robot or maybe powerful like one of the Robo-Alessed robots.

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Robo-Alessed needs more love.

02:24:01.239 --> 02:24:02.079
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was awesome.

02:24:02.099 --> 02:24:02.460
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:04.261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you on that.

02:24:04.301 --> 02:24:05.842
[SPEAKER_01]: But his name would be Master System.

02:24:07.083 --> 02:24:08.725
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Master System, hello.

02:24:10.066 --> 02:24:10.386
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:24:11.387 --> 02:24:12.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around.

02:24:12.427 --> 02:24:15.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how about your number three answer tonight for the list?

02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:15.950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's easy.

02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:16.551
[SPEAKER_06]: President Cat.

02:24:18.922 --> 02:24:19.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

02:24:19.122 --> 02:24:20.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's President Cat.

02:24:20.823 --> 02:24:23.364
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a very OLR thing and it's being shouted by a lot of people in chat.

02:24:23.384 --> 02:24:25.845
[SPEAKER_01]: So President Cat... I thought we had to pick something original.

02:24:26.446 --> 02:24:27.086
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

02:24:27.186 --> 02:24:30.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who said President Cat has to be that same President Cat?

02:24:31.068 --> 02:24:34.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Since clearly that game company didn't give a fuck about our idea.

02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:39.993
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might remember the translation was something like, what, Boss Cat?

02:24:40.033 --> 02:24:41.033
[SPEAKER_06]: We said President Cat.

02:24:41.093 --> 02:24:43.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Sukibon is like a female delinquent.

02:24:43.794 --> 02:24:45.395
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shacho is like a company president.

02:24:45.415 --> 02:24:47.016
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like a female delinquent.

02:24:48.117 --> 02:24:48.657
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob...

02:24:49.929 --> 02:24:50.129
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:51.791
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hit you in the face with a yo-yo.

02:24:52.892 --> 02:24:55.555
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only people who'd get that are people who actually saw Suki Bandeka.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, um... SSJ100 Matt had a really good suggestion.

02:25:03.325 --> 02:25:06.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Dickie the Pen Dickie the Pen is awesome

02:25:32.847 --> 02:25:33.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

02:25:33.247 --> 02:25:35.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Dickie the Pen is awesome.

02:25:36.730 --> 02:25:38.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think about that one for a little bit.

02:25:38.812 --> 02:25:38.992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:25:39.032 --> 02:25:41.814
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Spike, who's over there frowning at my answer.

02:25:42.795 --> 02:25:46.638
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your number three answer for the list of mascot you'd like to gift to Sega?

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:50.761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to gift to Sega Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress.

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:55.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:25:55.425 --> 02:25:57.227
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have to sing like her?

02:25:57.367 --> 02:25:58.688
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the egg purse too.

02:26:00.783 --> 02:26:09.426
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel so bad for your listeners.

02:26:11.127 --> 02:26:12.287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just singing Bjork.

02:26:16.329 --> 02:26:16.629
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:21.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, but not leastly, with the number three item for the list tonight, Tim, what is your contribution to the list?

02:26:22.151 --> 02:26:29.194
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since I think that crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad, I think a good mascot for them would be a 32X with a frowny face.

02:26:32.793 --> 02:26:36.296
[SPEAKER_05]: So a regular 32X.

02:26:36.356 --> 02:26:38.277
[SPEAKER_06]: A 32X with a frown face.

02:26:39.037 --> 02:26:39.418
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:26:39.978 --> 02:26:41.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the number two answers.

02:26:41.579 --> 02:26:41.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie.

02:26:42.019 --> 02:26:44.021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, keep in mind, I'm not doing mine in any particular order.

02:26:44.041 --> 02:26:45.342
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing them the order I want to list them in.

02:26:45.642 --> 02:26:45.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

02:26:46.182 --> 02:26:47.503
[SPEAKER_01]: Segata Sanshiro II.

02:26:50.005 --> 02:26:51.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in chat said that earlier, I think.

02:26:51.969 --> 02:26:58.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they actually said Segata Sanshiro, but since I'm being original, Segata Sanshiro the second.

02:26:58.993 --> 02:27:00.934
[SPEAKER_01]: It's A-T-A.

02:27:01.554 --> 02:27:04.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Segata Sanshiro the second.

02:27:04.876 --> 02:27:10.259
[SPEAKER_01]: And if no one's seen it, look up the Segata Sanshiro videos after the show.

02:27:12.521 --> 02:27:13.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your number two answer tonight.

02:27:14.181 --> 02:27:14.862
[SPEAKER_06]: A forklift.

02:27:21.525 --> 02:27:23.914
[SPEAKER_06]: And why would their mascot be a forklift?

02:27:23.934 --> 02:27:25.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you not play Shenmue?

02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:26.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, I get it.

02:27:26.825 --> 02:27:27.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:33.301 --> 02:27:38.823
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was going to be a joke there about moving things into the warehouse, but alright, fine.

02:27:39.583 --> 02:27:40.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, however you want to take it.

02:27:41.784 --> 02:27:43.164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny in multiple formats.

02:27:43.325 --> 02:27:46.266
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the joke was how you didn't get it.

02:27:46.746 --> 02:27:50.447
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, my brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue out of all the video games in the world.

02:27:50.507 --> 02:27:52.268
[SPEAKER_06]: It should always think of Shenmue.

02:27:53.627 --> 02:27:55.188
[SPEAKER_06]: I approve, but you're awful

02:28:16.768 --> 02:28:18.430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long-running OLR joke, Spike.

02:28:18.470 --> 02:28:19.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Just smile and nod.

02:28:19.671 --> 02:28:19.911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:28:19.951 --> 02:28:23.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-Sylon Occupy Caprica from SSJ100MAD is my number two answer for the list.

02:28:24.975 --> 02:28:26.976
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Captain Spike, what is your number two answer for the list?

02:28:27.196 --> 02:28:33.301
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know your memes or anything, so I'm just going to go with Dark Sakura in a sailor suit.

02:28:35.202 --> 02:28:36.103
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I at least have a gun?

02:28:38.204 --> 02:28:38.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

02:28:38.885 --> 02:28:39.746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

02:28:40.106 --> 02:28:42.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura in a sailor suit and a gun.

02:28:42.848 --> 02:28:43.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

02:28:43.408 --> 02:28:43.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:46.360
[SPEAKER_06]: because look at her.

02:28:46.401 --> 02:28:47.421
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be badass.

02:28:47.761 --> 02:28:48.842
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a Duffy thing.

02:28:49.002 --> 02:28:49.903
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?

02:28:50.663 --> 02:28:51.564
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Duffy!

02:28:51.624 --> 02:28:52.924
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.

02:28:53.285 --> 02:28:53.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

02:28:53.745 --> 02:28:54.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure!

02:28:54.625 --> 02:28:57.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, when you don't get my references, that's okay.

02:28:57.727 --> 02:29:00.349
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get your references and that's a crime against gaming.

02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:06.292
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, little factoid, my very first cosplay ever was Sailor Venus.

02:29:06.933 --> 02:29:07.573
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

02:29:08.786 --> 02:29:10.047
[SPEAKER_01]: This skirt was way too short.

02:29:11.968 --> 02:29:12.349
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:29:13.350 --> 02:29:14.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Spike.

02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:16.212
[SPEAKER_01]: In the name of the moon, I will fuck you up.

02:29:16.432 --> 02:29:18.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Tim's number two answer.

02:29:19.074 --> 02:29:20.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, what is your number two answer for the list?

02:29:20.695 --> 02:29:23.618
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually really similar to Spike's, and we did not plan it that way.

02:29:23.738 --> 02:29:29.102
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all three OLR hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.

02:29:30.063 --> 02:29:30.823
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that much hair.

02:29:31.884 --> 02:29:32.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Loki be Jaune?

02:29:34.759 --> 02:29:35.419
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Loki can be Jon.

02:29:35.439 --> 02:29:36.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob has to be the other witch.

02:29:36.779 --> 02:29:37.160
[SPEAKER_01]: What was her?

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:38.740
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Jon.

02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:39.260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:40.600
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be Joe Pesci.

02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:41.280
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob has to be.

02:29:42.181 --> 02:29:43.061
[SPEAKER_01]: He can be the little girl.

02:29:43.481 --> 02:29:45.001
[SPEAKER_01]: The little young virgin.

02:29:45.281 --> 02:29:47.322
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I will not be a little girl.

02:29:47.542 --> 02:29:48.062
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not you.

02:29:48.102 --> 02:29:48.802
[SPEAKER_01]: You be Jon.

02:29:48.922 --> 02:29:50.182
[SPEAKER_01]: He be the little girl.

02:29:50.342 --> 02:29:51.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sexy, right?

02:29:52.003 --> 02:29:52.363
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

02:29:53.403 --> 02:29:54.403
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be wearing a breastplate.

02:29:55.104 --> 02:29:55.864
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say yes.

02:29:55.944 --> 02:29:56.904
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said I guess.

02:29:57.751 --> 02:29:58.031
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:29:58.651 --> 02:30:01.473
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, the list of mascots we will gift to Sega.

02:30:02.053 --> 02:30:18.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, 32X with a frowny face, Segata Senshiro II, a forklift, non-Sylon-occupied Caprica, Dark Sakura in a sailor suit, and a gun.

02:30:19.041 --> 02:30:21.202
[SPEAKER_06]: All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

02:30:21.242 --> 02:30:22.062
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the worst list ever.

02:30:22.082 --> 02:30:23.323
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm already wearing the glasses.

02:30:23.463 --> 02:30:23.803
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:30:23.963 --> 02:30:26.805
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like how everyone assumed I would be Bayonetta, so thank you.

02:30:28.826 --> 02:30:31.269
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way I would wear high heels is if they had guns on them.

02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:35.073
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one answers for the list.

02:30:35.153 --> 02:30:36.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

02:30:37.336 --> 02:30:37.856
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

02:30:38.257 --> 02:30:41.320
[SPEAKER_01]: Opa Opa's retarded cousin Opi Opi that looks like a huge boom.

02:30:43.482 --> 02:30:44.984
[SPEAKER_05]: That was oddly specific.

02:30:46.893 --> 02:31:15.136
[SPEAKER_01]: OPI is boob in Japanese so it would be I won't use the R word in the answer I will say OPA OPA's OPI huge boob cousin it's OPP AI by the way OPI OPI OPI yeah instead of OPA OPA because we all know that Fantasy Zone is awesome okay there we go Loki your number one answer ooh la la

02:31:17.034 --> 02:31:19.535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it, but it's getting taken down.

02:31:43.718 --> 02:31:44.378
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Rob.

02:31:45.119 --> 02:31:46.279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already taking down one of yours.

02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:47.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine, fine.

02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:55.044
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can't have that, you know, if we're gonna, we're gonna make, I'm gonna, instead of like a game character, I want a game to be an actual, you know, thing.

02:31:55.224 --> 02:31:55.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

02:31:55.724 --> 02:31:56.945
[SPEAKER_08]: The Japanese table flipping game.

02:31:57.305 --> 02:31:57.945
[SPEAKER_08]: The arcade game.

02:31:58.525 --> 02:32:01.327
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be the, it should just be a big table being flipped over.

02:32:01.507 --> 02:32:02.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played that?

02:32:02.187 --> 02:32:02.908
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

02:32:03.008 --> 02:32:03.828
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I want to play it.

02:32:03.848 --> 02:32:04.648
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.

02:32:04.788 --> 02:32:07.130
[SPEAKER_06]: That emote icon could just be their new mascot.

02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:09.251
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Chiggers Forever for saying De Medna.

02:32:11.471 --> 02:32:13.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my puppets!

02:32:13.772 --> 02:32:16.273
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about my blast processing?

02:32:19.334 --> 02:32:19.754
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

02:32:19.874 --> 02:32:26.196
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to redo the Pandaren meme and have it say blast processing.

02:32:26.256 --> 02:32:27.757
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stealing X to first meme.

02:32:27.777 --> 02:32:31.398
[SPEAKER_06]: The sad thing is like 98% of the audience just isn't going to understand.

02:32:32.919 --> 02:32:34.939
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the 2% that do, you're welcome.

02:32:35.019 --> 02:32:35.320
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:35.800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it for us.

02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:36.200
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:32:37.240 --> 02:32:39.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, your number one answer.

02:32:40.512 --> 02:32:43.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've done one for Rob and I've done one for DarkSakura.

02:32:43.893 --> 02:32:48.254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go with Loki in a banana hammock with a giant purple dildo bat.

02:32:51.915 --> 02:32:54.675
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have just done as Tingle.

02:32:56.456 --> 02:32:57.616
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, Loki.

02:32:57.656 --> 02:32:58.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Tingle's old.

02:32:58.496 --> 02:33:00.597
[SPEAKER_06]: You were the one that wanted to get past Tingle.

02:33:00.677 --> 02:33:05.278
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat is on the list.

02:33:05.598 --> 02:33:06.758
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100 not suggested Betty White.

02:33:06.778 --> 02:33:06.899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:33:10.069 --> 02:33:12.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more.

02:33:14.376 --> 02:33:17.340
[SPEAKER_06]: One more here from Tim to add to the list.

02:33:17.461 --> 02:33:18.823
[SPEAKER_06]: Last chance to get something on the list.

02:33:18.843 --> 02:33:20.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, no, I didn't do my number one, did I?

02:33:20.085 --> 02:33:20.766
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you didn't.

02:33:20.786 --> 02:33:21.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

02:33:21.407 --> 02:33:22.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, then my number one answer...

02:33:23.957 --> 02:33:34.121
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer would be, now, my number one answer is inspired by the fact, I don't know if you guys know this, but in San Francisco, in the Sega building, they're no longer there in the Sega building, you know what company moved in in their place?

02:33:35.481 --> 02:33:36.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Zynga.

02:33:36.842 --> 02:33:42.243
[SPEAKER_06]: So my number one answer mascot is Zeke the Zynga Killer, and he's a coyote that eats dogs.

02:33:44.404 --> 02:33:46.405
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a horrible person, Rob, I approve.

02:33:46.425 --> 02:33:48.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he only eats Zynga dogs, don't worry.

02:33:48.185 --> 02:33:49.806
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well then he can eat the Zynga dog.

02:33:52.799 --> 02:33:54.660
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer is Zeke the Zynga Killer.

02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:58.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, last but not leastly, Tim, your number one answer.

02:33:58.923 --> 02:34:04.507
[SPEAKER_00]: My number one answer is a terrifying amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:18.156
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some vaguely Sonic-shaped character that's pink like the girl, Amy, and has knuckles as hands and a gun.

02:34:19.117 --> 02:34:20.858
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?

02:34:21.451 --> 02:34:22.611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Sonic Gestalt.

02:34:22.671 --> 02:34:22.991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

02:34:23.451 --> 02:34:23.712
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

02:34:23.912 --> 02:34:26.452
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would have to be called SBO because that was the weirdest name.

02:34:26.592 --> 02:34:26.872
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:34:26.932 --> 02:34:27.452
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

02:34:27.472 --> 02:34:29.213
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a highly scientific process.

02:34:29.253 --> 02:34:30.073
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to run down the list.

02:34:30.113 --> 02:34:32.654
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's some items that didn't make the list from chat.

02:34:32.714 --> 02:34:33.714
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really surprised at some of these.

02:34:34.054 --> 02:34:37.055
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100 Matt, the giggling lesbians didn't make the list tonight.

02:34:37.915 --> 02:34:39.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Chigger said Dame Edna, which we said.

02:34:41.876 --> 02:34:43.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was talking about the singer from D-Lite?

02:34:44.837 --> 02:34:47.317
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when he brought up Ooh La La.

02:34:47.397 --> 02:34:48.878
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole lawsuit and everything like that.

02:34:49.038 --> 02:34:50.298
[SPEAKER_01]: Lady Miss Keira Kirby.

02:34:51.138 --> 02:34:51.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:34:52.699 --> 02:34:53.619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.

02:34:53.659 --> 02:34:54.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody said ferret.

02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:56.280
[SPEAKER_06]: That surprised me as well.

02:34:59.001 --> 02:34:59.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:34:59.381 --> 02:34:59.961
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did we say?

02:35:00.061 --> 02:35:02.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Peep the Peep Jouster, says S. Jonah and Matt.

02:35:02.982 --> 02:35:05.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Needs more rappy, says Prince Brightstar.

02:35:05.984 --> 02:35:08.965
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't name a ferret because we respect the ferret too much.

02:35:10.305 --> 02:35:12.446
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, but guys, this list is too big.

02:35:12.867 --> 02:35:14.448
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to thin it down a little bit.

02:35:14.508 --> 02:35:16.729
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to go around the list.

02:35:16.769 --> 02:35:20.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Since there's so many people, please let me know if you got two of your items eliminated because I don't know who said what at this point.

02:35:21.152 --> 02:35:23.473
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.

02:35:23.533 --> 02:35:23.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

02:35:24.654 --> 02:35:34.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, a 32X with a frowny face.

02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:58.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Segata Senshiro II, A Forklift, Non-Silent Occupied Caprica, DarkSakura in a Sailor Suit and a Gun, All OLR Hosts in Bayonetta Cosplay, Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Loki in a Banana Hammock with a Purple Dildo Back, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an Amalgamation of All of Sonic's Shitty Friends.

02:35:59.633 --> 02:36:01.334
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this list is too big.

02:36:01.454 --> 02:36:03.995
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:36:04.747 --> 02:36:07.969
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's old and played out.

02:36:08.089 --> 02:36:10.150
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye non-silent occupied Caprica.

02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:12.551
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-silent occupied Caprica.

02:36:12.631 --> 02:36:13.711
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

02:36:13.752 --> 02:36:15.572
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have stayed if it was a bottle of Propel.

02:36:17.033 --> 02:36:18.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:36:19.114 --> 02:36:20.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock.

02:36:23.507 --> 02:36:24.508
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that was happening.

02:36:24.628 --> 02:36:26.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat.

02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:28.031
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

02:36:28.731 --> 02:36:29.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike.

02:36:29.712 --> 02:36:29.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait.

02:36:29.952 --> 02:36:30.573
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll go next.

02:36:31.093 --> 02:36:31.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

02:36:31.393 --> 02:36:32.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one am I going to strike from the list?

02:36:34.416 --> 02:36:41.161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura, but I'm going to remove Segata Senshiro II because, you know what?

02:36:41.341 --> 02:36:43.964
[SPEAKER_06]: A copy of something that's already out there is too easy.

02:36:44.144 --> 02:36:44.564
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

02:36:44.584 --> 02:36:46.406
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be too much awesome for the universe.

02:36:46.426 --> 02:36:49.128
[SPEAKER_05]: But then who are they going to base Segagaga 2 off of?

02:36:50.242 --> 02:36:50.582
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

02:36:50.982 --> 02:36:53.784
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't we not have... Except it would be nothing but bad decisions.

02:36:53.804 --> 02:36:55.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, not my problem.

02:36:55.124 --> 02:36:56.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, kids, not my problem.

02:36:57.045 --> 02:36:58.306
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

02:36:59.346 --> 02:37:01.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:37:01.567 --> 02:37:04.909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand Dickie the Pen, and so I don't wish to see it.

02:37:05.889 --> 02:37:06.350
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:07.550
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we should have said?

02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.871
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have said...

02:37:11.202 --> 02:37:11.823
[SPEAKER_01]: I just forgot it.

02:37:11.983 --> 02:37:12.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

02:37:27.497 --> 02:37:28.938
[SPEAKER_00]: am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?

02:37:29.418 --> 02:37:54.348
[SPEAKER_06]: yes you can if you must 32x with a frowny face is super depressing a 32x with a frowny face Tim has decided you know what I'm not feeling it anymore I would rather see an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends so it has been stricken from the list it should have the little quote bubble that says kill me I remember what it is I remember what the suggestion that we should have done was Pepsi Man Pepsi Man

02:37:56.261 --> 02:38:00.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, that means it is time to vote in tonight's list list.

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:03.486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to paste the list here in chat right now.

02:38:03.927 --> 02:38:08.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Send your number one and your number two answers via private message to Rob Roberts.

02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:10.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, your choices tonight.

02:38:10.712 --> 02:38:13.474
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System, the Sega Robot, President Cat,

02:38:13.954 --> 02:38:15.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Robertson and Bjork Swandress.

02:38:15.775 --> 02:38:16.436
[SPEAKER_03]: That stayed.

02:38:17.797 --> 02:38:18.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:38:18.858 --> 02:38:22.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Forklift, DarkSakura in a sailor suit and a gun.

02:38:22.801 --> 02:38:24.962
[SPEAKER_06]: All OLR hosts and Bayonetta cosplay.

02:38:25.623 --> 02:38:26.403
[SPEAKER_06]: That stayed.

02:38:26.884 --> 02:38:27.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:38:27.944 --> 02:38:29.325
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only eliminate one.

02:38:30.246 --> 02:38:39.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

02:38:40.416 --> 02:38:45.400
[SPEAKER_06]: Send your votes via private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two answers.

02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:52.367
[SPEAKER_06]: And to answer that question I see in chat right now from VSJSXV, why aren't we using the VOGnetwork.com poll for this?

02:38:52.827 --> 02:38:55.249
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm going to say is, soon.

02:38:56.671 --> 02:38:57.251
[SPEAKER_06]: but not tonight.

02:38:58.032 --> 02:39:01.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so send those votes in right now.

02:39:01.797 --> 02:39:04.139
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little later in the show.

02:39:04.199 --> 02:39:09.465
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt, I don't think that Konami would want to let go of their awesome lion to Sega.

02:39:11.047 --> 02:39:11.307
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:39:12.347 --> 02:39:15.268
[SPEAKER_06]: While I tally up those votes, I think we're going to take a... Dude, I miss Pepsi, man.

02:39:15.288 --> 02:39:17.249
[SPEAKER_01]: Those commercials were hilarious.

02:39:17.549 --> 02:39:17.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:39:18.329 --> 02:39:18.509
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:39:18.529 --> 02:39:20.830
[SPEAKER_06]: While I tally up those votes, we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.

02:39:21.310 --> 02:39:21.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.

02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:31.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag every week and dives in... What the hell is this shit?

02:39:31.653 --> 02:39:34.534
[SPEAKER_06]: ...and picks out some of her favorite emails to read.

02:39:34.934 --> 02:39:35.794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all sticky.

02:39:36.635 --> 02:39:37.655
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it's not powdery.

02:39:38.075 --> 02:39:40.656
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura, what emails are you going to read tonight?

02:39:41.405 --> 02:39:43.046
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I approve of how this one started.

02:39:43.106 --> 02:39:44.066
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Degenerate Johnny.

02:39:44.726 --> 02:39:46.667
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and salutations.

02:39:46.987 --> 02:39:49.628
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I have to do the Christian Slater voice from Heathers.

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:52.789
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and salutations, O Alarmy.

02:39:52.869 --> 02:39:54.449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

02:39:54.930 --> 02:39:59.171
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack of strong female lead characters in video games.

02:39:59.591 --> 02:40:05.073
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you've had the chance to watch Anita Sarkisian's... I know I pronounced that wrong.

02:40:05.593 --> 02:40:08.654
[SPEAKER_01]: Kickstarter video discussing the damsel in distress trope in games.

02:40:09.054 --> 02:40:10.435
[SPEAKER_01]: But it mentions the same topic.

02:40:10.655 --> 02:40:12.895
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not, I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.

02:40:13.956 --> 02:40:20.558
[SPEAKER_01]: While I do agree that feminism is moving at a snail's pace, the lack of diversity is becoming less common than it was ten years ago.

02:40:20.958 --> 02:40:29.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we see three-dimensional character development for both genders of all sexual orientations, such as Tony Prince, GTA 4, Samantha Trainor, and Mass Effect 3.

02:40:30.241 --> 02:40:40.265
[SPEAKER_01]: We even see strong female leads who evolve significantly throughout certain game series, such as a young, naive, independent summoner who learns how to become independent with goals of her own.

02:40:40.605 --> 02:40:43.707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm a guy that played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy X-2.

02:40:44.007 --> 02:40:45.047
[SPEAKER_01]: X-2, Rob!

02:40:46.408 --> 02:40:47.668
[SPEAKER_01]: Big whoop, wanna fight about it?

02:40:48.169 --> 02:40:48.889
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not judging you.

02:40:49.690 --> 02:41:00.188
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about interactive entertainment is that it promotes individualism over traditionalism, therefore the player is free to accept others regardless of their race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.

02:41:01.621 --> 02:41:16.853
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal society, but I believe that both the feminism and homosexual movement will progress faster once the traditionalist members of the baby boomer generation retire from the professional world.

02:41:17.273 --> 02:41:20.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I won't be present for tonight's show, I'm heading a card game tournament.

02:41:21.296 --> 02:41:21.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick their ass.

02:41:22.617 --> 02:41:25.279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in hearing your thought on this.

02:41:25.339 --> 02:41:27.240
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on 502 episodes.

02:41:27.661 --> 02:41:30.423
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well, army knight degenerate Johnny.

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is the thing about progress.

02:41:38.084 --> 02:41:41.687
[SPEAKER_01]: When people get it in their head that progress needs to happen, it will happen.

02:41:43.448 --> 02:41:45.909
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, the old guard's going to die out.

02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:48.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other thoughts, people?

02:41:50.672 --> 02:41:54.735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to admit I'm furiously counting votes over here, so can you summarize real quick for me?

02:41:55.487 --> 02:41:58.670
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's a lot more diversity in video games.

02:41:58.710 --> 02:42:00.812
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing more strong female leads come out.

02:42:01.412 --> 02:42:07.237
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically the old head up their ass baby boomer traditionalist people are going to die out.

02:42:07.937 --> 02:42:09.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not really playing video games anyway.

02:42:09.999 --> 02:42:10.199
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

02:42:10.239 --> 02:42:15.684
[SPEAKER_06]: But I worry about when I see these articles about how people believe that strong female leads won't sell.

02:42:16.444 --> 02:42:17.665
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me sick.

02:42:17.786 --> 02:42:20.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the statistic that 18% of people are playing FemShep.

02:42:21.008 --> 02:42:23.089
[SPEAKER_06]: We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.

02:42:23.249 --> 02:42:25.610
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what really surprised me about that?

02:42:25.951 --> 02:42:30.713
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about every bit of the fandom I've seen has been surrounding a female Shepard.

02:42:32.614 --> 02:42:38.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once or twice we'll see a fic with a male Shepard or fan art of BroShep.

02:42:39.697 --> 02:42:40.478
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just saying.

02:42:43.018 --> 02:42:43.318
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:42:44.999 --> 02:42:45.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

02:42:45.479 --> 02:42:46.979
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, someone we haven't heard from for a while, Rob.

02:42:47.899 --> 02:42:49.020
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, OLR Crew.

02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:52.580
[SPEAKER_01]: My email is directed towards Sky, who asked a simple question on episode 501.

02:42:53.361 --> 02:42:54.621
[SPEAKER_01]: What's coming to PlayStation Vita?

02:42:55.441 --> 02:43:00.962
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is found on Reddit, where users compiled a list of upcoming games, even those without set release dates.

02:43:01.062 --> 02:43:02.822
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the link so you can skim through the list.

02:43:03.163 --> 02:43:03.683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

02:43:03.923 --> 02:43:05.323
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hold on.

02:43:08.768 --> 02:43:09.370
[SPEAKER_01]: Freaking Reddit.

02:43:10.795 --> 02:43:12.822
[SPEAKER_01]: Guacamelee, which I kind of want to play.

02:43:13.886 --> 02:43:14.708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super good.

02:43:16.665 --> 02:43:39.473
[SPEAKER_01]: Draw Slasher, Soul Calibur, Broken Destiny, Zombie Tycoon 2, Velocity Ultra, Muramasa Rebirth, Jak and Daxter, Dragon's Crown, Tearaway, Batman, Arkham Origins, Blackgate, Final Fantasy X-2 HD, Divekick, a bunch of Oddworld stuff, Malicious Rebirth.

02:43:39.493 --> 02:43:44.055
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but I still don't think that... Oh, there's an Ys game on here, too.

02:43:46.969 --> 02:43:52.271
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that it's going to be enough to really save it unless they can pull a miracle out of their ass.

02:43:54.131 --> 02:43:57.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Sky, you have dabbled with games from your PlayStation.

02:43:57.152 --> 02:43:59.713
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, have you dabbled with games for your PlayStation Plus collection?

02:44:00.213 --> 02:44:06.675
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems a little unusual that you haven't brought up games from Plus that you haven't tried out before in the How Was Your Gaming Week segments.

02:44:07.035 --> 02:44:10.876
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea 3, The Cave, Closure, and others.

02:44:11.176 --> 02:44:11.956
[SPEAKER_01]: I did buy Closure.

02:44:12.696 --> 02:44:16.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny enough, I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3 ready to play.

02:44:16.121 --> 02:44:19.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't get to it this week because I had that other game to review.

02:44:19.206 --> 02:44:21.409
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.

02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:24.715
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cave specifically, I was curious in checking out.

02:44:24.755 --> 02:44:26.117
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully next week.

02:44:26.829 --> 02:44:28.551
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get closure, by the way, on Steam.

02:44:28.871 --> 02:44:29.672
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't played it yet.

02:44:30.793 --> 02:44:32.094
[SPEAKER_06]: So many games, so little time.

02:44:32.754 --> 02:44:34.636
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you for the feedback on the Vita.

02:44:35.477 --> 02:44:38.019
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see what comes at E3.

02:44:38.059 --> 02:44:39.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's going to be a huge thing as well.

02:44:40.021 --> 02:44:41.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the end of this email?

02:44:41.462 --> 02:44:42.423
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some Pinkberry.

02:44:42.823 --> 02:44:43.784
[SPEAKER_01]: The nasty canasta.

02:44:43.984 --> 02:44:44.425
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't?

02:44:44.925 --> 02:44:45.806
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some Pinkberry.

02:44:47.087 --> 02:44:47.968
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this one's kind of long.

02:44:48.849 --> 02:44:49.910
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR.

02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:57.113
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, by the way, guys, if I sound awful, I had an allergic reaction earlier, so.

02:44:57.153 --> 02:45:00.055
[SPEAKER_01]: I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago, basic set.

02:45:00.515 --> 02:45:02.396
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been having a somewhat good time with it.

02:45:02.796 --> 02:45:07.199
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already, I've already, I guess that should be got four games.

02:45:07.659 --> 02:45:08.359
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Bros.

02:45:08.579 --> 02:45:11.801
[SPEAKER_01]: U, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and Injustice Gods Among Us.

02:45:12.262 --> 02:45:16.044
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun system that the touchpad is taking a lot more getting used to.

02:45:16.644 --> 02:45:29.090
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably not be buying a lot of non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got pro controller or classic controller support, but it's proving to be not the embarrassing waste of time I thought it would be when the system came out.

02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:32.832
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping and fully expecting the system to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.

02:45:34.212 --> 02:45:40.637
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of, it seems that Nintendo bullying out of the huge dick-waving contest that is the Mega Press Conference.

02:45:41.257 --> 02:45:42.238
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bowing out, sorry.

02:45:43.959 --> 02:45:44.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we covered that earlier.

02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:49.523
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.

02:45:49.963 --> 02:45:51.424
[SPEAKER_01]: The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.

02:45:51.924 --> 02:45:55.387
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's sad that the gaming media is quick to bash on Nintendo.

02:45:55.747 --> 02:46:00.630
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but I was always under the impression that we won the games.

02:46:02.391 --> 02:46:02.611
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

02:46:03.892 --> 02:46:29.482
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of it do you guys feel it's just the people wanting to shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics whore choice versus legitimate concerns about the company I think there's a lot of bandwagon bashing but I my thing with press conferences or release of information I don't give a shit how they do it as long as they do something and we find out what it is I only care about the information I don't care how they put it out I just care that they do that's me

02:46:31.198 --> 02:46:31.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Music

02:46:53.410 --> 02:46:57.752
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the... I need to actually pick this instead of email.

02:46:58.152 --> 02:47:02.234
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, my next hardware purchase is coming around July, and that is the Retron 5.

02:47:02.574 --> 02:47:08.596
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles, but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure maximum compatibility.

02:47:10.057 --> 02:47:15.519
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 720p upscaling saves states and full-button customization for any controller you use on the thing.

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:18.360
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me to the question, where do you guys stand on retro gaming?

02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:25.005
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want all the modern accoutrements that are offered by emulators and will be offered by the Retro 5?

02:47:25.065 --> 02:47:28.347
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys intolerant of any deviation from the original play limitations?

02:47:28.808 --> 02:47:29.969
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, I can go either way.

02:47:30.509 --> 02:47:35.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Though with five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES, Genesis all at once.

02:47:36.234 --> 02:47:38.916
[SPEAKER_01]: And if only they can add in support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.

02:47:39.696 --> 02:47:40.557
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's it for the email.

02:47:40.577 --> 02:47:41.157
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for reading.

02:47:41.197 --> 02:47:42.198
[SPEAKER_01]: Regards, RawSteelUT.

02:47:43.259 --> 02:47:46.361
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my thought about it, because given that I am in a position of both,

02:47:47.162 --> 02:47:52.185
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not put in the do not give a shit category because it all depends on my mood.

02:47:52.925 --> 02:48:05.392
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how much I feel like digging through boxes to pull out one of the Super Nintendos and plug it in and then where to find our copy of Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid or...

02:48:06.773 --> 02:48:33.722
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to play things on the original console if given my if I had the perfect vault if we had everything hooked back up again switch boxes and everything yeah I would be totally playing it on the original console because I can safely say I likely have the original console but if it's a quick thing or I want to play like a Seiken Densetsu 3 and there's an amazing fan translation out but I don't have a ROM burner

02:48:34.662 --> 02:48:40.050
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll play the emulator I'm not really picky If it's the only way I have to play it I'll play me some Power Rangers

02:48:40.865 --> 02:48:40.945
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

02:48:40.965 --> 02:48:41.025
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Unboxed for about $150 on eBay.

02:49:12.402 --> 02:49:13.182
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be selling it.

02:49:14.243 --> 02:49:19.587
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like that chick that found the copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store and she's making bank off it.

02:49:20.327 --> 02:49:20.747
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for her.

02:49:20.767 --> 02:49:25.370
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole reason is that as much as we love the game, it's not going to be one that we're going to play a lot.

02:49:27.007 --> 02:49:33.591
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking at the collection, I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play Dracula X. Which is the correct choice to make.

02:49:34.512 --> 02:49:38.214
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I wish they would translate and re-burn on a CD?

02:49:39.375 --> 02:49:47.439
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sapphire was a great game, but Emerald Dragon was the RPG that came out on PC Engine Duo.

02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:49.521
[SPEAKER_05]: You just named a game I've never played.

02:49:50.381 --> 02:49:51.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.

02:49:52.122 --> 02:49:53.543
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.

02:49:54.477 --> 02:49:58.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, but I mean, I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.

02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:01.983
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends that for a little while worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.

02:50:03.184 --> 02:50:04.045
[SPEAKER_01]: She wouldn't lend it to me.

02:50:04.065 --> 02:50:05.746
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you're going to Japan, let me borrow it.

02:50:05.966 --> 02:50:06.226
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

02:50:07.407 --> 02:50:10.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me say this quickly about the back to the email with the emulators and all that.

02:50:11.390 --> 02:50:15.173
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do like, you know, the retro gaming when it's done right.

02:50:15.453 --> 02:50:18.456
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.

02:50:18.976 --> 02:50:23.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish companies in this day and age would do more, especially because, you know, we've shifted from...

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:24.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:45.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a better game.

02:51:11.134 --> 02:51:11.775
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:51:32.729 --> 02:51:35.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty rad that we can fire up a two-player game.

02:51:35.632 --> 02:51:37.533
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, again, I'm going to use Ice Climbers as an example.

02:51:37.873 --> 02:51:40.095
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we can do that anywhere.

02:51:40.155 --> 02:51:44.819
[SPEAKER_06]: We could sit in the car and play Ice Climber on 3DS.

02:51:45.479 --> 02:51:48.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, versus, thanks to Virtual Console.

02:51:48.382 --> 02:51:49.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I love that.

02:51:50.343 --> 02:51:55.868
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to just see that pushed forward a little faster because the technology's, you know, there to get it online and all that.

02:51:56.508 --> 02:51:56.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

02:51:57.884 --> 02:51:58.605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thoughts.

02:51:58.665 --> 02:51:59.485
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another email.

02:51:59.765 --> 02:52:01.046
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:52:02.728 --> 02:52:03.768
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from RallstillUT.

02:52:03.969 --> 02:52:05.450
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the last email.

02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:07.271
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, y'all.

02:52:08.272 --> 02:52:08.832
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say it right.

02:52:09.072 --> 02:52:09.613
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, y'all.

02:52:10.533 --> 02:52:10.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Howdy.

02:52:10.934 --> 02:52:11.914
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I say it myself.

02:52:12.695 --> 02:52:17.058
[SPEAKER_01]: I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox official store today and marveled at all the shit you can buy there.

02:52:17.578 --> 02:52:18.439
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, look it up.

02:52:18.499 --> 02:52:22.802
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an astounding variety of items with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste your money on.

02:52:23.983 --> 02:52:26.586
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an equivalent store for WoW memorabilia?

02:52:27.446 --> 02:52:27.727
[SPEAKER_01]: eBay.

02:52:28.968 --> 02:52:32.551
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a place online where I can blow my money on a wide variety of WoW shit?

02:52:33.112 --> 02:52:36.535
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a sticker with your flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.

02:52:37.056 --> 02:52:41.620
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing you use to get around in real life on the thing you use to get around in the real world?

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:43.081
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

02:52:43.361 --> 02:52:45.103
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay Black Redertainment Trainer.

02:52:46.905 --> 02:52:46.965
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

02:52:48.948 --> 02:52:52.311
[SPEAKER_01]: You know... There's the Jinx store.

02:52:52.571 --> 02:52:54.633
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Geek has a lot of WoW stuff.

02:52:55.013 --> 02:52:55.314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:52:56.495 --> 02:52:59.477
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a Blizzard company store.

02:53:00.218 --> 02:53:02.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Jinx is kind of like one of their official, I think, vendors.

02:53:03.181 --> 02:53:05.322
[SPEAKER_06]: They do a lot of that stuff.

02:53:05.343 --> 02:53:07.364
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're always at BlizzCon.

02:53:07.404 --> 02:53:09.426
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like J-Y-N-X, right?

02:53:09.666 --> 02:53:10.207
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

02:53:10.247 --> 02:53:10.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the drag queen?

02:53:11.208 --> 02:53:14.531
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.

02:53:15.612 --> 02:53:33.907
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say too that I think if you look on Etsy there's a lot of fan made items that are really good I mean and I know that there are people out there who will like there's artists out there who will do commissioned work of your character and your mount and

02:53:34.347 --> 02:53:35.288
[SPEAKER_01]: The Current Lich King

02:54:00.291 --> 02:54:00.672
[SPEAKER_06]: Artis?

02:54:00.752 --> 02:54:01.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Artis.

02:54:01.393 --> 02:54:01.853
[SPEAKER_01]: Bolvar?

02:54:02.214 --> 02:54:02.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:54:02.995 --> 02:54:06.079
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a picture of him on fire.

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:07.421
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

02:54:07.461 --> 02:54:08.582
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sitting on the throne.

02:54:08.722 --> 02:54:09.864
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just standing there on fire.

02:54:09.904 --> 02:54:10.725
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's called Lava Man.

02:54:11.106 --> 02:54:11.646
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have him.

02:54:12.327 --> 02:54:17.394
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have old actual Warcraft things, but all you need is the viewer and the ability to make the stickers.

02:54:17.634 --> 02:54:24.736
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also going to suggest, honestly, if your mall has a hot topic, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.

02:54:26.077 --> 02:54:33.199
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting props and things or stuff to put on your wall, check with cosplay distributors.

02:54:33.699 --> 02:54:35.040
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can get stuff there too.

02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:36.080
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who make weapons.

02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:39.541
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.

02:54:40.262 --> 02:54:42.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's that printer?

02:54:42.743 --> 02:54:45.044
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a couple grand, but it's like an at-home 3D printer.

02:54:45.064 --> 02:54:46.044
[SPEAKER_00]: It's MakerBot?

02:54:46.145 --> 02:54:46.705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, MakerBot.

02:54:47.325 --> 02:54:50.967
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think people have done insignias and things for MakerBot.

02:54:50.987 --> 02:54:55.969
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also buy a monthly membership to TechShop and use their fancy ones.

02:54:56.129 --> 02:55:03.413
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that actually the school I go to now is going to be getting a 3D printer in the next couple years for the art design lab.

02:55:05.519 --> 02:55:18.753
[SPEAKER_06]: all right uh if that's it for the emails tonight yes indeed it is let's go to the FUs of the week it's a chance for us to be angsty because you know for 502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst on this show

02:55:34.699 --> 02:55:36.640
[SPEAKER_01]: My F you goes to the pizza, actually.

02:55:37.361 --> 02:55:38.821
[SPEAKER_01]: To Papa Murphy's pizza in general.

02:55:39.162 --> 02:55:42.784
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is actually the third time I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's pizza.

02:55:43.584 --> 02:55:45.585
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a different kind of pizza every time.

02:55:46.345 --> 02:55:50.308
[SPEAKER_01]: And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to swell, my throat itched.

02:55:51.028 --> 02:55:52.609
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry, because it's so good.

02:55:53.169 --> 02:55:59.493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining about how delicious the pizza was, but I was sitting here having... And, by the way, thank you for the medical.

02:55:59.813 --> 02:56:02.915
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting here, like, literally having one of those, like...

02:56:03.943 --> 02:56:07.605
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird allergic reactions with the rash and everything, and I'm like, oh my god.

02:56:07.625 --> 02:56:09.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank god Tim brings us drugs.

02:56:09.687 --> 02:56:10.447
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.

02:56:10.507 --> 02:56:11.167
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

02:56:11.848 --> 02:56:18.532
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, this is the third time I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's and Reacted to it.

02:56:19.272 --> 02:56:21.093
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't think I'll be eating here again.

02:56:22.514 --> 02:56:22.794
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

02:56:23.635 --> 02:56:27.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, United States Postal Service, for just chilling on my package.

02:56:28.418 --> 02:56:30.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just, you know, delivering my package.

02:56:30.299 --> 02:56:31.579
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually that's what you want people to do.

02:56:33.647 --> 02:56:34.788
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't want them to chill.

02:56:34.828 --> 02:56:36.489
[SPEAKER_08]: You want them to fucking move around.

02:56:37.249 --> 02:56:42.673
[SPEAKER_08]: You want them to be getting close to, you know, delivering the package.

02:56:45.815 --> 02:56:49.837
[SPEAKER_08]: And said no, they're just like... You want them to make that delivery.

02:56:50.318 --> 02:56:50.898
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

02:56:51.218 --> 02:56:52.059
[SPEAKER_08]: Make the delivery.

02:56:52.959 --> 02:56:53.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Get moving!

02:56:56.802 --> 02:56:57.863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my, ooh yeah!

02:56:57.943 --> 02:56:58.063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

02:57:02.913 --> 02:57:08.922
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the crappy heat here in Sacramento today, because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market, but it was just too hot.

02:57:09.983 --> 02:57:14.145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go bargain hunting for video games in October.

02:57:14.365 --> 02:57:18.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly with those two Sega prototype systems.

02:57:18.246 --> 02:57:21.248
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going for like multi-grand on eBay.

02:57:21.428 --> 02:57:22.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Bought for a dollar.

02:57:22.628 --> 02:57:23.428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

02:57:23.889 --> 02:57:25.829
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?

02:57:25.849 --> 02:57:27.070
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where Trader Dan's was.

02:57:27.290 --> 02:57:27.610
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.

02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:31.872
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have a really hard time finding the good game sales at the flea market.

02:57:31.892 --> 02:57:34.573
[SPEAKER_06]: You find some stuff at the flea market still, though.

02:57:34.633 --> 02:57:34.993
[SPEAKER_01]: You do.

02:57:35.013 --> 02:57:38.354
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet Trader Dan's started back up on eBay, though.

02:57:38.955 --> 02:57:39.355
[SPEAKER_01]: I would bet.

02:57:40.496 --> 02:57:42.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:57:45.239 --> 02:57:48.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim for preferring Super Mario Bros.

02:57:48.761 --> 02:58:02.031
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 to Super Mario World and Rage quitting on me when we played Super Mario World and you for making me play Ice Climber Deal with it Alright, Tim, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:58:02.231 --> 02:58:07.775
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, it was a related note Fuck you, Magikoopa I am done with your shit

02:58:10.011 --> 02:58:10.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

02:58:12.312 --> 02:58:12.632
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:58:14.453 --> 02:58:18.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us do a couple more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit.

02:58:18.534 --> 02:58:21.475
[SPEAKER_06]: We are running super long tonight, though, so I'm sorry.

02:58:21.495 --> 02:58:23.276
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to abbreviate some of the end of the show here.

02:58:23.676 --> 02:58:25.716
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's at least get these news stories out of the way.

02:58:25.756 --> 02:58:26.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:58:26.237 --> 02:58:32.659
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened, and some of your big franchises have gone to, well, mainly Nordic games.

02:58:32.739 --> 02:58:34.739
[SPEAKER_08]: They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.

02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:37.300
[SPEAKER_08]: And five games, guess what they get drawn to life?

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:38.561
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:46.687
[SPEAKER_08]: and then Gearbox actually got a hold of the Homeworld franchise.

02:58:47.508 --> 02:58:49.730
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that they were trying to buy via crowdfunding.

02:58:51.772 --> 02:58:59.939
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nord Games actually has been working with THQ for a while now talking sequels and they're hopefully going to get the same developers back on board.

02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:05.784
[SPEAKER_08]: Also they purchased MX vs. ATV and Titan Quest were the other two franchises they bought.

02:59:06.244 --> 02:59:25.102
[SPEAKER_08]: And then THQ sold all this money to a lot of people, including Double Fine, Codemasters for F1, and hell, they even own Ruben some money because different, I guess, bonuses or whatever.

02:59:25.163 --> 02:59:26.564
[SPEAKER_08]: Employee obligations, they said.

02:59:29.983 --> 02:59:33.445
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys tonight, and I think this is very interesting.

02:59:33.505 --> 02:59:39.689
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner, but lately we've talked about a lot of crappy games.

02:59:40.409 --> 02:59:48.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I shouldn't say necessarily they're crappy games, because there's still people that love them, but games that get a crappy reputation based on the internet.

02:59:49.074 --> 02:59:53.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Games such as SimCity, Mass Effect 3 and the ending.

02:59:53.936 --> 02:59:56.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Aliens, Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem Forever.

02:59:56.278 --> 02:59:56.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

02:59:56.918 --> 03:00:02.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Before all of that, there was E.T., the extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.

03:00:03.502 --> 03:00:07.285
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, when I was seven, it wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be.

03:00:07.305 --> 03:00:10.067
[SPEAKER_06]: But the most frustrating thing was you always fell in the damn pit, right?

03:00:10.647 --> 03:00:11.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

03:00:12.148 --> 03:00:16.831
[SPEAKER_06]: A hacker went back and fixed some of the problems people have with the game.

03:00:17.211 --> 03:00:19.613
[SPEAKER_06]: And now people are like, this game's not so bad.

03:00:19.673 --> 03:00:20.473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun.

03:00:20.893 --> 03:00:22.374
[SPEAKER_06]: So what were the things that were changed?

03:00:22.414 --> 03:00:26.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for one, they made ET an actual ET color instead of, you know, that green.

03:00:27.397 --> 03:00:31.559
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, they fixed the falling in the pit all the time.

03:00:31.599 --> 03:00:37.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of one pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different collision detection, which makes it far less frustrating.

03:00:37.703 --> 03:00:39.424
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not always falling in that stupid pit.

03:00:40.505 --> 03:00:46.674
[SPEAKER_06]: So, now just so you guys know, Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game and he was really rushed for time.

03:00:46.854 --> 03:00:51.120
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lot of the movie tie-in games were at the time, he only had months to make it.

03:00:51.281 --> 03:00:53.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing happened with Pac-Man and why that turned out so bad too.

03:00:54.706 --> 03:00:55.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that funny?

03:00:55.347 --> 03:00:56.088
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man was awful.

03:00:56.388 --> 03:00:57.388
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:01:17.755 --> 03:01:23.541
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, neocomputer.org is the one that made the project that tried to fix some of E.T.'

03:01:23.521 --> 03:01:24.542
[SPEAKER_06]: 's problems.

03:01:25.022 --> 03:01:32.269
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe the project ended up getting done by David Richardson, who goes by the handle Recompile.

03:01:32.770 --> 03:01:33.691
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty cool.

03:01:34.332 --> 03:01:35.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, from Atari Age.

03:01:35.333 --> 03:01:40.301
[SPEAKER_06]: He single-handedly, I guess, maybe this, like, started the discussion there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.

03:01:40.841 --> 03:01:49.054
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, fixed the well, fixed the difficulty settings, so, like, not every step will drain your energy, and some of this stuff.

03:01:49.114 --> 03:01:49.615
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh...

03:01:50.055 --> 03:01:50.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty cool.

03:01:50.896 --> 03:01:53.418
[SPEAKER_06]: And it even showed tutorial videos and how they did it.

03:01:53.978 --> 03:01:59.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself, they give you the addresses and what to change in the hex editor.

03:01:59.883 --> 03:02:04.166
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet somebody like you is like, well, I mean, I know you don't hack a lot of Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fascinating.

03:02:04.186 --> 03:02:05.727
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the one that's already done.

03:02:05.767 --> 03:02:06.808
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download the ROM, I think.

03:02:06.948 --> 03:02:07.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

03:02:08.429 --> 03:02:09.050
[SPEAKER_08]: But very cool.

03:02:10.972 --> 03:02:14.095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like how people will hack SimCity to play offline.

03:02:15.336 --> 03:02:17.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Or fix alien colonial marines.

03:02:17.899 --> 03:02:19.200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just funny.

03:02:19.821 --> 03:02:20.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

03:02:21.823 --> 03:02:23.705
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the official stories we have tonight.

03:02:24.586 --> 03:02:26.707
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me open up the Skype line.

03:02:26.727 --> 03:02:30.611
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

03:02:30.931 --> 03:02:32.973
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go ahead and give us a call, that would be awesome.

03:02:34.794 --> 03:02:44.463
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show tonight or something you think we missed, what you've been playing, you have a question for Captain Spike or Tim and want to talk about whatever, give us a call.

03:02:44.783 --> 03:02:45.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello.

03:02:45.163 --> 03:02:48.006
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:48.366 --> 03:02:48.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Last Minute Stories

03:03:11.770 --> 03:03:17.373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that... Again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say Batman sucks because they're adding multiplayer to it.

03:03:17.393 --> 03:03:19.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Mass Effect 3, it was fine.

03:03:19.695 --> 03:03:21.195
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love the multiplayer Mass Effect 3.

03:03:21.556 --> 03:03:29.980
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand where people have some great reservations, especially hearing it's a new studio and now all this other... It kind of sounds like they're trying to do this one on the cheap.

03:03:31.001 --> 03:03:32.502
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a big concern.

03:03:35.988 --> 03:03:37.990
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?

03:03:38.490 --> 03:03:39.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree.

03:03:39.131 --> 03:03:39.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

03:03:40.052 --> 03:03:43.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, because Arkham City is so fucking good.

03:03:43.615 --> 03:03:48.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this next game, to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be a step above that.

03:03:48.479 --> 03:03:52.002
[SPEAKER_06]: When you hear things like this, you kind of go, not sure if want.

03:03:54.003 --> 03:03:54.344
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

03:03:54.384 --> 03:03:55.865
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure E3's going to answer a lot of that.

03:03:56.305 --> 03:03:56.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

03:03:56.706 --> 03:04:01.009
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call.

03:04:01.070 --> 03:04:01.470
[SPEAKER_06]: All one word.

03:04:02.373 --> 03:04:12.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says the reason why the new Batman game has a younger version actor is because the game takes place years before Arkham Asylum, it's a prequel that's why they went with somebody younger

03:04:33.805 --> 03:04:34.985
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's an excuse.

03:04:35.005 --> 03:04:38.506
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a voice actor.

03:04:39.306 --> 03:04:43.047
[SPEAKER_05]: He's played younger Batman in different animated series and what have you.

03:04:43.087 --> 03:04:44.607
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been doing this voice a long time.

03:04:44.627 --> 03:04:45.727
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very good.

03:04:45.867 --> 03:04:47.868
[SPEAKER_06]: They also didn't hear your mic off or something?

03:04:48.368 --> 03:04:53.289
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done Teenage Bruce Wayne and did a wonderfully believable job.

03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:55.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got a phone call here.

03:04:55.529 --> 03:04:56.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:04:56.789 --> 03:04:57.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, buddy?

03:05:03.390 --> 03:05:03.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

03:05:04.770 --> 03:05:05.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not a whole lot.

03:05:06.091 --> 03:05:08.712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, hanging in there.

03:05:09.392 --> 03:05:10.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what did you want to call us about tonight?

03:05:13.133 --> 03:05:18.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had a, uh... Hang on, let me mute my... Are you here?

03:05:18.455 --> 03:05:20.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you forget to mute your radio before you called in?

03:05:23.016 --> 03:05:23.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was trying to.

03:05:23.936 --> 03:05:24.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot, sorry.

03:05:25.017 --> 03:05:25.817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I had a, uh...

03:05:33.396 --> 03:05:38.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah, I want to... Wait, didn't DarkSakura have dibs on that?

03:05:38.337 --> 03:05:39.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Something with La Mulana on Steam?

03:05:39.677 --> 03:05:39.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

03:05:39.917 --> 03:05:42.478
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want it.

03:05:42.678 --> 03:05:44.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was like, if she ain't taking it, I'm taking it.

03:05:44.938 --> 03:05:45.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, I want to play it.

03:05:45.998 --> 03:05:47.858
[SPEAKER_01]: I came super close to buying it until I remembered.

03:05:48.379 --> 03:05:49.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

03:05:49.259 --> 03:05:57.260
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Well, as much as I would love to give a key away to the listeners, I think we want to kind of keep it for ourselves.

03:05:57.320 --> 03:06:02.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, but I want to play... Only because you rave about it so much do we want to play it for ourselves.

03:06:05.546 --> 03:06:07.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should we all be playing La Mulana?

03:06:07.368 --> 03:06:12.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a fun game.

03:06:12.532 --> 03:06:18.296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, those old school games were tough, but, you know.

03:06:19.277 --> 03:06:23.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but isn't La Mulana like Asshole Mario Hard?

03:06:26.278 --> 03:06:29.599
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be, but once you get the hang of it.

03:06:29.899 --> 03:06:31.859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just memorizing patterns, just like old Mega Man games.

03:06:31.879 --> 03:06:32.359
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

03:06:32.699 --> 03:06:38.400
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be magnanimous and donate that code to you.

03:06:38.880 --> 03:06:39.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

03:06:40.741 --> 03:06:50.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, DarkTetsuya, I thank you very much for donating the code to us and feeding our gaming addiction further.

03:06:50.842 --> 03:06:54.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in the chatroom says, La Mulana is your Mass Effect.

03:06:54.443 --> 03:06:54.663
[SPEAKER_06]: True?

03:06:56.018 --> 03:06:57.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet he doesn't have tarantula.

03:06:57.099 --> 03:06:58.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I suppose so.

03:06:59.701 --> 03:06:59.961
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:07:00.242 --> 03:07:03.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dr. Suya, is there anything else you want to talk with us about tonight?

03:07:06.527 --> 03:07:08.148
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a question.

03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

03:07:10.570 --> 03:07:13.453
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was planning on Best of Three.

03:07:14.173 --> 03:07:14.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

03:07:14.774 --> 03:07:15.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

03:07:16.455 --> 03:07:21.860
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of need Episode 169 to finish working on it.

03:07:23.554 --> 03:07:28.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for, um, uh, is this, this is the, um, the, is this the DDR step file stuff?

03:07:30.521 --> 03:07:33.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's the, uh, Best Hits compilation.

03:07:33.344 --> 03:07:35.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you, you need episode 169?

03:07:35.326 --> 03:07:36.427
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have that?

03:07:36.447 --> 03:07:36.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's at 159.

03:07:41.008 --> 03:07:41.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-uh.

03:08:07.219 --> 03:08:07.841
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big deal.

03:08:08.202 --> 03:08:08.964
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:08:09.025 --> 03:08:10.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, DarkSakura, we're going to let you go to get more calls.

03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:11.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, okay?

03:08:12.435 --> 03:08:13.077
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:08:13.097 --> 03:08:13.558
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

03:08:15.086 --> 03:08:18.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, he had some type of echo going on in the background and it kind of made it hard for me to hear.

03:08:18.467 --> 03:08:20.208
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he didn't really mute the computer.

03:08:20.688 --> 03:08:22.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he had the TV on in the background.

03:08:22.268 --> 03:08:24.029
[SPEAKER_06]: He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.

03:08:25.189 --> 03:08:25.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn that show.

03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:28.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to us at the same time.

03:08:28.950 --> 03:08:30.631
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, though, I did find a character I like.

03:08:31.391 --> 03:08:31.811
[SPEAKER_01]: Daenerys.

03:08:32.311 --> 03:08:33.632
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she sets people on fire.

03:08:35.752 --> 03:08:39.494
[SPEAKER_08]: She inquires about the location of her dragons.

03:08:39.514 --> 03:08:43.135
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

03:08:43.175 --> 03:08:44.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, can you talk again?

03:08:45.572 --> 03:08:47.953
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking and my mic is not working.

03:08:47.993 --> 03:08:49.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Why has your mic just suddenly stopped working?

03:08:49.873 --> 03:08:50.593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

03:08:51.093 --> 03:08:53.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your board is possessed.

03:08:53.954 --> 03:08:55.154
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just needs to be dusted.

03:08:55.214 --> 03:08:56.634
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of gray.

03:08:56.654 --> 03:09:01.315
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if our board might just be... I mean, we've had that board six years now.

03:09:03.956 --> 03:09:05.356
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a damn expensive board.

03:09:05.396 --> 03:09:06.176
[SPEAKER_01]: It should last.

03:09:07.217 --> 03:09:07.577
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

03:09:07.637 --> 03:09:08.217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

03:09:08.817 --> 03:09:09.617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the reality.

03:09:09.657 --> 03:09:10.537
[SPEAKER_06]: We might need something else.

03:09:10.997 --> 03:09:12.258
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.

03:09:12.558 --> 03:09:13.378
[SPEAKER_01]: The contacts need to be

03:09:14.184 --> 03:09:15.125
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work on it.

03:09:15.945 --> 03:09:16.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio.

03:09:16.645 --> 03:09:17.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't it a blast?

03:09:17.306 --> 03:09:23.189
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we didn't learn that we were going to have audio problems until like Bobby's call tonight.

03:09:23.209 --> 03:09:24.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really, right?

03:09:24.490 --> 03:09:24.790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:09:25.851 --> 03:09:28.032
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to just leave it open a little longer for another call.

03:09:28.052 --> 03:09:30.434
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype.

03:09:30.594 --> 03:09:32.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

03:09:33.535 --> 03:09:37.557
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to quickly try to comb the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

03:09:38.737 --> 03:09:40.078
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sending us a tweet.

03:09:40.258 --> 03:09:43.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Eve Online getting a TV show based on real player stories.

03:09:44.459 --> 03:09:46.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is doing?

03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:50.542
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Eve Online, of course, is an MMO that's been around for a while.

03:09:50.582 --> 03:09:52.862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that whole space one.

03:09:52.902 --> 03:09:53.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the one where...

03:09:54.443 --> 03:10:01.527
[SPEAKER_06]: They had all that loot of game time cards that were on a ship and the ship exploded and all that money is just gone.

03:10:02.967 --> 03:10:05.849
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, EVE Online is going to get a TV show based on the stories and game.

03:10:05.869 --> 03:10:06.429
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:09.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if they turned fanfic into TV shows?

03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:11.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's essentially what they're saying here.

03:10:11.632 --> 03:10:14.313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

03:10:14.333 --> 03:10:16.354
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.

03:10:17.695 --> 03:10:18.595
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that.

03:10:19.855 --> 03:10:21.578
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for creepy Shaga.

03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:24.142
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that really upset me.

03:10:24.162 --> 03:10:25.203
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so date rapey.

03:10:25.443 --> 03:10:25.984
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

03:10:27.466 --> 03:10:29.109
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt dirty watching it on YouTube.

03:10:31.661 --> 03:10:32.602
[SPEAKER_01]: Just filthy.

03:10:34.343 --> 03:10:34.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

03:10:34.903 --> 03:10:40.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Also at Twitter.com slash OLR a tweet from Actdeft.

03:10:41.367 --> 03:10:44.409
[SPEAKER_06]: The third Skullgirls DLC character voting has ended.

03:10:44.449 --> 03:10:47.811
[SPEAKER_06]: The fans chose Eliza, an Egyptian-based character.

03:10:48.231 --> 03:10:50.773
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the brony community.

03:10:51.613 --> 03:10:53.694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised that Actdeft's reporting on this.

03:10:53.854 --> 03:10:56.896
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot, actually.

03:10:56.996 --> 03:10:57.356
[SPEAKER_01]: Brony?

03:10:57.576 --> 03:10:58.196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Skullgirls.

03:10:58.276 --> 03:10:58.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Skullgirls?

03:10:58.977 --> 03:10:59.217
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

03:10:59.737 --> 03:11:02.238
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.

03:11:02.319 --> 03:11:03.899
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great alliance that they made.

03:11:03.919 --> 03:11:05.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:07.081
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's Twitter topics.

03:11:07.101 --> 03:11:09.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

03:11:11.403 --> 03:11:12.164
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's calling.

03:11:12.404 --> 03:11:13.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody wants to say hi.

03:11:13.524 --> 03:11:14.025
[SPEAKER_06]: How sad.

03:11:14.485 --> 03:11:15.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, call us.

03:11:16.926 --> 03:11:18.247
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't yell at you much.

03:11:18.687 --> 03:11:20.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream in chat says that's who they voted for.

03:11:21.786 --> 03:11:25.408
[SPEAKER_08]: So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting a Kickstarter.

03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:26.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, here, here.

03:11:26.970 --> 03:11:29.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, no, she read that during the Rapid Fire News.

03:11:29.051 --> 03:11:29.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

03:11:29.671 --> 03:11:33.334
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to remind everybody to kickstart it when it actually comes online.

03:11:33.514 --> 03:11:34.495
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the real thing.

03:11:34.515 --> 03:11:35.715
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

03:11:36.836 --> 03:11:38.637
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be Kunio or it's nothing else.

03:11:38.718 --> 03:11:40.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Among the Sleep looks awesome.

03:11:40.679 --> 03:11:41.559
[SPEAKER_08]: I kickstarted that one.

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:49.005
[SPEAKER_08]: Among the Sleep, it's the one, it's a survivor horror, the horror game where you play as a two-year-old from the perspective of a two-year-old.

03:11:49.025 --> 03:11:49.705
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:11:50.065 --> 03:11:51.046
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play the hell out of that.

03:11:51.601 --> 03:11:54.043
[SPEAKER_08]: Kickstarting, right now, they need money It's not over yet

03:12:16.511 --> 03:12:19.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, our listeners are being shy tonight.

03:12:19.273 --> 03:12:19.734
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, come on.

03:12:19.754 --> 03:12:20.394
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them one more chance.

03:12:20.535 --> 03:12:21.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more chance.

03:12:21.375 --> 03:12:25.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave it open a little bit longer here.

03:12:25.559 --> 03:12:26.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't do... Thank you.

03:12:26.700 --> 03:12:27.460
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we can fill time.

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:28.041
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, listless.

03:12:28.281 --> 03:12:29.102
[SPEAKER_06]: Listless results.

03:12:29.122 --> 03:12:30.163
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't do Twitter topics, did you?

03:12:30.283 --> 03:12:30.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

03:12:30.883 --> 03:12:32.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

03:12:32.685 --> 03:12:33.445
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't paying attention.

03:12:33.646 --> 03:12:34.026
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

03:12:34.466 --> 03:12:35.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's out of it tonight.

03:12:35.607 --> 03:12:39.270
[SPEAKER_06]: These sound problems just snowballed into LOL.

03:12:39.631 --> 03:12:41.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go over listless results now.

03:12:44.056 --> 03:12:45.658
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why I didn't do listless results?

03:12:45.678 --> 03:12:47.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in my head, I already know.

03:12:47.079 --> 03:12:48.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I already tabulated them up.

03:12:48.961 --> 03:12:49.582
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

03:12:49.622 --> 03:12:51.163
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't live in your head, thank God.

03:12:51.404 --> 03:12:54.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, the definitive list as voted on by the listeners.

03:12:54.687 --> 03:12:56.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Mascot, we are going to donate to Sega.

03:12:57.048 --> 03:13:01.470
[SPEAKER_06]: In a close fourth place, worth mentioning, Master System the Sega Robot.

03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:03.991
[SPEAKER_06]: In a very close fourth place.

03:13:04.612 --> 03:13:08.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the way the listeners voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to say.

03:13:08.733 --> 03:13:10.674
[SPEAKER_06]: So I cannot argue with this at all.

03:13:11.155 --> 03:13:11.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three.

03:13:12.355 --> 03:13:15.196
[SPEAKER_06]: The number three answer for mascot we will donate to Sega.

03:13:15.657 --> 03:13:18.278
[SPEAKER_06]: An amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

03:13:19.358 --> 03:13:20.519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one I would have voted for.

03:13:21.141 --> 03:13:22.102
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is, number three.

03:13:22.782 --> 03:13:27.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, as voted by the listeners, President Cat.

03:13:27.645 --> 03:13:28.726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

03:13:28.746 --> 03:13:29.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough, fair enough.

03:13:29.607 --> 03:13:30.387
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you, Rina.

03:13:30.767 --> 03:13:36.331
[SPEAKER_06]: And the number one answer of mascot, we will, and I don't know how we're going to do this.

03:13:36.391 --> 03:13:39.333
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I can get somebody to put together a little clip art, something for us.

03:13:39.373 --> 03:13:41.875
[SPEAKER_06]: We can actually send this to Sega, like a nice little envelope.

03:13:42.275 --> 03:13:49.120
[SPEAKER_06]: The number one answer that we will gift on behalf of OLR, a forklift, ladies and gentlemen.

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:50.901
[SPEAKER_06]: A forklift.

03:13:52.362 --> 03:13:53.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I approve.

03:13:53.882 --> 03:13:55.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the forklift have a name?

03:13:55.303 --> 03:13:58.364
[SPEAKER_00]: A forklift one out of all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?

03:13:58.724 --> 03:13:59.004
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

03:13:59.665 --> 03:14:00.225
[SPEAKER_00]: And Loki.

03:14:00.525 --> 03:14:01.085
[SPEAKER_01]: Forky.

03:14:02.406 --> 03:14:04.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Forky the forklift.

03:14:04.927 --> 03:14:05.447
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

03:14:06.228 --> 03:14:06.708
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll draw it.

03:14:07.008 --> 03:14:10.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't the name be QQQQ so it's Forky the forklift?

03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:13.051
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's great.

03:14:14.311 --> 03:14:15.432
[SPEAKER_01]: Forky the forklift.

03:14:15.852 --> 03:14:17.052
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he comes into that song.

03:14:17.072 --> 03:14:17.733
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Taku.

03:14:21.792 --> 03:14:22.433
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is.

03:14:22.453 --> 03:14:23.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Your winner of the list tonight.

03:14:23.533 --> 03:14:28.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give that disapproving... It's funny and you know it.

03:14:28.497 --> 03:14:29.658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my default look.

03:14:30.078 --> 03:14:30.819
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so mean.

03:14:34.241 --> 03:14:35.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I wish it were a TV show.

03:14:35.562 --> 03:14:38.324
[SPEAKER_01]: Dungeon Buster wants to see the forklift fight the Daytona car.

03:14:38.344 --> 03:14:40.106
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

03:14:40.126 --> 03:14:41.267
[SPEAKER_01]: The forklift would fight dirty.

03:14:42.808 --> 03:14:44.629
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just get under the car and flip it.

03:14:45.229 --> 03:14:48.532
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Daytona car has the power of AM2 behind it.

03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:52.321
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

03:14:52.461 --> 03:14:52.761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:14:53.362 --> 03:14:55.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the Skype line not lighting up.

03:14:55.123 --> 03:14:56.044
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with y'all?

03:14:56.704 --> 03:14:58.145
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to close it.

03:14:58.206 --> 03:14:58.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

03:14:58.626 --> 03:14:59.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Skype screwed up.

03:14:59.707 --> 03:15:00.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

03:15:00.347 --> 03:15:01.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is screwed up on a nice show.

03:15:01.928 --> 03:15:02.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not Skype?

03:15:02.409 --> 03:15:03.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not Skype?

03:15:03.149 --> 03:15:03.450
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:07.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is about going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:15:07.333 --> 03:15:11.156
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we go around and get all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests for being here tonight.

03:15:11.876 --> 03:15:14.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.

03:15:15.786 --> 03:15:17.367
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to have you do it.

03:15:18.908 --> 03:15:20.169
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that you liked my gift.

03:15:21.130 --> 03:15:22.071
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you very much.

03:15:22.091 --> 03:15:24.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to slap you when we get home tonight.

03:15:25.793 --> 03:15:27.414
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a little TMI?

03:15:27.515 --> 03:15:29.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, you guys.

03:15:30.016 --> 03:15:33.939
[SPEAKER_06]: But good luck with whatever it is you guys are working on next.

03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:38.102
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for talking about how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.

03:15:38.382 --> 03:15:39.143
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, it was my pleasure.

03:15:39.763 --> 03:15:43.446
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a Twitter or anything you might... If listeners want to follow you further or whatever...

03:15:43.982 --> 03:16:10.321
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I Tim TRP at Twitter I'm sort of Tim TRP at everything because I have no imagination if you have any more questions for me or questions about you know getting into the game industry or whatever I'm happy to happy to talk to you about it all right awesome I'll be sure to give you my resume Captain Spike it's about fucking time you came back to the show thanks for being here I literally haven't seen you in years even if you are so mean to me all of the time but that's all right

03:16:10.521 --> 03:16:12.042
[SPEAKER_05]: I am mean to you all the time.

03:16:12.282 --> 03:16:14.242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my second favorite thing to do.

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:16.683
[SPEAKER_06]: But it comes out of a place of love, or at least it better.

03:16:18.164 --> 03:16:19.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we can go with that.

03:16:19.884 --> 03:16:20.384
[SPEAKER_06]: You dick.

03:16:20.464 --> 03:16:20.744
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:16:22.265 --> 03:16:24.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear your own show.

03:16:25.406 --> 03:16:29.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's terribly... Which I take back every nice thing I said about it earlier in the show.

03:16:29.627 --> 03:16:32.468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been tonight.

03:16:33.068 --> 03:16:36.890
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the off chance anyone does care, gamebuoy.org...

03:16:38.684 --> 03:16:59.626
[SPEAKER_05]: gaming news and views that aren't on your radar but maybe should be we'd really appreciate the hits and I just want to say so much thank all three of you so much for having me here tonight it's actually been quite a bit of fun and I really do wish it hadn't been like seven years since last time I was on well make better and come back on a more regular basis at some point I would love to fantastic love it

03:17:00.086 --> 03:17:00.366
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:17:01.506 --> 03:17:04.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop tonight.

03:17:06.088 --> 03:17:07.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, who doesn't have a microphone?

03:17:07.728 --> 03:17:09.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

03:17:09.589 --> 03:17:10.909
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish my microphone worked.

03:17:12.290 --> 03:17:12.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

03:17:13.570 --> 03:17:14.810
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:17:15.051 --> 03:17:16.231
[SPEAKER_01]: My throat feels like a desert.

03:17:17.251 --> 03:17:20.392
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought tonight is haters to the left.

03:17:23.873 --> 03:17:26.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, your final thought tonight?

03:17:28.555 --> 03:17:29.695
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you so much.

03:17:31.912 --> 03:17:36.034
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, Tim, your final thoughts tonight?

03:17:36.435 --> 03:17:42.838
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ate some potato chips that taste like they're Doritos, and they taste like Doritos tacos.

03:17:43.459 --> 03:17:45.400
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the computer science world, we call that recursion.

03:17:47.412 --> 03:17:48.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Recursive Chips.

03:17:50.274 --> 03:17:50.554

03:18:05.803 --> 03:18:06.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Shade that wave.

03:18:07.123 --> 03:18:08.244
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally judging right now.

03:18:09.151 --> 03:18:10.513
