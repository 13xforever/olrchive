Tonight April 14th, 2013

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Could Capcom be ending HD fighting game remakes?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Level 5 is set to work on a Playstation 4 game

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And could one government be investigating in-app sales?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are live!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight episode number 500

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For this April the 14th of 2013

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And I'm here with you every week for this very long, long, long time with my co-host

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you Jamie?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm caffeinated now, now I can start drinking

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You've had coffee

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now bring on the booze

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bring on the booze

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Bring it on

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I brought a bottle of pre-made mimosa

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Nice

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What is pre-made mimosa?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It means that you don't have to buy orange juice and champagne separately

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How lazy are you?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They did that shit for you

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I did something called saving time, space, and money

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
By just bringing it already done

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Because, fuck it

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's booze, it drinks the same way

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Speaking of fuck it, I decided to mark the occasion tonight

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm gonna wear my pajama pants

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm gonna take a picture of Rob

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
With all these little lips all over them that say kiss me

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because I'm wearing my pajamas to OLR tonight

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Rob wants his pants kissed

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I give no fucks

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Happy 500th episode

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think you gave the last fuck last episode

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So we're fresh out of fucks, sorry

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Alright, say hello

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How are you Loki?

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I wish these fries were better

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'd throw them all away because they're crap

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You went to McDonald's, duh

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a crap shoot, I know

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I wasn't that hungry so I expected them to suck

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I just wanted to be pleasantly surprised that they were good

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But they were not

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is that the tragedy that has followed you for 11 years here on this program?

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, it's just, it's a

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The problem is that I was very indecisive on what I wanted to eat

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, it was kind of like, you know

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
First I started driving towards Jack in the Box

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I'm like, eh, I'm not that hungry

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't judge me

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not hungry enough for Jack in the Box

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So then I went to McDonald's

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm like, oh but I really want Subway

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But it's across the street

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I'm like, eh, I'll just eat McDonald's

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because I need to get gas

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, so thanks to Alan for distracting things

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sorry, Loki

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But while Loki was talking

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Alan came over here and dropped on the table

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I got this bag of the chicken and waffles Lay's

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because I knew Jamie has it

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Actually, Alan got it

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have had them

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, you have had them?

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They're pretty good

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're fairly amazing until you get halfway down through the bag

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then I was like, what the fuck am I eating?

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Brad from Pod Culture said they were the worst absolute things in the world

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They're amazing, I love them

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't think they're the best potato chips I've ever had

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But they're not bad

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The cheesy garlic bread ones though are pretty epic

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are they?

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They are quite epic

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Whoever came up with that little contest at Lay's, genius

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here we are talking about food yet again

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why break tradition, folks?

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Duh

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why break tradition, folks?

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'd rather just have a waffle

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alright

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Dude, waffles would be awesome right now

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We do have a special guest here joining us tonight

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Say hello to Becky

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Greetings

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How are you, Becky?

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm doing pretty well, thanks

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Welcome back

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now Becky, for those that don't know, is Jamie's BFF

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And so Jamie sometimes talks about her on the show

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And she's also quite the chef

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And so Becky was kind enough to actually cook

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here we go with food again on a video game show

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Was kind enough to cook for us tonight

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What did you make for us tonight, Becky?

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I made red velvet brownies

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And they look like murder

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They are beautiful, glorious, dripping red

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hope y'all don't see the food boner in my jammies right now

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Cause

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm gonna go take pictures

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That sounds pretty epic

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of the food boner?

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No comment

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The always present fourth guest on our show

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I know we have a fourth guest in the studio

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But also always with us as you guys have been

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And we would not have made it to 500 episodes without you guys

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's be real

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hello everybody in our chat room

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What the hell comment do I start with tonight?

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How about Mako Chan?

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Starts us off tonight saying

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Murder is pretty fucking tasty

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It would be awesome if you drew like super meat boy on those

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because that would be

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's perfect

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's it, Becky, we have to do this again next weekend

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So what's going on, live listeners?

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is the stream not work-

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I guess a lot of people are bitching that the stream is like

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stopping going tonight or something

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I don't know what's up with that

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We're not doing anything different

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can do it

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's too many of you listening

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's what's happening

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Bite your tongue

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alright, we do tape live every Wednesday

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every Wednesday when I'm not here

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What fucking show is having a birthday today, Rob?

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We do tape live every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And thanks to all you guys who do turn out live

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Or who do listen to us in the podcast

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Speaking of Vognetwork

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are the brownies like really, really good?

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright, I'm about to eat one

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, I want to try one in a minute

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But I have to talk about Vognetwork things

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Because this is really exciting

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fine, you can talk and we'll eat

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fine, sounds good, alright

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think I need new pants

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Last week on the show

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I complained that I wanted the Vognetwork website to have something

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And that was the ability to have instant polls

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So we could go and actually ask the listeners questions

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And actually poll them instantly

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, Bobby Black Wolf, in celebration of our 500th episode

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Has made that a reality

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So for all you guys that are right there on live.vognetwork.com

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because it's the only place you're going to see it

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So if you're tuned into IRC via MIRC or something

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Make sure you bring up live.vognetwork.com

170
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't need to refresh the page or anything like that

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is going to happen automatically

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But it is time

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For the very first time

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We are going to go to our live audience poll

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dork

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright, tonight in the very first Vognetwork live poll

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We are going to settle the great debate once and for all

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because we have to start with an epic question

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So here it is

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tonight's question

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cake or pie?

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Cake or pie?

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There it is up there at live.vognetwork.com

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can participate right now and vote in the poll

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And look at this

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How cool is this

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We see the results live as they come in

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's all tied up right now

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, cake just pulled ahead a little bit

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is the most amazing thing ever

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Bobby is a genius

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's great

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Alright, so there it is

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Cake or pie?

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We will read the results here momentarily

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But it does look like cake is quite a bit ahead here in the live poll

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Alright

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Moving on

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What else do I want to talk about tonight?

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have the new feature that I want to talk about

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Anything you guys want to say in acknowledgement of our 500th episode?

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What the fuck are we doing?

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look at your life

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Look at your choices

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well said

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm going to go drink now

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I want to drink too

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That poll is going to be too distracting

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because it's just

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have to keep watching it change

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know right

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's, it's, it's

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hypnotic

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's hypnotic to watch

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Alright

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's awesome

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I love how it lives up

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are going to be required now

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They'll use that sound clip though

223
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Every time we do an instant poll

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That was the plan

225
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh sweet

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do brownies count as cake?

228
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's a good question

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Maybe I should have added brownies to the list

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh well

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But what does ice cream cake count as?

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I guess cake

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not real cake

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But what about pudding filled cake?

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like Boston cream pie

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's called a pie but it really has cake bits

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, you're making it too fucking complicated lady

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't see Boston cream pie as one of the options of cake versus pie so

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Uh oh, here go hell come

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And of course how thoughtful

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh hi Alan

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hi

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What did you just set down in front of me here in studio?

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Take a whiff of it, smell it

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh god

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh my god it's that stuff I can't have

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm getting drunk just smelling it

250
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It has to smell how awful it is

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You want to smell it?

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is a present from Brad from Pod Culture

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Our pals

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank god it smells more like whiskey than it does like cinnamon

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Um

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you want to smell it at all?

257
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Alright

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Uh, Alan do you want to introduce the drink?

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes it's fireball whiskey

260
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The bottle art is amazing

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And we don't have anything for a chaser really

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So I got you a glass of water

263
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Apple juice I think would have been really good

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But we don't have any so

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I forgot to make apple pie

266
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We poll

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Um

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Chase it with a brownie

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright so uh

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You have to chase it with a brownie

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll chase it with a brownie but here's the thing

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When was the last time we did drinking on OLR?

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was a very long time ago

274
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know but I remember one time I ate half a box of waffles

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If I didn't have to take my son to uh

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know to school every morning

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I would have totally you know

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I know

279
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Crashed but um

280
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I forgot to take tomorrow off work

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I remember when uh you had the uh tequila binge

282
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That was kind of hilarious

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't drink tequila

284
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You did once

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No I didn't

286
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Or was it vodka?

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's always vodka

288
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I could swear it was tequila but okay

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Remember he married a Russian chick

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's always vodka right?

291
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She doesn't drink anything

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She likes rum

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you ready to launch into your gaming week if Rob ends up in a coughing fit after he does the shot?

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Get the first news story ready

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm ready

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Um

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't we have a disclaimer we usually give during drinking shows?

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Um

300
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't drink and drive

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I live here so I can drink

302
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Um

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't be irresponsible

304
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Uh

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And keep it in your pants

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah

307
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Drink moderately

308
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't come up with you know next gen game console ideas after you know consuming vast quantities of alcohol

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay so here's my cheers to all you non drinkers

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Can you toast me with something?

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm gonna go make me a coffee

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Alright yay cheers 500 yay

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
One

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Two

315
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Three

316
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hi Rob

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I wish you guys could see the look on his face he's like gone immediately for the water

318
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wow

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is fantastic radio

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Poor Rob your face is red

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
500 episodes I do what I want

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm gonna go make my mimosa after I do my week

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh my god

324
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Brad thank you for the bottle of Fireball because this is so worth it right now

325
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The webcam's at my house I've been using it to stream drawing

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Loki is there anything you wanted to say in memory of our in celebration of our 500th episode?

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No not really I don't have anything I want to say

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Technically Rob just had a double

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Just that I wish that the wife was capable of taking the son to school so then I could partake but yeah

330
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I said I cannot

331
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Alright I just really want to thank everybody for you know supporting our show and being here

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you know it would have been great to do like a giant convention for our 500th episode and just have you all in one room

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But you know money

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
My apartment ain't that big

335
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Exactly exactly

336
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We're happy to just have you all here and chat with us

337
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I do want to acknowledge this as well because this is like the most awesome thing that ever awesomed

338
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is something that one of our listeners Code Man

339
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I need to take a picture of that too

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who would you who has a who has a YouTube channel and I'm a horrible person because I can't remember the name of it right now

341
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But hopefully somebody will dig it up and post it in chat

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But Code Man is a graphic artist like Dark Sakura

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But he designed this really amazing poster to commemorate our 500th episode

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And Jamie's going to put a picture of it right now at orange-radio.com

345
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah I might start reposting stuff just to tell him because it will take less time

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I believe his channel is Ratchet 1785

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you you're very Tiger Claw tonight I love it

348
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Alright so it's a poster to commemorate our 500th episode

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What's awesome about this is that he's drawn us as these little chibi characters

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And Dark Sakura is like an N7 trooper, she's basically femshep

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Loki is Grand Theft Auto and he's got a bloody baseball bat

352
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I'm World of Warcraft and look guys look

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm flaming there with my hand

354
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And we have a ferret with dynamite strapped to him

355
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But you know what I really love about this is that if you look at the background

356
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He layered a bunch of listener names in the background

357
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know where he got this list of names because I recognize old and new names in there

358
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Like I look at this list and I go okay Jim Sally of course I know who he is

359
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But then I'm like Roboboy430 I haven't seen that name in years

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So I think he did like a combination of people from like

361
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The wiki as well as people he's seen in our chatroom and so forth

362
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So you guys are all a part of this poster as well which I think is just amazing

363
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He should sell prints of it I really wouldn't care and I think he'd make some good money

364
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So I bet a lot of you guys would like that

365
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Alright so oh Tigerclaw found it it's C Taylor 1785

366
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thank you Codeman he also does

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh you know what he co-hosts a show called Down for Maintenance I should plug that

368
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And it has very good artwork go figure

369
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So thank you Codeman for that

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Should we go to the results of our poll?

371
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sure by the way some of the photos are already up they're just being slow

372
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay

373
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
At the very top of OrangeDawnsRadio.com

374
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Alright here it is the results of our poll we're gonna go ahead and end it now

375
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So if you didn't get in too bad

376
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The results of the poll was

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Cake 1

378
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And cake was 62.86% to pie 37.14%

379
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You all pissed me off

380
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright

381
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Just kidding

382
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Alright I'm finally gonna eat one of these brownies I think it's about

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think it's about time to get into our gaming week

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So DarkSakura how was your gaming week?

385
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
My gaming week was semi-productive

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I really didn't play like a whole lot of stuff

387
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I did play some more drunken robot pornography

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That game is so fun I swear

389
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay everybody in the world by now should know how much I love Jumping Flash

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's Jumping Flash with guns and giant robots

391
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And really really good music the game is crack I cannot wait for more of it to come out

392
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I also played something that I'm not allowed to talk about

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So I'm not gonna except I will totally leave one game for this one

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's all I can say

395
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh yeah I played Minecraft I actually streamed me playing Minecraft so I could show off my house

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Or I should say my underground bunker

397
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So that I can hide from everybody else no one can find my house

398
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You've been getting really into this streaming thing lately

399
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I've more or less just wanted to get it to work

400
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Because Dan and I have a plan

401
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll go ahead and do like a semi-announcement

402
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Dan and I have a plan to start doing classic gaming stuff on Twitch TV

403
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I'm trying to decide if Twitch or livestream works better

404
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But we want to eventually get it to where we can run our capture card into

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well we get a capture card to run the video game systems through the PC

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And then have everything run off of the main monitor while we

407
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Sorry the liquor is starting to hit me so if I start smiling for no reason just ignore it

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I was like Rob I'm feeling good

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
By the way I like never drink anymore so the fact that I had that is

410
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I have no tolerance I have the alcohol tolerance of a

411
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh Jaylinx you are hilarious

412
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Of a child

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But yeah so I've just been practicing like with different things

414
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Like lately I've just been streaming playing Mass Effect 2

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because there's a couple people who watched it who just completely skipped it and are playing 3

416
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So like no no no fixing this

417
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then I was playing Drunken Robot Pornography and I've been doing some drawing you know

418
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I tested out the webcam with it but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing webcam stuff

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Now I don't know if you heard Cyl on Horde House this week which we all love Cyl

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I love Cyl

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She's the best but she was talking about some of her experiences in livestreaming

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And how you know because she has the webcam on her and she's very resilient

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And able to do that because she gets all these trolls coming in there going you know take your top off

424
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Will you do you know will you make out with a German chick will you do mouth to ass

425
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Will you do so yeah have you put your mug out there

426
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay you probably don't want to

428
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I had it pointing at a piece of paper

429
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't take that the wrong way you're a very pretty lady and I don't think you give yourself enough credit

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But there's just too many people on the internet that are crazy horny

431
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah they're crazy horny

432
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well fortunately none of them are my problem

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But thank you Jason I will look into the black magic capture card

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But no I was just practicing you know doing stuff and trying out different things

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because I think that what we're going to do is we're also going to maybe try to start bringing up you know

436
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Stuff that's actually in our collection like lovely pajamas Rob

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like we have a whole lot of deluxe editions of games like for example the cyber bots limited edition

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And that stupid card capture soccer game that I had to have and played once it came with a damn pillowcase

439
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But we're just really wanting to and part of it is to we might actually be selling off part of the collection

440
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Legasp

441
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Legasp I'm talking about like the stuff that we actually don't play which you know would probably be the Neo Geo CD and the Intellivision

442
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's probably about it but yeah I still haven't decided what I'm going to use the rest of it for right now until we get this officially started

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But Dan and I have been in the works talking about doing something like that for Twitch just because you know we're inspired by like classic game room

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And the angry video game nerd which I just think that guy is absolutely hilarious

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It didn't make our show roll tonight but I heard something about he's getting his own game or something or was it a movie or a game or what?

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He did a movie already

447
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He did a movie already because they had a kickstarter for the movie and it was so dumb but it was great

448
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah the movie looked ridiculous

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The movie was absolutely ridiculous but it was hilarious too

450
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay I just want to point out when Becky just took that brownie she left these in the shape of a dick

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Did you notice that?

452
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You were so perverted because I was thinking they were in the shape of a T

453
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No those are balls and that's the shaft

454
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I have never seen a dick that read before

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That is a letter T

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You would have to do this to make it a cup

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Now it's balls

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That is a cross because this show needs Jesus right now

459
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You know what? You know who needs Jesus Rob?

460
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Sorry did I offend the Jew? My bad

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You didn't offend the Jew

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now try harder

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The atheist is here

464
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The atheist is here

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well then let me just call Justin Bieber because then maybe Justin Bieber can really offend you

466
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know Rob I'm so disappointed

467
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're such a heathen

468
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No I don't know I don't care

469
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll eat a ball

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Best nuts ever

471
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You don't even want to see the disgusting thing I saw today by the way

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
While you chow down on those balls?

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Tasty balls

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Alright I'm done

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Alright Becky

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh yeah I played well

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Okay now I'm done

479
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay Becky I know you don't play a whole lot of games but I think Dark Sakura got you into a game recently right?

480
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
God she got me into Mass Effect and it has sucked away my whole damn life

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
True

482
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
One of us one of us

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're welcome

484
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Alright femshep or mailshep?

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Femshep I have done a broshep I call it broshep because mailshep sounds weird

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But I did a playthrough just because it was the only way I could romance Jack

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Fair enough fair enough

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't get why Jack wasn't a crazy lesbian hookup

489
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't get it either

490
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Doesn't make any sense

491
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I would have gone for it

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Who is your romance of choice? Because I know and I think it's a good one

493
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Who is your romance of choice?

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thane

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Now Thane kind of they really screwed with him in Mass Effect 3 by you know spoilers killing him off

496
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The game is a year old now right?

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But they tried to make things right with the Citadel DLC were you happy with what they did?

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was very happy with it because it never actually bothered me that he died

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I mean he had a terminal illness if he hadn't died I would have found it stupid

500
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I like that they let him die

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was realistic

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In a heroic kind of way

503
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What pissed me off was that nobody said they were sorry for your loss if you romanced him

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I mean Garris is there at the memorial wall standing right in front of his name and doesn't say a word about it

505
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And that was the part that pissed me off

506
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So actually getting to have a memorial service made me very happy

507
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah and I have to admit I did watch the whole thing on YouTube and watching the videos

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because there's an extra video

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because you find out that Thane

510
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This really isn't that bad of a spoiler you guys

511
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You find out that Thane made all these videos

512
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well he said he did

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah and no matter if you romance him or not you get to see most of the videos

514
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But if you romance him there's an extra video you get to see it

515
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I have to admit I got a little choked up

516
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And what especially got me was the goodbye scene at the very end when they're all getting back on the ship

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I was like

518
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The feels, the feels

519
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I cried like a little girl

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I copied off Becky's save files from her Xbox so that I could mod her Shepard

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And so I played through all of the memorial and everything with her Shepard

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Which it's always very weird playing somebody else's Shepard

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But yeah I actually had to go get tissues and cuddle the cat for a little while

524
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Because like ehhh

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Technus in our chat room says

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think Jack being either bi or a lesbian would have been kind of cliche IMO

527
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But Breakman corrects and says

528
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It is part of Jack's backstory

529
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
She was in a relationship with a man and a woman

530
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And that's again live.vognetwork.com

531
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And Extover says

532
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There goes any interest I had in playing the game too

533
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh shush

534
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Shush ya haters

535
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Alright

536
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Any other games that you've been into besides space operas

537
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I've been adventure time

538
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They do have adventure time DS games

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Watching my son play a lot of adventure time and screaming at the computer

540
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Is kind of adorable to watch an almost six year old going

541
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Stupid computer stop that

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You're not supposed to do that

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's so cute

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's so interesting watching kids now

545
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
When like you know back in my day

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
When I was six we had Commodore 64

547
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And that was cutting edge

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But now you know

549
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Wow you had Commodore 64 when you were six

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You're such a baby

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Becky had to play with sticks

552
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Assuming there's nothing else for Becky's gaming week

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let me go over to Loki

555
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

556
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I played

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's see

558
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Lots of Saints Row of the Third actually

559
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We've been trying to go through and 100%

560
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
100% almost everything

561
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I guess it would be 98%

562
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Because I don't want to play all the co-op stuff

563
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't really want to play through the game for like a fourth time

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It would just be so annoying

565
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I finished up the DLC stuff

566
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm actually finishing up right now

567
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The Gangstas in Space DLC

568
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Which is alright

569
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's like the first DLC really sucked

570
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And the other two were okay

571
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They weren't necessarily like

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I mean they were still kind of side missions

573
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But they at least dressed them up a little bit more

574
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And they're just so short

575
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They're like three missions long

576
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And that's it

577
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's like ten minute missions

578
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And thirty minutes for like seven bucks initially

579
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Kind of a rip off

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So whatever

581
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So I'm playing The Room

582
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And hopefully I'll be done with it pretty soon

583
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll finish the game and get all my achievements on Steam

584
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And move on to something else

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They have been playing Defiance

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
More of that

587
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And actually still don't really know too much about

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What's going on in the world

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's hard for me to follow

590
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But the game is very similar to Borderlands

591
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
For example if you take a franchise you love

592
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And then you think

593
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh hey look there's a sci-fi rip off of that franchise

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's what Defiance is for Borderlands

595
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's basically a sci-fi rip off of Borderlands

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And they've got all these different weapons

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That you can use and stuff

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And it's not necessarily that you specialize in anything

599
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But the more you use a weapon

600
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The better

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Well eventually it gets better

602
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And the more you use a weapon

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The better

604
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well eventually it gets better

605
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And then

606
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They have the different elemental stuff

607
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And it's kind of hard to get good weapons in the game

608
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I've found so far

609
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Unless I'm not doing something right

610
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But they have these lock boxes

611
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That you basically scavenge parts

612
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
From killing people

613
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Or taking weapons that you find

614
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
In loot and breaking them down into parts

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And then you use those parts to buy keys

616
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And then using those keys

617
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You buy these random loot chests I guess

618
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That have two random weapons

619
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Which for my so far

620
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Doing tier two and tier three chests

621
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
They've all sucked

622
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So

623
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's kind of lame

624
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You were telling me about the TV show beforehand

625
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And Tigerclaw is saying some stuff in our chatroom about that

626
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Did you watch the TV show?

627
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I haven't watched the TV show

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't even know if it's on yet

629
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But one thing I did know

630
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Strudels89 in our chatroom says I think it airs in a week or so

631
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I think it's coming soon

632
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Monday

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think it's this week

634
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Either Monday or Tuesday

635
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think it's airing

636
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But here's the thing

637
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
They are trying so hard to almost be like a Battlestar Galactica

638
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Or something like that

639
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Like I was mentioning they have their own lingo

640
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Or their own slang I guess

641
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
To be fair it's by the creators of Battlestar Galactica

642
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay so

643
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That is quite fair

644
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So at least they're ripping themselves off

645
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes they're ripping themselves off

646
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But they're kind of forcing it a little bit

647
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Because you know in Battlestar Galactica one of the most recognizable things

648
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Is the use of the word frack instead of fuck

649
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Well now they're trying to do the same type of thing for Defiance

650
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Except they're kind of taking it even further

651
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
They have two words

652
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Shtaco is one of them

653
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Which is I guess equatable to shit

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And so they say that a lot in the show

655
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They're just like

656
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What you're trying to be a fucking Battlestar Galactica

657
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I mean seriously what's going on here

658
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But anyways the game itself

659
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's kind of fun

660
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I like the fact that you can kind of just run around and do whatever

661
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I've been playing solo through the whole thing

662
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But there's

663
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The way it kind of works is if you happen to go into an area

664
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Say you're doing a mission or something like that

665
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And you're going into an area and someone else is also there doing a mission as well

666
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You kind of get credit for it if you go and help them and stuff

667
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So you can almost like

668
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's almost like partying but not

669
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But you can actually party in the game I just don't

670
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And then these arc fall things that happen

671
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Which are a little repetitive but

672
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They're pretty hard

673
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And you have like you know

674
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
30 or 40 people just

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Trying to take down like a massive alien or something

676
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And that's kind of fun you get a lot of experience doing that

677
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But basically I mean the whole like

678
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Look of the game is very bland

679
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I guess like I don't recognize

680
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's not like this is supposed to be San Francisco

681
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And driving around I couldn't tell you

682
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Like

683
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't see any landmarks that I recognize

684
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Well it's the future

685
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well it's the future

686
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Nuclear war and all that you know it changes things

687
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's just it's kind of bland

688
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But here's the thing who cares if it looks bland

689
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's fun I'm having fun with it so

690
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah

691
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I have not paid any money for

692
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Because you can pay money to get a lot of things in the game

693
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Not necessarily anything that's going to help

694
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean you can buy I guess you know

695
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Tokens that give you more experience

696
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like go up your experience by 10% or something like that

697
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Or money drops or weapon drops

698
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And that kind of thing

699
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Or they will have like you know customizable things

700
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
To make your character look

701
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because right now my character looks like a 50 year old

702
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Trying to look like a teenager

703
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And it looks stupid

704
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But I don't care because I don't really look at my avatar that much

705
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
He's facing the other way

706
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But I swear to god there's like no customization

707
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
As far as how they look

708
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
They all look like some weird fucked up person

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But that's fine

710
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Because you can get a suit that covers their face up

711
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And you'll ever see them again

712
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm kind of surprised at all the hate for

713
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Battlestar Galactica in our chat room

714
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
5th Dream in our chat says

715
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
70's Battlestar Galactica is only Battlestar Galactica

716
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Brad from Pod Cultures asked

717
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Good Battlestar Galactica

718
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Remake Battlestar Galactica

719
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I like the new Battlestar Galactica an awful lot

720
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I guess I'm just crazy

721
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But yeah it's fun

722
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I just wish more people play

723
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The only person I know that plays the game

724
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Other than me on 360

725
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I have a friend I met a long time ago

726
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Matt who works at

727
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Zappos actually

728
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh rad the shoe plays

729
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He was one of the line directors

730
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
There so

731
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He plays

732
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I friended him on Xbox a while ago

733
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's the only guy I know that plays that game

734
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I think it's fun

735
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Buy to play

736
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's no monthly fees

737
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
If you're running into Xbox

738
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Outages like we had this week

739
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You know it's not a big deal

740
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Because hey I can just play later on

741
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And that's kind of the thing I like about it

742
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And the other thing I saw that was kind of cool

743
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They have a lot of these

744
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Different things just like in Borderlands

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
How you do different things like kill

746
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Kill people in an assault rifle

747
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Go to these places

748
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Do this type of mission or something like that

749
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And once you complete

750
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
All these challenges or whatever you experience

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well they have it broken up

752
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Season 1 is all these

753
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Different challenges so they're going to have different challenges

754
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
For the next season and I think actually

755
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The whole game is going to change for season 2

756
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So whatever happens on the show

757
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Is going to reflect in the game and vice versa

758
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Like if

759
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't really know if there's any competing factions

760
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Or anything right now but if they have something like that

761
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It may reflect on the show

762
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So it's interesting so far

763
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think

764
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I'm going to play a little more of that

765
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And then the other thing I played that I really probably shouldn't be playing

766
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because it's

767
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I think piracy

768
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean we shouldn't really talk about it

769
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Shame on you

770
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Whatever I'm buying the game when it comes out anyways

771
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But I wanted to play it early so that's

772
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
As long as you're going to buy it

773
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm going to buy it so

774
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The gameplay was Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

775
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's fucking awesome

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Is that the Xbox Live one?

777
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's Xbox Live

778
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
PlayStation Network and Steam

779
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's going to be amazing

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's 15 bucks when it comes out on the first

781
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's going to be fantastic

782
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It got leaked out earlier this week

783
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Because of some hack on Uplay and stuff

784
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I had to try because I watch all the trailers

785
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I watch gameplay footage and I'm like I gotta play this game

786
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And it's just

787
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's so awesome

788
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is basically a developer making a game

789
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
They're like okay you guys make a game that's fun

790
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That you guys want to play

791
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's just so fucking

792
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why aren't all video games?

793
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's just so cheesy though

794
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Shouldn't that be the mindset that goes into any game?

795
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But it's just so cheesy

796
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's basically this cliche

797
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
B science fiction type plot

798
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That takes place in the year 2007

799
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And it's

800
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
A lot of the details they have

801
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
First off they kind of poke fun at themselves

802
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
With the whole tutorial thing

803
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Basically you drop down

804
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
To invade this base

805
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And your partner

806
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He kind of trolls you

807
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
By enabling this tutorial mode

808
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
In your suit

809
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And so through the entire tutorial

810
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Which is giving you stupid commands

811
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And just breaking it down

812
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Jumping allows you to

813
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Change your orientation

814
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Along the Z axis

815
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Weird stuff like that

816
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So he's just like I hate these tutorials

817
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is stupid I just want to kill somebody

818
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's kind of funny

819
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And then there was also

820
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Like a part where that guy is

821
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hacking this missile guidance system

822
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Thing and all the jargon

823
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
He's throwing out

824
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm hacking the motherboard

825
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm doing this to this

826
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's just all completely

827
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Obviously made up jargon

828
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's just hilarious though

829
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And then they reference stuff that no one has any idea

830
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What they're talking about

831
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's just like that time in South America

832
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah and then they go in there

833
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And then also

834
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I like how his partner

835
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Uses the phrase

836
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Motherfucker a lot

837
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Because he's the cliche

838
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Black action hero guy

839
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Like we're gonna get those motherfuckers

840
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You know

841
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's just awesome

842
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is Samuel L. Jackson voicing him?

843
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm imagining those words coming out

844
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like if it was a comic panel in the same font

845
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
As I'm gonna get you sucka

846
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Pretty much like that

847
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And here's the best part about it

848
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
All just like old PC

849
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Animated cutscenes like they're all static

850
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Images that they're moving around and stuff like that

851
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It looks just like an old NES game or something

852
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Seriously it is an awesome

853
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
If you like Far Cry

854
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Pick it up it's like 15 bucks it's great

855
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The island's still pretty big

856
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
They have blood dragons

857
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Which are cybernetic like

858
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Dinosaur things that shoot lasers out of their eyes

859
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And they're cyber panthers

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Cyber panthers

861
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I want a cyber panther

862
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes I don't

863
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I don't normally condone piracy but

864
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This is a game that I was gonna pick up anyway

865
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You just couldn't wait

866
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I couldn't wait

867
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was already planning on

868
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Picking it up on Xbox Live or Steam

869
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because I'm multi platform for some reason

870
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You just gotta have achievements

871
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I do

872
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

873
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's it

874
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My gaming week pretty quick

875
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

876
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That freaking addicting

877
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Jetpack joyride

878
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If you're still listening you suck for getting me addicted to that

879
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Also World of Warcraft

880
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Been working on PVP

881
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
My character's level 65 now

882
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I did try some new IOS

883
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Games this week I wanted to plug real quick

884
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Talk about a couple of them

885
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I know some people don't really consider the iPhone

886
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Games actual games

887
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But whatever deal

888
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'd like to see them play through

889
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Escabagaluda

890
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
These games are not quite as tricky as Escabagaluda

891
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But I want to talk about them anyway

892
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
To be fair I've been playing them on my iPad 3

893
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Which is the new iPad

894
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But not the newest iPad

895
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The first one is called

896
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Puzzle and Dragons

897
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Which apparently is a big hit over in Japan

898
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah I was about to say

899
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Isn't that like a rehash of the old

900
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah it's partially a puzzle game

901
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Mixed with Pokemon

902
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's an interesting little puzzler

903
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And it has Pokemon elements in it

904
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Where you can kind of combine

905
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Which is funny because the combining elements

906
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Was very similar to what I saw in that card game

907
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Guardian Cross

908
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
From Square Enix that I got into

909
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
A couple of weeks ago

910
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Overall Puzzle and Dragons

911
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I didn't really care for it

912
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The puzzle mechanic part of it

913
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I didn't think was very good

914
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because you touch to move things

915
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And line them up in 3's

916
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And that doesn't attack

917
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But you can literally move them anywhere

918
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And you end up building up combos

919
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And things like that to ultimately be able to take out enemies

920
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But the challenge really wasn't there

921
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And it felt like a bit of a grind

922
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Fest and I just wasn't a fan

923
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I would have to see it because I remember something about it being

924
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Related to the

925
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What was that game?

926
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I actually did it as a classic game ages ago

927
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The Puzzle and Desu

928
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah

929
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Because that's where I heard about it

930
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Because somebody was comparing the two

931
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It could be but I didn't play the other one

932
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I couldn't tell you

933
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Overall Puzzle and Dragons

934
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It entertained me for a couple of evenings

935
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But I'm kind of already over it

936
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The puzzle mechanic isn't enough

937
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
To keep me interested in it

938
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm sorry to say

939
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I also checked out Nimble Quest

940
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Which if you guys know Nimble Bit

941
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
They made Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes

942
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Which you know hello crack

943
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But this new game is actually nothing like those games

944
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It still has the whole 8 bit feel

945
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But they basically created a new version

946
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Of Snake and they are not

947
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They even say in the tutorial

948
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Remember this game and they show the little cell phone

949
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Picture of Snake and

950
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's basically what they've created but what you do

951
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Is that instead of picking up

952
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Squares that make your Snake longer

953
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You pick up more heroes

954
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And some will throw fireballs, some use swords

955
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Some have bombs

956
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know and that's kind of the gist to it

957
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And the other guys

958
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Running around might try to attack you

959
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So it's all about maneuvering

960
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Not running into yourself

961
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And kind of being in the right place

962
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
To use different attacks

963
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It's very addicting

964
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How long will it take Zinga to steal it?

965
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sure they've already worked on it

966
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They're already working on it right now

967
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So you know it's also free to play

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So you can download it for free

969
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You level up your characters

970
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And they can get stronger but of course

971
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
If you spend real money you can level them up real fast

972
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's kind of the catch

973
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But overall I liked Nimble Quest quite a bit

974
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The only thing I didn't like about it

975
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Is that you go through the same

976
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Levels over and over again

977
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You start at level one

978
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's like you're going through the same levels over and over again

979
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Which you know is fine that's how a video game works

980
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But in a game like this you would

981
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Sort of think at some point

982
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I can either branch and go to different

983
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Stages or I can resume

984
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Where I died or something a little

985
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Different I was a little disappointed

986
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That that basic mechanic wasn't somehow

987
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Improved on

988
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The last game that I checked out this week

989
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Which actually is probably my favorite of the three

990
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Is not free to play it's a 99 cent game

991
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's called Slayin

992
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And this game is really cute it's very 8-bit

993
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Style and it's retro-tasticness

994
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But um

995
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Basically it's just got left arrow right arrow

996
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And button and you move left move right

997
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And jump and your character is a little

998
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
8-bit knight that constantly has a sword

999
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Out in front of it and you can either move left

1000
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Or right and you're killing little

1001
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Slimes or you can jump in the air

1002
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And hit little flying skulls

1003
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And as I talk about it

1004
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It sounds like super basic but it's really

1005
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Addicting and the graphics are

1006
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Part of the charm the music

1007
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Is part of the charm I like how at the

1008
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
End of the level you can upgrade weapons

1009
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And it even integrates

1010
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Game center where you can kind of see the tombstones

1011
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Of your friends where they died and so

1012
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Forth so I thought that was kind of

1013
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Cool so I

1014
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah I like that one that was my favorite of the three

1015
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Is Slayin so out of

1016
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Those three that's the one I recommend but go figure

1017
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That's the only one that's not free but it's only 99 cents

1018
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So

1019
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Rastielutianchat asks

1020
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Why the hell does no one ever do 16-bit

1021
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Retro?

1022
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You see it once in a while

1023
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
To the moon? Yeah

1024
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I would say maybe even Slayer

1025
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Looks a little more 16-bit

1026
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Than 8-bit it's somewhere in between

1027
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's like a 12-bit

1028
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Like a turbo graphics game

1029
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Or something it's kind of a little bit in between

1030
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's two 8-bit processors together

1031
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So there you go

1032
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That was really my gaming week just a bunch of iOS games

1033
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But you know that's one of the places people

1034
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Play games on now

1035
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
To be honest that's where I'm doing a lot of

1036
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
My handheld gaming I haven't touched

1037
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
My DS and

1038
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Except when I cleaned it

1039
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Actually the last handheld system I played was a Winter Swan

1040
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Well I still have been playing Harmonite

1041
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But I talked about that last week already and of course

1042
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Swap Note but I'll talk about that later in the show

1043
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And you know there's still other three

1044
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I even booted up Kid Icarus 3D classics

1045
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The other day just because I love

1046
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Kid Icarus and the 3D remakes

1047
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Surprisingly good because they

1048
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Didn't change much besides

1049
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The backgrounds and

1050
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Giving it some 3D effects so it's really

1051
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Good so

1052
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Anyhow let's get into

1053
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Tonight's news

1054
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes we're going to do news tonight just like we always do

1055
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So let's have Loki start us off

1056
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Alright so

1057
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
EA has

1058
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Let some people go and of course

1059
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They're not going to say who or

1060
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Why or where but they

1061
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Basically

1062
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Had layoffs and they're

1063
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Not seeing which teams they're coming from and that kind of sucks

1064
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But isn't some of that leaking out to the internet anyway?

1065
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Who it is?

1066
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah I believe it was EA Montreal if I remember correctly

1067
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It was supposed to be

1068
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I think some of the people

1069
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That are affected by it

1070
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah EA Mobile Montreal

1071
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So

1072
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know

1073
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And they're saying that I guess

1074
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
60 to 70 permanent employees

1075
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Were let go and I guess another

1076
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
100 people working under contract

1077
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Were let go as well

1078
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Mostly QA testers

1079
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So

1080
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I don't know

1081
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's just kind of a normal cycle because after all

1082
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
EA did have a bunch of games

1083
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Just come out recently and like you know

1084
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Three

1085
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I want to say like three or four games

1086
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah four games

1087
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I want to say that they just had Tiger Woods

1088
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Army had two

1089
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Dead Space 3 and

1090
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Crysis 3 so

1091
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It might just be that they're

1092
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You know

1093
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
They're just slowing down right now

1094
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And so they don't need people because the only other game they have coming out right now

1095
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Is Fuse and then NCAA

1096
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah but we're on the cusp of the new E3

1097
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And who knows what's being developed

1098
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
For next gen systems

1099
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Battlefield

1100
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
My guess is a lot of Bioware people

1101
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They've already ruined the IPs now it's time for the

1102
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Layoff phase

1103
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Another game coming out?

1104
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's Mobile

1105
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Montreal

1106
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't know what exactly EA Mobile Montreal

1107
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Was doing

1108
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Facebook games

1109
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Bioware is working on at least

1110
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The Don't Call It Mass Effect 4 game

1111
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The Dragon

1112
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
E3 and the Unknown

1113
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Game that the old Mass Effect

1114
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Team is doing because they are not doing Mass Effect 4

1115
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The multiplayer team is doing it

1116
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So we'll see

1117
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Probably at E3 get some more information about that

1118
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah because EA

1119
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Montreal

1120
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well Montreal is

1121
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Army at two

1122
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But that would be just EA Montreal

1123
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Not necessarily Mobile Montreal

1124
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
What else have they worked on?

1125
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
As long as our friends

1126
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Here locally at Bioware Sacramento

1127
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Are okay but I think they're doing a lot of

1128
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What were they before?

1129
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
ClickNation

1130
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
They do a lot of Facebook

1131
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They had a really popular Facebook game

1132
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's why they got grabbed up

1133
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So I'm sure any Dragon Age

1134
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Mass Effect kind of like Facebook tie-ins

1135
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Or something they were probably working on

1136
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I don't know I've applied for them three times and they haven't hired me

1137
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Aw poor thing

1138
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Sorry Loki anything else?

1139
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes and unsurprisingly

1140
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
In a row they have been voted the worst company

1141
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
In America by Consumerist

1142
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Which is you know a poll

1143
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That they have on a website that people vote

1144
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That are consumers that visit the website

1145
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It is completely

1146
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Well all the nominations

1147
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Are done by people that review the website

1148
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And then they take the top 16

1149
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or so nominations I think it's more than 16

1150
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
32 and then they

1151
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Narrow it down from there

1152
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And this really seems to carry a lot more weight

1153
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Than it ought to like a lot of people

1154
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I see a lot of people that are pissed

1155
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Like why did EA

1156
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Win this when Bank of America

1157
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is a far more evil company

1158
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
When Comcast is more evil

1159
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's an anti-popularity contest

1160
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's not even that it's just like

1161
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Bank of America was one of the I think even they went up against Bank of America

1162
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And it's just people voted

1163
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Maybe Bank of America is just not

1164
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That much in the forefront for some of these people

1165
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's a fucking internet poll

1166
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like do we give this much

1167
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Weight to something that's on Yahoo.com

1168
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I sure hope not

1169
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Like I don't

1170
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That's my thing like the results

1171
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's like who's line is it anyway

1172
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The score doesn't matter

1173
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
My vote for internet's

1174
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Worst poll goes to consumerist

1175
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Worst company in America

1176
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh you should be

1177
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We're analysts we can say this

1178
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I could run a poll right now

1179
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
On the site who runs the worst poll

1180
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
About the worst poll in America

1181
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Consumerist or somebody else

1182
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I won't right now

1183
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I have to save that for special

1184
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
SSJ 100 Matt calls it an ass hattery contest

1185
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Whatever it's just a contest

1186
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's just haha lols

1187
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That you know they won again

1188
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Because haha you screwed up all this SimCity stuff

1189
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And we hate you because of your DRM

1190
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And your policies regarding

1191
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Cashing in

1192
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Microtransactions and all that stuff

1193
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Haha see we showed it

1194
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We showed you

1195
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's kind of what it is

1196
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I didn't log on to Mass Effect for a month

1197
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So I voted them the worst

1198
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Shadow Next Gen

1199
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Shadow Next Gen says in our chat room

1200
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Anyone who voted EA as the worst company

1201
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Should have their gaming rights rescinded

1202
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And be banned from the industry

1203
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Look people are welcome to their opinion as far as I'm concerned

1204
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But I'm just kind of like

1205
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You know

1206
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I tend to think

1207
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
There are far bigger problems

1208
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Than you know EA

1209
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
As a gamer do I like a lot of the things

1210
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That NCA has brought to the table? Hell no

1211
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And do I think they've deflected an awful lot

1212
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Of the blame? Hell yes

1213
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And have they made a lot of bad decisions

1214
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And possibly deserve to be having the lower financial

1215
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Quarter because of it? Yes

1216
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Do I think people should be losing their jobs?

1217
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No

1218
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But it's not those people's fault

1219
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's the fault of? Who is it?

1220
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Management

1221
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So what management got laid off

1222
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
As a part of this?

1223
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
That's what we really should be

1224
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You got me

1225
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
They did lose the CEO and that sadly

1226
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Or fortunately depending on which side you're on

1227
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Is the person that needed to take the fall

1228
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So we'll see if things get better

1229
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But if you know

1230
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
If last year was any sort of

1231
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You know

1232
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Barometer of whether things are getting better

1233
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Nope

1234
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Besides how many years is it going to take

1235
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Before SimCity stops working

1236
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
When they shut up those servers

1237
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
DarkTetsuya in our chat room says

1238
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I do give EA credit for their pro

1239
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
LGBT stance

1240
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And I do love Need for Speed

1241
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They blame that as one of the reasons they got voted

1242
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You know

1243
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's a tricky

1244
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I appreciate the fact that

1245
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Peter Moore did come out and say

1246
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If that's the reason you're going to name us the worst

1247
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Company in America then by golly

1248
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We're the worst company in America

1249
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I appreciate that he said that but at the same time

1250
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm kind of like

1251
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But like

1252
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
How do you focus on the real reasons you're getting

1253
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Voted for this

1254
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Like a lot of that is feeling like smoke

1255
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And mirrors and whether you deserve it or not

1256
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's falling on deaf ears

1257
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It seems to me and that doesn't

1258
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Make it very promising

1259
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That you're going to change anything

1260
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I honestly would have put more of the crappy

1261
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
If I was going just on video game companies

1262
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I would have put more crap on Activision

1263
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I think

1264
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Or maybe Capcom

1265
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't know

1266
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
EA is the company that designed the whole

1267
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Online pass phenomenon

1268
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That we see nowadays

1269
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
EA was also one of the first companies to

1270
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Hey you know those games that you had cheats in before

1271
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
In Playstation 2 where you just enter

1272
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
A little button press and you get those cheats

1273
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah you can buy those now

1274
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And even in fact I remember

1275
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is the first Godfather game they had

1276
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
On Playstation 2 and Xbox

1277
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Where they didn't have such a way to purchase those

1278
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Bits of DLC

1279
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
They actually had button presses to do those cheats

1280
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
On the 360

1281
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That's going to cost some money

1282
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So yeah so they can go fuck themselves

1283
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Origin is just the thing that pisses me on

1284
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Origin is the worst part of it

1285
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Hey but Rob

1286
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There's 45 million people on Origin

1287
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
How many satisfied customers

1288
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How many people on Origin

1289
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Because the game they wanted to play

1290
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Was only through Origin

1291
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
If I could disable that shit I would

1292
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
To be fair

1293
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And I have to say this I have to acknowledge it

1294
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Nobody liked Steam when it first came out

1295
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And it's great now but I just

1296
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
To me there's a difference

1297
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm kind of like Valve fixing it

1298
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah I kind of see that out of them

1299
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But EA fixing it I'm like I don't know if they're ever

1300
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Going to

1301
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I think that Steam though had it right from the get go

1302
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That you know let's put out games and put them out

1303
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
At affordable prices

1304
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Get people interested in franchises do big sales

1305
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And EA's like oh that's not any way to make money

1306
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And look where they are

1307
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Hi

1308
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Alright well let's move on to one of those companies

1309
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That Dark Soccer has said you know they're not doing

1310
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Much better and that's Capcom

1311
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And Capcom had something interesting to say

1312
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
This week where

1313
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Capcom Senior Vice President

1314
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Christian Svensson said on the

1315
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Ask Capcom forums

1316
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Quote, sadly I think we've probably

1317
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Run the course of feasible titles here

1318
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Given the drop off we've seen in sales

1319
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
With each new introduction

1320
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That's in regards to HD ports and

1321
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Remakes of fighting games

1322
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's a lot of games to be honest

1323
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well

1324
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
No they could really dig back

1325
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
In the archive do like the Mega Man fighting

1326
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Games and

1327
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Capcom vs SNK

1328
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Although I guess that's coming out on the

1329
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Playstation 2 or whatever

1330
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's going to be an old hit or whatever

1331
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Just how bad is it?

1332
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They've come out and said

1333
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That the Dark Stalkers resurrection

1334
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Sales are not good

1335
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Dark Stalkers

1336
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The Dark Stalkers resurrection didn't even place

1337
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
On the list of best selling Playstation Network

1338
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Games

1339
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
In further comments Christian Svensson saying

1340
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's partially due to lack of a

1341
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Promotion

1342
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Quote, we've not given up but I'm disappointed in the opening

1343
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Sales response relative to any other fighting

1344
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Title we've put out on the same platforms

1345
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Given the frequency and urgency of

1346
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Requests we've had here over the last several years

1347
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And the quality of the execution

1348
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's the most fully featured

1349
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And probably best project of this type

1350
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
That we've done

1351
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Here's a question that comes to my mind when I'm

1352
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Reading about these stories and that is

1353
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Is possibly Xbox Live Arcade

1354
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And Playstation Network just too

1355
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Oversaturated and that's what's

1356
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Causing the drop off is that there's just

1357
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Too much stuff on there now and it's hard to stand

1358
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Out because I'll tell you what

1359
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
When Xbox Live Arcade first came out

1360
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Shit I was buying everything

1361
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I bought almost like every other week there was a new

1362
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Release I would buy it like just because like hey

1363
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
New game for five bucks right

1364
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I bought like everything

1365
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Now I honestly couldn't

1366
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Tell you the last game I bought on Xbox Live Arcade

1367
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't remember it was a while ago

1368
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Or even Playstation Network

1369
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I don't remember the last game

1370
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I got

1371
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Last game I got was Retro City

1372
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Rampage

1373
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So is it possible that maybe

1374
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Part of the sales drop off is it's hard

1375
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
For this game to stick out because maybe

1376
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You know it's not

1377
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
There's too much to pick

1378
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
From now

1379
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Maybe just Darkstalkers

1380
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Is just not as popular as Street Fighter

1381
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But isn't that the game that everybody was asking for?

1382
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
They wanted Darkstalkers 3

1383
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They wanted Darkstalkers

1384
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You mean Darkstalkers 4 but could that

1385
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Could this

1386
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Could this endanger a Darkstalkers

1387
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
4 because this hasn't been selling well

1388
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
He admitted themselves it was under promoted

1389
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So I mean a good portion

1390
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Of the failure to perform has to

1391
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Do with their failure to promote

1392
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ActDeft in chat says

1393
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
The last Xbox Live Arcade game I bought was

1394
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Darkstalkers Resurrection

1395
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yyr in chat says

1396
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'll say this much

1397
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The moment Sony announced that Playstation 4

1398
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Would not be backwards compatible

1399
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I lost almost all desire to buy

1400
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Anything for Playstation 3

1401
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
On the Playstation Store

1402
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That's a really good point

1403
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That's a very good point

1404
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I have to admit that crosses my mind too

1405
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And part of the

1406
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I mean and this is

1407
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I know where some people

1408
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Keep in mind a lot of people I hang out with are classic gamers

1409
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Why buy something in HD

1410
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That I have on how many

1411
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Other dozen systems

1412
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
In the past that I have paid good money for

1413
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah it's like I got a maim cabinet

1414
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
If I want to play Darkstalkers I'll go play

1415
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Darkstalkers

1416
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I've got the Vampire Savior collection for Saturn

1417
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
If I wanted to play that that's the best version

1418
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Out for a home console right now

1419
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I mean

1420
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Darkstalkers they do an anthology on Playstation 2 as well

1421
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think so

1422
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah so it's not like it's that hard to go out to your used game store

1423
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And buy a $5 Darkstalkers

1424
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's not that hard

1425
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I do want a new Darkstalkers

1426
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
That being said because it's probably one of my favorite fighting game

1427
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Franchises

1428
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But still

1429
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I mean doing these HD versions

1430
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Especially in a still depressed market

1431
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Not very

1432
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Not a very good idea you have to bring something innovative out

1433
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And just cleaning up the graphics isn't going to be enough

1434
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Interesting

1435
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But there's other HD remakes on the horizon

1436
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
They might not be fighting games

1437
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But we do have the Dungeons and Dragons arcade game

1438
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And DuckTales Remastered coming out

1439
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Judging on the reaction

1440
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That everybody gave at least the DuckTales game

1441
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
At Penny Arcade Expo

1442
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm thinking they don't have anything to worry about there

1443
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That's an HD reboot that's not in trouble

1444
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But the Dungeons and Dragons games

1445
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Now look I'm a fan

1446
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Hell yeah

1447
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
But I worry they're a little niche

1448
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I don't know I'm hoping I'm wrong

1449
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I hope I am wrong

1450
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I will be more than happy to say

1451
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I was so wrong on that

1452
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And that game sold shit tons

1453
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But I have a feeling it's very niche

1454
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And it might not sell well

1455
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I keep my fingers crossed on it

1456
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But I mean they're not really giving it the best promotion either

1457
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Are they?

1458
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Well they unveiled it at the same expo

1459
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Well yeah DuckTales

1460
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But I mean since then

1461
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I think they'd have to promote the hell out of it

1462
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And to really get the type of sales they're looking for out of it

1463
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And again

1464
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I probably won't buy it because

1465
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I've already got it

1466
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Lots of people in our chat room saying some positive things about it

1467
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
DungeonBuster says yay the D&D beat em ups

1468
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Marinko

1469
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I hope I said that right

1470
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Said I would love to see more Dungeons and Dragons

1471
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Well y'all better go buy it

1472
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Chiggers wants Mr. Do

1473
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
They never did I thought they did a new Mr. Do

1474
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Not that long ago

1475
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I thought they did I could be wrong

1476
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I think it was out on a compilation

1477
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Or some type of like new Mr. Do

1478
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But it was really nothing like the old ones

1479
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The sequel Mr. Pooh

1480
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Mr. Does

1481
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Mr. Did

1482
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
They had a Mr. Do game I don't remember what it was called

1483
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
But yeah they actually had an arcade game

1484
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Where it was really weird

1485
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't remember

1486
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Like a platformer or something

1487
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And honestly though

1488
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Back to comparing the D&D to DuckTales

1489
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
People underestimate

1490
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
The love for the old DuckTales game

1491
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The DuckTales game was freaking sweet

1492
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I mean

1493
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That was one of the first things that Dan

1494
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And I ever talked about when we first met

1495
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Online ages and ages and ages ago

1496
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
He's like we were talking about

1497
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Video game music and he says oh yeah my favorite

1498
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Is that DuckTales moon level

1499
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And I'm like oh yeah me too and you know

1500
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And then we started reading you know sharing

1501
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Bad fanfictions and it was love

1502
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Aww

1503
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Actually

1504
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You know what we met over right?

1505
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Um

1506
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Ranma one half

1507
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh I thought it was your sound rips you did

1508
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
No I did those after

1509
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Actually I just started doing the sound rips after I moved out here

1510
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Ah

1511
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Alright well let's move on DarkSakura

1512
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
If you have some news for us

1513
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Hey Codeman's in chat hi thank you for our poster it's awesome

1514
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And I need to talk to you later

1515
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Has to do with album art

1516
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Secret messages to listeners

1517
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Secret secret meh

1518
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Secret message how's that? Well there was

1519
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
A survey that went out

1520
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
That showed the

1521
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Income disparity between

1522
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Game developers based on gender

1523
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And it was

1524
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Actually a 2012 salary survey

1525
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That was put out in the March issue of Game

1526
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Developer magazine where

1527
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
They were saying that even though the number of women

1528
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
In the industry is growing

1529
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There is still a huge salary

1530
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Gap is something like

1531
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The average female game

1532
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Producer makes about

1533
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Maybe 79,000

1534
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And the average male makes

1535
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
About 86,000

1536
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So we're talking about a huge

1537
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Disparity for the same work

1538
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
For people who are just as capable

1539
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
If not you know

1540
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Overlooking people who are more capable simply because

1541
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Gender

1542
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Well does the story get into why?

1543
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
There's a big

1544
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Is that just you know because unfortunately

1545
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I can't get into the area that has the

1546
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Cool thing on it because I don't want to pay for a subscription

1547
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
For it. I was going to say

1548
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Is that just an unfortunate echo

1549
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Of what can happen

1550
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
In the greater world unfortunately

1551
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Well they're also

1552
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Talking a little bit more about

1553
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Where the bulk

1554
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Of women are working within the industry

1555
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And it says that

1556
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That's in art and animation at about 16%

1557
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And game designers around 11%

1558
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So

1559
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I wish I had more information

1560
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I tried to get into the thing but

1561
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I don't have a subscription so sorry

1562
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Um

1563
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Marinko in our chat room says

1564
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
You would think we would be past

1565
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
All this gender inequality at this point in human

1566
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Society. You would wouldn't you?

1567
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And it's unfortunately

1568
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That this industry has to

1569
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Really exacerbate that issue

1570
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It sounds like from these statistics

1571
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So

1572
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
But it's just a really

1573
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's just

1574
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Pretty sad I think

1575
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Sort of sad commentary that

1576
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I mean I am glad to see more women

1577
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Getting into the industry because I mean we definitely

1578
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Need it especially after what we talked last week

1579
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
About the

1580
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Preference

1581
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Towards male leads in video games

1582
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Versus female leads when we've had

1583
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Awesome games with female leads like what mirrors

1584
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Edge and the new Tomb Raider

1585
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The new Tomb Raider

1586
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I really think that it's just

1587
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Something in the public perception that's gonna

1588
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Have to change so

1589
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Well we have the power

1590
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
To change it so

1591
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
If people would listen to us

1592
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I don't mean we I mean we as a generation

1593
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I know I know I know

1594
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
How about this way if people would be

1595
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
A little bit less distracted by

1596
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Things and actually get off their ass and do something

1597
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Just saying

1598
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Alright Loki speaking about the we changing

1599
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Uh

1600
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah the uh

1601
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
A lot of the features that are on the we

1602
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Online features maybe

1603
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Stuff that you don't use I'm sure it's a lot of stuff

1604
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You don't use are being

1605
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Deactivated starting June

1606
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
28th this includes the

1607
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Nintendo channel the news channel

1608
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
The forecast channel everybody votes channel

1609
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
The me contest channel and

1610
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Some of the data exchange

1611
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
With friends in other words

1612
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Data exchange includes the ability

1613
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
To send messages to friends

1614
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And also all of the

1615
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Me data exchange

1616
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
In some games

1617
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Will end as well

1618
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'm wondering if that also means like the

1619
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Me plaza swapping of

1620
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Characters and stuff like that I wonder if that's gonna go away

1621
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But shit at this point I mean

1622
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
That's almost like

1623
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Almost all the online functionality

1624
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Of the we I mean

1625
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well like Nintendo's ever had

1626
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Any real concept of embracing

1627
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Online technology it's kinda

1628
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Dumb that they

1629
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Had all these curated channels and they couldn't have

1630
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Like just pulled you know

1631
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Weather information from

1632
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yahoo or you know news

1633
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
From like anything

1634
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't know RSS

1635
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Feeds I mean that's all they really are why couldn't they

1636
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Have just updated hey we're not gonna do these on

1637
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Our server anymore let's just update this

1638
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
To like RSS feeds for different things

1639
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Uh Rasteel UT in chat

1640
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Asks does anyone use those stupid channels

1641
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I figured it'd be faster to just go with the browser

1642
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Well I haven't touched my we

1643
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It was fun to spin the globe

1644
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
In the news channel and in the

1645
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The weather channel

1646
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The weather channel but yeah I mean that kinda

1647
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Loses it's luster after some time

1648
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But you know they're still actively

1649
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Selling the we

1650
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Granted the most recent model they came out with

1651
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
In Canada had the internet parts just

1652
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Stripped out of it maybe that should've

1653
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Told us something but

1654
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You know it's not like they aren't

1655
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Still I mean there's a we game is

1656
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Coming out this week or just came out

1657
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The whole pandora's tower

1658
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah this week so it's not like

1659
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The week itself is dead

1660
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's dead but there's

1661
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But they're sure pulling the plug on

1662
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Basically we connect 24 is

1663
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Getting it's plug pulled anything that runs off the

1664
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Internet on the we is done yeah cause after pandora's tower

1665
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The next game you have coming out is

1666
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Smurfs 2

1667
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And then after that

1668
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Planes

1669
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Disney planes

1670
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And

1671
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Disney infinity

1672
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So it's all kids stuff but

1673
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You're not gonna get Madden

1674
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
You're not gonna get in 6AA

1675
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You're not gonna get anything else

1676
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I think after this year and maybe

1677
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Maybe if you know

1678
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
There's some indie developers out there

1679
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Or smaller developers that really

1680
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Want to just still focus on the we

1681
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I think you're gonna be out of titles

1682
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Probably by

1683
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Second quarter next year

1684
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Yyr in chat says

1685
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Darn I can't check the weather at the north pole anymore

1686
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Everyone you know you've done this

1687
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Guilty as charged

1688
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I have to say not guilty

1689
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Totally fun though I've actually never played with the weather channel

1690
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You wanna know where my we is?

1691
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
In a dumpster?

1692
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
No it's in a box at Dan's mom's house

1693
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Haven't touched that thing in months

1694
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I can't believe I waited in line for that thing

1695
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Although that was pretty fun giving donuts

1696
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And bribing for our spot online

1697
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Ravens dolphin in chat says

1698
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I don't think people were using that stuff on we

1699
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
How many people sent messages on their we

1700
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And watch it glow blue

1701
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Not in years mine is on the floor

1702
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And yeah you know what let's be real

1703
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I haven't used that stuff in a long time either

1704
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So I can't sit here and go

1705
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Oh how dare they take away the stuff I used to love

1706
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It's over

1707
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I think what the thing that's

1708
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Annoying people the most is it's basically

1709
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Just saying that Nintendo's just giving up

1710
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Support on this console

1711
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
They're just like eh we're done we have the Wii U now

1712
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Which they kinda need to do to help

1713
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You know motivate people to get the Wii U

1714
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yeah but I mean what's gonna happen

1715
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
When the new Wii U U comes out

1716
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
The Wii U U?

1717
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Is it the Wii W?

1718
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's funny

1719
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Her her I'm clever her

1720
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Alright

1721
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Hopefully also funny and light hearted

1722
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Like some of their previous games

1723
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And fun will be the next

1724
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Game from level 5

1725
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Level 5

1726
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Is probably most well known for

1727
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Ni No Kuni as of late

1728
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But they also did Dragon Quest 8

1729
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Which was so good and White Knight

1730
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Chronicles 1 and 2 which you know

1731
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Were kind of a little more controversial

1732
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
In fact I heard the servers for those games are getting shut down

1733
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Which is kind of unfortunate but whatever

1734
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Games end

1735
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I guess in this day and age

1736
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
But apparently a new PlayStation 4

1737
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Project is in the works

1738
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
This is according to level 5 boss

1739
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Akihiro Hino talking

1740
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
In an interview with Nikkei Trendy

1741
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's in the planning stages

1742
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Hoping that they can announce something

1743
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
More specific about it soon

1744
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Could that be

1745
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Ni No Kuni 2

1746
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Dragon Quest 8 2

1747
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Or okay to be fair

1748
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Maybe we don't necessarily need a sequel

1749
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
They can do something new

1750
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That would be nice right

1751
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So

1752
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
We will see what is next from

1753
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Level 5

1754
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Okay Ravenstaufen was hilarious

1755
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
There's been a bunch of jokes going on in chat about Wii U 2

1756
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Featuring Bono and I said featuring

1757
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The Edge and Ravenstaufen

1758
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Says is the Wii U 2 slogan with or without you

1759
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I like it

1760
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's funny

1761
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Yeah that is pretty clever

1762
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
With or without you

1763
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Alright one more story for you guys

1764
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Then release dates, Dark Saga

1765
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I got a story for you

1766
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Well hackers gonna hack right

1767
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
They cracked

1768
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Ubisoft's Uplay security

1769
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So they can download games for free

1770
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And Ubisoft actually sent out

1771
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
A statement that they said that they are aware

1772
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Of the issue and are trying to resolve it

1773
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The rest of the quote goes no personal information

1774
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Was compromised

1775
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Uplay's PC download service will be unavailable

1776
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Until the problem is fixed however all other Uplay services

1777
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Remain available

1778
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So basically it was actually a group of Russian

1779
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Hackers that broke into it and downloaded

1780
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Games for free

1781
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Wow

1782
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Hackers gonna hack

1783
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah but that's quite something to get in there and

1784
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Download games for free

1785
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Loki

1786
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Including that's how Far Cry

1787
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Give us some more details

1788
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
How did this exactly happen

1789
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It's basically a trick with the client

1790
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think they said it's easy

1791
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Even maybe like a console command

1792
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Or something like that

1793
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But basically

1794
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Tricked Uplay into thinking

1795
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
That you own the game and allowed you

1796
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
To re-download it

1797
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So they did that with

1798
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

1799
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And some other stuff

1800
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
To prove that it worked

1801
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And so now they're gonna try to patch that out

1802
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
But

1803
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
If you mean that sucks that your DRM

1804
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Is able to be defeated that quickly

1805
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Especially to have a game like that

1806
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Leak out early

1807
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But it is awesome so I do recommend

1808
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Everyone go buy it

1809
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well they've

1810
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Taken down

1811
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Well it's not gonna stop people from the re-up

1812
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Probably how you got yours but

1813
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Once it's on the internet it's

1814
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
On the internet for a second on there for an eternity

1815
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But yeah

1816
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
They

1817
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Did their best to get that shut down as soon as possible

1818
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
But still

1819
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It was Gameranx

1820
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
G-A-M-E-R-A-N-X

1821
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Put an image of the game being

1822
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Downloaded

1823
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
That was for Far Cry 3

1824
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Blood Dragon

1825
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And basically said here is us

1826
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Sending it to the torrent sites

1827
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You know

1828
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Bite our ass

1829
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So

1830
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Hackers gonna hack

1831
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Alright so don't put your full games

1832
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Online

1833
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Or like a month before they're supposed to come out

1834
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Unless I mean

1835
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm gonna do a brag about being unhackable

1836
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Cause usually that follows immediately being hacked

1837
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
No but Ubisoft had that whole

1838
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
DRM thing which nobody liked

1839
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Not that that makes it okay

1840
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm just saying that's you know

1841
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Probably the justification

1842
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I got the Ubisoft little service myself and I said

1843
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You know what I don't really need to play Assassin's Creed

1844
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That much

1845
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I registered some of my games with it

1846
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's you know whatever

1847
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So

1848
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Alright let us travel around the world

1849
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Check out some release dates

1850
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000

On the 3DS

1861
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Oh that didn't come out in tandem with the DS?

1862
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Nope

1863
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The Wii U version? No it did not

1864
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Weird. Was it delayed?

1865
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I don't know

1866
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I don't think it was ever supposed to come out at the same time

1867
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Okay

1868
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Let us go on to Japanese

1869
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000

Revelations gets a special edition

1874
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000

1875
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3

1876
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000

Is Tomodachi still a thing?

1909
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah Tomodachi I was trying to see what this is

1910
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Tomodachi means friend

1911
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Tamagotchi are the little

1912
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
egg babies

1913
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Little people

Hang out with friends with PictoChat

01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Wait a second

1918
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
For people who don't want to go outside

1919
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because it's a scary place

1920
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You know what I can get behind that

1921
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Lastly on the PSP

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000

Is that like where they're like you know

1928
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Doing one of those

1929
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
What do they call that?

1930
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I forgot

1931
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That's it

1932
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
That is exactly what it is

1933
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
That game where they do stuff

1934
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Also on the PSP this week

1935
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
7th Dragon 2020-2

01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It's a little late but I remember now

1937
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It's like a flash mob but you don't know why you're there

1938
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Sorry I had to look behind me to see if I could find the joke

1939
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Jonsai Gakuen

1940
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Hold your hand up over your head

1941
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
You might catch it when it sails past

1942
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Alright, you know what

1943
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You guys don't deserve any more Japanese

1944
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Japanese release dates

1945
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
That's it

1946
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
There's some stuff coming out in Europe

1947
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
On the 18th of April

1948
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
We have Pappo and Yo on PC

1949
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Which looks kind of interesting

1950
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And then stuff on April 19th

1951
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000

01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Gods Among Us

01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And that's it

1954
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
No more

1955
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
You guys don't get any more games

1956
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It's kind of a slow time of year

1957
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah

1958
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Alright, let's go for a few more stories

1959
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And then the classic game of the week

1960
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I bet y'all can't wait to see what she picked for this episode

1961
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You guys are going to be so surprised

1962
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Actually, I legitimately was

1963
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Loki, what did you pick tonight for news?

1964
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
For news? Let's see

1965
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I picked

1966
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The UK government investigating

1967
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
In-app purchases

1968
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Because they believe it's putting too much

1969
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Pressure on children to accidentally

1970
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Or maybe

1971
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Mislead them into

1972
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Purchasing smurf objects

1973
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Or stuff that they don't need

1974
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Basically saying

1975
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
We're concerned that children and their parents

1976
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase

1977
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
When they're playing games they

1978
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Thought were free, but which actually

1979
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Run up a substantial cost

1980
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
The OFT

1981
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Is not seeking to ban in-game purchases

1982
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
But the games industry must ensure

1983
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That it's complying with

1984
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Relevant regulations so that children

1985
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Are protected. Think of the children

1986
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
They're coming for you smurf village

1987
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
La la la la la la spend my mom's credit card

1988
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Are we going to get smurf village 2 with the

1989
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Smurfs 2 movie coming out?

1990
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Smurfs village 2 electric boogaloo?

1991
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I hope not

1992
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
If it was really combining those two movies

1993
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I might have to watch it

1994
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The Smurfs movie is

1995
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It's so bad

1996
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Katy Perry is one of the

1997
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I kind of wanted to watch it just because

1998
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Neil Patrick Harris is in it

1999
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Unfortunately did not

2000
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Want to see that movie

2001
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
He can't see that movie

2002
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Now if Neil Patrick Harris

2003
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The character

2004
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
From all of the wonderful

2005
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Harold and Kumar movies

2006
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Was in that movie

2007
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
That might be something

2008
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay

2009
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I have to go on a little tangent here

2010
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Dan and I had a very interesting discussion

2011
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
About the Smurfs

2012
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yes my husband and I discussed the Smurfs

2013
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Through Fry's Electronics

2014
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
He picked up a plushy smurf and said

2015
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
That's a big smurf. He said actually this would be about how big a smurf really is

2016
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And then he started stacking

2017
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Like what the size of apples

2018
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Would have been because they're three apples high

2019
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And he was like how did nobody ever

2020
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Find the damn smurf village

2021
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
If they came up to your shins?

2022
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So

2023
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
End of story

2024
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Alrighty

2025
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That means there would be no plot ever

2026
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Because everyone would be

2027
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Well maybe they just

2028
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Lived in like remote Canada

2029
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Where nobody thought to look

2030
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
People live in Canada

2031
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Not that far north

2032
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yes they do

2033
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
They lived in Nunavut

2034
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Alright

2035
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Nobody lives there

2036
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Breakman voted for Gargamel

2037
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I voted for Asriel because Gargamel was pretty stupid

2038
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
To register participation

2039
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2040
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
At vognetwork.com

2041
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Use the passphrase

2042
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Pancake

2043
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Well would you vote for this?

2044
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I know a lot of people are very

2045
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They're purist when it comes to their Japanese voiceovers

2046
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
But here's an interesting one

2047
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
How much would you pay for Japanese voiceovers?

2048
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Square Enix

2049
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Is going to be selling a Japanese voiceover pack

2050
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
For the Steam version of Tomb Raider

2051
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It's already available in Japan

2052
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Through the Western store

2053
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Here's the thing though

2054
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
If you want to get the Japanese localization pack

2055
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It will cost $30

2056
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That's $30 DLC

2057
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
That's on top of

2058
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
What the game costs already

2059
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Now it should be noted

2060
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Japanese games do tend to be

2061
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
A little bit higher in price

2062
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Anyway

2063
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The Japanese version of the game

2064
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Actually comes out on April 25th

2065
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That is the same day

2066
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
As the voiceover pack

2067
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And it will retail for $80

2068
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
This is typical for Japan

2069
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So in a way it's kind of like

2070
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Well the $50 you paid for it on Steam

2071
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Plus the $30 for the voiceover pack

2072
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Equals the $80 it would have cost you anyway

2073
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But there went your deal

2074
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The only reason I could remotely

2075
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Think of it being that high would be

2076
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Simply the cost of paying voice actors

2077
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Especially with

2078
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I mean

2079
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It ain't cheap

2080
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
They'd have to

2081
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Basically decide what they've had to pay

2082
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
The voice actors for

2083
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And then see what their overhead is for the recording

2084
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And then adjust the price

2085
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
There's still I think pulling a big profit off of it

2086
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And I know people will buy it

2087
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Yeah there's a lot of people in chat going

2088
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
What? What? Why? But then you have Zombie Princess

2089
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
That gives us a little perspective here

2090
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
At live.vaughnightware.com

2091
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Says I would pay that much for Japanese voices in Mass Effect

2092
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I would not

2093
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Because it was not ever dubbed in Japanese

2094
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
But neither was Tomb Raider

2095
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
No

2096
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
However

2097
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Actually I do have to say that Mass Effect

2098
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
In French sounds pretty fucking cool

2099
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I want to know

2100
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
What her voice sounds like

2101
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Did they go the route where she's super chibi

2102
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Or did they pick like a deep male

2103
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Japanese voice for her

2104
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It's Japanese voice acting she probably sounds

2105
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Super kawaii

2106
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
YYR in chat says

2107
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
When was the last time a Japanese game was released here with subtitles

2108
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And the English dub cost an extra

2109
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
$20

2110
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You know to import a game from Japan

2111
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Remember when we used to import

2112
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
DDR and BeatMania and all that stuff

2113
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Well um

2114
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Shoot what was it

2115
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
There was another game

2116
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Oh yeah Sonic Adventure

2117
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Remember when it came out on Dreamcast

2118
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It had the Japanese

2119
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
You could choose the Japanese voice track with the English subtitles

2120
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Which because

2121
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I played through it the first time in Japanese

2122
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
On my import

2123
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So I played through it again in Japanese

2124
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Because I was used to the voices

2125
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I think of a lot of fighting games nowadays

2126
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I want to say like Soul Calibur

2127
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
The Street Fighter series you can choose language

2128
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You can choose between the two

2129
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
But the amount of dialogue in Street Fighter versus

2130
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Tomb Raider

2131
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But it also changed the in game voice acting

2132
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
To the Japanese voice actors

2133
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Which honestly

2134
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
If I'm going to listen to Ryu I don't want him to sound like

2135
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
He's a white boy

2136
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Break Man

2137
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Going back in time a little bit

2138
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Excuse me

2139
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Not going back in time

2140
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But Break Man going back to an earlier comment saying

2141
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I would pay that much for a Mass Effect nude code

2142
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But I'm a perv

2143
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You know what you can do that for free it's called text mod

2144
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Let me introduce you to the internet

2145
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It is your friend and there's lots of nudity on it

2146
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Actually I have

2147
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
When I was putting in all those outfits

2148
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
From my Shepard and everything

2149
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
One of them is completely naked except there is absolutely no features on it

2150
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'm sure that there's already a mod out there

2151
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
For Tomb Raider

2152
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Again it's the internet

2153
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
It's been done

2154
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Actdeft in our chat room says

2155
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Just a friendly reminder guys

2156
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's optional

2157
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Reminding us that if you don't want to buy the $30 pack

2158
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You don't have to

2159
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
But Black Wolf goes it's required

2160
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It exists therefore I must have it

2161
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
There are consumer whores out there

2162
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And honestly

2163
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It's the same reason why people buy Dubbed Anime here

2164
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Even though I paid a little bit extra

2165
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
For the subtitled versions

2166
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
When they were on VHS

2167
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's people

2168
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
The average person would like

2169
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
To watch something in their native language

2170
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It's more comfortable

2171
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
For the average person to do

2172
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
People don't want to read

2173
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
At least that's America anyway

2174
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Well let's move on

2175
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
To a simpler time

2176
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Let's travel back in time

2177
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
They didn't have to worry about

2178
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Dubbing over

2179
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
On different voice overs

2180
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Couldn't talk

2181
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm a little bit older than that

2182
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I see what you did there

2183
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah I picked a video game

2184
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
That was made in the 1940's

2185
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
This is the legit

2186
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
First video game that existed

2187
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I am going so classic

2188
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Like some of your parents weren't alive

2189
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So chew on that

2190
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And actually

2191
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
If anyone ever remembers

2192
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
When I used to write for a geek life

2193
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I wrote for my

2194
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Geeks in History

2195
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
David Smith Jr.

2196
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Who basically is the guy that invented this

2197
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
He was from Greenville, South Carolina

2198
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Born in 1910

2199
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And he actually

2200
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Filed a patent

2201
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
For a game with

2202
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Estelle Ray Mann in 1948

2203
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That is a cathode ray tube

2204
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Game that uses radar displays

2205
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Used from World War II

2206
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And basically it's table tennis

2207
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
You had adjusting difficulties

2208
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
You would basically

2209
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Have paddles on either side

2210
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Very pong like

2211
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
If you want to have something that is a frame of reference

2212
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
But it would knock the ball

2213
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
From one side to the other

2214
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Using the same type of light moves

2215
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
On a radar screen

2216
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It had adjustable difficulties

2217
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
He also had

2218
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
A missile game

2219
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Using screen overlays

2220
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
You could shoot at targets

2221
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It was sort of like

2222
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
The Vectrex

2223
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But it used

2224
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Basically the CRT's electron gun

2225
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Kind of like an edge sketch

2226
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
The same type of

2227
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Theory behind it

2228
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Now how long before somebody

2229
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Drew a penis?

2230
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Using the technology

2231
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
45 seconds?

2232
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Rob, this was in the 40s

2233
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
People were so repressed

2234
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Like I said

2235
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
They made a cock overlay for it

2236
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And had

2237
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Becky said they didn't

2238
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Talk about it in public back then

2239
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
They were polite company Rob

2240
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Rob, you're so dirty Rob

2241
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Sorry I'm trying to

2242
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I will call her later if you push me

2243
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I love your mom, your mom's awesome

2244
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Okay but no

2245
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I'm imagining they put a little

2246
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Penis shaped overlay on it

2247
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And had the little white ball shoot out of the top

2248
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Anyway

2249
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Basically it detected

2250
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
The targets mechanically

2251
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And then

2252
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I'm just going to read this here

2253
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
By connecting a cathode retube to an oscilloscope

2254
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And devising knobs that controlled

2255
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
The angle and trajectory of the light

2256
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Traces displayed on the oscilloscope

2257
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
They were able to invent a missile game that when

2258
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Using the overlays created the effect of firing

2259
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Missiles at various targets

2260
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So we're looking at the history

2261
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Of video gaming starting right there

2262
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I mean unless you want to talk about

2263
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Why can I never remember

2264
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Her name too

2265
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Lady that created the first programming language

2266
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Lord Byron's daughter

2267
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Why can't I remember her name?

2268
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Do you remember?

2269
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I don't remember her name

2270
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Lady Byron?

2271
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
No

2272
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
But I mean

2273
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
She invented the first programming language

2274
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So we could just go back to her but

2275
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Still

2276
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Are you looking at

2277
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I'm trying to look it up

2278
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Ada Lovelace, thank you

2279
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Ada Lovelace

2280
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So yeah

2281
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
This guy here pretty much

2282
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Without him screwing around

2283
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
With radar screens

2284
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Would we have

2285
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Earth Defense Force

2286
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Just ask him

2287
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Alright

2288
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Thank you World War 2

2289
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
For making video games

2290
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
There it is your classic game of the week

2291
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Radar games

2292
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Radar games

2293
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Radar Love

2294
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Is that what you're going to name it?

2295
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Radar Love

2296
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
We should have played the song in the background

2297
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That's great

2298
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Let's see

2299
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Akuma JP linked this to me

2300
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And this was definitely worth playing

2301
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
With the prior story

2302
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
This is Tomb Raider Japanese voice acting

2303
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
But I want to point out

2304
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
This is the older Tomb Raider

2305
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This is not from the new game

2306
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's a Sega Saturn Sony Playstation game

2307
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
She's watching a computer there

2308
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Let me fast forward

2309
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
To a loading screen

2310
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Good lord

2311
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That's the tutorial telling her how to play the damn game

2312
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
This is not a great video

2313
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
This represented the voice acting here

2314
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Let me go back

2315
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You know what forget it

2316
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's lost its

2317
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I wanted the British accent

2318
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Thank you Royal Steel U.T.

2319
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's a cathode ray tube amusement device

2320
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm still calling it Radar Love

2321
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I like Radar Love it's easier to remember

2322
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Alright

2323
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Let's take a break guys

2324
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
We're going to take a break but when we come back

2325
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
There is plenty more to come

2326
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
We have some rapid fire news for you guys

2327
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And why not

2328
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
We're going to play match game tonight

2329
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So stay tuned guys

2330
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Match game and more when we come back

2331
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

2332
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Episode number 500

2333
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Hi there this is Blocko Jones

2334
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio

2335
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The show where every gamer has a voice

2336
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And I want to use my voice to tell you

2337
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You should all play Ni No Kuni

2338
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Rob you should beat Ni No Kuni

2339
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Now that I said in the bumper you have to beat Ni No Kuni

2340
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Or you have to play this bumper forever

2341
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Never

2342
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Never I'll never beat it you know why

2343
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Because I have gamer ADD I never beat games

2344
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Welcome back everybody you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio

2345
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Episode number 500

2346
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
In progress here

2347
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And if you want to send in a bumper

2348
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Like Blocko Jones did

2349
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And we have one other bumper that was

2350
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Sent in and I'll let you know who that

2351
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Was next week when we play it

2352
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That's quite an empty space there

2353
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
We're looking for more bumpers

2354
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
More information at the VoG network forums

2355
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
VoGnetwork.com

2356
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
If you want to send in a bumper for future use on the show

2357
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Because you know we do say it is the show where every

2358
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Gamer has a voice and we mean it

2359
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
We want to hear from more of you guys and what you want to use your voice

2360
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
To tell people here on the show

2361
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Alright

2362
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Moving on

2363
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
You doing okay

2364
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I think it might be time for me to have one more shot

2365
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Should I do one more shot

2366
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Alright I'm going to go get one more shot

2367
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
What would you use

2368
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Like I'm never going to discourage you from getting shit faced

2369
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
What would you use your voice to tell people

2370
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What would I use my voice to tell people

2371
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I would use my voice to tell people to give me money

2372
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Because I'm broke and hire me

2373
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
That's what

2374
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
That's what I'm going to use my voice for

2375
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Jamie that hasn't worked for 500 episodes

2376
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And it's not going to work now

2377
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And I think you forgot the whole thing where

2378
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
We're not trying to profit off the show

2379
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I just want a job

2380
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Listen to my voice

2381
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You want me to market your stuff

2382
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I can sell you anything

2383
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Rob would you sell anything

2384
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That I offered you to buy

2385
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I mean

2386
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Rob says yes

2387
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
He's off the mic

2388
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Yes I would go directly to eBay and sell all that crap

2389
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Hey

2390
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Alright

2391
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Okay shot time

2392
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
What's this cheers to

2393
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
The

2394
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
By the way these are double shots

2395
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
To the air we breathe

2396
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The air from my lungs

2397
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Rob just shivered and made stink face

2398
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Awesome

2399
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's fiery

2400
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's flaming

2401
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Alright I got your email

2402
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And I am so sorry I didn't get a chance to reply

2403
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
To a zombie princess

2404
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Is this personal chat time here on ORR

2405
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Hey it's money shut up

2406
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Alright

2407
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Moving on let's get to

2408
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Rapid fire news

2409
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And talk about what else is going on in the video game industry

2410
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Coming up the FUGL question of the week

2411
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Match game in this segment as well

2412
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
We're going to get players for that soon

2413
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
But first Loki

2414
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about

2415
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Ridge Racer

2416
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
That's right Ridge Racer

2417
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Driftopia

2418
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Is a new game that they announced that they're going to be putting out

2419
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
No it's not like your classic Ridge Racer

2420
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
It's actually kind of an extension

2421
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Of Ridge Racer Unbounded

2422
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Which is done by Bugbear

2423
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And they're doing a new one

2424
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It's going to be a free to play game

2425
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
So you're going to have

2426
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I guess the ability to buy cars, repair kits, and XP packs

2427
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Hopefully it's just not going to be crippled

2428
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
By the free to play stuff

2429
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It's coming to PS3 and PC

2430
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Hurry

2431
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
This is something I actually backed on

2432
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
On Kickstarter, Road Redemption

2433
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
It is a spiritual successor to

2434
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Road Rash, it's in 3D

2435
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And they're looking for $160,000

2436
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Over the next 30 days

2437
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And

2438
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
As of right now I believe

2439
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
They're not quite there

2440
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
They are

2441
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Let's see

2442
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
$34,000

2443
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Not bad, so I think they'll make it

2444
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
And it looks kind of neat

2445
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It is not though done by anybody

2446
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And last but not least

2447
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

2448
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's fantastic

2449
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
If you haven't watched the trailer yet

2450
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
For the game

2451
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You should definitely check it out

2452
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
They even have a fake 80's cartoon

2453
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
That they made for the advertisement

2454
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
For this game

2455
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Seriously, buy this game when it comes out in the first

2456
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's out on Steam

2457
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And PS3 and

2458
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Xbox 360

2459
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Hopefully all around at the same time

2460
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
They have, instead of loading screens

2461
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
They have tracking screens

2462
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Like VHS tracking

2463
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
It's awesome

2464
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So what does that mean?

2465
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It does the little fuzzy wuzzies

2466
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Like a tape that's been de-magnetized

2467
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's all fuzzy and then there's the tracking

2468
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Thing going back and forth on the bottom

2469
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Can you adjust it?

2470
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
No

2471
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And it's great that they have tool tips on there

2472
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
For example, fast travel

2473
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Is like traveling

2474
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Fast

2475
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Or

2476
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Guns, or was it

2477
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Shooting enemies within range

2478
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Will cause them damage

2479
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I need this in my life

2480
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright

2481
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Let's get to

2482
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Some other stories here

2483
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
This is interesting

2484
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Armature Studio was working on an unreleased

2485
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Mega Man first person shooter

2486
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Called Maverick Hunter

2487
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
This is in a report from Polygon

2488
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Armature Studio is the Austin based developer

2489
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
That was formed from Retro Studios originally

2490
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Yeah, it was a Mega Man X first person shooter

2491
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I don't know if that necessarily means

2492
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You know, like Mega Man Legends or all that

2493
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
But I think this was supposed to be a little more

2494
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Like, you know, hardcore

2495
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Or something like that

2496
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Capcom did cancel the project

2497
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
You know, cause Mega Man Universe and Mega Man Legends 3

2498
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
All those went to hell, so why not this one as well

2499
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Armature did have a prototype in 2010

2500
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And it looks like there was a little screenshot

2501
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
That leaked to the web as well

2502
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I watched it already

2503
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
How'd it look? I didn't see the video

2504
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It gave me a lot of vibe

2505
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I don't know if it would have been this bad

2506
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But it gave me a lot of the

2507
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Bomberman

2508
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Act Zero vibe

2509
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Cause it didn't really look like Mega Man

2510
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
He was firing, you know, like machine guns

2511
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And stuff like that

2512
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And, you know, just kind of fighting some generic

2513
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Looking robots and doing all sorts of weird

2514
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Take downs and stuff

2515
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It just didn't seem very much like Mega Man

2516
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It looked neat, but I don't know if it was necessarily

2517
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Mega Man

2518
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I don't know

2519
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I would have probably played it, but

2520
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I don't know

2521
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
He sort of resembled Mega Man

2522
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I mean, I can kind of see the look

2523
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But it was very Bomberman Act Zero-ish

2524
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Ubisoft

2525
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Has picked up German developer related

2526
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Designs

2527
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
They made the Anno strategy series

2528
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Including Anno 1404

2529
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Which is Dawn's Discovery over here

2530
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Ubisoft previously held a 30% share

2531
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
In the company, but they have purchased the other 70%

2532
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
It is undisclosed for how much

2533
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That went for, but you can expect more

2534
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Strategy style games for Ubisoft in the near future

2535
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Unfortunately, Atari

2536
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Closed a studio this week

2537
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
They closed Eden Games

2538
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Which was the mind behind Test Drive Unlimited

2539
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
And Alone in the Dark

2540
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
A long time ago

2541
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
This is according to a report from Eurogamer

2542
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I can't believe they closed that

2543
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Studio after such a wonderful game

2544
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Like Alone in the Dark

2545
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I like the Test Drive games

2546
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
The problem was

2547
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It wasn't Forza

2548
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It just wasn't

2549
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
That same level

2550
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
They had a charm of their own

2551
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
To get away from the police, you drove in the grass

2552
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I can't get you, you've left a road

2553
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
How am I going to get you now?

2554
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Damn you grass

2555
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And also, Lamborghinis make really awesome

2556
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Off-road vehicles

2557
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Twitch Game Guru in our chatroom

2558
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
At live.vognetwork.com says

2559
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Atari still exists?

2560
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
What have they put out lately?

2561
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Actually, they were supposed to be liquidating soon

2562
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Weren't they? Because all their properties

2563
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Are supposed to be up for sale

2564
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I don't know what happened to that

2565
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's supposed to happen

2566
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Marble Madness up for sale

2567
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Somebody needs to pick up Marble Madness

2568
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's an Xbox Live Arcade

2569
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
PlayStation Network thing worth

2570
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Picking up for sure

2571
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
They would have to do a lot to Marble Madness though

2572
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
More stages than 6

2573
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And longer levels

2574
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And more challenges

2575
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

2576
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I have some stuff and things

2577
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It would help if I was actually on the right window

2578
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
On my stupid iPad

2579
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
We have a new mobile game coming out soon

2580
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
The Prince of Persia

2581
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
The Shadow and the Flame

2582
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Is going to mobile on that

2583
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Fun date

2584
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That we like to refer to as

2585
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Soon

2586
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But soon

2587
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And it's

2588
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Being developed by

2589
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Ubisoft Pune

2590
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Ubisoft Pune?

2591
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
What?

2592
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
P-U-N-E

2593
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
You say it

2594
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Who likes the Pune?

2595
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Come over to Ubisoft

2596
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
You gave me this story

2597
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So you can give me shit

2598
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Get yourself the Pune

2599
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
You gave me this story

2600
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Ubisoft and saved yourself from trying to

2601
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
It's Rob's fault

2602
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Do not get in the way of me blaming Rob for shit

2603
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I will judge you

2604
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Ok

2605
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Dark Souls

2606
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Cause I know that there are a lot of people out there who like this game

2607
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It sold 2.3 million copies worldwide

2608
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And that was

2609
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
From Software

2610
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That put this out

2611
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
They actually had an event to announce this out

2612
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
For the Japanese press

2613
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It sold 375,000 copies for PS3 in Japan

2614
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And 1.3 million internationally for PS3 and Xbox 360

2615
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
So yay for Dark Souls fans

2616
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You know what I think they should do with that series?

2617
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
They should get the guy that made

2618
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I want to be the guy

2619
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And have him help with level design

2620
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
For that game cause that would be awesome

2621
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Just to fuck with the fans

2622
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And make it so hard

2623
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That would make people jump off buildings

2624
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Or into bullet trains

2625
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And that type of thing

2626
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
It'd be like a rehash of the beginning of Suicide Club

2627
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And then last but not least

2628
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Oh ha ha

2629
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Remember that guy Adam Orth?

2630
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We were kind of giving him shit last week

2631
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Kinda

2632
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Well guess what? He quit

2633
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Either he quit or was fired

2634
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
He's the one that said

2635
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Sorry I don't get the drama about having an always on console

2636
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Every device is always on

2637
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
That's the world we live in

2638
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Hashtag deal with it

2639
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
He decided to retire so he could get all the Pune

2640
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Well

2641
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Rob

2642
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I've been drinking leave me alone

2643
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Well someone actually went back and asked him

2644
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Did you learn nothing from Diablo 3 or SimCity

2645
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
You know some people's internet goes out right

2646
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Deal with it is a shitty reason

2647
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And he replied electricity goes out too

2648
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
That somebody worked for BioWare if I remember right

2649
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Manveer

2650
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Could that have just been friends

2651
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Giving each other shit cause I'm way

2652
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Way meaner to people on Twitter than that guy was

2653
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Well

2654
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I mean the person made another good point

2655
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You lived in Seattle, San Francisco, LA

2656
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Very connected places try living in

2657
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Jamesville, Wisconsin or Blacksburg, Virginia

2658
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And then he said why on earth

2659
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Would I live there

2660
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
It's a fair question

2661
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I mean I'm sorry

2662
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
But

2663
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Come on like you haven't said way worse shit

2664
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
On the internet like you haven't said way worse shit

2665
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I'm completely innocent

2666
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Yeah but I've said shit about places I've actually lived

2667
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Look

2668
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I get it though this is just the day and age

2669
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
That we live in is that you know

2670
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Whether or not you want to represent your company

2671
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
When you are the creative director for Microsoft

2672
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There are people that are going to read way

2673
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Too much into your stuff

2674
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Like you know create a second account

2675
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That's anonymous or something like that

2676
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
But like cause I mean if you're like

2677
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Working at Microsoft you don't go

2678
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I don't understand what the big deal is

2679
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You're the creative director for Microsoft

2680
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You don't go posting shit on the internet

2681
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Unless you hate your job

2682
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Do you think that he ever imagined

2683
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
That the entirety of gaming

2684
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Online would read so

2685
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Much into his tweets

2686
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
People on the internet don't think about consequence

2687
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Usually

2688
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I know right

2689
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
No one put a gun to his head to tell him to be stupid

2690
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Yeah but some people are just stupid

2691
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Okay but by your guys definition

2692
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Is stupid I act stupid all the time

2693
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Yes you do Rob

2694
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I don't but I

2695
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Rather I like my job

2696
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And I wouldn't want to lose it due to my opinion

2697
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But I'm also smart enough to not talk about my industry

2698
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Well exactly and no matter how drunk

2699
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
You might be right now Rob I've seen you far drunker

2700
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And even in

2701
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
You've seen me at my most drunkest

2702
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And even in the depths of inebriation

2703
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I have never seen you said I'm gonna go post

2704
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
About my work on Tumblr or Twitter

2705
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Me

2706
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Rob's never done that I have seen you kiss a girl

2707
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Which was very weird

2708
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Why are we bringing this up?

2709
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Because you were drunk

2710
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
What does me kissing a girl

2711
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Have to do with an always online Xbox

2712
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It's less offensive than this guy

2713
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I love watching Rob turn red it's hilarious

2714
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
He is literally like blowing

2715
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I almost want to put that into a poll question

2716
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
What's more offensive Rob kissing a girl

2717
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Or that guy

2718
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So anyway

2719
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
The guy actually

2720
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Apart from

2721
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Somehow or another losing

2722
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
His means of employment

2723
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Which by the way I'm open for employment

2724
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Microsoft you can hire me

2725
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I don't go saying stupid shit on the internet just saying

2726
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Are you sure? Rob

2727
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
500 episodes dark soccer

2728
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I don't say stupid shit about my job

2729
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Honey you've said a lot of stupid shit on this show

2730
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I have said a lot of stupid shit on this show

2731
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
A real friend will tell you that

2732
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I love this show

2733
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I admit it

2734
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Anyway the dude actually locked

2735
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
His Twitter and deleted

2736
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
His linked in account

2737
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So yeah he's like

2738
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I'm going to hide now

2739
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Can you blame him?

2740
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I don't blame him he's kind of stupid

2741
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
If freaking loltaku is going to be posting everything

2742
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
That you tweet about then yeah

2743
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It's suddenly going to become a new headline

2744
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Then yeah I'd go into hiding too

2745
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And you all want to know why I don't use my real name

2746
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
On this show because you know

2747
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I like my job

2748
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I just don't care

2749
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
What about all this mess or what?

2750
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Everything

2751
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
You don't care about everything

2752
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I just don't care I still didn't get

2753
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Other than the fact that his comments

2754
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Are a little insensitive to the fact that

2755
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Hey there are a lot of people

2756
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
That are trying to figure out what this new

2757
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Xbox is going to be like and

2758
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The rumors that it's going to be online only

2759
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And then you come out and say well I don't see

2760
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
The problem with that is I mean after all it sounds

2761
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Like a fucking wonderful thing

2762
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And then you start being insensitive to everybody

2763
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
That people might be a little bit

2764
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Pissed off about that and you just don't

2765
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Understand why well

2766
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Come on can't you put yourself

2767
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
In other people's shoes obviously not

2768
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Why would I want to live there?

2769
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Obviously they're not asking you to move to this

2770
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Fucking city they're talking about hey be

2771
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Empathetic

2772
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And by the way Rob just for the record I'm not offended

2773
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I was just like that's bizarre

2774
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Well it's Queen Simeon

2775
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Chat says well hey if some people become

2776
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Bicurious when inebriated

2777
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Look I just like to make out okay

2778
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I cook

2779
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
What's wrong with that?

2780
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
It's actually a true story I cook when I'm drunk

2781
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Who doesn't like enjoy a little kissy kissy

2782
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Every now and then come on

2783
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You guys were playing spin the bottle

2784
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And I was the only one sober because I had to drive

2785
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Which was boring

2786
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
This was like ten years ago too

2787
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
This was at the U.N. Loki apartment

2788
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That was a long time ago

2789
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I remember that

2790
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I think you were there

2791
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I remember you

2792
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Some of the things that happened when you weren't there Loki

2793
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I remember you like

2794
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Matrix walking up the

2795
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Or trying to matrix walk up the wall

2796
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That was fun

2797
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Remember the

2798
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
DDR parties

2799
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
People would

2800
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Inevitably end up like retardedly drunk

2801
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And then try to play DDR

2802
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And hit their head on the washing machine

2803
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
That was behind the monitor

2804
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I don't know anything about that

2805
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
La la la la

2806
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Let's see going to

2807
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
The chat SSJ100 Matt talking about this guy

2808
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Says he got death threats the gaming community

2809
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Is sad that is stupid

2810
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
That is stupid

2811
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
The action

2812
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Needs to be taken against the people who are making

2813
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Death threats over a video

2814
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Game console

2815
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Priorities people

2816
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
This is a problem though with the internet in general

2817
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Is that it has added this

2818
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Air of anonymity where people can just let the worst

2819
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Parts of their personality out

2820
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Without any sort of real consequence

2821
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Except unless you know how to track

2822
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
IPs

2823
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And then you can message them back and tell them where they live

2824
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Alright is there anything else

2825
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
You want to share with us for rapid fire

2826
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
News that has gone on for 20 minutes?

2827
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I'm done

2828
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Let's get to the FUGL question of the week

2829
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And let's see how many of them I can make it through tonight

2830
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
FUGL question of the week

2831
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Where's my FUGL song

2832
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I can sing

2833
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Becky can sing

2834
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
She's a good singer

2835
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Facebook, Google

2836
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Put them together you get FUGL

2837
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And every week we ask a question

2838
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And we read some of the answers here on the show

2839
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
There's a lot of answers tonight you guys

2840
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Who is your favorite character in a video game ever and why?

2841
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Easy right?

2842
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I thought you know it's a special episode

2843
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Let's keep it simple let's keep it positive

2844
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Do it

2845
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright so who's your favorite character in a video game and why?

2846
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Redertainment on Google Plus says

2847
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I like it whenever I'm able to play with myself

2848
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And we're done thank you everybody

2849
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
It's been a great show I'll see you later

2850
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
See you next week

2851
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Episode 501

2852
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Thanks for joining us tonight

2853
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
That was clue worthy Rob

2854
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I like whenever I'm able to play with myself

2855
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I like playing with characters

2856
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That I can style to be like myself

2857
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Or an idealized version of myself

2858
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That's the unique thing about video games

2859
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Rare is the media platform

2860
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
That allows yourself to project yourself

2861
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Into the media experience

2862
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Rare is the media platform

2863
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That not only allows you to

2864
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Right encourages you to play with yourself

2865
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I think I see what you're doing there Redertainment

2866
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And didn't he marry our own little angel?

2867
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Huh? Redertainment?

2868
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
No it was not Redertainment

2869
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You're thinking of big red pimp

2870
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Different red

2871
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Sorry

2872
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Shane just messaged me other memories

2873
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Of things that happen in that apartment that are not

2874
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Appropriate for error

2875
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Send me a message

2876
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
No I'm telling him to

2877
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Flaco Jones says I have to go with

2878
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
GLaDOS

2879
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I've been drinking you guys

2880
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
As if she wasn't already worthy of the title

2881
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
After the first game

2882
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Portal 2 manages to give her even more depth

2883
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And a backstory as well

2884
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
She also may be the most quotable character

2885
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
In a video game history

2886
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
More quotable than the old guy in Legend of Zelda?

2887
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
It's dangerous to go alone

2888
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Kirby of course

2889
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Despite popular belief he doesn't suck

2890
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Evil says

2891
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Missing no

2892
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
By a simple random encounter you get

2893
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Infinite rare candies and master

2894
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Balls for the cost of being disgraced

2895
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
In the hall of fame

2896
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And Dasnichi replies

2897
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Solid snake

2898
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
But are you still gonna feel that way

2899
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
If it's not David Hayter?

2900
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
That's my question

2901
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I need to not listen to

2902
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Any more of this while I'm having drinks

2903
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
What, these lulls?

2904
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Ok so on Facebook we have

2905
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
30 responses, should I read them all?

2906
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
30 responses on Facebook

2907
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Grandpa says Mega Man

2908
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
After he acquires the boss's skill powers

2909
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
He's very versatile, I like my men

2910
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
My men versatile

2911
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
DarkSakura

2912
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
replied but nobody cares

Tim P.

2914
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
replied and said Commander Shepherd

2915
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
He's the sexy space marine

2916
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I always wished I could be

2917
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
He said he, a brochep fan

2918
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
A brochep fan

2919
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
There are no room for dude chefs in my head

2920
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Burr replied and said

2921
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Sonic the hedgehog

2922
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Too fast for the naked eye

2923
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Sonic the hedgehog, Sonic

2924
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
He can really move, Sonic he's got an attitude

2925
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Sonic he's the fastest thing alive

2926
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Anyway to me as a kid that was the moment

2927
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
When video games started to be cool

2928
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And not just goofy fun with ridiculous looking characters

2929
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I'll always have a soft spot for Sonic

2930
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
as a series

2931
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Sil replied Garrus

2932
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
First time I thought an alien was damn hot

2933
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I love you Sil

2934
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Dark Tetsuya said pantsless rage

2935
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Just kidding, in all seriousness I'd have to go

2936
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
with Solid Snake

2937
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
That was an old ass

2938
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
That was an old ass

2939
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
That was an old joke

2940
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Gamergirl says

2941
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Sophie, later known as Protos Hyas

2942
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Ok this music

2943
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
is starting to not do it for me

2944
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
From Tails of Graces F

2945
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
because she's odd

2946
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Red the Haze says

2947
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Renegade femshep

2948
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I've never had a favorite game character but

2949
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Renegade femshep comes to mind

2950
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You know what, I actually have to

2951
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
kind of agree with that playing Renegade femshep

2952
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
is pretty fun, except in some

2953
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
situations then it's just bitchy

2954
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
But I'm playing one right now with Ashley's face

2955
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It's really funny

2956
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
James S. replied and said

2957
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
There's a sorely underrated mid-90s

2958
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
NX game called The Illusion

2959
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
of Gaia, that game rules

2960
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I have this game

2961
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Good choice

2962
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
The journey that young Will endures in hopes to find out

2963
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
what became of his father who ventured off

2964
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
before him ultimately changes the course of the

2965
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
entire world

2966
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
This game came out during a time when games of this art style

2967
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
weren't just for children

2968
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
The themes were adult and the story utterly breathtaking

2969
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
The music alone gives me chills

2970
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It was part of a three part series

2971
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Soul Blazer was one of them

2972
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Oh god, I can't remember the first

2973
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
other game in the series

2974
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
There's one other game in the series

2975
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It's Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia and there was another one

2976
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Dammit, well somebody in chat will remember

2977
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah, somebody in chat do our

2978
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
work for us

2979
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Andrew S. said

2980
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
The Chesire Cat from American McGee

2981
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
He's creepy and psychologically

2982
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
sane and insane at the same time and always

2983
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
cool and collected

2984
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Bobby Blackwolf says

2985
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Dot in Adventure, he was so brave

2986
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
He was

2987
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
He had to figure out how to get through that maze

2988
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Thank you

2989
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Rasteel UT, Terranigma, that was it

2990
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Oh, Prince Brightstar actually brought it up

2991
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
first too, yes it was Terranigma was the other game

2992
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Shane replied and said

2993
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Another vote for Commander Shepard

2994
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
but only if he's full on paragon

2995
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
He sets the bar for what qualities

2996
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I'm looking for in a man, video game character

2997
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I mean

2998
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Gio Videa says

2999
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
The Eye Tetromino

3000
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Everyone always wants the eye

3001
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Alright, I have to go with Dante from the Devil May Cry

3002
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
series, a complete badass

3003
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
also a bit of an asshole, you really get to see

3004
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Dante go from reckless teen

3005
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
to equally reckless adult

3006
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Ronnie B says

3007
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Ico, he took me through a great journey

3008
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
He went through a lot in the story and overall the game was really

3009
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
original

3010
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Extover says Samus Aran and I don't need

3011
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
to explain why

3012
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Well yes you do

3013
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
The alternate universe extover thinks Nathan Drake

3014
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
is his favorite based on ass physics

3015
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Also Matt, my boyfriend's

3016
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
favorite is Yoshi

3017
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Wonder Dog Harold says

3018
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Leon S. Kennedy, he's so dreamy

3019
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Degenerate Johnny says

3020
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Kreia from Knights of the Old Republic 2

3021
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
From being one your companions

3022
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
at the beginning to becoming the ultimate

3023
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
villain at the end, you'll find that she's one of the

3024
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
most unique and best written characters you'll ever

3025
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
meet in a video game

3026
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Emily C. replied and said

3027
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I love all cosmos in Katamari Dimash

3028
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
He is so fun, flamboyant and makes me

3029
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
laugh every time, that's a really good choice

3030
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Barbara O. says

3031
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Toss up between Cloud from Final Fantasy 7

3032
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and Balthier from Final Fantasy 12

3033
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
We get to watch Cloud make a terrifying

3034
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
discovery about himself and then fight his way

3035
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
back from it. Balthier seems to be

3036
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
only a dashing pirate, but he

3037
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
slowly reveals both his trustworthiness

3038
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
and his strong moral convictions

3039
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
At least he's not talking about being a hero all the damn time

3040
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
These are all really good answers

3041
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Wolf O'Donnell from Star Fox

3042
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
because he can't let you do that

3043
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Wicked says

3044
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
My favorite has to be Kratos, not because

3045
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
of anything relatable, but due to his

3046
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
utter ferocity and severe brutality

3047
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I had not seen in a video game character beforehand

3048
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
It was almost like playing a villain, as cold-hearted

3049
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and brutal as he was

3050
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Kyrian G. says

3051
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Myak the Liar because his

3052
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
dialogue is extremely entertaining

3053
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
That or Luther, son of Scotia from

3054
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Lands of Lore 2, Guardians of Destiny

3055
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
who provided many sound bites to my family

3056
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
throughout the years

3057
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Edgar R. replies

3058
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
There's nothing like roaming the post-apocalyptic world

3059
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
beating up mini Power Rangers

3060
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and racing poison chihuahuas

3061
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Rob H. says

3062
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Guybrush Threepwood

3063
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
He's a mighty pirate who can hold his breath for 10 minutes

3064
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
and he also has a rubber chicken with a pulley

3065
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
in the middle. How can you not like that?

3066
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
There's a lot of unique answers

3067
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
tonight. I like this. That's why I'm reading them all

3068
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
because there's so many different ones

3069
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I feel equally about two characters

3070
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Samus Aran, she's awesome and badass

3071
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I fell in love with her in Super Metroid

3072
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
My other all-time

3073
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
fave is the adorable and amazing

3074
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Garrus. I wasn't too sure of him in Mass Effect

3075
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
1, but by 2 they made his character so much

3076
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
better. He's sweet, a bit of a dork,

3077
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
but kind. J. Link

3078
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
says Will from Illusion of Gaia

3079
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
There's two people that said that

3080
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Go figure

3081
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
People have good taste. I could relate at that age

3082
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
when I played the game about being the outcast

3083
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
change kid in class and having a clique

3084
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
of dorky friends. It also didn't hurt

3085
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
that the game story was amazing and I really

3086
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
fell in love with it as my first real RPG

3087
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Dave Falcon says

3088
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Duke Nukem. Why? Hail to the

3089
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
king, baby. Tiger Claw

3090
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
says I'm gonna have to say Mario. Why?

3091
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Because he always gets the girl in the end

3092
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Marinko says

3093
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Knuckles the Echidna

3094
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I can never say that. No one

3095
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
has better background music than that Red Demon

3096
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Pumpkin Hill, anyone?

3097
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Haseo Sumeruwagara says

3098
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
To be honest, I'd have to say Oran from Final Fantasy

3099
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
X, Travis Touchdown from No More

3100
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Heroes, and Big Boss from the Metal Gear

3101
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
series. I loved

3102
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Big Boss in the very first game.

3103
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
That was amazing. Lastly,

3104
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Slagkick says

3105
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Bayonetta. She's a fierce

3106
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
witch who kicks major ass and has great

3107
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
hair. Great hair. Fabulous.

3108
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
You know what? I'm actually starting

3109
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
that game next week. Good answers.

3110
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Bayonetta is freaking amazing.

3111
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Alright.

3112
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So, let's go around the table.

3113
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I'm curious what you guys all think. Dark

3114
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Sakura, I'll start with you as if this is gonna be a

3115
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
shock. Favorite game character of all time?

3116
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
The Guardian from

3117
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Guardian Legend.

3118
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Good pick. Why The Guardian?

3119
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Because Guardian Legend, first of all, is my favorite game.

3120
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And it was just

3121
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
it was really neat when playing through the game

3122
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
and then

3123
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
having to pause the game and going, is that

3124
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
a girl? That's a girl.

3125
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Yeah. And it was, you know,

3126
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
an early NES game that had

3127
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
a female protagonist. And yeah, we had Metroid

3128
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
but you didn't find out that Samus

3129
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
was female until you beat the

3130
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
game or put in Justin Bailey.

3131
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
You know, it was

3132
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
a character that was

3133
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
going around and kicking a lot of ass

3134
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
in one of the most difficult

3135
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
games I have ever played in my life.

3136
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And we all know how freaking hard that game

3137
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
is. I don't have nearly half the skill I used to

3138
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
have at that game. It's so amazing though.

3139
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I've beaten it. God, I wish that game

3140
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
would come back somehow. I don't really want

3141
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
like a remake necessarily, but just a spiritual

3142
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
successor of sorts. Well, I'm still trying to

3143
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I'm debating putting an MSX emulator on

3144
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
so I can play Gardic, the first one.

3145
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Yeah. Oh,

3146
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
sorry, anything else? Well,

3147
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
The Guardian Effect, yeah.

3148
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But

3149
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I also would have to, I mean,

3150
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
as far as classic gaming, that

3151
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
would be probably my favorite character.

3152
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Anything more modern,

3153
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta.

3154
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Yeah. Because, well,

3155
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I mean, I really would like to go with

3156
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
my own Shepard, but I have my own

3157
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
weird head canon. Then you're playing with yourself

3158
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
like ready to chamber. Then I'm playing with myself.

3159
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
And I can get dirty, especially the places my brain goes.

3160
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So, Hey all!

3161
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
So, um,

3162
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta just because

3163
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
it's totally fabulous. And I love

3164
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
her character concept. I love the game.

3165
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
It was completely over the top.

3166
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And I watched Dan play through it for a little while

3167
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
because I didn't, you know, really do a lot

3168
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
of console gaming after my surgery.

3169
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Except for playing Blue Dragon.

3170
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So, um, but I've got a lot more

3171
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
endurance in my hand now thanks to practicing a lot.

3172
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
So I'm going to sit down and try to play through

3173
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Bayonetta. So playing with yourself has gotten

3174
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
your hand a lot of practice. No, I've been drawing!

3175
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Shut up! Alright.

3176
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Becky, do you have a favorite

3177
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
that you'd want to mention?

3178
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Well, since the last time I

3179
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
played video games before Jamie got

3180
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
me hooked on Mass Effect was

3181
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
on my parents, Commodore 64.

3182
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Good choice.

3183
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I think I would probably have to say

3184
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
FemShep.

3185
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I like, I really like her

3186
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
mostly paragon with just a little bit of bitchiness

3187
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
here and there because it makes her feel human.

3188
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Very good. Very good answer.

3189
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You're in good company with some of our listeners tonight.

3190
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Loki?

3191
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
One of my favorite characters

3192
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
and unfortunately they better bring him

3193
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
back for the goddamn fourth game because that was

3194
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
a fucking mistake to kill him off.

3195
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Johnny Gap from the Saints

3196
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Row series. Fucking awesome

3197
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
awesome character.

3198
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Of course, voiced by

3199
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Daniel Dae Kim.

3200
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
From Lost and stuff.

3201
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Just awesome.

3202
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Really cool character.

3203
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That's probably it.

3204
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
My favorite video game character

3205
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
ever would probably be

3206
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Rydia from Final Fantasy IV.

3207
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
That's a good choice. Because

3208
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
just literally

3209
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
watching her grow up through the game

3210
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
and I have such an attachment to that story too

3211
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
because that game was so epic and

3212
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
that was really the first time most

3213
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
people in America saw the summoner

3214
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and that was such a badass thing when she would come back

3215
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
to your party and she had all those

3216
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
summons and you'd go to her homeland and everything

3217
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
and she used the whip which was cool and

3218
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
had the black magic and

3219
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
she was great.

3220
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Obviously she had to grow

3221
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
up a lot faster in that story and

3222
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
went through tragedy and overcame it.

3223
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
But I have such an attachment

3224
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
to Final Fantasy IV but Rydia was an

3225
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
amazing character.

3226
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Where Dan in this room, he would

3227
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
probably list Cain as one of his favorite characters

3228
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
from the same.

3229
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Or Zero.

3230
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I want to know what Allen

3231
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
would pick. Allen,

3232
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
sorry to put you on the spot. I know you came in here

3233
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
to get a snack but what's your favorite

3234
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
video game character ever?

3235
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Robo and Luca together.

3236
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Twins. OTP.

3237
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Good choice.

3238
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Good choice. Alright, thank you guys for

3239
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
participating with the Fugu Question of the Week. I know

3240
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
that was a lot this week. I read every

3241
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
single answer because you know what? It's a show where

3242
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
every gamer has a voice. Why not? Let's get back

3243
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
into some news. Loki.

3244
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Alright, so let's

3245
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
talk about some more Xbox rumors

3246
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
and hopefully, I don't

3247
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
know, I hope that these are all rumors

3248
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
so I don't know. This is kind of almost

3249
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
like the whole online thing.

3250
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
But once again, I

3251
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
still am under the assumption

3252
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
at least I guess hopeful assumption

3253
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
that Microsoft isn't dumb enough

3254
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
to have a console that's

3255
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
online only. That would

3256
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
be a major gaming console that's online only

3257
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
and maybe some of this kind of ties into it

3258
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
and it's this leaked

3259
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
roadmap that's been

3260
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
a new roadmap that they had.

3261
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Now, this is coming

3262
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
from VG Leaks so

3263
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
who knows? But basically saying that

3264
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
there's going to be two

3265
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Xboxes the next time around.

3266
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
There's going to be a mini Xbox that's going to

3267
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
operate kind of like an

3268
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Apple TV. Basically, all the

3269
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
video streaming stuff

3270
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
maybe even like Xbox Live Arcade

3271
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
that kind of thing. That

3272
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
will be online only because it will not have

3273
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
a disk drive. However,

3274
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
the regular console will

3275
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
not be online only.

3276
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
That makes a little more sense

3277
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
because an Apple TV

3278
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
kind of operates the same way. It's not

3279
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
necessarily online only but to get

3280
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
all the functionality of it, you have to be connected.

3281
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
You mean to use Netflix? I have to be online?

3282
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Shut the front door.

3283
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And they're saying

3284
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
that basically the

3285
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
whole

3286
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
tying in with the TV is going to be

3287
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
a big thing. Basically, they're saying the smaller

3288
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Xbox is to compete with the Apple TV

3289
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
but also provides XBLA and

3290
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
360 game support

3291
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
which will give it an edge over the Apple

3292
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
TV. Basically,

3293
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
saying that the rumors of the online

3294
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
only requirement

3295
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
come from the smaller Xbox unit which may

3296
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
not have a disk drive like Apple TV.

3297
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
It would require

3298
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
a network connection and internet

3299
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
to provide any real functionality.

3300
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It may be possible they will design

3301
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
both consoles to be stackable.

3302
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And

3303
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
of course, the original

3304
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
rumor was that Durango is not

3305
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
going to be backwards compatible

3306
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
which makes sense. It's a

3307
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
different processor altogether.

3308
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
The PS4 is not going to be

3309
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
backwards compatible either.

3310
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Also, the Kinect, they're saying that

3311
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
a different department within

3312
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Xbox handles the Kinect hardware and

3313
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
software. The focus was more on developing

3314
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
and networking both consoles

3315
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
with Kinect more of an

3316
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
afterthought at that point. It says concerning

3317
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
dealing with it, it's less an issue than hardware changes.

3318
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
The main console, Kinect, isn't the

3319
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
primary focus. However,

3320
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
development kits require several pieces

3321
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
of hardware combined. All the potential

3322
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
hardware which may or may not be

3323
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
required to work with each other.

3324
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Which also includes the potential for any

3325
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
devices to require a network

3326
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
connection which is where that required

3327
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
rumor comes from.

3328
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I'm thinking

3329
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
I'm just hoping that it's not all

3330
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
online only. This sounds a little bit more

3331
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Microsoft. Microsoft's

3332
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
always been about streaming crap to your TV.

3333
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
They have the whole Windows

3334
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
XP Media Center edition and that kind of

3335
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
shit.

3336
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I could see them wanting to be in

3337
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
your living room and have this focus and

3338
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
stuff.

3339
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I'm just hoping that they don't make the mistake of

3340
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
having a console that's going to be a next gen

3341
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
console that's only online.

3342
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
After all, Microsoft's

3343
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
live service hasn't been working very

3344
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
well the last few days.

3345
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's not a good idea to say

3346
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
hey, we're going to be online only.

3347
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Ignore the fact that you couldn't connect

3348
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
to live the last few days.

3349
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Let me ask this though,

3350
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
because here we go again reporting

3351
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
on rumors.

3352
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I'm not saying us specifically,

3353
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
but I'm just talking the internet and the whole

3354
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
hype machine. Why do we keep

3355
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
reporting on rumors?

3356
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Because we don't have anything to go off of from

3357
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
them. All we know is that they're going to

3358
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
have

3359
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
some sort of, the rumor is that

3360
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
they're going to have some sort of

3361
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
reveal at the end of May, but right now

3362
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
we have no information about it other than what's

3363
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
supposedly leaking out.

3364
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I think mainly discussing this, I'm not saying

3365
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
this is all fact. I'm just saying here's the rumor

3366
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
and I hope

3367
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
it's a little bit more on this side

3368
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
than it's always

3369
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
online. There is no other

3370
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
way about it.

3371
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I want to know how important talking

3372
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
about Xbox rumors are. You know what it's

3373
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
time for? I think it's time for us

3374
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
to poll the listeners.

3375
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
We're going to put up a live poll right

3376
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
now at live.vognetwork.com

3377
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
If you want to vote in the poll, make sure

3378
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
you're logged in. live.vognetwork.com

3379
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
How much weight

3380
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
do you give to Xbox

3381
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
rumors? It's Microsoft, it's

3382
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
all true. I think a lot of it is

3383
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
true, but I'm still quite skeptical.

3384
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,

3385
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

3386
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Or the internet is full of lies

3387
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
and slander, and I don't

3388
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
believe any of it. Vote now

3389
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
live.vognetwork.com

3390
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Our Instant Poll

3391
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
We'll read the results

3392
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
here in a moment, and try to

3393
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
get some of the answers as they come in.

3394
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Alright.

3395
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
And then one other thing also,

3396
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
another rumor coming along with

3397
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
some of the launch titles. Next-Gen

3398
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Forza game, Rise,

3399
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
a couple weeks ago I've been talking about

3400
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Rise saying, where the fuck was that

3401
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
gladiator game that showed that it was supposed to be a

3402
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Kinect title? So that

3403
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
may be something that's going to be there. And then

3404
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
some sort of, you know, kind of

3405
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Nintendo Land-esque Kinect

3406
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
game. Although I

3407
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
am seeing a lot of Kinect titles, two of those

3408
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
being Kinect-required titles, so

3409
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
ehhhhh

3410
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Not interested, but

3411
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Forza sounds cool. Forza Horizon.

3412
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Next-Gen Forza Horizon, I could be down with that.

3413
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Alright, right now in our Instant

3414
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Poll, very much, it's very tilted

3415
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
towards the bullshit side of things.

3416
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
67% of the vote for

3417
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,

3418
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

3419
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
21% saying the internet is full of

3420
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
lies and slanders, I don't believe any of it.

3421
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So only 13%

3422
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
of the vote at this point, I think the math doesn't add up because

3423
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
it just updated, 13% of the vote

3424
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
right now only slightly leans true.

3425
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Zero people saying

3426
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
it's all true. Zero.

3427
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Rob, it's on the

3428
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
internet, of course it's true. Well, some

3429
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
people would think that. You know what,

3430
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
honestly, I almost lean towards that top

3431
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
option. With Microsoft, there's

3432
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
very little that's fake anymore

3433
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
it seems. But we'll see.

3434
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
We'll leave that poll up for about another minute.

3435
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Again, live.vognetwork.com, live on this

3436
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Sunday evening if you want to vote in that poll.

3437
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I think we're all still UT has it wrong, instead of the internet

3438
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
being 10% lies and 90% porn.

3439
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I think it's 10% lies,

3440
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
10% hate,

3441
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
and 80% porn.

3442
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
YYR in our chatroom asking

3443
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
where is the poll? It will show

3444
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
up automatically at live.vognetwork.com

3445
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
if you are logged

3446
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
into the site. If you're not

3447
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
logged into the site, it may not

3448
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
show up for you.

3449
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
This is a feature that's in beta

3450
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
right now. Trademark.

3451
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
So you can't talk about it to anybody.

3452
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Literally, this

3453
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
was not tested.

3454
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
We are testing it as the show goes on.

3455
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
So, there you go.

3456
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Alright. You're all under NDA

3457
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
you can't talk about it.

3458
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Alright, we'll do one more story and then I'll go to the results of that poll.

3459
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I'll shut it off and do that.

3460
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
This is a story about Animal Crossing and I

3461
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
can't flippin' believe this.

3462
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I know, right? That's the same sound I make.

3463
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Mr. Resetti

3464
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
from Animal Crossing, optional

3465
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
in New Leaf. What?

3466
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
He is not there by

3467
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
default and this is because of

3468
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
QQ online.

3469
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Now, tell people

3470
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
about Mr. Resetti for those that don't know Dark Star.

3471
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
If you didn't save your game

3472
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and just turned off your

3473
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Animal Crossing, you turned off the system

3474
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
where you had Animal Crossing loading.

3475
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
When you started your game back up

3476
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
this mole comes out of the ground

3477
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
and yells at you

3478
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
for ten minutes

3479
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
in all capital huge letters

3480
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
and from what

3481
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I understand, because I tried doing it on my Japanese

3482
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
version, he's really freakin' rude.

3483
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
And it was just absolutely

3484
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
hilarious. He's like, what did you do in resetting

3485
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
this form? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3486
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
And he freakin' chews you out.

3487
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
This mole, bitter

3488
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
crass,

3489
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
grumpy old mole

3490
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
digs his self out of the hole just to give

3491
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
you shit for not saving your game.

3492
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
This is not popular in our chat.

3493
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Gamegirl says, what? He's the best part

3494
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
of the game. YYR says, it's blasphemy.

3495
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Gameguru says, Mr. Resetti

3496
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
has been fired. No, he's not

3497
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
fired. Let me clarify here.

3498
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
In a column called Iwata

3499
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Asks, Resetti's

3500
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
status was updated.

3501
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Apparently out of guilt

3502
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
the developers made him optional

3503
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
in Animal Crossing New Leaf because

3504
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
apparently he brought some players to

3505
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
tears. Good!

3506
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Save your game!

3507
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They also changed the goal of the

3508
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
game from paying off Tom Nook

3509
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
to improving the town as the mayor.

3510
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So Tom Nook is no longer your

3511
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
pimp. YYR says, Mr.

3512
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Resetti is a critical feature of Animal Crossing.

3513
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It is required for the game to

3514
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
work properly. He handles many of the game's calculations

3515
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
so it's technically impossible to run Animal

3516
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Crossing without it. Strudels89

3517
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
says, he was a dick, lol.

3518
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Loki's a dick, but we all

3519
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
love him. We keep him around.

3520
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
He's a vital part

3521
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
of the show. We couldn't do calculations

3522
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
without him. In fact, you know what?

3523
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You know what we used to do all the time?

3524
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Fucking time travel. Fuck that

3525
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Resetti. Hell yeah. I'm time traveling like

3526
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
fucking Marty McFly.

3527
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I would travel to my birthday every

3528
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
year just to get more shit.

3529
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Now in an article on Destructoid, I

3530
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
really like this point about it, but in an article

3531
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
published on Destructoid, they talked about how it was

3532
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
one of the more creative fourth-wall

3533
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
breaking moments in gaming history

3534
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
along with Psycho Mantis reading

3535
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
your save files on the Playstation card.

3536
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I see you like Final Fantasy.

3537
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Did he actually? He only called

3538
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
that other Konami games, didn't he? No, I'm sorry.

3539
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
He said Xenogears

3540
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
and it was on there before

3541
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Xenogears. What am I saying? Are you thinking Castlevania?

3542
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
No. Yeah, he said Symphony of the Night

3543
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
because Dan and I had... Sweet Coden?

3544
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
It was Sweet Coden. That was it because Sweet Coden

3545
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
hadn't come out yet.

3546
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
By the way, we tried that

3547
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
with our Japanese save file for Castlevania

3548
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
and it did not work.

3549
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
But what do you guys think?

3550
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Is it a great fourth-wall breaking

3551
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
moment? I think more games should break the fourth-wall

3552
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
to be honest. I think so too, but it was pretty cool

3553
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
watching the controller move on the floor

3554
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
with Psycho Mantis.

3555
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Alright, that's going to bring our poll

3556
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
to an end at live.vognetwork.com

3557
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
So from the last story, here it is.

3558
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
How much weight do you give to Xbox Rumors?

3559
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
62% of the vote saying

3560
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits

3561
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

3562
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Hey, finally a vote.

3563
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
3% of the vote for it's Microsoft.

3564
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
It's all true.

3565
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Oh, poor naive child.

3566
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
12% I think a lot of it is true

3567
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
but I'm still quite skeptical.

3568
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
22% the internet is full of lies

3569
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
and slanders. I don't believe any of it.

3570
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Hasea Sumiragawa says a good point.

3571
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Deadpool will. I'm excited.

3572
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
But Deadpool you expected of Deadpool.

3573
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
You didn't quite expect that in Animal Crossing.

3574
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
To have a character come out of the ground

3575
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
and yell at you for 10 minutes.

3576
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Whereas, I mean didn't you

3577
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
ever read Deadpool

3578
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
in comics? It's supposed to happen.

3579
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Hi. You know what else people

3580
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
weren't expecting?

3581
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Video game match game

3582
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
coming back to OLR tonight. When was the last

3583
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
time we did this? It was a long time ago wasn't it?

3584
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
A while. It was a while.

3585
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
But we are going to do video game match game tonight

3586
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
but we need some contestants for video game

3587
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
match game. So let's get

3588
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
a listener in the chat room. Here's

3589
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
how we're going to pick a listener from the chat room.

3590
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
The first person to name

3591
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
that wants to play match game. First person

3592
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
to shout out in chat. What

3593
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
were the potato chips

3594
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
that Jamie got excited about when they

3595
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
were set on the table earlier in the evening?

3596
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
This is test your memory earlier in the show.

3597
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
First person to remember and shout it out in chat

3598
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
will get to play. And

3599
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
we'll take the first caller right now

3600
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
on the skype line 1877 game

3601
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
OLR or a user name on skype

3602
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
orange lounge radio. The first person

3603
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
to get through will get to play

3604
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
video game match game against

3605
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
our chat room

3606
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
listener who answers first which is

3607
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Mako Chan or Jovidea got the

3608
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
right answer. There it is. Mako Chan.

3609
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Alright so let me open

3610
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
up a chat window with Mako Chan.

3611
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Mako Chan from Makoto.

3612
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Oh my bad.

3613
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Well I keep thinking of the Mako from

3614
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Mass Effect.

3615
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
You know what? I kept calling it Mako

3616
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
because

3617
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I took too much Japanese.

3618
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And the answer was

3619
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Chicken and Waffles and JasonXV

3620
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
after that. CodeMan

3621
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
TimTRP

3622
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
got it. It wasn't the cheese bread. I just said the cheese

3623
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
bread was delicious. Alright let's see

3624
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
who Mako Chan is going to be competing against

3625
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
tonight. Let's go to the skype line right now. Hi you're on

3626
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god

3627
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I got in. You got in? Hi.

3628
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
OMG! Who is this?

3629
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
It's Raven's Dolphin. Raven's

3630
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Dolphin! You always come out

3631
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
for the big landmark episodes. I always

3632
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
love hearing from you. Oh my god I

3633
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
have to. You guys. I know you

3634
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
have to get to match game but I have to say

3635
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
you guys are an inspiration to me and my

3636
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
show. What I do. I look

3637
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
at you guys. I'm like wow they keep going.

3638
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I keep going. But

3639
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
it is absolutely a pleasure to be

3640
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
with you tonight. I totally love

3641
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
your icon by the way. It's gorgeous. Thank you

3642
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
so much and you know flattery will get you

3643
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
everywhere but it won't win you the match game.

3644
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
You can come over and have murder brownies.

3645
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Would you like a murder brownie?

3646
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Yes just send it over the internet

3647
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
please. I know you have to get to match game but I

3648
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
have to know one question. Alright

3649
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
fair enough. Alright

3650
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
so you've been doing this show for 11 years

3651
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
and was there

3652
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
a time that you said

3653
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I don't know if I can go on?

3654
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Yes.

3655
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Alright.

3656
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
That was episode 2.

3657
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Yes.

3658
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
If I

3659
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
followed through every time I

3660
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
threatened to quit the show there would have been about

3661
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
20 Orange Lounge radios by now but

3662
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
you know you find your motivation

3663
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
and you keep going and you know

3664
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
a lot of the drama tends to work itself

3665
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
out and you know drama is drama

3666
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
and drama

3667
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
was something I thrived a lot more on when I was

3668
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
in my 20s and now that I'm in my 30s

3669
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
it's like I don't know what else

3670
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I'd have if I didn't have O.L.R.

3671
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
The sad reality is

3672
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
the sad reality is

3673
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
this show will end someday.

3674
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I mean it has to. Everything comes to an end.

3675
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
But I like to think it's going to end because

3676
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
you know. Murder.

3677
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
It's not going to end in murder. It's going to end

3678
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
because Dark Sakura

3679
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
has to move for a great

3680
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
dream job of hers or something or

3681
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
you know low key. It had to be a hell of a dream job.

3682
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
You know I'm just saying like it's going to

3683
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
be something along those lines

3684
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
or you know the honest.

3685
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
It would have to be something that would dramatically change our

3686
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
dynamic. Or that

3687
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
you know we all sit down and we agree

3688
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
you know what we don't have the passion

3689
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
for this we once did. And I mentioned on a

3690
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
previous episode I sometimes worry about

3691
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
where the gaming industry is going when we talk about all this

3692
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
always online and

3693
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
the management thinking they know what's best

3694
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
for gamers. I sometimes sit here and wonder

3695
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
am I going to be a video game fan

3696
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
in a few years.

3697
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
But I like to think I would

3698
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and even if I fell out of

3699
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
love with new consoles the

3700
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
dynamic of the show would just shift again.

3701
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
We didn't start as a video

3702
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
game show.

3703
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Super Orange on Radio 2X.

3704
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I was there when you

3705
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
were at 2Go and I found you on a

3706
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
PSP website. Which

3707
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Loki still needs to update the freaking thing.

3708
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
No it was on a different PSP website.

3709
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Oh really?

3710
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Yeah it was on like this called

3711
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
PSP Drive and it was formatted for

3712
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
PSP and you were on there

3713
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
and I remember downloading it

3714
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
before the other sites and all that stuff.

3715
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
This was before Black Wolf and A1 and I went like

3716
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
oh Orange on Radio I'll download this.

3717
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Oh VGN I'll download this.

3718
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Yeah I have to admit Loki got

3719
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
on that PSP bandwagon really early

3720
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
and a lot of the PSP community really

3721
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
supported that older website. We were

3722
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
on whatever the AOL blog was for

3723
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
PSP before they all merged into Joystiq.

3724
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
We were featured on there once and

3725
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
that was really cool.

3726
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
As much as we joke about the PSP and that

3727
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
website and how out of date it is, that

3728
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
community really embraced Loki's

3729
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
little project so we really appreciate that.

3730
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Now it's

3731
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Stitcher and iTunes.

3732
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Yeah it's all about Stitcher and iTunes. Especially Stitcher

3733
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I think is really the wave of the future especially as

3734
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
iTunes continues to

3735
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
shove

3736
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
podcasting under the table.

3737
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
That's for another episode.

3738
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
I do have to share this. Frisbee says when that happens convert

3739
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
OLR to food and Disneyland talk.

3740
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
So Jon's like episode 501

3741
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
dull whips.

3742
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Ragenator in chat says I've been

3743
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
a fan of gaming for 32 years. I don't see

3744
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
myself losing my gaming passion.

3745
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
You know and I think ultimately I tend to

3746
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
agree. I may get really pissed off at some

3747
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
of the decisions that happen in the gaming industry

3748
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
but at the end of the day I could always come on

3749
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
here and talk about Commodore 64.

3750
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Right.

3751
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I keep going. You keep going.

3752
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
It's an inspiration. Of course.

3753
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Let's get to the match game.

3754
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
All right.

3755
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Do you know how the match game works Ravenstaufen?

3756
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Oh my god do I know.

3757
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I mean too bad we don't even have Charles Nelson

3758
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Wiley or that guy from

3759
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
from Family Feud.

3760
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Well you've got me. Awesome.

3761
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Richard Dawson. You've got me and

3762
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
you've got on the panel tonight you've got

3763
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Techmaster Loki is here joining us on the

3764
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
panel tonight. Hello. And Dark Soccer

3765
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
is here. Hi. And I'm here

3766
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
and Chef Becky is here.

3767
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Iron Chef Becky is here

3768
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
with her murder brownies to play

3769
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
with us. Hello. And Becky you're going to play with

3770
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
us too right? Sure. Sure why not.

3771
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
And then also joining us in studio

3772
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
tonight say hello to

3773
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Hello Mother Dolly.

3774
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Wow.

3775
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Oh Alan you're the best.

3776
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Or excuse me is it is it little

3777
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Alan tonight? It's not little Edie

3778
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
it's just Alan. Hello.

3779
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
All right Alan is going to be joining us tonight. So here's how

3780
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
it works for the listeners who may not know.

3781
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
We're going to read some statements

3782
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
and these statements will have a blank

3783
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
at the end of them or near

3784
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
the end of them. It's up to Ravens Dolphin

3785
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
and Mako Chan playing along

3786
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
in our chat room to guess what will

3787
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
be said in that blank by

3788
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
the hosts on the panel.

3789
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
For every answer they get right

3790
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
they will get a point.

3791
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
But like whose line is it anyway the

3792
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
points really don't matter. But we'll give our

3793
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
winner a little something. Listen to a no prize.

3794
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
All right. So here we go

3795
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
and Mako Chan if you're sitting there

3796
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
in our chat room be sure to

3797
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000

number one tonight.

3802
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Bobby Blackwolf.

3803
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
It's the first question

3804
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
it's got to be about Bobby.

3805
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf brought

3806
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
on the ire of 4chan

3807
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
this week by voicing his opinion

3808
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
on Twitter.

3809
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
He didn't really seem to care at

3810
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
first but he really lost

3811
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
it when they came for

3812
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
his blank.

3813
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Ding.

3814
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Bobby Blackwolf

3815
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
brought on the ire of 4chan

3816
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
this week by voicing his opinion on Twitter.

3817
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
He didn't really seem to care about

3818
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
it at first but he really

3819
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
lost it when they came for his blank.

3820
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Chatters you can help out

3821
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
by voicing your answer in our chat room

3822
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
live.vognetwork.com

3823
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
You know I actually did

3824
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
miss the whole 4chan

3825
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
thing I don't even know

3826
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It wasn't really that serious

3827
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Bobby had an opinion

3828
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
and some folks disagreed with it.

3829
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
You know what 4chan is for? Rolling my eyes.

3830
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And porn.

3831
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Ding for me.

3832
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Becky you good? You got an answer?

3833
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
She's thinking.

3834
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Peek over

3835
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Jamie show the iPad and get some help

3836
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
from the chatters. You have an answer

3837
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Alan?

3838
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
He really lost it when they came

3839
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
for his blank.

3840
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Am I supposed to say something now?

3841
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
No no not yet because we need Becky

3842
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
to ding first.

3843
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
She's

3844
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Oh Becky will do

3845
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
great. Help her out Jamie. Feed her one of the

3846
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
answers it'll be funny.

3847
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Does Becky not want to play?

3848
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Alright Becky doesn't want to play. Alright fine.

3849
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
It'll be four of us.

3850
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
It's because Becky hasn't met Bobby.

3851
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
She can't say it the same way.

3852
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Well here we go anyway.

3853
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
So Raven's

3854
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Wait let me make sure Mako got an answer in because I didn't even check.

3855
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I usually check for that first.

3856
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Here we go.

3857
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Raven's Dolphin

3858
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
The question is Bobby Blackwolf

3859
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
brought on the Ira 4chan this week by

3860
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
voicing his opinion on Twitter. He didn't really seem

3861
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
to care at first but he really lost it when they

3862
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
came for his

3863
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Ban hammer. His ban hammer.

3864
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Good answer good

3865
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
answer. It's the only thing I could

3866
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
come up with. Makochan in chat says

3867
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
when they came for his

3868
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Anon membership card

3869
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I did not know Bobby was in

3870
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Anon but apparently he was. Alright

3871
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
let's go around and see if we've got any match.

3872
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Ban hammer or Anon membership card.

3873
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Loki what did you get when they came for his

3874
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Fence. When they came for his

3875
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Fence. Not a match

3876
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
if you've been following the recent drama online.

3877
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
No when they came for his Fence.

3878
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Dark Sakura

3879
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
when they came for his Fence.

3880
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
When they came for his Fence.

3881
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
That's two for Fence. He really lost it

3882
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
when they came for his. Those damn kids

3883
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
and his Fence. Allen what did you say

3884
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
when they came for his.

3885
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Anti-brony propaganda.

3886
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Anti-brony propaganda.

3887
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Oh damn it. Not a match.

3888
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Not a match alright. And I said they

3889
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
that he really lost it when they came for

3890
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
his Clicky pen.

3891
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Clicky.

3892
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Clicky pen. I thought it was Clicky the pen.

3893
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Also not a match.

3894
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
But it's a Clicky pen.

3895
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Alright. The score

3896
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
let's look at the leaderboard right now.

3897
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Zero to zero.

3898
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Alrighty. Zero to zero.

3899
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Alright that's alright Ravensdorf and you

3900
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000

3901
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
tonight. Alright here we go.

3902
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Question number two.

3903
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Question number two

3904
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
is the cast

3905
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
of Orange Lounge Radio

3906
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
was really appreciative

3907
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
that Becky baked brownies for their

3908
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
500th episode.

3909
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000

02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Ding.

3915
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000

Alright.

3922
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Ding.

3923
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Loki said ding. Dark soccer ding.

you should cook the

3930
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
ferret. Cook the ferret.

3931
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
And Mako

3932
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Chan in chat said you

3933
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
should cook the ferret.

3934
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Oh

3935
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
boy alright well

3936
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
let's see what happens. It's

3937
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
going to be a tie either way but let's see how many

3938
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
points this may or may not earn them.

3939
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Loki yeah what did you say

3940
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
yeah she should cook the

3941
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
bacon el diablo. Bacon

3942
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
el diablo.

3943
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Great answer

3944
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
but not a match.

3945
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Alright. Dark

3946
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
soccer. I did go for obvious

3947
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
and say the ferret. The ferret did. Oh my

3948
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
god. It's a

3949
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
score on the match game leaderboard.

3950
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
One to one.

3951
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Ding ding ding ding.

3952
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
More points than people usually get during this.

3953
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Alright excellent. Uh

3954
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Alan

3955
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
she should cook the

3956
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I think this still counts but my answer

3957
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
was the bungee ferret. The

3958
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
bungee ferret. Let's go to the judges.

3959
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Alright the judges will allow it.

3960
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Two to two for the ferret.

3961
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Alright and lastly my answer

3962
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
she should cook the

3963
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Cylon occupied

3964
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
caprica cake.

3965
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
The Cylon

3966
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
occupied caprica cake. Old

3967
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
old joke. Alright there

3968
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
it is. Two

3969
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
two though. That

3970
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
could be the highest score ever in the history of

3971
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
video game matches. I think our highest score was three

3972
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
to be honest. Was it? I think it was

3973
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
three. There is still two questions

3974
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
to go. Here we go. There are two

3975
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
questions. There are two questions. Watch your

3976
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
grammar drunkie.

3977
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Shut up. Alright

3978
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
here we go. Oh it's a question about

3979
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Jamie. Here we go. Question. You ready

3980
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Ravenstaufen? You ready for it? I'm ready.

3981
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I'm ready. Jamie decided

3982
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
to mark the occasion

3983
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
of the 500th episode

3984
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
to give up coffee forever.

3985
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Lies. This is

3986
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
make believe. I know. Jamie decided

3987
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give

3988
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
up coffee forever. She came

3989
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
to episode 501

3990
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
and in a coffee deprived rage

3991
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
instantly screamed into

3992
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
the mic. First one

3993
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
to mention blank dies.

3994
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
She came to episode

3995
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
501 and in a

3996
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
coffee deprived rage

3997
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
instantly screamed into the mic.

3998
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
First one to mention

3999
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
blank dies.

4000
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I didn't think

4001
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
of an answer for this one.

4002
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
You wrote it. I know right.

4003
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
First

4004
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
one to mention

4005
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
um

4006
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
ding.

4007
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Ding.

4008
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Alan?

4009
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Ding. Alright here we go.

4010
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Raven you got an answer? I do.

4011
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Alright here we go. She gave up

4012
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
coffee on episode 500. She came to

4013
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
episode 501 and in a coffee

4014
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
depraved rage instantly screamed

4015
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
into the mic. First one to mention

4016
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
double shot mochaccino.

4017
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Double shot mochaccino

4018
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
dies. That sounds amazing.

4019
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
I want one. Mako

4020
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Chan in our chat room says first one

4021
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
to mention male chef

4022
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
dies. I was thinking about

4023
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Alright here we go. Let's go around the room

4024
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
and see what

4025
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
we got. If we got any matches.

4026
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
First one to mention Loki?

4027
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I almost said male chef

4028
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
but I said Propel instead. Propel

4029
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
first one to mention Propel

4030
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
dies.

4031
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Do they even make Propel anymore?

4032
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Yes they do. Wow alright awesome.

4033
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
It's called like Propel Zero now or some shit.

4034
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Alright Dark Sakura first one to

4035
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
mention. Bro chef.

4036
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Bro chef? Really?

4037
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Oh my god.

4038
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Alright I think we're gonna count it. I honestly couldn't think

4039
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
of anything else. Mako Chan pulls

4040
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
ahead three to two.

4041
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Alright Alan

4042
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
first one to mention

4043
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Mocha Pinkberry.

4044
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Oh my god. Why does this not

4045
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
exist? That was really close

4046
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
to what Raven said but

4047
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I don't think it's close enough unfortunately. Why does this not

4048
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
exist? I don't know. You should

4049
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
write Pinkberry.

4050
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Alright and my answer was

4051
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
first one to mention. Why not?

4052
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
First

4053
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
one to mention

4054
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Final Fantasy 11 dies.

4055
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Alright

4056
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
not a match but one more

4057
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
question. One more question. So close.

4058
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So close. Ravenstaufen you can do it.

4059
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I know. I have faith in you.

4060
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I have faith in you. I know. Alright.

4061
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
But what about the chatter?

4062
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Alright here we go.

4063
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Question number four

4064
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
the last one Ravenstaufen your only

4065
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
hope. Alright.

4066
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Loki was very happy with the

4067
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
poster that Codeman drew

4068
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
to celebrate episode 500 of the show.

4069
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Upon careful

4070
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
examination of the poster though

4071
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
he exclaimed Rob I'm

4072
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
surprised he drew you as a World

4073
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
of Warcraft fan and not

4074
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
as a fan of blank.

4075
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Rob I'm surprised he

4076
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
drew you as a World of Warcraft fan

4077
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
and not as a fan of blank.

4078
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Oh that was

4079
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
really quick on all the hosts.

4080
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I'm still waiting on MakoChan to

4081
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
ping in there in our chat

4082
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
room at live.vognetware.com where some

4083
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
people are going to feed the answers right now.

4084
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Loki very happy with the poster that

4085
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Codeman drew but

4086
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
on careful examination of the poster

4087
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
exclaimed Rob I'm surprised he didn't just draw you

4088
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
as a fan of blank. Alright

4089
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000

4092
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000

4093
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
you as a World of Warcraft fan

4094
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
and not as a fan of

DDR 4th mix.

4096
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
DDR 4th mix.

4097
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Good answer. I was a fan of

4098
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
DDR 4. 4th plus to be

4099
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
specific but we'd let that slide.

4100
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
MakoChan in our chat room says

4101
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft

4102
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
fan and not as a fan of

4103

02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
there's a match. Loki

4107
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000

4108
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
fan and not as a fan of

4109
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Ni No Kuni's ending. Ni No Kuni's ending.

4110
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Wait a minute.

4111
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright.

4112
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000

02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000

4165
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
No I did a second shot.

4166
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Laughter.

4167
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Alright and they're double shots but

4168
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
hey who cares.

4169
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
They only live once right Rob?

4170
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Alright thank you for playing along with match

4171
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
game tonight everybody we hope you had fun.

4172
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Alright

4173
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Megachan what do we give

4174
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Megachan for winning tonight? My love.

4175
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Megachan if you have

4176
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
something you want to plug I have a feeling I know

4177
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
what it might be but send me a private message

4178
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
and you can get a free plug for your Twitter

4179
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
for your podcast whatever you want.

4180
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
But not a butt plug. No definitely

4181
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
not that. Alright

4182
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
let's see moving on it's

4183
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
time for the mailbag. Ah crap.

4184
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Dark soccer is always

4185
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
excited to get into the mailbag and read some emails

4186
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
that you guys send to mailbag

4187
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
at orange lounge radio

4188
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
dot com. So dark

4189
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
soccer if you wouldn't mind jumping

4190
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
to the emailbag there. We did get a lot

4191
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
of spam like that arrived after

4192
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
the real email. Oh hooray. I deleted

4193
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
well I didn't delete it but we need to delete

4194
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
a lot of old email.

4195
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Are we ready? Shall I do this?

4196
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yep yep. Hey O-L-R

4197
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
just thought I'd write in and respond

4198
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
to that email about the graphic violence

4199
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
of Bioshock Infinite. Ooh.

4200
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Not spoiling any major

4201
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
plot points here but Booker's history

4202
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
is full of violence. It's actually a

4203
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
major part of his character that he has done many

4204
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
terrible things in the past and has

4205
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
a very violent history.

4206
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Whenever you perform one of those brutal finishing

4207
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
moves with your sky hook Elizabeth will always

4208
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
audibly shudder at the act.

4209
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
As you get deeper in the game Elizabeth

4210
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
questions the need for so much violence from both

4211
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
sides of the conflict and wonders if it's really

4212
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
helping anybody. And that way

4213
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I think it's the approach to graphic violence is

4214
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
done in a way that serves the story and the

4215
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
characters. Now there is

4216
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
some gratuitous stuff in there but I'm a little tired

4217
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
of the comparisons to Call of Duty or

4218
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
that these were changes that made to

4219
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
these were changes

4220
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
these changes were made to appeal to that

4221
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
audience. I played a couple of

4222
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Call of Duty games and the violence

4223
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
though not the plot always seemed to ride

4224
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
closer to the side of realistic and not hyper

4225
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
real as it is in the Bioshock games

4226
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
including Infinite where you can electrocute someone

4227
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
to stun them then blast their entire head off.

4228
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Dude I need to play that.

4229
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
You can do that in Bioshock Infinite

4230
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
As we saw in Bioshock Infinite

4231
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Yes, it's awesome.

4232
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
In the Call of Duty games

4233
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
we rest our case

4234
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
In the Call of Duty games I played I don't remember

4235
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
any heads popping off like quarks

4236
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
but I did only play single player mode so

4237
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
who knows. My point is Bioshock

4238
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
games have always been violent

4239
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
and they've always been first person shooters

4240
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
so I don't think the game had to compromise

4241
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
anything for sales or to appeal to a certain crowd

4242
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
and in fact would only have been

4243
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
compromising if it toned itself down.

4244
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
That was all that was on my mind

4245
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
congrats on an amazing 500

4246
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
episodes even if you

4247
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
guys don't think it's such a big deal anymore

4248
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
it actually really

4249
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
is. I'm just glad I've

4250
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
been listening for the last 200 or so

4251
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
that's from Flaco Jones.

4252
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
We don't care if you've been listening since episode 1

4253
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
or if this is your very first episode

4254
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
we say welcome aboard and thanks for being a part of the

4255
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
family. Yeah, you're totally awesome.

4256
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
So

4257
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
moving on

4258
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Hi guys!

4259
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
First and foremost congratulations on your

4260
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
500th episode. I think it's

4261
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
amazing that you've been going for over

4262
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
10 years. You have an unshakable love

4263
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
of video games and a cast iron army

4264
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
of dedicated fans

4265
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
to...dude you guys made a cast iron? I didn't know that.

4266
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Okay.

4267
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
So here's something.

4268
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
I think he's frying you.

4269
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Will you fry us an egg?

4270
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
I bet you get really hot on

4271
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
warm days. So here's something

4272
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
that may interest you. Do you remember me talking

4273
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
about Project Possum a while

4274
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
ago? When the Inside

4275
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Xbox UK team were given the

4276
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
sack, they went off on Kickstarter

4277
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
to start their own show about video games.

4278
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Well, they finished the pilot and that's not what you

4279
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
call your average video game show.

4280
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
It's called Thank You For Playing

4281
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
and you can find it at ThankYouForPlaying.com

4282
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
there are dashes in between each word.

4283
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It's structured much like a game

4284
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
letting you view the features in order

4285
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
that you want and has unlockables in the form of extra

4286
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
goodies and editorials, expanding

4287
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
on the themes touched in the videos.

4288
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
The plot's all about multiplayer

4289
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
and I really recommend you take a look.

4290
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I thought it was really interesting and

4291
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
hope to see a lot more from them soon.

4292
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Just like I hope to keep hearing from you guys

4293
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
for many years to come, take care and once again

4294
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
congratulations, Picaruno.

4295
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Thank you

4296
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
for your support.

4297
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an

4298
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
athletic supporter.

4299
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I'm sorry, this is my favorite line from Greece.

4300
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Okay, this is an OLR PSA

4301
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
from CatastrophicMoggie.

4302
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Oh, it's my friend Moggie who I chat with

4303
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
every day on Steam. Come on guys,

4304
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I think after 500 episodes we can give the whole

4305
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Loki in a tingle costume thing a rest.

4306
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
He might like that.

4307
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Instead for the next

4308
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
500 we need to get Loki

4309
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
in a kitty costume.

4310
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
A kitty costume?

4311
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
And you have to say

4312
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
meow, that's right.

4313
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
It has to be a kitty in costume.

4314
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I don't think he'd do that.

4315
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
That's worse than tingle.

4316
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
He sent an image to you but it didn't embed.

4317
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
P.S. I would have

4318
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
left an audio message but Rob is a meanie.

4319
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Even if I stayed up late enough

4320
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I wouldn't be able to Skype after the disaster

4321
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
that was last time. So I guess you don't

4322
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
get any congratulations from Moggie.

4323
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Send an MP3.

4324
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Send an MP3.

4325
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Dude, you talked to me on Steam.

4326
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Just attach me a file or something.

4327
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Excuse me.

4328
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Is that it or is there more?

4329
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
No, there's one more.

4330
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I had an oddly mimosa red velvet brownie flavored burp.

4331
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Imagine that.

4332
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Imagine that.

4333
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Alright, here's the last one.

4334
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Hello is the one and only

4335
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
often imitated, never duplicated DDR dollar bill.

4336
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I just wanted to write and congratulate you guys

4337
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
on your 500th episode.

4338
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
To the last 500 episodes is something truly

4339
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
of an accomplishment. Not just for the fact

4340
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
that most podcasts end in a few years

4341
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
but that the show keeps the same

4342
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
basic formula without getting stale.

4343
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
That you also survived in a market where some

4344
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
have turned to sponsors and subscription fees

4345
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
to even make a presence

4346
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
is even more of a reason to celebrate.

4347
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Well, thank you.

4348
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I'm all broke.

4349
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Not everyone can podcast.

4350
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
True, we all wish to be heard but it takes something

4351
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
special to keep going for a long time

4352
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
and not just make it into a small hobby that you grow

4353
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
out of. It's a labor of love, one that

4354
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
the O.L. Army slash family

4355
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
have grown to be a part of, whether they

4356
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
hang around, come back once in a while

4357
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
when they can, or just move on.

4358
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
If I could, I'd just like to take a moment

4359
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
to say why I do recommend your show to other listeners.

4360
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
One, the host.

4361
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Why, thank you. Every show you have

4362
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
three amazing, entertaining, intelligent, yet human

4363
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
hosts who talk about gaming

4364
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
that can appeal to the hardcore fans as well as

4365
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
the casuals. Just to let you know I'm really from another planet

4366
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
once a month.

4367
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
They are

4368
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
people who actually do game as part of

4369
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
their lives, not game because it's their

4370
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
job to. We talk about gaming like

4371
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
fans who talk about sports or comics or

4372
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
sci-fi with that casual yet knowledgeable

4373
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
flair. And when they speak about

4374
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
gaming news, they do it on a dual level of

4375
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
professionalism that gives a great analysis

4376
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
and yet keeps it simple and fun.

4377
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Can I say something really

4378
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
quick about the sponsor thing? Because we have

4379
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
a lot of friend podcasters that do

4380
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
the sponsor thing and we've even, you know,

4381
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
we have had donations before in the past

4382
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
and so forth and I just want to say, like, there's

4383
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
nothing wrong with podcasters who want to get

4384
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
sponsors because, contrary to popular belief,

4385
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
this shit ain't free for us to do.

4386
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
True. It is costing us money

4387
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
to do, but that's, you know, it's okay.

4388
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
We pay the money because

4389
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
it's our hobby. It's like, you know,

4390
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
it's like the tax you pay to

4391
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
your club, you know,

4392
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
your dues or whatever.

4393
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
For us, that's fine.

4394
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
And, you know, I have no problem with people that

4395
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
want to get sponsors to offset the cost of

4396
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
hosting, offset the cost of, you know,

4397
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
producing the show

4398
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
and so forth. But I do start to

4399
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
get into a problem when, you know,

4400
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
and I can think of particular

4401
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
individual podcast things that have

4402
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
gone up saying, we need

4403
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
$30,000 to do this

4404
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
podcast, this one

4405
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
podcast because we're going to rent a studio

4406
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
and we have to travel to conventions

4407
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
and this and this and this. And

4408
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I'm sorry, but like,

4409
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
you know, if they can get it and the listeners

4410
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
support them enough, that's

4411
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
great, I guess. But I'm

4412
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
just kind of like, you ain't fooling

4413
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
anybody. I could tell you how much it costs to

4414
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
do a podcast and it's not as much as

4415
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
you're telling people it is.

4416
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
I mean, we've had

4417
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
generous donations in the past. I mean,

4418
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
like what Kristen did.

4419
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I mean, we would not have

4420
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
new equipment if not for her.

4421
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
But I just want to be clear because I have very

4422
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
several peer podcasters that do

4423
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
raise money through sponsors

4424
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
and so forth.

4425
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
We've got the ads on the site. We have been super

4426
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
effing lucky that our website

4427
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
has been donated very generously

4428
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
for many years or

4429
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
else we would probably have to turn to that

4430
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
too because that could get very expensive.

4431
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
So, I just, you know,

4432
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I just want to clear the air and make

4433
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
sure that's understood.

4434
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
So, and I've

4435
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
sat up for, I mean,

4436
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
just on my own hours working on

4437
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
graphics and stuff

4438
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
for, not just for Orange Nails, but

4439
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
for VOG in general, you know.

4440
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
We've all put a lot of time and effort into this.

4441
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Uh, DDR dollar bill in chat says

4442
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I think the best way to put it is

4443
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
people don't like to be shilled.

4444
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
And I agree with that. And I would not do that to

4445
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
the audience. You guys are far too intelligent for me

4446
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
to sit here and say, please send me to all these

4447
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
exotic places so I can

4448
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
talk about them with you. You know,

4449
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
like, I'm not, I'm not

4450
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
going to do that. You guys are... And we're not doing ads for the

4451
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
man-grate. Yeah.

4452
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
I'm sorry, I have, you know,

4453
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
my overwhelming love

4454
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
for, uh, Greg Proops.

4455
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do laugh every time he does

4456
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
the ad for the man-grate. Anyhow, I apologize to interrupt

4457
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
the email. Okay. To the show.

4458
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
This show, while keeping the basic format,

4459
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
always finds a way to grow and yet

4460
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
never loses its focus. Yes, they go off on

4461
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
tangents and just Pinkberry trips to Disneyland.

4462
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Let's go get Pinkberry. Okay. Trips to Disneyland

4463
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
and other aspects of their

4464
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
daily lives. But I find that to be the greatest

4465
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
asset because you, the listener, participate in

4466
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
the show in any fashion. It's so laid back

4467
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
and friendly that you do not feel they are

4468
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
corporate shills. If you are right

4469
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
or wrong, you can discuss this openly.

4470
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
And even when it gets heated, it's still

4471
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
more personal than some shows where the sense

4472
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
of keeping it professional loses that intimacy

4473
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
that's required for some difficult and passionate

4474
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
topics. Also,

4475
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
each segment does include something for the listener,

4476
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
whether it's mailbag to submit your letters,

4477
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
and I actually do enjoy reading the email.

4478
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
I'll just throw on a hissy fit

4479
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
just for fun. Um, Skyplines

4480
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
to call in even when

4481
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
even if just wish

4482
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
to get on and say, what's up?

4483
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
The classic game of the week, my favorite part,

4484
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
why, thank you. We used to do the

4485
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
website of the week.

4486
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
There was website of the week and the advice,

4487
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Star Soccer's advice column.

4488
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I could still give advice.

4489
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Um, uh,

4490
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
like, uh,

4491
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I don't know.

4492
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Pay your hoes or you might get cut.

4493
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
There's

4494
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Star Soccer's advice.

4495
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Was it never bet with a Sicilian when death is

4496
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
on the line?

4497
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Finish the email. Okay.

4498
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Fugal question of the week.

4499
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
It's always welcoming listener input, which

4500
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
leads into

4501
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
dot, dot, dot, dot, the audience.

4502
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
That was number three. The chatroom is

4503
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
full of people who often come up with amazing

4504
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
nuggets of joy. It's rarely

4505
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
censored, meaning you'd really have to be

4506
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
a dick to have the mighty ban hammer cast upon

4507
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
yourself. But like, um,

4508
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
but like a good wrestling federation,

4509
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
the show wouldn't be much without the loyal fans

4510
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
who have helped keep the

4511
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
energy going. Friendly and

4512
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
often hilarious, they are never ignored

4513
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
by the host. I'm sorry if this

4514
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
went on a bit more, but it was just something to

4515
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
note. Here's to another 500 episodes.

4516
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I wonder how the future of gaming would look in another

4517
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
11 years. Tune in and find out. Wink.

4518
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Oh, that was

4519
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
sweet. That was a very nice email. I'm gonna do

4520
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
a quick sweep. That

4521
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
was it. I agree. The audience is

4522
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
the best part.

4523
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
We love you guys. For dinner.

4524
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Speaking of which.

4525
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
No, seriously. And Black Wolf and chat

4526
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
actually follows up with

4527
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
that. I don't think we have anybody banned.

4528
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I don't think we've

4529
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
had to ban anybody yet.

4530
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
That's not a request or

4531
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
a contest. No, no. Don't challenge

4532
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
this. Bammers.

4533
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
I've kicked people out of chat

4534
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
for being dicks. Well, but we haven't

4535
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
banned anybody. Most people

4536
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
learn their lesson. Yeah.

4537
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
I've smacked a few people around with a giant trout.

4538
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Anyhow. Speaking

4539
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
of audience. Mako Chan has

4540
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
her plug ready to go that

4541
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
she won for Match Game. Do I even

4542
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
have to mention this? I somehow knew it would

4543
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
be this. Anime Jam session

4544
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
on Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

4545
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
9.30 PM Eastern is when the pre-show

4546
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
starts at 9.15.

4547
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Excuse me, it's the pre-show at 9.15. 9.30 is the

4548
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
show. Mako Chan gets to

4549
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
choose the pre-show music this week. Oh

4550
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
shit. And happy 500th.

4551
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Yes, listen to Anime Jam session. It's a good time.

4552
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Totally a good time.

4553
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
So, alrighty.

4554
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Let's see.

4555
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Is that it for emails?

4556
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
We're done, huh? You want to know something? I've actually

4557
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
started getting back into

4558
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
watching some old school series now. Oh yeah?

4559
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Because Dan's little brother

4560
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Mason, who is a teenager.

4561
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
He was posting on Facebook

4562
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Oh, teenagers.

4563
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I'm bored and I don't know any

4564
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
I was like, go back and watch some classic anime, dude.

4565
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Get to the roots of it.

4566
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
You know, go watch some Yamato

4567
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
or some Gachamon.

4568
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Alright. Go 80s style and watch

4569
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Bubblegum Crisis.

4570
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Let's do the FUs of the Week.

4571
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
And Minecraft Server.

4572
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
FUs of the Week time.

4573
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Here is punishment.

4574
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Here.

4575
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
This is fucked up.

4576
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Yeah, we did

4577
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
ban the song on the show.

4578
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
And we banned a website. We banned

4579
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Politary. DarkSakura, your FU, please.

4580
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
My FU goes to

4581
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
the hoe bag who was driving behind me

4582
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
in the Mercedes, trying to do her

4583
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
makeup while tailgating me.

4584
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
It would have been incredibly

4585
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
hilarious if I had brake checked you

4586
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
and you completely ruined the back end of my car

4587
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
so that I get a new car and

4588
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
you have to pay for it. Just saying.

4589
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Don't do your makeup while you drive

4590
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
and get off your damn phone and pull up your pants.

4591
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Loki, any FUs? Get off my lawn.

4592
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I guess an FU to the driver that I encountered

4593
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
last week when I was leaving the show

4594
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
about to enter onto the freeway

4595
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
when I had a guy pass

4596
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
me on the right in the

4597
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
in the meat, like actually off the

4598
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
road, pass me on the right and then

4599
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
cut across into the next lane

4600
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
to not go on the

4601
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
freeway. I don't even know why he was doing that.

4602
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
It's just stupid. He could have just gone to the

4603
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
left and changed lanes.

4604
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
But no, he had to pass me at the same time too.

4605
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
For no reason.

4606
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
And then, what else? Oh.

4607
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
And to my co-workers for not wanting to play

4608
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
games during lunch because they're, you know,

4609
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
they will flake on me unless

4610
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
we get all four people to play, including

4611
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
myself. And a lot of times we can't do

4612
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
that because, you know, my boss will be

4613
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
gone or something and they don't

4614
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
want to play games with just me because I kick their ass.

4615
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
So they need to...

4616
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
But you're so humble about it. So FU'd at being good?

4617
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Yeah, I'm just too good

4618
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
for them, unfortunately.

4619
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Um, my FU of the week

4620
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
goes to car repairs

4621
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
and the bills that go with them.

4622
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Oh my god, robbery!

4623
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
So much money!

4624
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
And everything breaks at once!

4625
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Not okay.

4626
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
We all gave FU to traffic-related things.

4627
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
How appropriate for our 500th episode.

4628
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
We always freaking complain about

4629
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
drivers. The hell.

4630
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
You want to throw out a nephew to cars, too,

4631
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
while you're at it?

4632
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
You can throw out a nephew to Power Rangers.

4633
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Oh god, yes.

4634
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Shane might take issue to this.

4635
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
FU to Power Rangers

4636
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Megaforce, which my son wants to

4637
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
watch constantly and my brains

4638
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
are dribbling at my ears.

4639
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
It is horrifying. The acting

4640
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
makes me want to strangle my own brain.

4641
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
By the way, Megaforce is

4642
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
playing a brand new 3DS game

4643
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
coming this year.

4644
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Aw, Shane will be offended by that

4645
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
and that makes me happy.

4646
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
I do still want to watch the

4647
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Japanese version because I do like the Sentai series.

4648
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Shane and Chad's like,

4649
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
why FU to Power Rangers?

4650
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Because she's a mom

4651
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
and little boys watch

4652
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Power Rangers, Shane, not 30-year-olds.

4653
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
But Shane said that Megaforce is pretty bad.

4654
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Oh god,

4655
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I wish I was still a 30-year-old.

4656
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
So if

4657
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
the Power Rangers fan of Chad

4658
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
is saying it's bad,

4659
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
then you are fully justified.

4660
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
All kidding aside,

4661
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
we've got a couple more stories for you guys quickly

4662
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
and then we're going to go to the Skype line

4663
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
at 1-877-GAME-OLR

4664
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
There might be a few of you that want to call in tonight

4665
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
so we'll get to that shortly,

4666
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
but first a couple quick stories.

4667
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Alright, so Nintendo

4668
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
totally figuring out ways to revitalize the Wii U.

4669
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Not sure if this is going to be one of those ways,

4670
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
but they have a new patent.

4671
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
A patent that allows them

4672
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
to use the Wii remote

4673
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
to remotely control mobile devices

4674
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
like a robot.

4675
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
That's what they have in the picture.

4676
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
They have a robot with a Wii

4677
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
remote in it.

4678
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Rob 2.0?

4679
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Or as the joke I made on Facebook,

4680
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Rob U?

4681
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
And it will.

4682
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
And it will.

4683
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
What the hell would a Rob 2.0 do?

4684
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
The first Rob was a really

4685
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
niche, stupid thing.

4686
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
It just played Gyromite, right?

4687
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
There was one other. Stack'em?

4688
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
It would run up to people

4689
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
that are playing the Wii games

4690
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
not standing up,

4691
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
because you're supposed to be active,

4692
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
and punch you in the balls.

4693
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Get off your couch. Boom!

4694
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I need one of those

4695
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
to motivate me to exercise more.

4696
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Can I get a Rob U to punch me in the balls

4697
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
when I'm not, you know, exercising?

4698
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Perhaps.

4699
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Wouldn't that be awesome?

4700
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Well, speaking of Nintendo devices,

4701
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
the must-have, most important

4702
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
application on the 3DS has

4703
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
been updated. That's right.

4704
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
SwapNote has a new version

4705
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
that's available now. You can go get that

4706
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
right there in the little eShop.

4707
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Get the free update, and there's a note

4708
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
that you should have got reminding you of that.

4709
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I've added some new OLR listeners recently,

4710
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
and I gotta say, it's like a SwapNote resurgence.

4711
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
My little blue light is on almost every day.

4712
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
It's great. Some of the new features.

4713
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
You can now use a

4714
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
different color on each page of a message,

4715
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
so you don't just have to use black anymore.

4716
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
You can do photos

4717
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
and audio while you write.

4718
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
You don't have to import them from the SD card.

4719
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
You can filter notes by who

4720
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
sent them if you want to find a note from somebody.

4721
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
You can delete multiple notes at once.

4722
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
You can

4723
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
see how many replies

4724
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
a note has received, and you can

4725
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
slide the CirclePad left to

4726
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
slow down writing and drawing animations

4727
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
from notes, or use

4728
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
CirclePad right to speed it up.

4729
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
It's like a speed up, slow down.

4730
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Very cool.

4731
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Basically trying to modernize SwapNote

4732
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
a little bit with some functionality

4733
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
that you kind of go, wow, that wasn't there before.

4734
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Nope.

4735
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
But it's there now.

4736
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
All right. That brings us to the Skype line.

4737
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
1877 Game OLR.

4738
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4739
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
If you want to give us a call on this,

4740
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
our 500th episode to talk about whatever,

4741
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
we will take a few calls until

4742
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
we decide it's time to end the show or the calls stop

4743
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
coming in.

4744
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Well, there's a whole

4745
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
other plate, huh?

4746
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Oh, boy. All right. So,

4747
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
we are going to take the calls right now.

4748
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
I'm also going to bring up Twitter topics.

4749
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I don't know, Loki, if you have any last minute stories over there.

4750
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Not yet.

4751
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Power Rangers Megaforce game,

4752
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
that's all I had.

4753
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Oh, you were trying to incorporate things.

4754
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
All right. Well, lucky for us, we're getting saved

4755
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
with a phone call. So, let's get to it.

4756
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

4757
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
This is CodeMan.

4758
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
CodeMan, what is up?

4759
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
What's up, man?

4760
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
We are loving these posters you made, just so you know.

4761
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Well, no problem, man.

4762
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
I hope I captured

4763
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
OrangeLoungeRadio as much as I could.

4764
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Uh, yeah.

4765
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I have to ask, is the little kitten on the bottom,

4766
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
is that Midna?

4767
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
It could be Midna, or it could be Shirmi.

4768
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I wanted to kind of

4769
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
go both ways

4770
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
because, you know, Shirmi was a big

4771
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
part of OrangeLoungeRadio, and

4772
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
we all, as all listeners,

4773
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
miss

4774
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
her as much as

4775
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
we can, you know.

4776
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
She was a huge part of

4777
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. And she was huge.

4778
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
It's an every cat.

4779
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Yeah, it's an every cat.

4780
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I was going to say, because it looks kind of like Midna.

4781
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Do you have a JPEG that you can forward me

4782
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
of this? Well, I think Dark Sakura,

4783
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
do we talk about the album art thing?

4784
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Yeah. Is that going to happen?

4785
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Awesome!

4786
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Good, the listeners can know what we're talking about because

4787
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
it's going to be the new album art to the show, and it's fantastic!

4788
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
And I thank you

4789
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
for, I got your message from Dropbox.

4790
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Thank you, I will be printing out a copy for my wall.

4791
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Yes, and you can, um,

4792
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
you can actually, if, if, uh,

4793
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Loki wants a JPEG,

4794
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
you can probably just, uh, you know, switch

4795
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
that over to a JPEG and then just send it to him.

4796
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Or whatever, it doesn't matter. Is it, like, just the full 300

4797
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
DPI PSD?

4798
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Yeah, it's, well, no, it's a PDF.

4799
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
It's 18 by 24.

4800
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
You can open it up in Illustrator,

4801
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
because I did it all in Illustrator.

4802
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Um, and you should be able to just

4803
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
export it as a JPEG.

4804
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Alright, you nerds,

4805
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I want to talk about video games.

4806
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I'm actually going to resize it for the frame I have.

4807
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Alright. Well, Codeman,

4808
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
uh, what did you, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?

4809
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I wanted to just call in and

4810
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
congratulate you guys on 500 shows,

4811
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
basically. I, I, I

4812
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
started listening, um, kind of

4813
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
at the end of my high school,

4814
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
uh, my senior year of high school,

4815
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
all the way through college, up

4816
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
until now. And so that, that

4817
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Christ, how old are you now?

4818
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
I am 27. I'll be 28 in,

4819
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
uh, September, so. Oh my god!

4820
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
You know, you

4821
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
realize I'm going to be 37 on

4822
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
next Friday, right?

4823
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
I'm just, I'm just, I,

4824
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
you know, and, and like I said in the chat room

4825
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
earlier, um, I said if this show ever dies,

4826
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
a piece of my heart will die.

4827
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Because this show has

4828
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
been like, I think a lot of the listeners has

4829
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
gotten me through a lot of hard times,

4830
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
um, you know, in past,

4831
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
past issues in my life and stuff like that.

4832
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
And just sitting down and like,

4833
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
when I'm at work, and

4834
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I'm listening to you guys, it just, it brings a

4835
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
positivity to, to my day

4836
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
that I didn't have before. So

4837
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
that, that's one of the reasons why I called it.

4838
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
I just wanted to tell you guys that you have

4839
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
done so many good things

4840
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
to a lot of people that are, that

4841
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
are out there listening to you every,

4842
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
every Sunday or on the podcast

4843
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
feed throughout the week. And,

4844
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
and I know that every time somebody listens

4845
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
to you guys, there is a positive

4846
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
jokingly feeling

4847
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
of like, they're in the same room as you

4848
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
guys and we're just all friends. And that's,

4849
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
and that's amazing. Don't make me cry,

4850
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Code Man. Don't do it. Don't do it.

4851
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Well,

4852
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I have to tell you too

4853
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
that just in the fact that we've been talking

4854
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
over the last month worth of shows,

4855
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
it's really nice to have a colleague

4856
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
who listens to, you know,

4857
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
it's, it's been kind of, it's just been

4858
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
really cool chatting with you and, you know,

4859
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
sort of exchanging, you know, not just

4860
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
the video game stuff, but having

4861
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
the design thing in common too.

4862
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Well, and, and Code Man, let me say this,

4863
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
and I'm sure it goes for

4864
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Dark Sakura and Loki as well, because I know

4865
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
we've had, we've all had these very difficult

4866
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
shows. This show has helped

4867
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
us get through a lot of hard times

4868
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
as well. Like, you know, I'll

4869
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
talk about myself since I have the mic right now,

4870
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
but, you know, a few years ago, I had a near

4871
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
death experience and that was very,

4872
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
you know,

4873
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
very humbling in a way. And,

4874
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
and there's a lot of jokes

4875
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
about, I don't want to turn 30. I don't want to turn

4876
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
30, 30. I might as well be dead if I'm gonna be

4877
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
30. Well, I, I almost did die at

4878
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
29. So, to make it to

4879
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
30, now I'm like, being

4880
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
30 is fucking rad.

4881
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
And it really is, like, it's, it's awesome.

4882
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
I was just saying, earlier, when I turned 30, I stopped

4883
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
giving a crap. Exactly. You just kind of

4884
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
learned all that. So, you know, this show

4885
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
helped me through a lot of that

4886
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
as well. You gave me tequila

4887
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
and told me not to think about it.

4888
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
So. Yes, but, no,

4889
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
that's, that's basically what I called in. I mean,

4890
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
as far as video games go, I mean,

4891
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
I've ever, I've been, I'm still

4892
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
struggling through Tomb Raider. I,

4893
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I don't know, Rob, you've been playing it too,

4894
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I think, and I, I don't know, I just,

4895
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
I haven't gotten to pick it up again.

4896
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
When are we playing the very average

4897
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
multiplayer that I, I, I, I shouldn't

4898
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
razz it because I haven't tried it yet, but when are we gonna

4899
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
give it a try? Uh, I don't know.

4900
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Alright. You know, anyway, yeah, I, I,

4901
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
I, you know, and then, and then all, I mean,

4902
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
all kinds of video games out

4903
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
right now that are just, I don't know, just

4904
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
eating me up. And, like I, like I mentioned before,

4905
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
I have a daughter, so I, most of the time, I don't even

4906
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
get to play video games, but, you know, it,

4907
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
it, when I do, I, I try to sit down for,

4908
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
like, just long periods of time

4909
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
and play video games, but, uh,

4910
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
but yes, I'll let you guys go and get another

4911
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
caller in here, but, um, because it is your 500th

4912
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
show, and I'm sure a bunch of people want to call in,

4913
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
but, um, I just want to say

4914
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
congratulations, guys, and I hope you enjoy the,

4915
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
the poster. I, I put so much

4916
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
heart and, and just

4917
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
stuff into it that, because I want you guys

4918
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
to understand how much

4919
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
you guys mean to me, and how

4920
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
much you mean to all of your fans

4921
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
and all of your, your, your

4922
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
listeners that are out there, all around

4923
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
the United States, and I just wanted to kind of

4924
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
put that all in a poster, and I didn't even

4925
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
capture all of it, um, and-

4926
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Code Man, we talked about the crying thing, don't do it.

4927
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Hey, you better cry, it's a 500th show, come on, Bob.

4928
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Maybe

4929
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
when Rob drinks more, he'll cry. I'm gonna make you

4930
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
cry. Oh, Rob, is he,

4931
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
is he an emotional drunk? Because I,

4932
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
because I am. No, I'm just loud. But,

4933
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
um, I, and horny

4934
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
apparently, if these other stories are to be believed.

4935
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Oh, you can't spin the bottle. Oh, Jesus Christ.

4936
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
It was hilarious. That was, that was

4937
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
by the way, um, Shane reminded me, that's where

4938
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Dunk came from. Oh, no.

4939
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Alright, look, uh, Code Man,

4940
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
thank you so much, and I'm, I'm so glad

4941
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
everybody gets to see your talent now in

4942
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
our album art, and the fact that that is

4943
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
listener created, I mean, Jamie

4944
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
did, did great work beforehand for, for

4945
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
a previous era of the show, but, you know,

4946
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
this show really is about the listeners, and,

4947
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
and so that the listeners could contribute to that,

4948
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
and the way you capture that by having

4949
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
everybody's name in there,

4950
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
or, I should say, not everybody, but a good chunk of the people.

4951
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
That was a great touch. That was a great

4952
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
touch. I loved it. So, that was

4953
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
my favorite part. Well, it's, it's, it's, wherever

4954
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
every gamer has a voice. Absolutely.

4955
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
It's not, yeah, it's, it's not only,

4956
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
you know, about the hosts

4957
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
that are on the show, but it's about the people that could

4958
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
participate in the chat room, and, you

4959
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
know, give a voice to the actual

4960
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
podcast itself. So,

4961
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I want, I want to thank you guys for, for

4962
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
doing so much for everybody, and

4963
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
just thank you. That's all I can say.

4964
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Thank you. Are you guys still doing the

4965
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
down for maintenance show?

4966
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
We are!

4967
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Yeah, we, we have taken

4968
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
a couple of weekends off due to

4969
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
just, just really busy,

4970
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
busy lives. I've been doing a lot of graphics

4971
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
for people on YouTube, and I've just been really,

4972
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
really, really busy, so,

4973
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
but other than that, yeah, we're still on,

4974
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
we're on Stitcher now, which is

4975
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
awesome. Nice.

4976
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
And iTunes is kind of

4977
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
fuzzy, because we, we're not

4978
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
running the kind of server that

4979
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
iTunes accepts, so,

4980
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
God, I hate, this is why iTunes is

4981
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
gonna, anyway, rabble, rabble.

4982
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
But, look, look them

4983
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
up at least on Stitcher, right? Down for maintenance.

4984
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
We do have a, we do have a website, though, now.

4985
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Please. www.thedfmpodcast.com

4986
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Alright, check it out. It's a great show.

4987
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
You know, probably the most ultimate compliment

4988
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
we get on this show, and I'm not saying this

4989
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
is necessarily true of your show, but

4990
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I, I get this so much, is that, you know,

4991
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
you guys helped inspire me,

4992
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
you guys showed me that anybody can really do

4993
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
this, and that I can, I can do this, too,

4994
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
and that, that is like the greatest compliment

4995
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
when we see these other shows

4996
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
arise of our listenerships. It's awesome.

4997
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
So. It's one of the reasons why we did it.

4998
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Thank you so much. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go

4999
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
so we can get more calls. Alright, man, well,

5000
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
you guys enjoy five rounds of the show, and I'm

5001
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
gonna go to bed, cause I'm sleepy.

5002
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Good night. Good night. Bye-bye.

5003
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Alright, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

5004
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Code man. Great call. Thank you.

5005
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Even if you're gonna make me cry. Alright, listen.

5006
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
I was feeling a little sniffly. The phone is

5007
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
ringing off the hook, so let's get to another call.

5008
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

5009
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

5010
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Are you muted?

5011
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
I see you.

5012
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Hello. One more time.

5013
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Come in, Tokyo. We don't hear you.

5014
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Alright.

5015
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Echo 123 to test your

5016
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
connection, folks. I think he's off

5017
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
at the esthetician.

5018
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Well, I'll bring up that joke.

5019
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Well, let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

5020
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Who's this? Hey, this is Brad from

5021
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Pod Culture. Oh, and we see him.

5022
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
We see him. It's Brad from Pod Culture. What's on

5023
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
your mind, buddy? Oh, just calling

5024
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
to say congratulations on 500,

5025
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
guys. Thank you so much.

5026
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
You're not that far behind.

5027
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Pod Culture's been going quite a while

5028
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
itself, hasn't it?

5029
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
In our

5030
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
eighth year, I guess. Yeah, that's something.

5031
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
That's something. That's amazing.

5032
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
You and I have the same color microphone I just

5033
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
realized with the little...

5034
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Gee, I wonder why. I know.

5035
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
You've done a lot to help this show out over the years,

5036
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Pod Culture, from getting us drunk to

5037
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
getting us heard. And thank you for

5038
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
all of the discs full of Doctor Who

5039
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
you've sent me in the past.

5040
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Oh, no problem. No problem. I'm glad

5041
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
to do it. But hey,

5042
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
without you guys, you know,

5043
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
I don't think we would have lasted as long as we

5044
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
have, and thanks for the

5045
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
inviting us into the

5046
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Vogue community. Oh,

5047
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
duh. Happy to have you.

5048
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
We knew when we were starting...

5049
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
We knew we wanted to do something that was not

5050
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
just games, but a celebration of everything

5051
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
geek, and some of our

5052
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
favorite shows came to mind, and absolutely,

5053
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
you were near the top

5054
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
of that list. You were seriously up there.

5055
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Well, thank you. But

5056
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
congratulations, and I'm gonna let you

5057
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
guys go and get

5058
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
some more calls in, and this one's for you guys.

5059
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Oh, look at that. Oh, oh, oh! Shot

5060
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
on air! Yeah!

5061
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
That's one of the best video

5062
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
calls we've ever got. See, you took it far better than Rob

5063
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
did, because Rob turned red in the face, and it was

5064
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
awesome. Well, I've had more practice.

5065
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
It's become a regular thing on the show.

5066
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
All right. Pod Cultures, Monday nights

5067
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
here at the Voice Geeks Network, continuing

5068
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
a celebration of the various

5069
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Doctors on Tardis Interruptus tomorrow.

5070
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
Fourth Doctor, right? Yes, sir.

5071
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
All right. Fourth Doctor was my Doctor.

5072
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
There you go. He was

5073
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
pretty well known.

5074
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Good night, guys. All right, take care, buddy.

5075
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
All right, always a pleasure to

5076
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
hear from Brad, from another great

5077
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
podcast. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's

5078
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
this? It's

5079
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
me, Mario.

5080
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Hi, Mario.

5081
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Hey. What's on your mind? Is this really

5082
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Extrofer? What?

5083
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Yeah, it's me.

5084
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
What's

5085
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
on your mind, Extrofer?

5086
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
What is on my mind? I don't

5087
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
know. I was just calling. Hair.

5088
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
You just wanted to see what's up?

5089
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Yeah, I wanted to see

5090
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
what's up in his house.

5091
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Well, we're doing this

5092
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
aussism

5093
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
multiple sclerosis walk

5094
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
one week from today, and everybody should

5095
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
donate at Hoardhouse.com through the

5096
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
link, right? Yeah, totally.

5097
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
There you go. Thumbs up for

5098
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
multiple sclerosis

5099
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
box. We broke a thousand

5100
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
dollars today. That's awesome. We did break

5101
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
it. We broke it.

5102
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
We took it out.

5103
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
We did take it out.

5104
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
And I'm very happy about that.

5105
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
What video games have you been playing

5106
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
lately, Extrofer?

5107
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
You know, Jetpack Joyride

5108
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
and

5109
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
I don't know, nothing else.

5110
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
I'm boring.

5111
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
You should know this already.

5112
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Well, what did you call to say

5113
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
tonight? Did you want to wish us well on our

5114
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
500th episode?

5115
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
Um, no. I just thought I'd call

5116
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
and say hi.

5117
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

5118
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Hey.

5119
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Hey. Got any plans tomorrow?

5120
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
Want to hang? You know what?

5121
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
You still need to come over and finish watching Firefly with

5122
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
me after five years of us not

5123
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
watching Firefly. Who's getting called out?

5124
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Yeah, you know, I'll check my calendar

5125
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
and stuff

5126
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
for that and get back

5127
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
to you. Well, let's see. My

5128
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
week is not working, not working, not working,

5129
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
not working, not working birthday. You can come.

5130
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Oh, let me check my calendar.

5131
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
I'm not working, not working,

5132
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
not working, not working.

5133
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
And then birthday.

5134
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I guess we have the same calendar.

5135
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Awesome. Amazing.

5136
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Uh,

5137
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Extrofer, do you want to plug Horde House?

5138
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
I will

5139
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
plug Horde House up the asshole

5140
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
for you.

5141
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Is it bleached?

5142
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Yes, it's a bleached, nicely bleached,

5143
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
freshly bleached asshole

5144
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
that Horde House has. Let me, let me

5145
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
ask you this, Extrofer, since, uh,

5146
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
you know, we have a lot of old school listeners that are

5147
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
revisiting us tonight and so forth.

5148
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
You know, for a while, you and I were roommates

5149
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
and OLR Studios was at

5150
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
your house. So what would

5151
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
the listeners be most surprised

5152
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
to know about Orange Lounge Radio behind

5153
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
the scenes? What do you think? What do you think

5154
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
the OLR listeners

5155
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
would be most surprised to know behind the scenes?

5156
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Well, our studio

5157
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
in our apartment was freaking

5158
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
filthy.

5159
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
And, um,

5160
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
and, uh,

5161
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Rob falls asleep in random

5162
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
places. It's totally

5163
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
true. It's not just when he's drunk.

5164
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
That is totally hilarious, too.

5165
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
What's the most- Like, I would come

5166
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
home and he'd be like asleep on the floor

5167
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
and be like, oh, I'm glad I didn't trip

5168
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
over you. I didn't see you down there.

5169
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
I

5170
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
remember coming over to that apartment

5171
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
and being absolutely thrilled that you were

5172
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
totally into Devil's Crush.

5173
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Oh, yeah. I love

5174
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Devil's Crush. Although, the,

5175
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
um,

5176
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
actually, it was- Alien Crush.

5177
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Yeah, Alien's Crush, or

5178
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
whatever. My favorite Extrofer

5179
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
memory was when you stood out on the line to get

5180
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
me the Wii.

5181
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
I know, right? And

5182
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
how many times did you play that

5183
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
thing?

5184
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Every day is what I want to say.

5185
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Every day. I was a huge Wii fan.

5186
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Yeah, you were a total Wii

5187
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
fan. You were like- It was like

5188
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
five years after it launched and you were like

5189
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
Wii!

5190
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Like, every single chance you would

5191
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
get, you would say that. It was kind of weird and

5192
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
depressing. It was a little awkward.

5193
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
Alright, well, Extrofer, before we let you go, is there

5194
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
any other final thoughts for listeners tonight?

5195
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
Um,

5196
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
well, I gotta go wash my hands

5197
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
because I did some dirty work before

5198
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
you guys

5199
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
gave me a call. In fact,

5200
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
when you called me earlier, I didn't

5201
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
say anything because

5202
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
I had just came and

5203
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
you didn't want to hear what

5204
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
my voice sounds like right after that.

5205
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Were you- I think you just better

5206
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
go wash your hands. Were you touching yourself to the

5207
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
show? That's a little awkward. If you're, like, jerking

5208
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
it to my voice- No! I took a shit on my

5209
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
chair and I was cleaning- What did you think

5210
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I was doing? Never

5211
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
change, please. Dirty work, okay? Never change.

5212
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Extrofer, I'm letting you go now.

5213
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Aww, thank you.

5214
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
Alright, bye!

5215
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Are we holding him for any reason?

5216
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
What the

5217
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
fuck?

5218
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
Like, seriously!

5219
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
I totally miss Extrofer

5220
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
and the utter randomness.

5221
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Ah, lordy. Hi, you're-

5222
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Yes! Oh my god, we-

5223
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
School bus reference in the chatroom.

5224
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Hi, here on Orange Nails Radio,

5225
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
who's this?

5226
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
Oh my god, it's Slidekick. Hey,

5227
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
girl. Hey, I'm the guy.

5228
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Hey, girl, what's up? Sorry, Rob.

5229
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
Sorry, Rob, you're not one of- you're not the guy.

5230
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
You're one of the girls. Whatever.

5231
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
What's up, Slidekick?

5232
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Hey, I just wanted to congratulate

5233
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
you, like, everyone else. Like, I know

5234
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
it's totally not original. And, like,

5235
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
how do I follow up?

5236
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
You know, that call that Extrofer just made,

5237
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
you know, I can't really-

5238
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
I am not touching myself, but

5239
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
I just wanted to congratulate all

5240
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
of you on your great achievement.

5241
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
And, yeah, that's amazing.

5242
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
500, like, I

5243
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
can't believe that. Well, thank you, baby. I appreciate it.

5244
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
I feel so nervous. Like, I'm on the radio.

5245
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Like, I'm kind of famous now.

5246
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
It's just me. You know me.

5247
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
You've met me. I'm not that scary.

5248
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
We're not that scary, right?

5249
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
You're a little

5250
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
scary.

5251
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Well,

5252
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
shoot, Slidekick, do you want to talk any games

5253
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
with us? What games have you been playing lately?

5254
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
I'm actually

5255
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
playing Fire Emblem Awakening.

5256
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Yeah? How's that?

5257
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
And I kind of suck at it, but

5258
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
it's cool. I like it a lot.

5259
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
I've never really played a lot of

5260
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
tactical strategy

5261
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
RPGs, so it's cool.

5262
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
I like it. There's a lot

5263
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
of people that are really into Fire Emblem

5264
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
on the 3DS, so I can't really

5265
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
blame you for being a fan of that.

5266
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
For sure.

5267
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
So, Slidekick,

5268
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
you've done a couple of podcasts of your own, too.

5269
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
I know you used to do a podcast with Alan.

5270
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Not everybody knows about this, but you used to do the

5271
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Amazing Warcraft podcast,

5272
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Fabulous Flames, right, Alan?

5273
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Yes, we did.

5274
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
And I have to say, Alan

5275
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
has been amazing tonight.

5276
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Yes, he has. I was a big

5277
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
fan of the Miss Nude World 96.

5278
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
I'm always

5279
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
a fan of the Miss

5280
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
Nude World 96.

5281
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
What are you doing these days in podcasting?

5282
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Do you have anything you want to plug?

5283
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Yes, and since

5284
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Exifer took the butt plug joke,

5285
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I'll just

5286
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
go ahead and shout out to

5287
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
my podcast, which is

5288
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Game Buoy. We're over at Gamebuoy.org,

5289
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
and we bring you gaming news

5290
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
and views that may be on your radar, but

5291
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
most definitely should be.

5292
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
And we are definitely inspired and

5293
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
pretty much owe everything about

5294
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
who we are, so thank you

5295
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
for being an inspiration

5296
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
and making

5297
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
a community out there

5298
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
for people to have a voice in gaming

5299
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
because it's super important

5300
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
for not just

5301
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
all the blogs and

5302
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
journalists

5303
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
to be the only ones talking about games.

5304
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Well, thank you. It means a lot,

5305
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
and your show is

5306
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
very good. I've heard it. And even though in those

5307
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
first few episodes I wanted to kill you over your

5308
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
sound quality, you guys have improved so

5309
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
much. You sound great now.

5310
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
It was actually better than it was on the previous

5311
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
one.

5312
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
I do miss Fabulous Flames, just saying.

5313
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
You sound great now, and

5314
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
your content is very good and

5315
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
well-researched, and you and Spike

5316
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
are great. And what I love most about your

5317
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
show is that you always pay it forward at the end,

5318
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
and you do give shout-outs and keep it

5319
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
indie, and I think that's great.

5320
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
And, you know, if we helped

5321
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
inspire that attitude, then that's

5322
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
a huge compliment.

5323
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
We're your biggest fans. We love

5324
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
you so much.

5325
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
I have been begging to come on your show for, like,

5326
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
six months, and look at this.

5327
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
I totally miss planning webcomics

5328
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
with you.

5329
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
I still have

5330
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
the WoW viewer. We can still do it.

5331
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
Yay!

5332
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Alright, well,

5333
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
Slidekick, I'm gonna let you go so I can get more calls,

5334
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
but anything else real quick before I let you go?

5335
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Um, no.

5336
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
Except I need to get

5337
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
up there and have an OLR party

5338
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
sometime. You're welcome any time.

5339
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Get up here on Sunday. You have to come up on Friday.

5340
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Bring Captain Spike.

5341
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
I will try. I will try.

5342
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have a good one.

5343
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Alright, you too.

5344
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Have a happy 500. Thank you.

5345
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Alright, 1877

5346
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
game OLR, username on Skype

5347
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call.

5348
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

5349
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
It's the undertaker of the internet,

5350
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Ravenstaufen. Wait a minute, weren't you just here?

5351
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
I was, but give me

5352
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
two minutes, Rob. Alright. I hope your

5353
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Paul Bearer didn't die. Alright, time

5354
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
starts now.

5355
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Alright, so I want to

5356
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
congratulate OrangeLoungeRadio

5357
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
for 500 shows and inspiring me

5358
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
to do my show. I'm not gonna

5359
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
plug it, but I'm just gonna say,

5360
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Rob, your cast

5361
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
and your people are very

5362
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
diverse, and you kept me entertained

5363
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
for years. I am now 26,

5364
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
and I've been listening since

5365
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
I was in high school as well.

5366
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Oh my god.

5367
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Oh my god, we're so old.

5368
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
I can feel myself

5369
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
aging. I've got cancer now.

5370
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
No, it's, it's, it's

5371
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
amazing. It's, that's amazing.

5372
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
It really is amazing. I also really

5373
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
like your voice.

5374
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Thanks. It's so funny. Your voice

5375
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
is very much mature. I remember when you used to

5376
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
call this show all the time when you were in high school,

5377
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
and the years right after that

5378
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
and so forth, your voice really has matured.

5379
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
Like, I can hear it through

5380
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
undoubtedly your own podcast and

5381
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
so forth. It's, it's, it's

5382
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
pleasant. It came a long way.

5383
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Everything came a long way, and I have to

5384
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
say, if OrangeLoungeRadio

5385
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
was a lighthouse in the beacon of the dark,

5386
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
you are

5387
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
awesome. Well, I appreciate

5388
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
it so much, Ravenstaufen, and thank you so

5389
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
much for sticking with us for all the years. It's a pleasure, as

5390
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
always, to hear from you. I've, I've, I

5391
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
listen to every archive. I've never

5392
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
leave. It's just sometimes I do my things

5393
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
on Sunday and it makes it hard. I had to cancel

5394
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
my own show for you guys because I had

5395
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
to be here for your special day.

5396
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Wow, that's, oh my gosh.

5397
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
Wow. What would you have talked

5398
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
about on your show tonight? Maybe we can

5399
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
work a little bit of it into here, a little

5400
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
crossover episode.

5401
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
Well, I was gonna talk about, and you guys

5402
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
didn't do, it was the whole thing about

5403
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Twitch TV, about that handicapped guy that

5404
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
wasn't handicapped. Yeah, I heard

5405
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
about this. So what, let me see if I can

5406
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
summarize. Let's see. So he was getting donations

5407
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
because he was sick

5408
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
and I guess it was donations for a surgery,

5409
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
right? And, uh, well

5410
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
the cameras weren't stopping on Twitch

5411
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
TV. He didn't turn them off and they caught

5412
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
him getting up out of his wheelchair.

5413
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Like, just getting up and walking

5414
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
away. So the, the cake was

5415
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
a lie, ladies and gentlemen, but that

5416
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
just goes to show, you gotta be, it's,

5417
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
it's sad that we can't just

5418
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
trust people and we can't, but like

5419
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
you, you do have to be skeptical.

5420
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
Like, that's why with the MS Walk stuff, and

5421
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
you know, we've been plugging that a lot. Like, I was very

5422
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
much like, we're gonna take it

5423
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
directly to the MS Walk

5424
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
society, the MS society and you donate

5425
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
right there, directly. We're not, you know,

5426
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
I don't, no funny business people.

5427
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
Yeah, so we were

5428
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
gonna talk about that. I mean, I had problems

5429
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
in the past. I mean, I'm on Social Security

5430
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
right now. I, you know, I

5431
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
had major problems, went to special

5432
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
schools. So for me, for someone that

5433
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
fakes an illness like that, like, you

5434
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
just slapped me in the face. And I'm not trying

5435
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
to get donations for what I'm doing,

5436
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
but it came a long

5437
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
way. It's, it's, you

5438
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
know what, though? That's, Karma

5439
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
will bite you when you do stuff like that. Karma

5440
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
will bite you. And Karma bit that guy

5441
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
big time. Big time. Yeah. So

5442
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
DJ Darknight

5443
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says

5444
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
that's just as bad as the guy that was caught spanking

5445
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
himself on Twitch. That's funny.

5446
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
That's funny.

5447
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
The wheelchair thing is, is bad.

5448
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
That's evil. That's awful. But the

5449
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
But that's the internet, though. Jerking it on Twitch, that's funny.

5450
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Any live streaming site, you're going

5451
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
to see dick or boobs anyway. Yeah, I was

5452
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
gonna say, or the one dude that had sex with his girlfriend

5453
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
or something like that in the background, or like, he

5454
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
just forgot it was on.

5455
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
Yeah, he forgot it was on. That's why I'm very

5456
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
careful about when I have the, I would not

5457
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
live stream 24-7 just because

5458
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Extra for, for shame. I know

5459
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
something bad would happen. Alright,

5460
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Ravenstaufen, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls, but thank you so

5461
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
much for the kind words. I understand. Thank you for taking my call.

5462
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Bye. No problem. Bye.

5463
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype.

5464
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Why not? We can do a couple

5465
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
more calls, right? We're only at 9-30.

5466
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
We are being

5467
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
horribly rude to our East Coast people.

5468
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
We are. How about one more call?

5469
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
One more call. One more call. Let's see who gets in.

5470
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. I'm

5471
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
totally, wait a minute, I'm totally jealous of all of them

5472
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
who have jobs.

5473
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
No. Keep them up all night.

5474
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
All night. You alright?

5475
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I was doing my Rhonda Shear

5476
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
impersonation. Hello? I see, I see.

5477
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Except I'm not wearing, you know, extra padding in the boob region.

5478
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
Alright, let me go to one more call. Hi, you're on

5479
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

5480
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
Hey, what's up? It's TigerClaw. Hey, TigerClaw.

5481
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
What's on your mind, buddy? Oh,

5482
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
I just want to congratulate you guys

5483
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
on your 500th episode.

5484
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
I guess you guys can go

5485
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
on record, maybe,

5486
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
as being the longest running podcast

5487
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
in history or something like that.

5488
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
We're not the longest running podcast. We are the longest

5489
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
running video game podcast. I don't

5490
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
even know. Well, you guys

5491
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
been around way before

5492
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
podcasting was a thing, so.

5493
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
I'd say live show. That's what gives

5494
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
us a jump on the other people is that we had

5495
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
the live 365 years and so

5496
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
we kind of slid right into the podcasting

5497
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
thing. But I would say

5498
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
I usually say we are the longest

5499
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
running internet show about

5500
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
video games. Weekly internet show about video games.

5501
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
Uh, yeah.

5502
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
But you know what? The internet, the internet

5503
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
TigerClaw, the internet is a big place.

5504
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
Like, uh, I've been putting

5505
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
together this special interest group on Facebook

5506
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
recently, uh, with some friends and I

5507
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
found that there's all these, like, other podcasters

5508
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
I didn't even know were out there. Like, I didn't even know

5509
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
these shows existed and, like, they're celebrating

5510
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
episode 100 and, and, and, like

5511
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
60 and I'm like, what?

5512
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
So, you never know what's out there, which is

5513
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
why I'm very cautious to stake a claim, like,

5514
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
we're the longest running show, bitches.

5515
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
You know, so I, I just,

5516
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
I want to be careful.

5517
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Yep, and just keep on doing

5518
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
what you're doing and

5519
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
and hopefully people will listen

5520
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
and, um,

5521
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
I don't know what else to say, uh,

5522
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
no matter how old you get

5523
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
just keep on gaming because

5524
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
you'll still feel the same way.

5525
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
Alright, well, TigerClaw,

5526
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
I appreciate your support over

5527
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
the years. It means an awful lot.

5528
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Uh, no problem.

5529
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
You're welcome. So, better let some other

5530
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
people call in. Alright, we'll see if

5531
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
maybe we'll let one more sneak in since you were short.

5532
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
But have a good one, TigerClaw. Alright, thanks.

5533
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
Alright. Take care. Mm-hmm, you too. Bye-bye.

5534
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Bye. Well, we can do

5535
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
one more. Let's do one more.

5536
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
One more, come on. Show up. Alright,

5537
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
one more, one more. Especially this one.

5538
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
Alright, hi, oh.

5539
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
Oh my gosh, it's a scary

5540
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
black man on the cam, oh my gosh.

5541
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
No, I'm kidding, you

5542
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
guys, it's DJ Rama S. You are looking

5543
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
sharp in your vlog shirt. You are looking very sharp

5544
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
today, young man. How are you?

5545
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
I'm doing fine. How is everybody in the

5546
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
Sacramento studios? We're,

5547
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
I'm sobering up, sadly.

5548
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
Oh, you should not be sobering up, because

5549
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
I have a problem with that good sir. Uh-oh,

5550
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
what's that? Well,

5551
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
ah. What are you drinking?

5552
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
If you can

5553
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
see what I got here. I

5554
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
love you, and I need to be at your house

5555
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
right now.

5556
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
He's got a bottle of

5557
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
Glenfiddich. This is one of

5558
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
two bottles of Glenfiddich I have.

5559
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Okay, I'm a BRB going on a plane.

5560
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
Of course, I could just go to Becky's house.

5561
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
Do you see this glass right here? Yes, I do.

5562
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
Oh, wait, hold it, except for once

5563
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
it says something about a Luigi hat. Give me

5564
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
one quick second. Oh, lord.

5565
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Wait, they can't, they can't, they can't, we're the

5566
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
only ones that can see you.

5567
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
Okay, he's wearing that, well you can, Rob,

5568
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
do you know what print screen is?

5569
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Oh, uh, yes, I do

5570
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
print screen.

5571
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
You've got Photoshop, right?

5572
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
I'll print screen, we'll just get that window.

5573
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
There we go. Alright, I think I got him, we'll see.

5574
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
Nice.

5575
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Do I even have PaintShop Pro on this

5576
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
computer or whatever? God, PaintShop Pro.

5577
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
Shut up.

5578
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
PaintShop Pro. I might have

5579
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
MS Paint. You know what, you

5580
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
can paste it in Paint.

5581
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
There you go, you got it. Yes, I got it.

5582
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
Woohoo. Alright, I'll save it as a paint thing

5583
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
and fix that up later. Alright, so anyhow.

5584
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
Bitmap.

5585
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
Where was I? I'm gonna save it

5586
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
with the very clever untitled

5587
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
.bmp. Alright,

5588
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
um, you're looking,

5589
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
Rob, I already took the damn picture.

5590
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
Rob is sadly not on a Mac.

5591
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
I'll continue to wear it to the end of the

5592
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
video broadcast, but as you can see,

5593
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
I am popping this bad boy open

5594
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
that has been in my freezer for the past

5595
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
two weeks. Oh, nice.

5596
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
And, as I

5597
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
pour this, I want to thank each and every

5598
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
single one of you. As everyone

5599
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
said before, if it wasn't for OLR,

5600
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
there wouldn't be no anime jam session.

5601
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
And also,

5602
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
I will not be one of those

5603
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
podcasters that will beg for

5604
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
money to do my show. What me,

5605
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
Marco, and Ari, what we all do,

5606
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
we do it for love, and we pick up

5607
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
all our money and we do it together.

5608
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
I'll do it for dollar

5609
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
bills to show my tatas,

5610
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
but that's it.

5611
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
Someone

5612
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
did send me money one time. For showing

5613
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
your tatas? No. I do

5614
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
that for free.

5615
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
To Dan.

5616
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
She does that for drinks.

5617
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
But no, remember when I had Pump Up the Volume?

5618
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
And Loki put it in my intro

5619
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
to tune in and give me a dollar? Oh yeah,

5620
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
someone actually sent me a dollar. I remember that.

5621
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
It was good times.

5622
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
Rama, thank you so much for the toast,

5623
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
and as I was saying before to some of the other

5624
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
callers, that is really the ultimate

5625
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
compliment to hear that we might

5626
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
have inspired even a portion of somebody

5627
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
else's show. It's outstanding.

5628
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
You need to come back for fun of me.

5629
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
We're just here having a good time.

5630
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
Go on.

5631
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
You cut out. Go ahead, Rama.

5632
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Well, I was going to say, OLR

5633
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
is not just a podcast. We're like a

5634
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
frickin' family. A giant

5635
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
dysfunctional family.

5636
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:31,000
We put the fun

5637
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,000
in dysfunction. That's right.

5638
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,000
I will go on record right now.

5639
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
You guys

5640
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
really got me through

5641
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,000
the passing of my mother when I called that

5642
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
one night and asked for you guys to play

5643
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:45,000
Let's Screw.

5644
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
That was one of my favorite songs.

5645
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
You guys played it, and I could not

5646
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,000
thank y'all enough for doing that.

5647
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,000
I'm more than happy

5648
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
to do so, especially if it'll help

5649
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
even just the slightest bit

5650
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
in somebody's really shitty day,

5651
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
to put it lightly. I'm

5652
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
happy to.

5653
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
Hearts.

5654
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
Of course. Now to

5655
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
Sky.

5656
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
Loki. Dark

5657
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
Sakura. Here's to you.

5658
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
Here's to me. The best of friends

5659
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
will ever be. If you should ever

5660
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
happen to disagree, well, fuck you

5661
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
and here's to me. Fuck you too,

5662
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
buddy. I hope

5663
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
that puts you on the floor. That is seriously

5664
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
my second favorite toast ever.

5665
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
That's great.

5666
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
And before I go, I did say I have a

5667
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
little treat for you. Okay. I love

5668
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
your hand flailing. That's cute.

5669
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
I thought that was the treat.

5670
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
I just came back from a J-pop concert and I got

5671
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
in for free, okay?

5672
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Amazing.

5673
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
But I'll have PAX East.

5674
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
I happen to run into a famous

5675
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
Nerdcore rapper, and I asked him to do

5676
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
a favor, and hopefully

5677
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
this will play through.

5678
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
And here we go.

5679
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
This is MC Frontalot, and you are

5680
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
participating with the Voice of Geeks

5681
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
Network.

5682
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
Shut the front

5683
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
door. Oh my god.

5684
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
Oh

5685
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
my god. That's amazing.

5686
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
Wow.

5687
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
Work it.

5688
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
I love you forever.

5689
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
I'm buying you drinks.

5690
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Alright, that's it. New York. When we going?

5691
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
Right now. Bye, BRB.

5692
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
Head to New York. BRB, New York.

5693
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
Alright, no. You have to pick up

5694
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
Marco as you go, because if you go, take

5695
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
me without her. She's going to kick everybody's

5696
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
ass. BRB is stopping in New Jersey.

5697
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
Alright,

5698
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
Rama, that was

5699
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
amazing. That was awesome.

5700
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
You've been an amazing support over the

5701
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
years, and thank you so much,

5702
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
buddy. You don't even know.

5703
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
No, thank you, because

5704
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
you guys gave me this opportunity to do

5705
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
this, so me running around, finding

5706
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
these opportunities to give you guys

5707
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
bumpers, interviews, this and that.

5708
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
This is more than my way of saying

5709
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
thank you, you know? This is,

5710
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
you know, all I ever wanted

5711
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
was to get my show on, and Rob, you gave

5712
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
me that opportunity, so

5713
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
believe it or not, I'm in your eternal thanks for all

5714
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
of this. Well, it's the

5715
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
least I could do.

5716
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Alright, take care of my friend. We have

5717
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
to go wrap up. It's not a marathon

5718
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
show. Yes? Stay black, my

5719
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
brother. I will, absolutely.

5720
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
Good night. Hey,

5721
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
run, run, Sean. Yeah, that's okay, Sean.

5722
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
Stay drunk.

5723
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
Bye, my friend.

5724
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
I don't have to have sinned.

5725
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
Alright, I'm hitting hang up now,

5726
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
because I've said bye like five times. Alright.

5727
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
That was

5728
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
amazing. It'll always be my run, Sean.

5729
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
What a great show.

5730
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
I'm getting a little of a clempt.

5731
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
Do we have any last minute stories? Oh, I need to read

5732
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
Twitter topics. Where's my iPad?

5733
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
Do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

5734
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
No. No, he's ready to go.

5735
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
I have a last

5736
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
minute story. Okay.

5737
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
I like these brownies. They're awesome.

5738
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
I just want to say, just kind of like a

5739
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
blanket thank you to

5740
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
the kind words on

5741
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
Twitter. There's been a lot of tweet

5742
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
activity tonight, and I just want to say a

5743
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
big thank you for all of that.

5744
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,000
I don't have the time yet, because we're

5745
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
running way over to read each and every single

5746
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
one of them, but I just want to say thank you.

5747
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Quickly, some of these tweets, real

5748
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
quick. Act F

5749
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
tweeting us about Shadowrun Returns

5750
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
backers for the DRM-free copy of the game

5751
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
may have gotten screwed by Microsoft,

5752
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
and in a nutshell, the game will be

5753
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
free, but the

5754
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
original game

5755
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
will be DRM-free, but the DLC

5756
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
will not. So they're holding

5757
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
up their end of the bargain. Basically what it is, is you get

5758
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
two versions of the game. You get a DRM-free

5759
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
version of the game. You get a Steam version of the game.

5760
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
Steam version will support the DLC

5761
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
beyond the Kickstarter

5762
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
exclusive DLC, and then

5763
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:45,000
the free-to-play

5764
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
DRM-free game will only

5765
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
support the Kickstarter

5766
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
DLC, but no

5767
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
additional DLC.

5768
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
Tigerclaw tweeting us that

5769
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
Ska Studios challenges the view that

5770
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,000
Microsoft is bad for indies, so not

5771
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
everybody is saying that Microsoft is this

5772
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:03,000
evil indie thing. Bobby Blackwolf

5773
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
tweeting us about this is a travesty

5774
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:07,000
in a story about Disneyland. Apparently

5775
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:09,000
Space Mountain was

5776
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,000
closed while Disneyland reviewed safety.

5777
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,000
Space Mountain, the Matterhorn Bobsleds,

5778
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
and Soarin' Over California were

5779
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,000
out of service today.

5780
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:19,000
What a shitty day to be at Disneyland.

5781
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:21,000
Hey, we weren't there.

5782
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:23,000
You poor guys that went to Disneyland today.

5783
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
But they did reopen Matterhorn Bobsleds already,

5784
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,000
which, you know, is kind of... I'm just still

5785
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
irritated they took out the basketball court.

5786
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:31,000
They did? Yeah, they took out the basketball

5787
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,000
court when they redid the tracks.

5788
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
For those who don't know their

5789
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,000
Disney trivia, the Matterhorn had a half

5790
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:39,000
court up in the very top of the

5791
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,000
mountain for cast members

5792
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,000
to go during their break.

5793
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,000
ActDeft tweeting us saying

5794
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
Wars of Horizon getting a new free DLC

5795
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,000
pack called the 1000 Club.

5796
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
I like free DLC. I'm on board

5797
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
with that. Also,

5798
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
ActDeft tweeting us...

5799
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,000
I think I went over his too, but that's okay.

5800
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
A New Jersey assemblywoman wants to

5801
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
ban violent video games in public

5802
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:03,000
places. Yeah, was that the same one where they

5803
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,000
want to ban M-rated arcade games? Yeah, they want

5804
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:07,000
to ban M-rated and AO-rated arcade

5805
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,000
games. Problem being, the ESRB does not

5806
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
rate arcade games.

5807
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:13,000
Yeah. So,

5808
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:15,000
way to do your research.

5809
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000
How about if you don't like them? Don't take your

5810
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,000
children there. And I just want to give

5811
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:21,000
some quick shout outs. I know I said I wasn't going to read

5812
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,000
each and every one of these, but we actually had some other

5813
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:25,000
fellow podcasters that tweeted us

5814
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:27,000
and said congratulations. And I think it's

5815
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:29,000
important to give these guys a shout out because

5816
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:31,000
community

5817
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
makes us great. And us indie podcasters,

5818
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,000
we really, really have to stick together.

5819
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
So I do want to give a shout out to Godfrey

5820
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
from Gamertag Radio who sent a tweet earlier

5821
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000
today. And they've been going

5822
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
a very long time as well. I know they were one of the

5823
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000
first shows on iTunes as well, so

5824
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,000
he's had many, many great

5825
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:49,000
accomplishments. So props to you, Godfrey.

5826
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
GameBui, who you

5827
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,000
heard Slidekick earlier, also sent us a tweet.

5828
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,000
Those guys are a lot of fun.

5829
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
Even though I think they should go weekly,

5830
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
but when they do

5831
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
put out a show, it is fabulous and very well

5832
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:03,000
researched. We always love it when they put out.

5833
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
Who doesn't love it when they put out?

5834
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,000
The Rich from the Video Game

5835
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
Show tweeted us and said congrats on

5836
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:11,000
500. Now Video Game Show, I

5837
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
think, as far as I

5838
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:15,000
know, I could be wrong, but as

5839
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,000
far as I know, Video Game Show is

5840
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
the only other podcast

5841
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:21,000
in iTunes when it went

5842
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
live about gaming the day it went

5843
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
live that is still going. They're about to hit

5844
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:27,000
episode 400. And again, if

5845
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:29,000
we didn't have the live 365 years to count,

5846
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
we'd probably be tied with them right now. So

5847
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
big props to the Video Game

5848
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
Show for keeping it going for all this time.

5849
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
Our old friends at All Games Radio

5850
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
also wishing us well on episode 500

5851
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:41,000
tonight. I think that's very nice.

5852
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,000
I'm glad to hear that they're doing well

5853
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
as well too. They've added a lot

5854
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
of cool shows to their lineup. They've really

5855
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
diversified things a little bit.

5856
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
Props to you guys at All Games

5857
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
Radio for keeping it

5858
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:55,000
going and Indie Radio.

5859
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
And of course, to our pal

5860
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
Bobby Blackwolf who's

5861
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
always before us here. We love Bobby so

5862
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
much. And Brad from

5863
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:05,000
PodCultured. CriticalMyth

5864
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:07,000
who's hitting 300 episodes tomorrow.

5865
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000
Nice.

5866
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:11,000
And Anime Jam Session

5867
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
and Hoard House and Girls Gone

5868
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:15,000
Wow and British

5869
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:17,000
Invaders. Have I named everybody now? I think I have.

5870
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:19,000
Understation Live. Oh my God.

5871
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:21,000
Understation Live. Well, I don't think that we would

5872
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:23,000
be here without them. Isn't that

5873
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:25,000
funny? Is that everybody's

5874
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,000
calling in saying, O-L-R

5875
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:29,000
you inspire me to do this. O-L-R you

5876
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,000
did this. And I think this is a good note for us to end on

5877
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:33,000
tonight. You know what? I'm going to sit on this for a minute because I want to end

5878
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:35,000
on that note. So let me go around and get everybody's

5879
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:37,000
final thought. Becky,

5880
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
thank you so much for being here. I know you didn't get a chance to

5881
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,000
say an awful lot, but we really

5882
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
appreciate the culinary delights. And your

5883
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
support still means the world to us. So thank you for

5884
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
being here. You're welcome.

5885
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
It's okay. I'm just, I'm a very

5886
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
quiet person. That's alright. Any final thoughts for our listeners

5887
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000
though? While you're at it? Any

5888
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000
last words of wisdom?

5889
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Don't let your kids watch Sponge

5890
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:01,000
Bob.

5891
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:03,000
It's horrible.

5892
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,000
Dark

5893
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight?

5894
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:09,000
Oh, why the fuck not? Reject false

5895
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:11,000
icons. Ooh,

5896
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:13,000
taking it back a notch.

5897
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,000
Loki, your final thought tonight? I have two things. One, I have a picture

5898
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000
of poop on my phone. And two,

5899
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,000
uh, wow.

5900
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000
Let's do this

5901
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
Mark IV style, motherfuckers.

5902
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
My final thought

5903
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:27,000
tonight, as promised, I want to

5904
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,000
say a lot of you gave props

5905
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
to us for helping inspire what you do.

5906
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
But I really have to say, and I

5907
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,000
got into this on Facebook a little bit before,

5908
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
but I really just want to say that, you know,

5909
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:39,000
I studied radio in college

5910
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:41,000
and I actually originally was

5911
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:43,000
going to be a weatherman. That was what I was in

5912
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:45,000
college to study originally.

5913
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:47,000
I interned at a broadcast station

5914
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:49,000
at an actual

5915
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
news broadcast in the town I went

5916
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:53,000
to school in. And although

5917
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000
everybody was really nice and it was a really great

5918
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,000
eye-opening experience, the way

5919
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,000
my eyes were open was that most people

5920
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
were very miserable in the jobs that they were doing and

5921
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
it really didn't want to be something I wanted to continue.

5922
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
So I kind of got into radio as a result

5923
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
of that, but I felt a lot of that same

5924
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:09,000
stuff. That in commercial radio

5925
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
it's really not about who you know, but it's about who

5926
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
you blow. And that wasn't really what

5927
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
I wanted, you know, contrary to what Jamie might tell

5928
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
you about when I drink, that wasn't really what I

5929
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:19,000
wanted to pursue. So

5930
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
I didn't finish school

5931
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
because I became very jaded with a lot of it.

5932
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
And I was kind of like, what the hell am I wasting my time for?

5933
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
I just need to go out into the working world.

5934
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
And while I don't hate school and I think it's

5935
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
great that a lot of people do go to school and finish

5936
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:33,000
college and all that, for me at that time

5937
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:35,000
it was what I needed to do and it was a great

5938
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:37,000
thing. And I love where I ended up in my career

5939
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
so I'm happy. But I'm really thankful

5940
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
to my time

5941
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,000
I did spend at the college radio station,

5942
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
my very first radio show at KCSC

5943
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,000
Student Radio.

5944
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000
I just want to say props to that and for my time there.

5945
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
And then I also want to say a big thank you to

5946
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
Travis Donahue

5947
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
from Understation Live for bringing me

5948
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
on to his show back in

5949
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000
what, 2000, 2001

5950
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,000
when I came on to his show for the first

5951
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
time. And it was so much fun

5952
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:05,000
he asked me to come back and I came back

5953
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:07,000
over and over and over again. And through

5954
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
him I learned how easy it was to do a show on

5955
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,000
Live 365. And so

5956
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:13,000
I, like DJ Rama

5957
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:15,000
was talking about with his show and

5958
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,000
Code Man was talking about his show and everybody else,

5959
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
I said, you know, I want to do something like

5960
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:21,000
this for the day. And I

5961
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
you know, I want to do something like this for the

5962
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:25,000
DDR community and for

5963
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
the, you know, Bamani

5964
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
community and all my new friends

5965
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,000
that I've been making playing Dance Dance Revolution.

5966
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
And Jamie, of course, was a big part

5967
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:35,000
of that. We kind of thought of all the basic

5968
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:37,000
concepts on that Bart ride.

5969
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
And then Loki, well, he just tagged along for

5970
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:41,000
the ride, but this show

5971
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
would not be the same without him. I do need to thank Travis, too,

5972
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:45,000
for having me on as a guest so much and filling in

5973
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,000
for Jessica. Absolutely. Absolutely.

5974
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,000
So, yeah,

5975
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:51,000
I guess this is in a way

5976
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:53,000
500 episodes of paying it forward.

5977
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
So really appreciate

5978
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
it. I don't know what else to say.

5979
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,000
I see lots of great stuff in the

5980
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,000
chat room right now. YYR says, thank you

5981
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,000
guys for 500 great episodes and for devoting

5982
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
so much of your time and energy to contribute towards

5983
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,000
all of our lives, ours and yours.

5984
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,000
Tim TRP says, Rob, you have a

5985
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:11,000
voice for radio, a face for TV

5986
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,000
news and a body for hardcore

5987
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000
pornography. Wait a minute.

5988
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,000
Wait a minute.

5989
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,000
Oh, Tim.

5990
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
Tim. All right.

5991
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,000
I'm going to cry in a second, by the way.

5992
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:25,000
Are you? What else can I say to make you cry?

5993
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:27,000
Shut up.

5994
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:29,000
If someone else brings up Sharmi, maybe.

5995
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
The chips are gone.

5996
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
I missed them already.

5997
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:37,000
All right.

5998
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
I think it's time we end the show. Thank you guys

5999
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
so much for 500 great episodes.

6000
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
Let's try to be less sappy next week, you guys.

6001
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
I did pick something very, very,

6002
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
very classic for Cookie.

6003
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.

6004
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
All right, that's it. We're done. What do you say, guys?

6005
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:53,000
We'll do it all again next week, all right?

6006
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Come on back next week for episode

6007
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
501.

6008
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:59,000
Until then,

6009
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,000
have a great week.

6010
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
Don't be a dick.

6011
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,000
And have fun. It's only a game.

6012
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:07,000
