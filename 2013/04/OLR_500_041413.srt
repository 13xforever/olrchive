00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:19,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, April 14, 2013, could Capcom be ending HD fighting game remakes?

2
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:25,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Level 5 is said to work on a PlayStation 4 game, and could one government be investigating in-app sales?

3
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:40,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Live and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:47,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight, episode number 500 for this April the 14th of 2013.

00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:53,916
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

6
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:19,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,364
[SPEAKER_07]: What is pre-made mimosa?

8
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that you don't have to buy orange juice and champagne separately.

9
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:25,386
[SPEAKER_03]: How lazy are you?

10
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:26,466
[SPEAKER_03]: They did that shit for you.

11
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:33,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I did something called saving time, space, and money by just bringing it already done.

12
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, fuck it.

13
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:36,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It's booze.

14
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:37,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It drinks the same way.

15
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:41,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of fuck it, I decided to mark the occasion tonight.

16
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:42,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to wear my pajama pants.

17
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:43,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a picture, Rob.

18
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,261
[SPEAKER_07]: With all these little lips all over them that say, kiss me.

19
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:49,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm wearing my pajamas to OLR tonight.

20
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob wants his pants kissed.

21
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I give no fucks.

22
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy 500th episode.

23
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you gave the last fuck last episode.

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're fresh out of fucks.

25
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

26
00:01:59,352 --> 00:01:59,673
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

27
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:00,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello.

28
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:02,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

29
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:03,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

30
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,257
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, Loki?

31
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:06,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish these fries were better.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd throw them all away because they're crap.

33
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You went to McDonald's, duh.

34
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it's a crap shoot, I know.

35
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't that hungry, so I expected them to suck.

36
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:18,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to be pleasantly surprised that they were good, but they were not.

37
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that the tragedy that has followed you for 11 years here on this program?

38
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:28,165
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is I was very indecisive on what I wanted to eat.

39
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:36,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was kind of like, you know, first I started driving towards Jack in the Box and I'm like, eh, I'm not that hungry.

40
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:36,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't judge me.

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not hungry enough for Jack in the Box.

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,590
[SPEAKER_14]: So then I went to McDonald's.

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, oh, but I really want Subway, but it's across the street.

44
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,353
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm like, eh, I'll just eat McDonald's because I need to get gas.

45
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,974
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture said they were the worst absolute things in the world.

47
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:12,614
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazing.

48
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:13,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them.

49
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:16,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're the best potato chips I've ever had, but they're not bad.

50
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,120
[SPEAKER_03]: The cheesy garlic bread ones, though, are pretty epic.

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they?

52
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,802
[SPEAKER_03]: They are quite epic.

53
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:22,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever came up with that little contest at Lay's, genius.

54
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are talking about food yet again.

55
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Why break tradition, folks?

56
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Why break tradition, folks?

57
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:30,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather just have a waffle.

58
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, waffles would be awesome right now.

59
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:36,099
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a special guest here joining us tonight.

60
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Becky!

61
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:39,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Greetings.

62
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:40,503
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you, Becky?

63
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing pretty well, thanks.

64
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:42,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.

65
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:45,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Becky, for those that don't know, is Jamie's BFF.

66
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Jamie sometimes talks about her on the show.

67
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's also quite the chef.

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Becky was kind enough to actually cook.

69
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go with food again on a video game show.

70
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Was kind enough to cook for us tonight.

71
00:03:58,032 --> 00:03:59,613
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you make for us tonight, Becky?

72
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:03,736
[SPEAKER_20]: I made red velvet brownies, and they look like murder.

73
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:09,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They are beautiful, glorious, dripping red.

74
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope y'all don't see the food boner in my jammies right now.

75
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go take pictures.

76
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds pretty epic.

77
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the food boner?

78
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,709
[SPEAKER_14]: No comment.

79
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,771
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment.

80
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Murder is Pretty Fucking Tasty

81
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:57,523
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be awesome if you drew like Super Meat Boy on those because that would be... That's perfect.

82
00:04:57,843 --> 00:04:58,664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, Becky.

83
00:04:58,684 --> 00:04:59,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do this again next weekend.

84
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on, live listeners?

85
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the stream not... I guess a lot of people are bitching that the stream is like stopping going tonight or something.

86
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what's up with that.

87
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,333
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not doing anything different.

88
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:09,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it.

89
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:11,535
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too many of you listening.

90
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:12,896
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what's happening.

91
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Bite your tongue.

92
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:14,838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

93
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:19,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live every... Every Wednesday when I'm not here.

94
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,370
[SPEAKER_07]: What fucking show is having a birthday today, Rob?

95
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:35,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We do tape live every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

96
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:41,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to all you guys who do turn out live or who do listen to us in the podcast.

97
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of VOG Network, are the brownies really good?

98
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:46,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about to eat one.

99
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:12,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could go and actually ask the listeners questions and actually pull them instantly.

100
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bobby Blackwolf, in celebration of our 500th episode, has made that a reality.

101
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:24,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So for all you guys that are right there on live.vognetwork.com, because it's the only place you're going to see it.

102
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:29,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're tuned into IRC via MIRC or something, make sure you bring up live.vognetwork.com.

103
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,208
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to refresh the page or anything like that.

104
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,889
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to happen automatically.

105
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:43,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is time for the very first time we are going to go to our live audience poll.

106
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:46,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Dork.

107
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,234
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

108
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:51,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight in the very first VOG Network live poll.

109
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:57,682
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to settle the great debate once and for all because we have to start with an epic question.

110
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:58,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is.

111
00:06:58,883 --> 00:06:59,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's question.

112
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us settle the great debate once and for all.

113
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Cake or pie?

114
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us settle the great debate once and for all.

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Cake or pie?

116
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,458
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is up there at live.vognetwork.com.

117
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,299
[SPEAKER_07]: You can participate right now and vote in the poll.

118
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:21,960
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at this.

119
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,920
[SPEAKER_07]: How cool is this?

120
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We see the results live as they come in.

121
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:26,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all tied up right now.

122
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, cake just pulled ahead a little bit.

123
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,906
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the most amazing thing ever.

124
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby is a genius.

125
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:35,208
[SPEAKER_07]: He's great.

126
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:36,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there it is.

127
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us settle the great debate once and for all.

128
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Cake or pie?

129
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,032
[SPEAKER_07]: We will read the results here momentarily, but it does look like cake is quite a bit ahead here in the live poll.

130
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:44,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

131
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:47,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

132
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,774
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do I want to talk about tonight?

133
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:51,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the new feature that I want to talk about.

134
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you guys want to say in acknowledgement of our 500th episode?

135
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,939
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck are we doing?

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at your life.

137
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at your choices.

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.

139
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go drink now.

140
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:09,482
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to drink too.

141
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,202
[SPEAKER_14]: That poll is going to be too distracting.

142
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:14,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to keep watching it change.

143
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

144
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hypnotic.

145
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hypnotic to watch.

146
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,406
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

147
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:24,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Do brownies count as cake?

148
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:28,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We are going to be required now to use that sound clip every time we do an Insta poll.

149
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:29,928
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the plan.

150
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Do brownies count as cake?

151
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:34,023
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

152
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should have added brownies to the list.

153
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

154
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:38,386
[SPEAKER_21]: But what does ice cream cake count as?

155
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:39,107
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess cake.

156
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,348
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not real cake.

157
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But what about pudding-filled cake?

158
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Boston cream pie.

159
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a pie, but it really has cake bits.

160
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you're making it too fucking complicated, lady.

161
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

162
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, how thoughtful.

163
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:51,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hi, Alan.

164
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:51,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

165
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:54,179
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you just set down in front of me here in studio?

166
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Take a whiff of it.

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Smell it.

168
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's that stuff I can't have.

169
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:12,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting drunk just smelling it.

170
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to smell how awful it is.

171
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,611
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to smell it?

172
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,015
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a present from Brad from Pod Culture, our pals.

173
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank god, it smells more like whiskey than it does like cinnamon.

174
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:22,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to smell it at all?

175
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:23,158
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

176
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, do you want to introduce the drink?

177
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's Fireball Whiskey.

178
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:29,924
[SPEAKER_09]: The bottle art is amazing.

179
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't have anything for a chaser, really, so I got you a glass of water.

180
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:37,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple juice I think would have been really good, but we don't have any.

181
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,732
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot to make apple pie.

182
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:39,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Weep hole.

183
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:42,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Chase it with a brownie.

184
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,037
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to chase it with a brownie.

185
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll chase it with a brownie, but here's the thing.

186
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,700
[SPEAKER_07]: When was the last time we did drinking on OLR?

187
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very long time ago.

188
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I remember one time I ate half a box of waffles.

189
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:59,513
[SPEAKER_14]: If I didn't have to take my son to school every morning I would have totally crashed.

190
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,736
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to take tomorrow off work.

191
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:05,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you had the tequila binge.

192
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of hilarious.

193
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't drink tequila.

194
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: You did once.

195
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:09,487
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't.

196
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it vodka?

197
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:12,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always vodka.

198
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I could swear it was tequila.

199
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, he married a Russian chick.

200
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:17,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always vodka, right?

201
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:19,316
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't drink anything.

202
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: She likes rum.

203
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:23,920
[SPEAKER_09]: When will you be ready to launch into your gaming week if Rob ends up in a coughing fit after he does this shot?

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the first news story ready.

205
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't we have a disclaimer we usually give during drinking shows?

206
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:31,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't drink and drive.

207
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I live here, so I can drink.

208
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:35,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be irresponsible.

209
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:37,707
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep it in your pants.

210
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:38,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

211
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Drink moderately.

212
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:47,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't come up with, you know, next-gen game console ideas after, you know, consuming vast quantities of alcohol.

213
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so here's my cheers to all you non-drinkers.

214
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:51,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you toast me with something?

215
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go make me a coffee.

216
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:53,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

217
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:53,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

218
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers!

219
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:54,253
500!

220
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:54,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

221
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:54,853
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three.

222
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:55,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Five.

223
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:02,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Rob.

224
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you guys could see the look on his face.

225
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,937
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, like, gone immediately for the water.

226
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

227
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:15,859
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fantastic radio.

228
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor Rob.

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Your face is red.

230
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:20,581
[SPEAKER_07]: 500 episodes, I do what I want.

231
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:24,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go make my mimosa after I do my week.

232
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

233
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:34,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, thank you for the bottle of Fireball because this is so worth it right now.

234
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,655
[SPEAKER_21]: The webcam's at my house.

235
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,516
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been using it to stream drawing.

236
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:44,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, is there anything you wanted to say in celebration of our 500th episode?

237
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:48,122
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not really.

238
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:52,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have anything I want to say.

239
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Technically, Ron just had a double.

240
00:11:54,808 --> 00:12:00,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Just that I wish that the wife was capable of taking the son to school so then I could partake.

241
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:00,932
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah.

242
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:01,733
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I...

243
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:03,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot.

244
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:05,495
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

245
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:12,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I just really want to thank everybody for supporting our show and being here.

246
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been great to do a giant convention for our 500th episode and just have you all in one room, but money.

247
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Our apartment ain't that big.

248
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, exactly.

249
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We're happy to just have you all here and chat with us.

250
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to acknowledge this as well because this is the most awesome thing that ever awesomed.

251
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,712
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that one of our listeners, Codeman,

252
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,552
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to take a picture of that too.

253
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you?

254
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Who has a YouTube channel, and I'm a horrible person because I can't remember the name of it right now, but hopefully somebody will dig it up and post it in chat.

255
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:50,716
[SPEAKER_07]: But Codeman is a graphic artist like DarkSakura, but he designed this really amazing poster to commemorate our 500th episode.

256
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:53,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie's going to put a picture of it right now at originalsradio.com.

257
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:53,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

258
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:57,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I might start reposting stuff just to Tumblr because it'll take less time.

259
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe his channel was at Ratchet1785.

260
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:00,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

261
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You're very Tigerclaw tonight.

262
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

263
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,140
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a poster to commemorate our 500th episode.

265
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:12,722
[SPEAKER_07]: What's awesome about this is that he's drawn us as these little chibi characters, and DarkSakura is like an N7 trooper.

266
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:13,883
[SPEAKER_07]: She's basically FemShep.

267
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki is Grand Theft Auto, and he's got a bloody baseball bat.

268
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm World of Warcraft.

269
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:19,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, guys, look.

270
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:21,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm flaming.

271
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:43,736
[SPEAKER_07]: and we have a ferret with dynamite strapped to him but you know what I really love about this is that if you look at the background he layered a bunch of listener names in the background I don't know where he got this list of names because I recognize old and new names in there like I look at this list and I go okay Jim Sally of course I know who he is but then I'm like Robo Boy 430 I haven't seen that name in years

272
00:13:44,196 --> 00:14:01,581
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think he did like a combination of people from like the wiki as well as people he's seen in our chat room and so forth so you guys are all a part of this poster as well which I think is just amazing he should sell prints of it I really wouldn't care and I think he'd make some good money so I bet a lot of you guys would like that alright

273
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:04,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So, oh, Tigerclaw found it.

274
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It's C. Taylor 1785.

275
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Codeman.

276
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:09,567
[SPEAKER_07]: He also does, oh, you know what?

277
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,468
[SPEAKER_07]: He co-hosts a show called Down for Maintenance.

278
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:12,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I should plug that.

279
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has very good artwork.

280
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

281
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:16,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Codeman, for that.

282
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we go to the results of our poll?

283
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:20,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

284
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,397
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, some of the photos are already up.

285
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,278
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just being slow.

286
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

287
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,840
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very top of OrangeLandsRadio.com.

288
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here it is, the results of our poll.

289
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,912
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go ahead and end it now, so if you didn't get in, too bad.

290
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:40,255
[SPEAKER_07]: The results of the poll was Cake won, and Cake was 62.86% to Pie, 37.14%.

291
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: You all pissed me off.

292
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

293
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

294
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm finally going to eat one of these brownies.

295
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:51,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about time to get into our gaming week.

296
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

297
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,001
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was semi-productive.

298
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:02,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I really didn't play a whole lot of stuff, but I did play some more Drunken Robot Pornography.

299
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is so fun, I swear.

300
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in the world by now should know how much I love Jumping Flash.

301
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Jumping Flash with guns and giant robots.

302
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, really good music.

303
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:14,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is crack.

304
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait for more of it to come out.

305
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played something that I'm not allowed to talk about.

306
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:43,133
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm not gonna except I will totally leave one game for this one that's all I can say um I um oh yeah I played Minecraft I actually streamed me playing Minecraft so I could show off my house or I should say my underground bunker so that I can hide from everybody else no one can find my house you've been getting really into this streaming thing lately

307
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I've more or less just wanted to get it to work because Dan and I have a plan.

308
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and do like a semi-announcement.

309
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I have a plan to start doing classic gaming stuff on Twitch TV.

310
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to decide if Twitch or livestream works better.

311
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:10,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to eventually get it to where we can run our capture card into... Well, we get a capture card to run the video game systems through the PC system.

312
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: and then have everything run off of the main monitor while we... Sorry, the liquor is starting to hit me.

313
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I start smiling for no reason, just ignore it.

314
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Rob, I'm feeling good.

315
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,521
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I like never drink anymore.

316
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:33,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fact that I have that is... I have no... I have the alcohol tolerance of a... Oh, J-Links, you are hilarious.

317
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:34,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Of a child.

318
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:59,229
[SPEAKER_03]: um but yeah uh so I've just been practicing like with different things and like lately I've just been um streaming um playing Mass Effect 2 because there's a couple people who watched it who just completely skipped it and are playing 3 so like no no no no no fixing this and then um I was playing Drunken Robot Pornography and I've been doing some drawing you know I tested out the webcam with it but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing webcam stuff

319
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:03,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't know if you heard Syl on Horde House this week, which we all love Syl.

320
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:03,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Syl.

321
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:04,465
[SPEAKER_07]: She's the best.

322
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:15,353
[SPEAKER_07]: But she was talking about some of her experiences in live streaming and how – because she has the webcam on her, and she's very resilient and able to do that because she gets all these trolls coming in there going, take your top off.

323
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you do – will you make out with a German chick?

324
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you do mouth to ass?

325
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you do – so –

326
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you put your mug out there?

327
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

328
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you probably don't want to.

329
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it pointing at a piece of paper.

330
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't take that the wrong way.

331
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:41,093
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a very pretty lady, and I don't think you give yourself enough credit, but there's just too many people on the internet that are crazy.

332
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:41,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Horny.

333
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're crazy horny.

334
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fortunately, none of them are my problem.

335
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

336
00:17:50,988 --> 00:18:19,993
[SPEAKER_03]: but thank you Jason I will look into the Black Magic capture card but no I was just practicing you know doing stuff and trying out different things because I think that what we're going to do is we're also going to maybe try to start bringing up you know stuff that's actually in our collection like lovely pajamas Rob like we have a whole lot of deluxe editions of games like for example the Cyberbots limited edition and

337
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:23,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That stupid Cardcaptor Sakura game that I had to have and played once.

338
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:25,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It came with a damn pillowcase.

339
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:34,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um... We're just really wanting to... And part of it is, too, we might actually be selling off part of the collection.

340
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:37,377
[SPEAKER_07]: LeGasp.

341
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:38,197
[SPEAKER_03]: LeGasp.

342
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:44,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about, like, the stuff that we actually don't play, which, you know, would probably be the Neo Geo CD and the Intellivision.

343
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably about it.

344
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... But, uh...

345
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:57,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't decided what I'm going to use the rest of it for right now until we get this officially started.

346
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: But Dan and I have been in the works talking about doing something like that for Twitch just because we're inspired by Classic Game Room and the Angry Video Game Nerd.

347
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that guy is absolutely hilarious.

348
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:12,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't make our show roll tonight, but I heard something about he's getting his own game or something.

349
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:14,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it a movie or a game or what?

350
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:15,577
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a movie already.

351
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:19,040
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a movie already because they had a Kickstarter for the movie and it was so dumb.

352
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the movie looked ridiculous.

353
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:24,205
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie was absolutely ridiculous, but it was hilarious too.

354
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to point out when Becky just took that brownie, she left these in the shape of a dick.

355
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice that?

356
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You were so perverted because I was thinking they were in the shape of a T. No, those are balls and that's the shaft.

357
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:39,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never seen a dick that red before.

358
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:43,995
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a letter T. You would have to do this to make it a cross.

359
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's a ball.

360
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:49,056
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a cross because this show needs Jesus right now.

361
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

362
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who needs Jesus, Rob?

363
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, did I offend the Jew?

364
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

365
00:19:58,427 --> 00:19:59,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't offend the Jew.

366
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,210
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, try harder.

367
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,231
[SPEAKER_07]: The atheist is pissed.

368
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the atheist is pissed.

369
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:11,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then let me just call Justin Bieber, because then maybe Justin Bieber can really offend you.

370
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Rob, I'm so disappointed.

371
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You're such a heathen.

372
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,707
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

373
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:57,172
[SPEAKER_20]: God, she got me into Mass Effect and it has sucked away my whole damn life.

374
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:58,512
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

375
00:20:58,852 --> 00:20:59,552
[SPEAKER_07]: One of us.

376
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:00,813
[SPEAKER_07]: One of us.

377
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:01,913
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

378
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

379
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Fem Shep or Male Shep?

380
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:05,454
[SPEAKER_20]: Fem Shep.

381
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I have done a Bro Shep.

382
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:09,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I call him Bro Shep because Male Shep sounds weird.

383
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:13,375
[SPEAKER_20]: But I did a playthrough just because it was the only way I could romance Jack.

384
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:16,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

385
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:17,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

386
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:22,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why Jack wasn't a crazy lesbian hookup.

387
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it either.

388
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:24,554
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't make any sense.

389
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have gone for it.

390
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:27,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is your romance of choice?

391
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know and I think it's a good one.

392
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's your romance of choice?

393
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:31,058
[SPEAKER_20]: Thane.

394
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:31,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Thane.

395
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Thane kind of, they really screwed with him in Mass Effect 3 by, you know, spoilers, killing him off.

396
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The game's a year old now, right?

397
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:39,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

398
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:43,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But they tried to make things right with the Citadel DLC.

399
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you happy with what they did?

400
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:50,189
[SPEAKER_20]: I was very happy with it because it never actually bothered me that he died.

401
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,830
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, he had a terminal illness.

402
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,031
[SPEAKER_20]: If he hadn't died, I would have found it stupid.

403
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:58,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that they let him die in a heroic kind of way.

404
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:04,496
[SPEAKER_20]: What pissed me off was that nobody said they were sorry for your loss if you romanced him.

405
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,837
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, Garrus is there at the...

406
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:18,011
[SPEAKER_20]: memorial wall standing right in front of his name and doesn't say a word about it and that that was the part that pissed me off so actually getting to have a memorial service made me very happy

407
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I have to admit, I did watch the whole thing on YouTube and watching the videos because there's an extra video.

408
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:29,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you find out that... This really isn't that bad of a spoiler, you guys.

409
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,506
[SPEAKER_07]: You find out that Thane made all these videos to Shepard.

410
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he said he did.

411
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:38,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and no matter if you romanced him or not, you get to see most of the videos.

412
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,630
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you romanced him, there's an extra video you get to see.

413
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to admit, I got a little choked up.

414
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:45,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And what especially got me was...

415
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:49,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The goodbye scene at the very end when they're all getting back on the ship.

416
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:50,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like...

417
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,090
[SPEAKER_20]: The feels, the feels.

418
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,531
[SPEAKER_20]: I am overcome by the feels.

419
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:55,672
[SPEAKER_20]: I cried like a little girl.

420
00:22:56,272 --> 00:23:00,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I copied off Becky's save files from her Xbox so that I could mod her Shepard.

421
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:11,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I played through all of the memorial and everything with her Shepard, which it's always very weird playing somebody else's Shepard.

422
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:16,327
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I actually had to go get tissues and cuddle the cat for a little while because...

423
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:24,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Technus in our chatroom says, I think Jack being either bi or a lesbian would have been kind of cliche IMO.

424
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:28,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But Breakman corrects and says, it is part of Jack's backstory.

425
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,742
[SPEAKER_07]: She was in a relationship with a man and a woman.

426
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, again, live.vognetwork.com.

427
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And Extover says, there goes any interest I had in playing the game too.

428
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:38,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shush.

429
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:40,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Shush, you haters.

430
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:43,329
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

431
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other games that you've been into besides, you know, space operas?

432
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:51,337
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been... Adventure Time?

433
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:54,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have Adventure Time DS games.

434
00:23:55,018 --> 00:24:04,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Watching my son play a lot of Adventure Time and scream at the computer was kind of adorable to watch an almost six-year-old going, Stupid computer!

435
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:05,301
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop that!

436
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,261
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not supposed to do that!

437
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:09,082
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, so cute.

438
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:17,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so interesting watching kids now when, like, you know, back in my day when I was six, we had Commodore 64 and that was cutting edge.

439
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:18,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, you know...

440
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,755
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you had Commodore 64 when you were six?

441
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:21,355
[SPEAKER_20]: You're such a baby!

442
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:21,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

443
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,097
[SPEAKER_20]: Becky had to play with sticks.

444
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:35,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart, love.

445
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:36,808
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

446
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:40,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming there's nothing else for Becky's gaming week, let me go over to Loki.

447
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:41,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

448
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I played, let's see, lots of Saints Row III, actually.

449
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:48,597
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been trying to go through 100% everything.

450
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, 100% almost everything.

451
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it would be 98% because I don't want to play all the co-op stuff.

452
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:56,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really want to play through the game for like a fourth time.

453
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:57,525
[SPEAKER_14]: It would just be so annoying.

454
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:58,246
[SPEAKER_14]: You're so annoying.

455
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I finished up the DLC stuff.

456
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:09,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually finishing up right now the Gangsters in Space DLC, which is alright.

457
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:14,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the first DLC really sucked, and the other two were okay.

458
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:20,277
[SPEAKER_14]: They weren't necessarily like... I mean, they were still kind of side missions, but they at least dressed them up a little bit more.

459
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:21,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

460
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:23,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're just so short.

461
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,051
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like three missions long, and that's it.

462
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:30,197
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like 10-minute missions and 30 minutes for like seven bucks initially.

463
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of a ripoff.

464
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:35,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So whatever, you know.

465
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:38,008
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm playing the room, and...

466
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:41,203
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

467
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,463
[SPEAKER_14]: A franchise you love and then you think, oh hey look, there's a sci-fi rip-off of that franchise.

468
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,784
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what Defiance is for Borderlands.

469
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:15,645
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically a sci-fi rip-off of Borderlands.

470
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:19,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've got all these different weapons that you can use and stuff.

471
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:27,351
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not necessarily that you specialize in anything, but the more you use a weapon, the better... Well, eventually it gets better.

472
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:27,931
[SPEAKER_14]: And then...

473
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:36,501
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the different elemental stuff and it's kind of hard to get good weapons in the game I've found so far unless I'm not doing something right.

474
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:48,096
[SPEAKER_14]: But they have these lock boxes that you basically scavenge parts from killing people or taking weapons that you find and loot and breaking them down into parts.

475
00:26:48,576 --> 00:27:02,747
[SPEAKER_14]: and then you use those parts to buy keys and then using those keys you buy these random loot chests I guess that have two random weapons which for my, you know, so far doing tier 2 and tier 3 chests, they've all sucked.

476
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:03,668
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

477
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:06,550
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of lame.

478
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:11,495
[SPEAKER_07]: You were telling me about the TV show beforehand, and Tiger Claw is saying some stuff in our chatroom about that.

479
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you watch the TV show?

480
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't watched the TV show.

481
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:15,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if it's on yet.

482
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But one thing I did know, or it just seemed like... Strudels89 in our chatroom says, I think it airs in a week or so.

483
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's Monday.

484
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:27,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's this week, either Monday or Tuesday, I think it's airing.

485
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:33,554
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the thing, they are trying so hard to almost be like a Battlestar Galactica or something like that.

486
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:37,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I was mentioning, they have their own lingo, or their own slang, I guess.

487
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,418
[SPEAKER_14]: To be fair, it's by the creators of Battlestar Galactica.

488
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:42,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that is quite fair.

489
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,020
[SPEAKER_14]: So at least they're ripping themselves off.

490
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they're ripping themselves off, but they're kind of forcing it a little bit.

491
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:53,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know, Battlestar Galactica, one of the most recognizable things is the use of the word frack instead of fuck.

492
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,047
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

493
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:16,449
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, the game itself, it's kind of fun.

494
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:20,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the fact that you can kind of just run around and do whatever.

495
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:35,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been playing solo through the whole thing, but the way it kind of works is if you happen to go into an area, say you're doing a mission or something like that, and you're going into an area and someone else is also there doing a mission as well, you kind of get credit for it if you go and help them and stuff.

496
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:37,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's almost like partying, but not.

497
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,893
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can actually party in the game, I just don't.

498
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:46,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and then these Arkfall things that happen, which are a little repetitive, but they're pretty hard.

499
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:54,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have, like, you know, 30 or 40 people just trying to take down, like, a massive alien or something.

500
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:55,982
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, that's kind of fun.

501
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,583
[SPEAKER_14]: You get a lot of experience doing that.

502
00:28:58,063 --> 00:29:02,806
[SPEAKER_14]: But, basically, I mean, the whole, like, look of the game is very bland, I guess.

503
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:08,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I don't recognize... It's not like... This is supposed to be San Francisco, and driving around, I couldn't tell you, like...

504
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

505
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I have not paid any money for, because you can pay money to get a lot of things in the game, not necessarily anything that's going to help.

506
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:44,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you could buy, I guess, tokens that give you more experience, like up your experience by 10% or something like that, or money drops or weapon drops and that kind of thing.

507
00:29:45,062 --> 00:30:10,202
[SPEAKER_14]: or they will have like you know customizable things to make your character look because right now my character looks like a 50 year old trying to look like a like teenager and it looks stupid but I don't care because I don't really look at my avatar that much he's facing the other way but I swear to god there's like no customization as far as how they look they all look like some weird fucked up person but that's fine because you can get a suit that covers their face up and you'll never see them again

508
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just crazy.

509
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:32,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but yeah, it's fun, I just wish more people played.

510
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:43,393
[SPEAKER_14]: The only person I know that plays the game other than me on 360 is, I have a friend I met a long time ago, Matt, who works at, um, Zappos, actually, so... Oh, Rad, the shoe place?

511
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:47,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he was one of the line directors there, so, um...

512
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:48,677
[SPEAKER_14]: and many more.

513
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:12,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

514
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:54,896
[SPEAKER_14]: and I think the whole game is going to change for season 2 so whatever happens on the show is going to reflect in the game and vice versa I don't really know if there's any competing factions or anything right now but if they have something like that it may reflect in the show so it's interesting so far I think so I've been playing a little bit more of that

515
00:31:55,376 --> 00:32:16,006
[SPEAKER_14]: and then the other thing I played that I really probably shouldn't be playing because it's technically piracy I mean we shouldn't really talk about it but it shame on you whatever I'm buying the game when it comes out anyways but I want to play it early so that's as long as you're gonna buy it I'm gonna buy it so the gameplay was Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon it's fucking awesome it's just

516
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:20,728
[SPEAKER_14]: XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam

517
00:32:37,633 --> 00:33:05,588
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's just it's so awesome it's just like this is basically a developer making a game they're like okay you guys make a game that's fun that you guys want to play and it's just so fucking why aren't all video games it's just so cheesy though shouldn't that be the mindset that goes into any game yeah I agree make it fun but it's just so cheesy it's basically this cliche you know B science fiction type plot that takes place in you know

518
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:08,972
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

519
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:30,195
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, partner, he, you know, kind of trolls you by enabling this tutorial mode in your, your suit.

520
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:42,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And so through the entire tutorial, which is giving you stupid commands, it's just like breaking it down, like, you know, jumping allows you to, you know, change your orientation along the Z axis, weird stuff like that.

521
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's just like, I hate these tutorials.

522
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:46,947
[SPEAKER_14]: This is stupid.

523
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:48,368
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to kill somebody.

524
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:49,329
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of funny.

525
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:56,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there was also a part where that guy is hacking this missile guidance system thing.

526
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,796
[SPEAKER_14]: All the jargon that he's throwing out.

527
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hacking the motherboard.

528
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing this to this.

529
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,903
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just all completely obviously made up jargon.

530
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,384
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just hilarious though.

531
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:12,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they reference stuff that no one has any idea what they're talking about.

532
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,408
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like that time in South America, yeah!

533
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they go in there.

534
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:25,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also I like how his partner uses the phrase motherfucker a lot.

535
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:30,412
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the cliche black action hero guy.

536
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:32,512
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna get those motherfuckers!

537
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:35,093
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just awesome.

538
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:37,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Samuel L. Jackson voice him?

539
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:37,534
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he didn't.

540
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm imagining those words coming out like if it was a comic panel in the same font as I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka.

541
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

542
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:09,879
[SPEAKER_14]: They have Blood Dragons, which are cybernetic dinosaur things that shoot lasers out of their eyes.

543
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:11,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's Cyber Panthers.

544
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:12,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Cyber Panthers.

545
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:14,383
[SPEAKER_21]: I love a Cyber Panther.

546
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awesome, but yes.

547
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:21,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't normally condone piracy, but this is a game that I was going to pick up anyway.

548
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,489
[SPEAKER_14]: You just couldn't wait.

549
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:26,832
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't wait.

550
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:32,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I was already planning on picking it up on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam because I'm multi-platform for some reason.

551
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You just gotta have achievements.

552
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:33,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

553
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

554
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:38,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

555
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:38,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

556
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,781
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week, pretty quick.

557
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:42,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

558
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the same stuff.

559
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:46,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I've still been playing that freaking addicting Jetpack Joyride.

560
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:49,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, if you're still listening, you suck for getting me addicted to that.

561
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, World of Warcraft, been working on PvP.

562
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:56,009
[SPEAKER_07]: My character's level 65 now.

563
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I did try some new iOS games this week I wanted to plug real quick.

564
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:00,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about a couple of them.

565
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:02,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Puzzle & Dragons Puzzle & Dragons

566
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:35,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was about to say, isn't that like a rehash of the old... Yeah, it's partially a puzzle game mixed with Pokemon.

567
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:40,947
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting little puzzler and it has like Pokemon elements in it where you can kind of combine.

568
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is funny because the combining elements was very similar to what I saw in that card game Guardian Cross from Square Enix that I got into a couple weeks ago.

569
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:54,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall, Puzzle & Dragons, I didn't really care for it.

570
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:58,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta say, the puzzle mechanic part of it, I didn't think was very good.

571
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:06,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's, you know, you touch to move things and line them up in threes, and that doesn't attack, but you can literally move them anywhere.

572
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:14,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's about setting up combos and things like that to ultimately be able to take out enemies, but the challenge really wasn't there, and it felt like a bit of a grind.

573
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to see it because I remember something about it being related to the puzzle industry.

574
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,325
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I heard about it because somebody was comparing the two.

575
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:36,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be, but I didn't play the other one, so I couldn't tell you.

576
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:37,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle and Destiny was hard.

577
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:42,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall, Puzzle and Dragons entertained me for a couple evenings, but I'm kind of already over it.

578
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:48,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The puzzle mechanic isn't enough to keep me interested in it, and I am sorry to say.

579
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:56,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I also checked out Nimble Quest, which if you guys know Nimble Bit, they made Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes, which, you know, hello, crack.

580
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,662
[SPEAKER_07]: But this new game is actually nothing like those games.

581
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:07,186
[SPEAKER_07]: It still has the whole 8-bit feel, but they basically created a new version of Snake, and they even say in the tutorial...

582
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:08,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember this game?

583
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And they showed the little cell phone picture of Snake.

584
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's basically what they've created.

585
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:19,369
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you do is that instead of picking up squares that make your Snake longer, you pick up more heroes.

586
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:25,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And some will throw fireballs, some use swords, some have bombs, you know, and that's kind of the gist to it.

587
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other guys running around might try to attack you.

588
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:32,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all about maneuvering and not

589
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:33,013
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

590
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,597
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, I liked Nimble Quest quite a bit.

591
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:06,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I didn't like about it is that you go through the same levels over and over again.

592
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:08,002
[SPEAKER_07]: You start at level one.

593
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:11,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you're going through the same levels over and over again, which is fine.

594
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:12,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how a video game works.

595
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:22,632
[SPEAKER_07]: But in a game like this, you would sort of think at some point I can either branch and go to different stages or I can resume where I died or something a little different.

596
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:26,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a little disappointed that that basic mechanic wasn't somehow improved on.

597
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:52,869
[SPEAKER_07]: um the last game that i checked out this week which actually is probably my favorite of the three is not free to play it's a 99 cent game it's called slaying and this game's really cute it's very 8-bit style and it's retrotasticness but um basically it's just got left arrow right arrow and button and you move left move right and jump and your character's a little 8-bit knight that constantly has a sword out in front of it and you can either move left or right and you're

598
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:53,489
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

599
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:17,749
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-bit retro To the moon

600
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:44,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say maybe even Slayer looks a little more 16-bit than 8-bit.

601
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It's somewhere in between.

602
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,287
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a 12-bit.

603
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:50,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a TurboGrafx game or something.

604
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:51,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a little bit in between.

605
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,148
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two 8-bit processors together.

606
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:55,968
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

607
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:56,968
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really my gaming week.

608
00:40:56,988 --> 00:41:00,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a bunch of iOS games, but that's one of the places people play games on now.

609
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,550
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, that's where I'm doing a lot of my handheld gaming.

610
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched my DS in

611
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Except when I cleaned it.

612
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the last handheld system I played was a Windows 1.

613
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I still have been playing Harmonite, but I talked about that last week already.

614
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:18,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Swapnote, but I'll talk about that later in the show.

615
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's still other three.

616
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:24,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I even booted up Kid Icarus 3D Classics the other day just because I love Kid Icarus.

617
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:33,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 3D remakes, surprisingly good because they didn't change much besides the backgrounds and giving it some 3D effects.

618
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:34,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really good.

619
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:36,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

620
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into tonight's news.

621
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:41,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we're going to do news tonight just like we always do.

622
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's have Loki start us off.

623
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so EA has let some people go.

624
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:59,270
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course they're not going to say who or why or where, but they basically have layoffs and they're not saying which teams are coming from.

625
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,111
[SPEAKER_14]: And that kind of sucks.

626
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,992
[SPEAKER_07]: But isn't some of that leaking out to the internet anyway?

627
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Who it is?

628
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:06,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I believe it was EA Montreal, if I remember correctly.

629
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:11,097
[SPEAKER_14]: It was supposed to be, I think, some of the people that are affected by it.

630
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:16,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, EA Mobile Montreal.

631
00:42:16,899 --> 00:42:19,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

632
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:24,483
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were saying that, I guess, 60 to 70 permanent employees were let go.

633
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:29,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess another 100 people working under contract were let go as well.

634
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:31,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And mostly QA testers.

635
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

636
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:37,252
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just kind of the normal cycle.

637
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:41,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, after all, EA did have a bunch of games just come out recently.

638
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:46,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, three or four games.

639
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:47,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, four games.

640
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:55,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say that they just had Tiger Woods, Armia 2, Dead Space 3, and Crysis 3.

641
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,357
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it might just be that they're...

642
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuse, and then NCAA.

643
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Is another game coming out?

644
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.

645
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's mobile Montreal.

646
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:28,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know what exactly EA Mobile Montreal was doing.

647
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:31,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Facebook games?

648
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:43,045
[SPEAKER_07]: BioWare is working on at least the Don't Call It Mass Effect 4 game, the Dragon Age 3, and the unknown game that the old Mass Effect team is doing.

649
00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:44,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they are not doing Mass Effect 4.

650
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:45,786
[SPEAKER_07]: The multiplayer team is doing it.

651
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:46,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

652
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:48,462
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

653
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably at E3, get some more information about that.

654
00:43:50,885 --> 00:44:01,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because EA Montreal, well, Montreal is Army of Two, but that would be just EA Montreal and not necessarily Mobile Montreal.

655
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,221
[SPEAKER_14]: What else have they worked on?

656
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:11,068
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as our friends here locally at Bioware Sacramento are okay, but I think they're doing a lot of the... What were they before?

657
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They were... ClickNation.

658
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:13,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, ClickNation.

659
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,532
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a lot of Facebook.

660
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,694
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a really popular Facebook game.

661
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:18,957
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they got grabbed up.

662
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:23,381
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure any Dragon Age, Mass Effect, kind of like Facebook tie-ins or something they were probably working on.

663
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

664
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:24,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I've applied for them three times.

665
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:25,504
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't hired me.

666
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:26,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, poor thing.

667
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:28,006
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

668
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:28,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

669
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:29,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Loki.

670
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:30,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

671
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:30,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

672
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:44,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And unsurprisingly, the second year in a row, they have been voted the worst company in America by consumerists, which is a poll that they have on a website that people vote that are consumers that visit the website.

673
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:53,023
[SPEAKER_14]: It is completely... Well, all the nominations are done by people that read the website, and then they take the top 16 or so nominations.

674
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:54,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's more than 16.

675
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:54,384
32.

676
00:44:55,064 --> 00:44:57,386
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they narrow it down from there.

677
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: and this really seems to carry a lot more weight than it ought to like a lot of people are I see a lot of people that are pissed like why did EA win this when Bank of America is a far more evil company when Comcast is more evil it's an anti-popularity contest Bank of America was one of the I think even they went up against Bank of America and it's just people voted maybe Bank of America is just not that much in the forefront for some of these people

678
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,628
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a fucking internet poll.

679
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:30,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we give this much weight to something that's on Yahoo.com?

680
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:32,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I sure hope not.

681
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:34,018
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thing.

682
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:36,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, whose line is it anyway?

683
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: The score doesn't matter.

684
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:45,461
[SPEAKER_14]: My vote for internet's worst poll goes to Consumerist, Worst Company in America.

685
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:46,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you should be.

686
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:47,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're analysts.

687
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:48,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We can say this.

688
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:49,904
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be, too.

689
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:52,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I could run a poll right now on the site.

690
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:56,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Who runs the worst poll about the worst poll in America, Consumerist or somebody else?

691
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to save that for special.

692
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,154
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 calls it an ass-hattery contest.

693
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:06,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, it's just a contest.

694
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:20,265
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just ha-ha lulz that they won again because ha-ha, you screwed up all the SimCity stuff and we hate you because of your DRM and your policies regarding cashing in and microtransactions and all that stuff.

695
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:23,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha-ha, see, we showed you.

696
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,249
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of what it is.

697
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:30,212
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't log on to Mass Effect for a month, so I voted them the worst.

698
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:39,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow NextGen says in our chatroom, Anyone who voted EA as the worst company should have their gaming rights rescinded and be banned from the industry.

699
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:44,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, people are welcome to their opinion as far as I'm concerned, but I'm just kind of like, you know...

700
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:48,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Managements

701
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:18,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So what management got laid off as a part of this?

702
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:20,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we really should be.

703
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:22,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they did lose the CEO.

704
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

705
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:23,199
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

706
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:24,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You got me.

707
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,622
[SPEAKER_07]: They did lose the CEO, and that, sadly, or fortunately, depending on which side you're on, is the person that needed to take the fall.

708
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:35,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if things get better, but if, you know.

709
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:40,627
[SPEAKER_14]: If last year was any sort of, you know, barometer of whether things are getting better.

710
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:41,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

711
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:48,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides, how many years is it going to take before SimCity stops working when they shut up those servers?

712
00:47:50,188 --> 00:47:57,010
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, I do give EA credit for their pro-LGBT stance and I do love Need for Speed.

713
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,270
[SPEAKER_14]: They blame that as one of the reasons they got voted.

714
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:00,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You know... What?

715
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:12,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tricky... I appreciate the fact that Peter Moore did come out and say, if that's the reason you're going to name us the worst company in America, then by golly, we're the worst company in America.

716
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that he said that.

717
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:15,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I'm kind of like...

718
00:48:16,615 --> 00:48:43,353
[SPEAKER_07]: but like why can't you focus on the real reasons you're getting voted for this like a lot of that is feeling like smoke and mirrors and whether you deserve it or not it's falling on deaf ears it seems to me and that doesn't make it very promising that you're gonna change anything I honestly would have put more of the crappy video if I was going just on video game companies I would have put more crap on Activision I think or maybe Capcom

719
00:48:44,453 --> 00:48:46,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

720
00:48:46,234 --> 00:48:52,197
[SPEAKER_14]: EA is the company that designed the whole online pass phenomenon that we see nowadays.

721
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:54,238
[SPEAKER_14]: EA was also one of the first companies to...

722
00:48:55,014 --> 00:49:00,257
[SPEAKER_14]: You know those games that you had cheats in before in, you know, PlayStation 2 where you just enter a little button press and you get those cheats?

723
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:01,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, you can buy those now.

724
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:12,305
[SPEAKER_14]: And even, in fact, I remember it was the first Godfather game they had on PlayStation 2 and Xbox where they didn't have such a way to purchase those bits of DLC.

725
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,286
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually had button presses to do those cheats.

726
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:17,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, but on the 360, that's going to cost some money.

727
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:20,190
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yes, they can go fuck themselves.

728
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Origin's just the thing that pisses me off.

729
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:24,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Origin's the worst part of it.

730
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:28,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, but Rob, there's 45 million people on Origin.

731
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,649
[SPEAKER_07]: How many satisfied customers?

732
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:35,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many people are on Origin because the game they wanted to play was only through Origin?

733
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,340
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could disable that shit, I would.

734
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:48,825
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, and I have to say this, I have to acknowledge it, nobody liked Steam when it first came out, and it's great now, but to me there's a difference.

735
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of like Valve fixing it, yeah, I kind of see that out of them, but EA fixing it, I'm like, I don't know if they're ever going to.

736
00:49:57,037 --> 00:50:05,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Steam, though, had it right from the get-go that, you know, let's put out games and put them out at affordable prices, get people interested in franchises, do big sales.

737
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:07,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And EA's like, oh, that's not any way to make money.

738
00:50:07,635 --> 00:50:09,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And look where they are.

739
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

740
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:16,352
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's move on to one of those companies that DarkSakura said, you know, they're not doing much better, and that's Capcom.

741
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:34,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And Capcom had something interesting to say this week, where Capcom Senior Vice President Christian Svensson said on the AskCapcom forums, quote, Sadly, I think we've probably run the course of feasible titles here, given the drop-off we've seen in sales with each new introduction.

742
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:38,266
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in regards to HD ports and remakes of fighting games.

743
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,328
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they've run out of games, to be honest.

744
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:43,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no.

745
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,551
[SPEAKER_07]: They could really dig back in the archive.

746
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like the Mega Man fighting games?

747
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:55,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom vs. SNK, although I guess that's coming out on the PlayStation 2 or whatever.

748
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:57,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be an old hit or whatever.

749
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:58,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Just how bad is it?

750
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,983
[SPEAKER_07]: They've come out and said that the Darkstalkers Resurrection sales are not good.

751
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkstalkers Resurrection didn't even place on the list of best-selling PlayStation Network games.

752
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:17,372
[SPEAKER_07]: In further comments, Christian Svensson saying it's partially due to lack of a promotion.

753
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:24,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, we've not given up, but I'm disappointed in the opening sales response relative to any other fighting title we've put out on the same platforms.

754
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:35,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the frequency and urgency of requests we've had here over the last several years and the quality of the execution, it's the most fully featured and probably best project of this type we've done.

755
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:40,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a question that comes to my mind when I'm reading about these stories.

756
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:45,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is, is possibly Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network just too oversaturated?

757
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's causing the drop-off.

758
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:51,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that there's just too much stuff on there now and it's hard to stand out?

759
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:52,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you what.

760
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:56,438
[SPEAKER_07]: When Xbox Live Arcade first came out, shit, I was buying everything.

761
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:59,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought almost, like every other week there was a new release, I would buy it.

762
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:02,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just because like, hey, new game for five bucks, right?

763
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought like everything.

764
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:08,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I honestly couldn't tell you the last game I bought on Xbox Live Arcade.

765
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:09,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

766
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:10,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a while ago.

767
00:52:11,923 --> 00:52:13,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even PlayStation Network.

768
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the last game I got.

769
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:19,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Last game I got was Retro City Rampage.

770
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:20,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

771
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:39,163
[SPEAKER_07]: so is it possible that maybe part of the sales drop off is it's hard for this game to stick out because maybe you know it's not there's too much to pick from now maybe just DarkSakura is just not as popular as Street Fighter but isn't that the game that everybody was asking for

772
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:40,583
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

773
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:24,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in chat says the last Xbox Live Arcade game I bought was Darkstalkers Resurrection YYR in chat says I'll say this much the moment Sony announced that Playstation 4 would not be backwards compatible I lost almost all desire to buy anything for Playstation 3 on the Playstation store that's a really good point that's a very good point I have to admit that crosses my mind too

774
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

775
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

776
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

777
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:26,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

778
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:29,092
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's other HD remakes on the horizon.

779
00:54:29,112 --> 00:54:34,435
[SPEAKER_07]: They might not be fighting games, but we do have the Dungeons & Dragons arcade game and DuckTales Remastered coming out.

780
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:42,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Judging on the reaction that everybody gave, at least the DuckTales game at Penny Arcade Expo, I'm thinking they don't have anything to worry about there.

781
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,402
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an HD reboot that's not in trouble.

782
00:54:45,442 --> 00:54:46,783
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Dungeons & Dragons games...

783
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Now look, I'm a fan.

784
00:54:49,265 --> 00:54:50,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be getting them.

785
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:52,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But I worry they're a little niche.

786
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:53,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

787
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:54,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping I'm wrong.

788
00:54:54,509 --> 00:54:55,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I am wrong.

789
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:00,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be more than happy to say I was so wrong on that and that game sold shit tons.

790
00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a feeling it's very niche and it might not sell well.

791
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:05,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep my fingers crossed on it.

792
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:08,121
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, they're not really giving it the best promotion either.

793
00:55:08,662 --> 00:55:08,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they?

794
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they unveiled it at the same expo they unveiled the DuckTales thing.

795
00:55:13,403 --> 00:55:21,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, DuckTales, but I mean, since then, I think they'd have to promote the hell out of it for them to really get the type of sales they're looking for out of it.

796
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:25,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I probably won't buy it because I've already got it.

797
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people in our chat room saying some positive things about it.

798
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster says, yay, the D&D beat-em-ups.

799
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Marinko, I hope I said that right, said, I would love to see more Dungeons & Dragons.

800
00:55:36,322 --> 00:55:37,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, y'all better go buy it.

801
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:42,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiggers wants Mr. Do.

802
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:44,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they did a new Mr. Do not that long ago.

803
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:46,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they did.

804
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:46,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.

805
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was out on a compilation.

806
00:55:49,107 --> 00:55:52,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Or some type of new Mr. Do, but it was really nothing like the old ones.

807
00:55:53,154 --> 00:55:54,316
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequel, Mr. Pooh.

808
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:56,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Does.

809
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:57,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Did.

810
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,742
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they had a Mr. Do game.

811
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:03,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember what it was called, but yeah, they actually had an arcade game where it was really weird.

812
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:05,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I don't remember where.

813
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was just different.

814
00:56:06,611 --> 00:56:07,833
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like a platformer or something.

815
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:09,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember thinking bubble, I don't know.

816
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:16,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly though, back to comparing the D&D to DuckTales, people underestimate the love for the old DuckTales game.

817
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:19,440
[SPEAKER_03]: The DuckTales game was freaking sweet.

818
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:26,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was one of the first things that Dan and I ever talked about when we first met online ages and ages and ages ago.

819
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:32,267
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, we were talking about video game music and he says, oh yeah, my favorite is that DuckTales moon level.

820
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh yeah, me too!

821
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:37,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started reading, sharing bad fanfictions.

822
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was love.

823
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:40,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It was love.

824
00:56:42,337 --> 00:56:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what we met over, right?

825
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:47,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma 1.5.

826
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:50,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought it was your sound rips you did.

827
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:54,549
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I started doing the sound rips after I moved out here.

828
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, fuck.

829
00:56:56,775 --> 00:56:57,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

830
00:56:57,276 --> 00:56:59,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on, DarkSakura, if you have some news for us.

831
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:00,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Code Man's in chat.

832
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you for our poster.

833
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:02,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome, and I need to talk to you later.

834
00:57:02,963 --> 00:57:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to do with album art.

835
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:09,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret messages to listeners.

836
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:11,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not so secret message.

837
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:11,976
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

838
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:20,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Well there was a survey that went out that showed the income disparity between game developers based on gender.

839
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:35,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually a 2012 salary survey that was put out in the March issue of Game Developer Magazine where they were saying that even though the number of women in the industry is growing, there is still a huge salary gap.

840
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:45,697
[SPEAKER_03]: is something like the average female game producer makes about maybe 79,000 and the average male makes about 86,000.

841
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:57,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about a huge disparity for the same work for people who are just as capable, if not overlooking people who are more capable simply because of gender.

842
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, does the story get into why?

843
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:09,490
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big... Is that just because unfortunately... I can't get into the area that has the full thing on it because I don't want to pay for a subscription for it.

844
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:17,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, is that just an unfortunate echo of what can happen in the greater world, unfortunately?

845
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:25,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're also talking a little bit more about where the bulk of women are working within the industry.

846
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:30,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says that that's in art and animation at about 16% and game designers around 11%.

847
00:58:35,454 --> 00:58:36,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had more information.

848
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:39,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to get into the thing, but I don't have a subscription, so sorry.

849
00:58:39,577 --> 00:58:39,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

850
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:48,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Marinko in our chatroom says, you would think we would be past all this gender inequality at this point in human society.

851
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,540
[SPEAKER_07]: You would, wouldn't you?

852
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:57,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's unfortunately that this industry has to really exacerbate that issue, it sounds like, from these statistics.

853
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:03,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really... It's just pretty sad, I think.

854
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:06,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of sad commentary that...

855
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I am glad to see more women getting into the industry because we definitely need it.

856
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially after what we talked last week about the preference towards male leads in video games versus female leads.

857
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:26,025
[SPEAKER_03]: When we've had awesome games with female leads like Mirror's Edge and the new Tomb Raider.

858
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that it's just something in the public perception that's going to have to change.

859
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

860
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:35,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have the power to change it.

861
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,107
[SPEAKER_03]: If people would listen to us.

862
00:59:38,127 --> 00:59:41,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean we, I mean we as a generation.

863
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know, I know.

864
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: How about this way?

865
00:59:44,273 --> 00:59:49,018
[SPEAKER_03]: If people would be a little bit less distracted by things and actually get off their ass and do something.

866
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:50,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

867
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:51,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki.

868
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:53,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking about the Wii changing.

869
00:59:55,628 --> 01:00:06,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, a lot of the features that are on the Wii, online features, maybe stuff that you don't use, I'm sure it's a lot of stuff that you don't use, are being deactivated starting June 28th.

870
01:00:08,315 --> 01:00:17,661
[SPEAKER_14]: This includes the Nintendo Channel, the News Channel, the Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, the Mii Contest Channel, and some of the data exchange with friends.

871
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:30,588
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, data exchange includes the ability to send messages to friends, and also all of the Mii data exchange in some games will end as well.

872
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:36,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if that also means the Mii Plaza swapping of characters and stuff like that.

873
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:37,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if that's going to go away.

874
01:00:37,693 --> 01:00:38,936
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

875
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:49,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Nintendo's ever had any real concept of embracing online technology.

876
01:00:50,700 --> 01:01:03,091
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of dumb that they had all these curated channels and they couldn't have just pulled weather information from Yahoo or news from anything.

877
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:03,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

878
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:06,473
[SPEAKER_14]: RSS feeds, I mean, that's all they really are.

879
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:09,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Why couldn't they have just updated, hey, we're not going to do these on our server anymore.

880
01:01:10,236 --> 01:01:13,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just update this to RSS feeds for different things.

881
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:41,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't touched my Wii it was fun to spin the globe in the news channel and in the weather channel but yeah I mean that kind of loses its luster after some time but you know they're still actively selling the Wii granted the most recent model they came out with in Canada had the internet parts just stripped out of it maybe that should have told us something

882
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's not like they aren't still... I mean, a Wii game is coming out this week, or just came out.

883
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole Pandora's Tower.

884
01:01:50,898 --> 01:01:51,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this week.

885
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's not like the Wii itself is dead.

886
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:55,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dead.

887
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:01,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're sure pulling the plug on Wii... Basically, Wii Connect 24 is getting its plug pulled.

888
01:02:02,202 --> 01:02:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that runs off the internet on the Wii is done.

889
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:10,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because after Pandora's Tower, the next game you have coming out is... Smurfs 2...

890
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:13,547
[SPEAKER_14]: and then after that, Planes.

891
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:15,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Disney Planes.

892
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:20,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And Disney Infinity.

893
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:27,645
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's all kids stuff, but you're not going to get Madden, you're not going to get NCAA, you're not going to get anything else...

894
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:44,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I think after this year, and maybe if there are some indie developers out there or smaller developers that really want to still focus on the Wii, I think you're going to be out of titles probably by second quarter next year.

895
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:49,093
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR in chat says, darn, I can't check the weather at the North Pole anymore.

896
01:02:49,493 --> 01:02:50,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, you know you've done this.

897
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilty as charged.

898
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:54,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say not guilty.

899
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:55,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally fun though.

900
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:56,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually never played with the Weather Channel.

901
01:02:56,757 --> 01:02:57,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You check it out.

902
01:02:57,438 --> 01:02:58,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know where my Wii is?

903
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:00,499
[SPEAKER_07]: In a dumpster?

904
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:01,120
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

905
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a box at Dan's mom's house.

906
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:05,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched that thing in months.

907
01:03:05,362 --> 01:03:06,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I waited in line for that thing.

908
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:10,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that was pretty fun giving donuts and bribing for our spot online.

909
01:03:10,784 --> 01:03:11,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

910
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:11,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of fun.

911
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:15,666
[SPEAKER_07]: RavensDolphin in chat says, I don't think people were using that stuff on Wii.

912
01:03:15,746 --> 01:03:18,628
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people sent messages on their Wii and watch it glow blue?

913
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:19,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in years.

914
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine is on the floor.

915
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:21,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, you know what?

916
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:22,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real.

917
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:24,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't used that stuff in a long time either.

918
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't sit here and go, oh, how dare they take away the stuff I used to love.

919
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.

920
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

921
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:38,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the thing that's annoying people the most is it's basically just saying that Nintendo's just giving up support on this console.

922
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,122
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just like, eh, we're done.

923
01:03:40,142 --> 01:03:40,902
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the Wii U now.

924
01:03:42,363 --> 01:03:52,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Which they kind of need to do to help motivate people to get the Wii U. Yeah, but what's going to happen when the new Wii U U comes out?

925
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:53,925
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii U U?

926
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:55,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the Wii W?

927
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:58,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii W. That's funny.

928
01:03:59,566 --> 01:04:01,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Her, her, I'm clever, her.

929
01:04:02,027 --> 01:04:10,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hopefully also funny and light-hearted like some of their previous games, and Fun will be the next game from Level 5.

930
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:24,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Level 5 is probably most well-known for Ni No Kuni as of late, but they also did Dragon Quest VIII, which was so good, and White Knight Chronicles 1 and 2, which were kind of a little more controversial.

931
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,952
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I heard the servers for those games are getting shut down, which is

932
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:28,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Nino Kuni 2 Dragon Quest 8 2

933
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,852
[SPEAKER_07]: or, okay, to be fair, maybe we don't necessarily need a sequel.

934
01:04:58,912 --> 01:04:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: They can do something new.

935
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:02,794
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be nice, right?

936
01:05:04,395 --> 01:05:08,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we will see what is next from level five.

937
01:05:08,657 --> 01:05:10,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Raven's Dolphin was hilarious.

938
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:10,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what did he say?

939
01:05:10,918 --> 01:05:15,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a bunch of jokes going on in chat about Wii U 2 featuring Bono and I said, you know, featuring The Edge.

940
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And Raven's Dolphin says, is the Wii U 2 slogan with or without you?

941
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,841
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

942
01:05:35,868 --> 01:06:02,451
[SPEAKER_03]: they cracked Ubisoft's Uplay security so they can download games for free and Ubisoft actually sent out a statement that they said that they are aware of the issue and are trying to resolve it the rest of the quote goes no personal information was compromised Uplay's PC download service will be unavailable until the problem is fixed however all other Uplay services remain available so basically it was actually a group of Russian hackers that broke into it and downloaded games for free so

943
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:05,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

944
01:06:05,453 --> 01:06:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Hacker's gonna hack.

945
01:06:06,553 --> 01:06:10,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that's quite something to get in there and download games for free.

946
01:06:10,354 --> 01:06:10,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

947
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:11,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

948
01:06:12,155 --> 01:06:16,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Including, that's how Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon leaked.

949
01:06:16,256 --> 01:06:17,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us some more details.

950
01:06:17,676 --> 01:06:19,017
[SPEAKER_07]: How did this exactly happen?

951
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:22,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically a trick with a client that they, I think it's, they said it's easy.

952
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:27,379
[SPEAKER_14]: It's even maybe like a console command or something like that, like that you would enter in, but

953
01:06:27,899 --> 01:06:34,065
[SPEAKER_14]: basically tricked Uplay into thinking that you own the game and allowed you to re-download it.

954
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:42,312
[SPEAKER_14]: So they did that with Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon and some other stuff to prove that it worked.

955
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:44,354
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now they're going to try to patch that out.

956
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,345
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah.

957
01:06:47,746 --> 01:06:50,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that sucks that your DRM is able to be defeated that quickly.

958
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially to have a game like that leak out early.

959
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But, it is awesome, so I do recommend everyone go buy it.

960
01:06:57,855 --> 01:07:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but still, I mean, you know... Well, they've taken down... Well, it's not going to stop people from, you know, the re-up.

961
01:07:04,502 --> 01:07:08,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, probably how you got yours, but... Once it's on the internet, it's...

962
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: On the internet for a second, on there for an eternity But yeah, they did their best to get that shut down as soon as possible But still, it was Gameranx G-A-M-E-R-A-N-X put an image of the game being downloaded That was for Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon And basically said, here is us sending it to the torrent sites

963
01:07:37,326 --> 01:07:39,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, bite our ass.

964
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Hackers gonna hack.

965
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so don't put your full games online.

966
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:46,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

967
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:49,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Or like a month before they're supposed to come out.

968
01:07:49,807 --> 01:07:52,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, do they happen to do a brag about being unhackable?

969
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because usually that follows immediately being hacked.

970
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:58,650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but Ubisoft had that whole DRM thing which nobody liked.

971
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that that makes it okay, I'm just saying.

972
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably the justification.

973
01:08:03,472 --> 01:08:09,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Ubisoft little service myself and I said, you know what, I don't really need to play Assassin's Creed that much.

974
01:08:11,556 --> 01:08:13,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I registered some of my games with it.

975
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:14,358
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, whatever.

976
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let us travel around the world and check out some release dates.

977
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, we'll start with you in the US.

978
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:30,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Pandora's Tower this week on the Wii, on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii U, and Justice Gods Among Us.

979
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:44,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Shimogami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers on the 3DS And last but not least, one week from today, LEGO City Undercover The Chase Begins on the 3DS Oh, that didn't come out in tandem with the DS?

980
01:08:44,942 --> 01:08:47,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope Or the Wii U version?

981
01:08:47,463 --> 01:08:49,984
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it did not Weird Was it delayed?

982
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:55,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know I don't think it was ever supposed to come out at the same time Okay

983
01:08:56,724 --> 01:08:58,986
[SPEAKER_07]: NARUTO ULTIMATE NINJA STORM 3 NAMCO BANDAI

984
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:18,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the Xbox 360.

985
01:09:19,145 --> 01:09:21,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do release Xbox 360 games in Japan.

986
01:09:21,808 --> 01:09:24,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is also out this week.

987
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:28,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I should mention that Monster Hunter Frontier G1 Premium Package.

988
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:32,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's just kind of like, again, like a Best Hits repackaging type of thing.

989
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week in Japan, though, on the 360, Bioshock Infinite.

990
01:09:37,645 --> 01:09:39,426
[SPEAKER_07]: How about on the PlayStation Vita this week?

991
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,948
[SPEAKER_07]: On the PlayStation Vita in Japan, Slaughter Mania 5.

992
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:43,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best name ever.

993
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:47,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Zetai Shokugeki 2 comes out this week.

994
01:09:47,693 --> 01:09:48,673
[SPEAKER_21]: That's like Becky's brownies.

995
01:09:52,256 --> 01:09:52,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

996
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,559
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Wii U this week in Japan...

997
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomodachi Tomodachi means friend

998

[SPEAKER_14]: Amnesia Crowd, 7th Dragon 2020-2 Flashmob, but you don't know why you're there

1000
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:27,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I had to look behind me to see if I could find the joke.

1001
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold your hand up over your head.

1002
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:32,982
[SPEAKER_21]: You might catch it when it sails past.

1003
01:11:34,383 --> 01:11:34,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1004
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:38,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys don't deserve any more Japanese release dates.

1005
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:39,145
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1006
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1007
01:11:41,857 --> 01:12:04,371
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some stuff coming out in Europe on the 18th of April we have Papo and Yo on PC which looks kind of interesting and then stuff on April 19th Fire Emblem Awakening and Injustice Gods Among Us and that's it no more you guys don't get any more games aww it's kind of a slow time of year yeah

1008
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:09,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go for a few more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1009
01:12:09,528 --> 01:12:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet y'all can't wait to see what she picked for this episode.

1010
01:12:11,249 --> 01:12:12,530
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are going to be so surprised.

1011
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:14,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I legitimately was.

1012
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:16,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what did you pick tonight for news?

1013
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:18,092
[SPEAKER_07]: For news?

1014
01:12:18,432 --> 01:12:19,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1015
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:30,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I picked the UK government investigating in-app purchases because they believe that it's putting too much pressure on children to accidentally or maybe...

1016
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:35,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Misslead them into purchasing Smurf objects.

1017
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Or stuff that they don't need.

1018
01:12:38,282 --> 01:12:39,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically saying,

1019
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:59,718
[SPEAKER_14]: The OFT is not seeking to ban in-game purchases, but the games industry must ensure that it's complying with relevant regulations so that children are protected.

1020
01:12:59,798 --> 01:13:00,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Think of the children.

1021
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:01,999
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming for you, Smurf Village.

1022
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,821
[SPEAKER_21]: La la la la la la.

1023
01:13:03,861 --> 01:13:04,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Spend my mom's credit card.

1024
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:08,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going to get Smurf Village 2 with the Smurfs 2 movie coming out?

1025
01:13:09,104 --> 01:13:10,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Smurfs Village 2, Electric Boogaloo?

1026
01:13:11,045 --> 01:13:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope not.

1027
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:15,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if it was really combining those two movies, I might have to watch it.

1028
01:13:17,549 --> 01:13:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: The Smurfs movie is so bad.

1029
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:23,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Katy Perry is one of the voices.

1030
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:29,674
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of wanted to watch it just because Neil Patrick Harris is in it, but I unfortunately did not want to see that movie.

1031
01:13:31,014 --> 01:13:32,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Katy Perry was Smurfette, right?

1032
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:43,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if Neil Patrick Harris, the character from all of the wonderful Harold and Kumar movies, was in that movie, that might be something.

1033
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my husband, I have to go on a little tangent here.

1034
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I had a very interesting discussion about the Smurfs.

1035
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, my husband and I discussed the Smurfs while walking through Fry's Electronics.

1036
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:58,848
[SPEAKER_03]: He picked up a plushie Smurf and said, that's a big Smurf.

1037
01:13:58,888 --> 01:14:01,249
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, actually, this would be about how big a Smurf really is.

1038
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:06,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he started stacking what the size of apples would have been because they're three apples high.

1039
01:14:07,112 --> 01:14:12,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, how did nobody ever find the damn Smurf village if they came up to your shins?

1040
01:14:13,636 --> 01:14:13,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1041
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,080
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

1042
01:14:17,562 --> 01:14:18,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

1043
01:14:19,003 --> 01:14:23,648
[SPEAKER_03]: That means there would be no plot ever because everyone would be, oh, what are these little blue fuckers running around for?

1044
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:27,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe they just lived in like remote Canada where nobody thought to look.

1045
01:14:29,253 --> 01:14:30,214
[SPEAKER_07]: People live in Canada.

1046
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but not that far north.

1047
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:33,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do.

1048
01:14:33,818 --> 01:14:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: They lived in Nunavut.

1049
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:40,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1050
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:42,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody lives there.

1051
01:14:42,464 --> 01:14:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Brakeman voted for Gargamel.

1052
01:14:43,706 --> 01:14:45,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I voted for Azrael because Gargamel was pretty stupid.

1053
01:14:48,126 --> 01:14:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, pancake.

1054
01:14:55,272 --> 01:14:56,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, would you vote for this?

1055
01:14:56,593 --> 01:15:01,737
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know a lot of people are very, they're purist when it comes to their Japanese voiceovers.

1056
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,558
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's an interesting one.

1057
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:06,201
[SPEAKER_07]: How much would you pay for Japanese voiceovers?

1058
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:13,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Enix is going to be selling a Japanese voiceover pack for the Steam version of Tomb Raider.

1059
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:17,209
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already available in Japan through the Western store.

1060
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, though.

1061
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,732
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get the Japanese localization pack, it will cost $30.

1062
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:26,193
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $30 DLC.

1063
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on top of what the game costs already.

1064
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:35,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it should be noted, Japanese games do tend to be a little bit higher in price anyway.

1065
01:15:37,237 --> 01:15:41,058
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese version of the game actually comes out on April 25th.

1066
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the same day as the voiceover pack.

1067
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:45,940
[SPEAKER_07]: and it will retail for $80.

1068
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: This is typical for Japan.

1069
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:58,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a way, it's kind of like, well, the $50 you paid for it on Steam plus the $30 for the voiceover pack equals the $80 it would have cost you anyway, but there went your deal.

1070
01:15:59,072 --> 01:16:06,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I could remotely think of it being that high would be simply the cost of paying voice actors, especially with...

1071
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's really the only thing I can think of.

1072
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:10,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it ain't cheap.

1073
01:16:11,578 --> 01:16:19,821
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd have to basically decide what they've had to pay the voice actors for and then see what their overhead is for the recording and then adjust the price.

1074
01:16:20,802 --> 01:16:22,482
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still, I think, pulling a big profit off of it.

1075
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know people will buy it.

1076
01:16:24,683 --> 01:16:26,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a lot of people in chat going, what?

1077
01:16:26,684 --> 01:16:27,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1078
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:34,587
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you have Zombie Princess that gives us a little perspective here at live.vognetwork.com says, I would pay that much for Japanese voices in Mass Effect.

1079
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not because it was not ever dubbed in Japanese.

1080
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:40,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But neither was Tomb Raider.

1081
01:16:41,121 --> 01:16:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1082
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Well.

1083
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:43,802
[SPEAKER_03]: However.

1084
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:45,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it is now.

1085
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:45,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1086
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I do have to say that Mass Effect in French sounds pretty fucking cool.

1087
01:16:50,163 --> 01:16:52,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to know what her voice sounds like.

1088
01:16:52,743 --> 01:16:58,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they go the route where she's super chibi or did they pick like a deep male Japanese voice for her?

1089
01:16:58,704 --> 01:16:59,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Japanese voice acting.

1090
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:01,785
[SPEAKER_03]: She probably sounds super kawaii.

1091
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:09,347
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR in chat says, when was the last time a Japanese game was released here with subtitles and the English dub cost an extra $20?

1092
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:17,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to be fair, you know, to import a game from Japan, remember when we used to import DDR and Beatmania and all that stuff?

1093
01:17:17,794 --> 01:17:20,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, shoot, what was it?

1094
01:17:21,598 --> 01:17:24,261
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, there was another, oh yeah, Sonic Adventure.

1095
01:17:25,002 --> 01:17:26,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember when it came out on Dreamcast?

1096
01:17:27,124 --> 01:17:31,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the Japanese, um, you could choose the Japanese voice track with the English subtitles.

1097
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:36,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, because I played through it the first time in Japanese on my, um, import.

1098
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:40,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played through it again in Japanese because I was used to the voices.

1099
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:43,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I think of a lot of fighting games nowadays.

1100
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say Soul Calibur and Street Fighter.

1101
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:46,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The Street Fighter series, you can choose language.

1102
01:17:46,682 --> 01:17:51,285
[SPEAKER_07]: You can choose between the two, but the amount of dialogue in Street Fighter versus Tomb Raider.

1103
01:17:52,125 --> 01:18:01,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also changed the in-game voice acting to the Japanese voice actors, which honestly, if I'm going to listen to Ryu, I don't want him to sound like he's a white boy.

1104
01:18:02,672 --> 01:18:02,892
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

1105
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:15,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Breakman, going back in time a little bit in our chat room, or excuse me, not going back in time, but Breakman going back to an earlier comment saying, I would pay that much for a Mass Effect nude code, but I'm a perv.

1106
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1107
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that for free.

1108
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:17,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called TextMod.

1109
01:18:18,075 --> 01:18:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me introduce you to the internet.

1110
01:18:19,856 --> 01:18:21,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It is your friend, and there's lots of nudity on it.

1111
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I have, when I was putting in all those outfits to, you know, for my shepherd and everything, one of them is completely naked, except there is absolutely no features on it.

1112
01:18:31,317 --> 01:18:34,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that there's already a mod out there for Tomb Raider for this.

1113
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's the internet.

1114
01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been done.

1115
01:18:38,325 --> 01:18:43,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, just a friendly reminder, guys, it's optional.

1116
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:47,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Reminding us that if you don't want to buy the $30 pack, you don't have to.

1117
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:51,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But Black Wolf goes, it's required, it exists, therefore I must have it.

1118
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,061
[SPEAKER_03]: There are consumer whores out there.

1119
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:58,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And, honestly, it's the same reason why people buy dubbed anime here.

1120
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I paid a little bit extra for the subtitled versions when they were on VHS.

1121
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:05,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's people...

1122
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games couldn't talk.

1123
01:19:35,749 --> 01:19:36,389
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1124
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:57,136
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have pushed me and pushed me and pushed me for Mass Effect.

1125
01:19:58,017 --> 01:20:01,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So I finally decided to go with something a lot older than that.

1126
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I see what you did there.

1127
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:07,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I picked a video game that was made in the 1940s.

1128
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:11,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1129
01:20:25,345 --> 01:20:32,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote for my Geeks in History, I wrote about Thomas Goldsmith Jr., who basically is the guy that invented this.

1130
01:20:33,432 --> 01:20:49,706
[SPEAKER_03]: He was from Greenville, South Carolina, born in 1910, and he actually filed a patent for a game with Estelle Ray Mann in 1948 that is a cathode ray tube game that uses radar displays used from World War II.

1131
01:20:50,607 --> 01:20:52,168
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically, it's table tennis.

1132
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: You had adjusting difficulties.

1133
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:58,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You would basically have your little paddles on either side, very Pong-like.

1134
01:20:59,114 --> 01:21:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to have something that's a frame of reference.

1135
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:08,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would knock the little ball from one side to the other using the same type of light moves on a radar screen.

1136
01:21:09,422 --> 01:21:14,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like I said, it had adjustable difficulties.

1137
01:21:14,206 --> 01:21:18,570
[SPEAKER_03]: He also had a missile game that using screen overlays, you could shoot

1138
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:20,011
[SPEAKER_03]: at targets.

1139
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was sort of like... Screen overlays, so it was like the Vectrex.

1140
01:21:23,775 --> 01:21:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Vectrex-y, yeah.

1141
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:29,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, it used basically the CRT's electron gun kind of like an etch sketch.

1142
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:34,086
[SPEAKER_03]: The same type of theory behind it.

1143
01:21:34,146 --> 01:21:39,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're talking about... Now, how long before somebody drew a penis using the technology?

1144
01:21:41,214 --> 01:21:41,575
[SPEAKER_07]: 45 seconds?

1145
01:21:42,415 --> 01:21:44,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, this was in the 40s.

1146
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:45,378
[SPEAKER_03]: People were so repressed.

1147
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:46,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

1148
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:47,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said.

1149
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:50,643
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a cock overlay for it.

1150
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:53,025
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't talk about it in public back then.

1151
01:21:53,726 --> 01:21:56,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Becky said, they didn't talk about it in public back then.

1152
01:21:57,509 --> 01:21:58,890
[SPEAKER_03]: They were polite company, Rob.

1153
01:21:59,371 --> 01:21:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob!

1154
01:21:59,871 --> 01:22:00,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so dirty, Rob.

1155
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm trying to... I can't do your... I will call her later if you push me.

1156
01:22:04,695 --> 01:22:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your mom.

1157
01:22:05,615 --> 01:22:06,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mom's awesome.

1158
01:22:07,016 --> 01:22:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but no, it was... I don't know, I'm imagining that they put like a little, you know, penis-shaped overlay on it and then had the little white ball shoot out of the top.

1159
01:22:14,802 --> 01:22:15,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1160
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:24,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but yeah, basically it detected the targets mechanically and then you used, I'm just going to read this here.

1161
01:22:24,552 --> 01:22:37,846
[SPEAKER_03]: By connecting a cathodary tube to an oscilloscope and devising knobs that controlled the angle and trajectory of the light traces displayed on the oscilloscope, they were able to invent a missile game that when using the overlays created the effect of firing missiles at various targets.

1162
01:22:39,124 --> 01:22:39,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Lady Byron?

1163
01:23:01,497 --> 01:23:01,897
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1164
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, but I mean, with her, you know, she invented the first programming language, so we could just go back to her, but still, um... Are you looking at... I'm trying to look it up.

1165
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:15,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Ada Lovelace.

1166
01:23:16,029 --> 01:23:16,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1167
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:17,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Ada Lovelace.

1168
01:23:19,172 --> 01:23:19,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah.

1169
01:23:20,093 --> 01:23:29,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, this guy here pretty much, without him screwing around with radar screens, would we have...

1170
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:31,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth Defense Force.

1171
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:33,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Just asking.

1172
01:23:35,726 --> 01:23:36,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1173
01:23:36,186 --> 01:23:37,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, World War II, for making video games.

1174
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:41,429
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Radar Games.

1175
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:44,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Radar Games.

1176
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Radar Love.

1177
01:23:46,611 --> 01:23:47,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're going to name it?

1178
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:48,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Radar Love?

1179
01:23:48,492 --> 01:23:50,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to name it Radar Love.

1180
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:50,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Radar Love.

1181
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:53,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have played the song in the background.

1182
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's great.

1183
01:23:57,476 --> 01:23:57,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1184
01:23:57,917 --> 01:24:04,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So AkumaJP linked this to me, and this was definitely worth playing with the prior story.

1185
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:10,245
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Tomb Raider Japanese voice acting, but I want to point out this is the older Tomb Raider.

1186
01:24:10,265 --> 01:24:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not from the new game.

1187
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:14,968
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Sega Saturn Sony PlayStation game.

1188
01:24:15,028 --> 01:24:16,169
[SPEAKER_00]: She's watching a computer there.

1189
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:17,350
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not very exciting.

1190
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me fast forward.

1191
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: to a loading screen.

1192
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Good lord.

1193
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:38,523
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the tutorial telling her how to play the damn game.

1194
01:24:40,043 --> 01:24:40,983
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a great video.

1195
01:24:41,003 --> 01:24:43,624
[SPEAKER_07]: This represented the voice acting here.

1196
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:44,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go back.

1197
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1198
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:47,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1199
01:24:47,305 --> 01:24:47,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lost its...

1200
01:24:49,144 --> 01:24:51,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted the British accent, but Japanese.

1201
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:54,447
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the cathode ray tube amusement device.

1202
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still calling it Radar Love.

1203
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:57,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Radar Love.

1204
01:24:57,128 --> 01:24:58,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier to remember.

1205
01:24:58,828 --> 01:24:59,149
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1206
01:25:00,589 --> 01:25:01,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a break, guys.

1207
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:04,511
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a break, but when we come back, there is plenty more to come.

1208
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:06,732
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some rapid fire news for you guys.

1209
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:07,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The Fugo Question of the Week.

1210
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:09,273
[SPEAKER_07]: More stories and...

1211
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:10,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1212
01:25:11,302 --> 01:25:12,983
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play match game tonight.

1213
01:25:13,104 --> 01:25:14,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So stay tuned, guys.

1214
01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:19,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Match game and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 500.

1215
01:25:29,144 --> 01:25:34,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi there, this is Flaco Jones, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1216
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:38,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to use my voice to tell you, you should all play Ni No Kuni.

1217
01:25:38,368 --> 01:25:38,768
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great.

1218
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:40,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.

1219
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:44,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that I said it in a bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni, or you have to play this bumper forever.

1220
01:25:45,863 --> 01:25:46,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

1221
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:47,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

1222
01:25:47,404 --> 01:25:48,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never beat it.

1223
01:25:48,324 --> 01:25:48,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

1224
01:25:48,824 --> 01:25:50,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have gamer ADD.

1225
01:25:50,165 --> 01:25:50,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I never beat games.

1226
01:25:51,165 --> 01:25:51,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody.

1227
01:25:51,866 --> 01:25:53,226
[SPEAKER_07]: You're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

1228
01:25:53,646 --> 01:25:56,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode number 500 in progress here.

1229
01:25:57,568 --> 01:26:06,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to send in a bumper like Flaco Jones did, and we have one other bumper that was sent in, and I'll let you know who that was next week when we play it.

1230
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,033
[SPEAKER_07]: That's quite an empty space there.

1231
01:26:09,053 --> 01:26:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking for more bumpers.

1232
01:26:10,394 --> 01:26:20,500
[SPEAKER_07]: More information at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com if you want to send in a bumper for future use on the show because we do say it is the show where every gamer has a voice and we mean it.

1233
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:25,384
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to hear from more of you guys and what you want to use your voice to tell people here on the show.

1234
01:26:26,144 --> 01:26:26,444
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1235
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:28,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1236
01:26:30,787 --> 01:26:32,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be time for me to have one more shot.

1237
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:33,028
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1238
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:34,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I do one more shot?

1239
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:34,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it!

1240
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:35,350
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1241
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go get one more shot.

1242
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:40,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm never going to discourage you from getting shit-faced.

1243
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,711
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you use your voice to tell people?

1244
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:43,373
[SPEAKER_03]: What would I use my voice to tell people?

1245
01:26:44,934 --> 01:26:48,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I would use my voice to tell people to give me money because I'm broke and hire me.

1246
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to use my voice for.

1247
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:56,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, that hasn't worked for 500 episodes and it's not going to work now.

1248
01:26:57,066 --> 01:27:00,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you forgot the whole thing where we're not trying to profit off this show, remember?

1249
01:27:00,489 --> 01:27:01,650
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not trying to profit off this show.

1250
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:02,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want a job.

1251
01:27:04,713 --> 01:27:05,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to my voice.

1252
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,614
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to market your stuff.

1253
01:27:08,674 --> 01:27:09,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I can sell you anything.

1254
01:27:10,554 --> 01:27:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, would you sell anything that I offered you to buy?

1255
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Yes.

1256
01:27:16,115 --> 01:27:16,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob says yes.

1257
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:17,836
[SPEAKER_03]: He's off the mic.

1258
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:18,436
[SPEAKER_04]: He says yes.

1259
01:27:18,496 --> 01:27:21,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I would go directly to eBay and sell all that crap.

1260
01:27:21,437 --> 01:27:21,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey.

1261
01:27:22,817 --> 01:27:23,177
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1262
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:24,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

1263
01:27:24,397 --> 01:27:25,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, shot time.

1264
01:27:26,518 --> 01:27:27,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this cheers to?

1265
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,822
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, these are double shots.

1266
01:27:33,603 --> 01:27:35,245
[SPEAKER_07]: To the air we breathe.

1267
01:27:35,846 --> 01:27:37,107
[SPEAKER_03]: The air from my lungs.

1268
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob just shivered and made stink face.

1269
01:27:45,739 --> 01:27:46,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

1270
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:48,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fiery.

1271
01:27:50,242 --> 01:27:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's flaming.

1272
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:51,843
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1273
01:27:51,863 --> 01:27:56,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I got your email, and I am so sorry I didn't get a chance to reply to it, Zombie Princess.

1274
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:57,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I will reply to it when I get home.

1275
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this personal chat time here on OR?

1276
01:27:58,768 --> 01:27:59,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's money.

1277
01:27:59,709 --> 01:28:00,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1278
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:03,472
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1279
01:28:03,552 --> 01:28:04,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1280
01:28:04,252 --> 01:28:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to rapid-fire news and talk about what else is going on in the video game industry.

1281
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:11,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming up, the Fugle Question of the Week, match game in this segment as well.

1282
01:28:12,058 --> 01:28:14,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get players for that soon.

1283
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,701
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

1284
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:22,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Ridge Racer.

1285
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:27,133
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, Ridge Racer Driftopia is a new game that they announced that they're going to be putting out.

1286
01:28:27,473 --> 01:28:29,234
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's not like your classic Ridge Racer.

1287
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:35,799
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually kind of an extension of Ridge Racer Unbounded, which is done by Bugbear, and they're doing a new one.

1288
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:43,384
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a free-to-play game, so you're going to have, I guess, the ability to buy cars, repair kits, and XP packs.

1289
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:46,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, it's just not going to be crippled by the free-to-play stuff.

1290
01:28:47,466 --> 01:28:48,946
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming to PS3 and PC.

1291
01:28:49,927 --> 01:28:51,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray.

1292
01:28:51,807 --> 01:28:53,768
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something I actually backed on Kickstarter.

1293
01:28:54,148 --> 01:28:54,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Road Redemption.

1294
01:28:55,228 --> 01:28:57,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a spiritual successor to Road Rash.

1295
01:28:57,829 --> 01:28:58,569
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in 3D.

1296
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:02,590
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're looking for $160,000 over the next 30 days.

1297
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:07,551
[SPEAKER_14]: And as of right now, I believe they're not quite there.

1298
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:11,572
[SPEAKER_14]: They are... Let's see...

1299
01:29:13,513 --> 01:29:15,135
[SPEAKER_14]: 34,000!

1300
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Not bad.

1301
01:29:15,636 --> 01:29:16,598
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think they'll make it.

1302
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,060
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks kind of neat.

1303
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,825
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not, though, done by anybody that did the original Road Rash game.

1304
01:29:21,845 --> 01:29:23,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It's merely people that are fans of it.

1305
01:29:23,348 --> 01:29:24,389
[SPEAKER_14]: So, sorry.

1306
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:27,654
[SPEAKER_14]: And last but not least, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

1307
01:29:27,955 --> 01:29:28,776
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fantastic.

1308
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:29,997
[SPEAKER_14]: VHS Tracking VHS Tracking VHS Tracking

1309
01:29:59,204 --> 01:30:00,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So what does that mean?

1310
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it does like the little fuzzy wuzzies like a tape that's been demagnetized or something?

1311
01:30:04,407 --> 01:30:07,610
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like all fuzzy and then there's the tracking thing going back and forth on the bottom.

1312
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you adjust it?

1313
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:10,271
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1314
01:30:10,732 --> 01:30:13,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's great is they have tool tips on there.

1315
01:30:13,633 --> 01:30:18,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Like for example, fast travel is like traveling except fast.

1316
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:28,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Or guns or was it shooting enemies within range will cause them damage or something like that.

1317
01:30:28,482 --> 01:30:29,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I need this in my life.

1318
01:30:31,371 --> 01:30:35,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to some other stories here.

1319
01:30:35,172 --> 01:30:36,013
[SPEAKER_07]: This is interesting.

1320
01:30:36,253 --> 01:30:42,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Armature Studio was working on an unreleased Mega Man first-person shooter called Maverick Hunter.

1321
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:44,496
[SPEAKER_07]: This is in a report from Polygon.

1322
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:49,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Armature Studio is the Austin-based developer that was formed from Retro Studios originally.

1323
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was a Mega Man X first-person shooter.

1324
01:30:52,458 --> 01:31:00,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that necessarily means Mega Man Legends or all that, but I think this was supposed to be a little more hardcore or something like that.

1325
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:07,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom did cancel the project because Mega Man Universe and Mega Man Legends 3, all those went to hell, so why not this one as well?

1326
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:13,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Arbiter did have a prototype in 2010, and it looks like there was a little screenshot that leaked to the web as well.

1327
01:31:13,353 --> 01:31:14,714
[SPEAKER_14]: They had video that leaked to the web.

1328
01:31:14,874 --> 01:31:15,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I watched it already.

1329
01:31:15,855 --> 01:31:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd it look?

1330
01:31:17,016 --> 01:31:17,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see the video.

1331
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:17,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It

1332
01:31:18,457 --> 01:31:20,178
[SPEAKER_14]: It gave me a lot of vibe.

1333
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:27,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it would have been this bad, but it gave me a lot of the Bomberman Act Zero vibe.

1334
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:30,124
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't really look like Mega Man.

1335
01:31:30,164 --> 01:31:33,186
[SPEAKER_14]: He was firing machine guns and stuff like that.

1336
01:31:33,986 --> 01:31:39,089
[SPEAKER_14]: And just kind of fighting some generic looking robots and doing all sorts of weird takedowns and stuff.

1337
01:31:39,549 --> 01:31:41,651
[SPEAKER_14]: It just didn't seem very much like Mega Man.

1338
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:44,592
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked neat, but I don't know if it was necessarily Mega Man.

1339
01:31:44,692 --> 01:31:44,752
[SPEAKER_14]: It...

1340
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:50,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Ubisoft has picked up German developer Related Designs.

1341
01:31:50,435 --> 01:31:55,337
[SPEAKER_14]: They made the Anno strategy series, including Anno 1404, which is Dawn's discovery over here.

1342
01:32:09,844 --> 01:32:13,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Ubisoft previously held a 30% share in the company, but they have purchased the other 70%.

1343
01:32:14,908 --> 01:32:20,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It is undisclosed for how much that went for, but you can expect more strategy-style games from Ubisoft in the near future.

1344
01:32:21,152 --> 01:32:23,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Atari closed a studio this week.

1345
01:32:24,394 --> 01:32:31,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They closed Eden Games, which was the mind behind Test Drive Unlimited and Alone in the Dark a long time ago.

1346
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,441
[SPEAKER_14]: This is according to a report from Eurogamer.

1347
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:38,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe they closed that studio after such a wonderful game like Alone in the Dark.

1348
01:32:40,444 --> 01:33:03,411
[SPEAKER_14]: well I like the test drive games alright the problem was it wasn't Forza it just wasn't that same level to get away from the police you drove in the grass and they're like I can't get you you left a road how am I going to get you now damn you grass and also Lamborghinis make really awesome off road vehicles

1349
01:33:04,721 --> 01:33:08,903
[SPEAKER_07]: TwitchGameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Atari still exists?

1350
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:09,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1351
01:33:09,883 --> 01:33:11,744
[SPEAKER_14]: What have they put out lately?

1352
01:33:11,964 --> 01:33:14,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, they were supposed to be liquidating soon, weren't they?

1353
01:33:14,305 --> 01:33:17,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I remember all their properties are supposed to be up for sale.

1354
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:21,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what happened to that, but it's supposed to happen.

1355
01:33:21,307 --> 01:33:22,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Marble Madness is up for sale.

1356
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I know somebody needs to pick up Marble Madness.

1357
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:30,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an Xbox Live Arcade PlayStation Network thing worth picking up for sure.

1358
01:33:30,891 --> 01:33:32,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have to do a lot to Marble Madness, though.

1359
01:33:34,187 --> 01:33:35,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Like more stages than six.

1360
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:36,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1361
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:38,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And like longer levels and more challenges.

1362
01:33:38,748 --> 01:33:41,088
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1363
01:33:41,608 --> 01:33:43,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some stuff and things.

1364
01:33:43,789 --> 01:33:46,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd help if I was actually on the right window on my stupid iPad.

1365
01:33:46,609 --> 01:33:46,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1366
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:50,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a new mobile game coming out soon.

1367
01:33:50,590 --> 01:34:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The Prince of Persia, The Shadow and the Flame is going to mobile on that really fun date that we like to refer to as soon.

1368
01:34:01,172 --> 01:34:02,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know when, but soon.

1369
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:09,998
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's being developed by Ubisoft Pune or is it Pune?

1370
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Ubisoft Pune?

1371
01:34:13,142 --> 01:34:13,482
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1372
01:34:14,223 --> 01:34:15,064
[SPEAKER_03]: P-U-N-E.

1373
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:18,047
[SPEAKER_03]: You say it.

1374
01:34:18,248 --> 01:34:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Who likes the Pune?

1375
01:34:21,826 --> 01:34:25,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Come over to Ubisoft and get yourself... You gave me this story so you could give me shit.

1376
01:34:25,449 --> 01:34:26,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Get yourself the poonay.

1377
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:27,691
[SPEAKER_14]: You gave me this story.

1378
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:33,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you could have just said it's being developed by Ubisoft and saved yourself from trying to... It's Rob's fault.

1379
01:34:33,576 --> 01:34:35,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not get in the way of me blaming Rob for shit.

1380
01:34:36,498 --> 01:34:37,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I will judge you.

1381
01:34:39,947 --> 01:35:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Souls, because I know that there are a lot of people out there who like this game it sold 2.3 million copies worldwide and that was from software that put this out they actually had an event to announce this out for the Japanese press it sold 375,000 copies for PS3 in Japan and 1.3 million internationally for PS3 and Xbox 360 so yay for Dark Souls fans

1382
01:35:05,049 --> 01:35:06,850
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I think they should do with that series?

1383
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:13,854
[SPEAKER_14]: They should get the guy that made I Want to Be the Guy and have him help with level design for that game because that would be awesome.

1384
01:35:14,415 --> 01:35:17,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to fuck with the fans and make it so hard.

1385
01:35:17,457 --> 01:35:22,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make people jump off buildings or into bullet trains and that type of thing.

1386
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like a rehash of the beginning of Suicide Club.

1387
01:35:27,182 --> 01:35:31,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, last but not least, remember that guy Adam Orth?

1388
01:35:31,465 --> 01:35:32,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We were kind of giving him shit last week.

1389
01:35:33,953 --> 01:35:34,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Kinda.

1390
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:35,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinda.

1391
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:36,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

1392
01:35:36,514 --> 01:35:36,834
[SPEAKER_03]: He quit.

1393
01:35:37,694 --> 01:35:44,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Either he quit or was fired, but he's the one that said, sorry, I don't get the drama about having an always-on console.

1394
01:35:44,756 --> 01:35:46,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Every device is always-on.

1395
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the world we live in.

1396
01:35:47,857 --> 01:35:48,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag deal with it.

1397
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:52,319
[SPEAKER_07]: He decided to retire so he could get all the Pune.

1398
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:57,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob.

1399
01:35:57,761 --> 01:35:58,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been drinking.

1400
01:35:58,481 --> 01:35:59,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave me alone.

1401
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:06,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone actually went back and asked him, did you learn nothing from Diablo 3 or SimCity?

1402
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You know some people's internet goes out, right?

1403
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:10,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal with it is a shitty reason.

1404
01:36:10,384 --> 01:36:11,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And he replied, electricity goes out too.

1405
01:36:12,404 --> 01:36:14,565
[SPEAKER_07]: That's somebody who worked for Bioware, if I remember right.

1406
01:36:17,286 --> 01:36:19,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Could that have just been friends giving each other shit?

1407
01:36:19,547 --> 01:36:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm way meaner to people on Twitter than that guy was.

1408
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, the person made another good point.

1409
01:36:25,371 --> 01:36:29,333
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you lived in Seattle, San Francisco, L.A., very connected places.

1410
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:32,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Try living in Janesville, Wisconsin, or Blacksburg, Virginia.

1411
01:36:32,794 --> 01:36:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he said, why on earth would I live there?

1412
01:36:38,038 --> 01:36:53,189
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a fair question I mean I'm sorry but come on like you haven't said way worse shit on the internet like you haven't said way worse shit on the internet I'm completely innocent yeah but I've said shit about places I've actually lived look

1413
01:36:53,809 --> 01:37:20,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it though this is just the day and age that we live in is that you know whether or not you want to represent your company when you are the creative director for Microsoft there are people that are going to read way too much into your stuff like you know create a second account that's anonymous or something like that that you but like because I mean if you're like working at Microsoft you don't go I don't understand what the big deal is if you have it on your thing you're the creative director for Microsoft you don't go posting shit on the internet

1414
01:37:20,385 --> 01:37:22,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you hate your job.

1415
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:28,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that he ever imagined that the entirety of gaming online would read so much into his tweets?

1416
01:37:28,992 --> 01:37:32,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people on the internet don't think about consequence, usually.

1417
01:37:33,255 --> 01:37:33,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Ain't that the truth.

1418
01:37:34,236 --> 01:37:34,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1419
01:37:34,996 --> 01:37:37,158
[SPEAKER_14]: No one put a gun to his head to tell him to be stupid.

1420
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:39,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but some people are just stupid.

1421
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:44,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but by your guys' definition of stupid, I act stupid all the time on Twitter.

1422
01:37:44,607 --> 01:37:46,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but you don't work for Microsoft.

1423
01:37:46,688 --> 01:37:54,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, but I like my job and I wouldn't want to lose it due to my opinion, but I'm also smart enough to not talk about my industry on Twitter.

1424
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:57,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and no matter how drunk you might be right now, Rob, I've seen you far drunker.

1425
01:37:58,011 --> 01:38:01,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen me at my most drunkest.

1426
01:38:01,172 --> 01:38:08,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the depths of inebriation, I have never seen you said, I'm going to go post about my work on Tumblr, Twitter, me.

1427
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:09,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no.

1428
01:38:09,616 --> 01:38:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never done that.

1429
01:38:10,656 --> 01:38:12,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen you kiss a girl, which was very weird.

1430
01:38:13,297 --> 01:38:14,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we bringing this up?

1431
01:38:15,759 --> 01:38:16,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you were drunk.

1432
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: What does me kissing a girl have to do with an always online Xbox?

1433
01:38:21,701 --> 01:38:23,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It's less offensive than this guy.

1434
01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:28,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I love watching Rob turn red.

1435
01:38:29,085 --> 01:38:30,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

1436
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:31,489
[SPEAKER_04]: He is literally glowing.

1437
01:38:31,509 --> 01:38:33,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost want to put that in as a poll question.

1438
01:38:33,773 --> 01:38:36,778
[SPEAKER_07]: What's more offensive, Rob kissing a girl or that guy?

1439
01:38:40,299 --> 01:38:50,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the guy actually, apart from somehow or another losing his means of employment, which, by the way, I'm open for employment, Microsoft.

1440
01:38:50,743 --> 01:38:51,344
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hire me.

1441
01:38:51,844 --> 01:38:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go saying stupid shit on the internet.

1442
01:38:53,304 --> 01:38:53,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1443
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:54,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you sure?

1444
01:38:54,485 --> 01:38:56,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab!

1445
01:38:56,406 --> 01:38:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: 500 episodes, DarkSakura.

1446
01:38:57,466 --> 01:38:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't say stupid shit about my job.

1447
01:38:59,707 --> 01:39:01,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Honey, you've said a lot of stupid shit on this show.

1448
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:02,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I have said a lot of stupid shit on this show.

1449
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,649
[SPEAKER_07]: A real friend will tell you that.

1450
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said a lot of stupid shit off this show, too.

1451
01:39:09,171 --> 01:39:09,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit it.

1452
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:15,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the dude actually locked his Twitter and deleted his LinkedIn account.

1453
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he's like, I'm going to hide now.

1454
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you blame him?

1455
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't blame him, but he's kind of stupid anyway.

1456
01:39:22,805 --> 01:39:31,192
[SPEAKER_07]: If freaking LolTaku's going to be posting everything that you tweet about, then yeah, it's suddenly going to become a new headline, then yeah, I'd go into hiding too.

1457
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:32,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

1458
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And y'all want to know why I don't use my real name on this show?

1459
01:39:34,755 --> 01:39:37,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, I like my job.

1460
01:39:37,858 --> 01:39:38,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care.

1461
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,961
[SPEAKER_07]: What, about all this mess, or what?

1462
01:39:42,162 --> 01:39:42,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything.

1463
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:45,710
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't care about everything.

1464
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:46,751
[SPEAKER_14]: You just don't care.

1465
01:39:47,091 --> 01:40:00,357
[SPEAKER_14]: I still didn't get... I mean, other than the fact that his comments are a little insensitive to the fact that, you know, hey, there are a lot of people that are trying to figure out what this new Xbox is going to be like and the rumors that it's going to be online only.

1466
01:40:00,497 --> 01:40:02,778
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you come out and say, well, I don't see the problem with that.

1467
01:40:02,858 --> 01:40:05,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, after all, it sounds like a fucking wonderful thing.

1468
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:07,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you start being insensitive to everybody.

1469
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:08,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1470
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:22,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, they're not asking you to move to this fucking city.

1471
01:40:22,801 --> 01:40:24,663
[SPEAKER_14]: They're talking about, hey, be empathetic.

1472
01:40:25,464 --> 01:40:28,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, Rob, just for the record, I'm not offended.

1473
01:40:28,406 --> 01:40:30,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, that's bizarre.

1474
01:40:30,448 --> 01:40:31,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

1475
01:40:31,049 --> 01:40:37,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a Queen Simeon chat says, well, hey, if some people become bi-curious when inebriated, look, I just like to make out, okay?

1476
01:40:38,015 --> 01:40:38,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I cook.

1477
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:40,257
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with that?

1478
01:40:41,078 --> 01:40:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a true story.

1479
01:40:41,898 --> 01:40:42,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I cook when I'm drunk.

1480
01:40:43,447 --> 01:40:46,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't, like, enjoy a little kissy-kissy every now and then?

1481
01:40:46,349 --> 01:40:46,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1482
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:50,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were playing Spin the Bottle, and I was the only one sober because I had to drive.

1483
01:40:50,673 --> 01:40:52,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Which was boring.

1484
01:40:52,374 --> 01:40:56,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wasn't... This was, like, ten years ago, too.

1485
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:57,759
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the you and Loki apartment.

1486
01:40:58,279 --> 01:40:59,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was a long time ago.

1487
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about eight years ago.

1488
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:00,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember that.

1489
01:41:01,242 --> 01:41:03,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I remember you... I think you were there.

1490
01:41:03,263 --> 01:41:03,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember...

1491
01:41:04,244 --> 01:41:07,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember you like some of the things that happened when you weren't there, Loki.

1492
01:41:08,847 --> 01:41:13,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember you like Matrix walking up or trying to Matrix walk up the wall.

1493
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,111
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.

1494
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:15,291
[SPEAKER_14]: That was during OLR.

1495
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:17,453
[SPEAKER_14]: That was during OLR.

1496
01:41:17,533 --> 01:41:30,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the DDR parties, the Bimani parties when people would inevitably end up like retardedly drunk and then try to play DDR and hit their head on the washing machine that was behind the monitor.

1497
01:41:30,522 --> 01:41:31,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about that.

1498
01:41:35,066 --> 01:41:53,884
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt says he got death threats the gaming community is sad that is stupid the action needs to be taken against the people who are making death threats over a video game console priorities people

1499
01:41:54,534 --> 01:42:04,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a problem though with the internet in general is that it's added this air of anonymity where people can just let the worst parts of their personality out without any sort of real consequence.

1500
01:42:04,606 --> 01:42:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Except unless you know how to track IPs.

1501
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:10,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can message them back and tell them where they live.

1502
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, is there anything else you want to share with us for rapid fire news that's gone on for 20 minutes?

1503
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:15,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1504
01:42:16,082 --> 01:42:16,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1505
01:42:17,222 --> 01:42:21,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week and let's see how many of them I can make it through tonight.

1506
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:23,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Fugle Question of the Week.

1507
01:42:23,884 --> 01:42:25,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my Fugle song?

1508
01:42:26,645 --> 01:42:27,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I could sing.

1509
01:42:27,505 --> 01:42:29,146
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

1510
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:29,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky can sing.

1511
01:42:29,966 --> 01:42:30,546
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a good singer.

1512
01:42:30,806 --> 01:42:31,687
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a good singer.

1513
01:42:34,522 --> 01:42:38,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook, Google, put them together, you get Fugle.

1514
01:42:38,165 --> 01:42:42,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And every week we ask a question and we read some of the answers here on the show.

1515
01:42:42,088 --> 01:42:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of answers tonight, you guys.

1516
01:42:47,472 --> 01:42:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is your favorite character in a video game ever and why?

1517
01:42:52,006 --> 01:42:52,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy, right?

1518
01:42:53,027 --> 01:42:54,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, you know, it's a special episode.

1519
01:42:54,688 --> 01:42:55,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's keep it simple.

1520
01:42:55,489 --> 01:42:56,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's keep it positive.

1521
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:56,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

1522
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:59,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so who's your favorite character in a video game and why?

1523
01:43:00,712 --> 01:43:05,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Entertainment on Google Plus says, I like it whenever I'm able to play with myself.

1524
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're done.

1525
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everybody for the food.

1526
01:43:12,701 --> 01:43:14,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been a great show.

1527
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:14,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you later.

1528
01:43:15,263 --> 01:43:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week.

1529
01:43:16,264 --> 01:43:17,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode 501.

1530
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for joining us tonight.

1531
01:43:21,747 --> 01:43:47,944
[SPEAKER_07]: that was clue worthy Rob I like whenever I'm able to play with myself I like playing with characters that I can style to be like myself or an idealized version of myself that's the unique thing about video games rare is the media platform that allows yourself to project yourself into the media experience rare is the media platform that not only allows you to but downright encourages you to play with yourself

1532
01:43:49,949 --> 01:43:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I see what you're doing there, Redertainment.

1533
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:57,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't he marry our own little angel?

1534
01:43:59,234 --> 01:43:59,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1535
01:43:59,754 --> 01:44:00,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment?

1536
01:44:00,555 --> 01:44:01,776
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was not Redertainment.

1537
01:44:02,516 --> 01:44:03,556
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thinking of Big Red Pimp.

1538
01:44:03,597 --> 01:44:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of Big Red Pimp.

1539
01:44:04,857 --> 01:44:05,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Different Red.

1540
01:44:05,578 --> 01:44:06,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Different Red.

1541
01:44:06,778 --> 01:44:06,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1542
01:44:07,078 --> 01:44:07,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I get people confused.

1543
01:44:08,059 --> 01:44:13,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane just messaged me other memories of things that happened in that apartment that are not appropriate for air.

1544
01:44:13,642 --> 01:44:14,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane sent me a message.

1545
01:44:14,903 --> 01:44:15,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he?

1546
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:16,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm telling him to.

1547
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:20,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Flaco Jones says, I have to go with GLaDOS.

1548
01:44:20,846 --> 01:44:21,327
[SPEAKER_07]: GLaDOS.

1549
01:44:21,867 --> 01:44:22,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been drinking, you guys.

1550
01:44:23,248 --> 01:44:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: GLaDOS.

1551
01:44:24,409 --> 01:44:30,933
[SPEAKER_07]: As if she wasn't already worthy of the title after the first game, Portal 2 manages to give her even more depth and a backstory as well.

1552
01:44:31,673 --> 01:44:35,596
[SPEAKER_07]: She also may be the most quotable character in video game history.

1553
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:39,899
[SPEAKER_07]: More quotable than the old guy in Legend of Zelda?

1554
01:44:40,099 --> 01:44:41,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dangerous to go alone.

1555
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, Kirby, of course, despite popular belief, he doesn't suck.

1556
01:44:47,762 --> 01:44:49,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Evil says, missing no.

1557
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:57,250
[SPEAKER_07]: By a simple random encounter, you get infinite rare candies and master balls for the cost of being disgraced in the Hall of Fame.

1558
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:01,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dasnichi replies, solid snake.

1559
01:45:03,055 --> 01:45:05,257
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you still going to feel that way if it's not David Hayter?

1560
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my question.

1561
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to not listen to any more of this while I'm having drinks.

1562
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: What, these lulz?

1563
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:17,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so on Facebook we have 30 responses.

1564
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I read them all?

1565
01:45:18,685 --> 01:45:20,086
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 responses on Facebook.

1566
01:45:22,288 --> 01:45:23,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Grandpa says Mega Man.

1567
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:27,273
[SPEAKER_07]: After he acquires the boss's skill powers, he's very versatile.

1568
01:45:27,493 --> 01:45:29,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my men versatile.

1569
01:45:31,412 --> 01:45:33,673
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura replied, but nobody cares.

1570
01:45:33,973 --> 01:45:35,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1571
01:45:35,634 --> 01:45:41,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim P replied and said, Commander Shepard, he's the sexy space marine I always wished I could be.

1572
01:45:41,837 --> 01:45:45,019
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he, a bro-shep fan, a bro-shep fan.

1573
01:45:45,717 --> 01:45:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no room for dude chefs in my head.

1574
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:54,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Burr replied and said, Sonic the Hedgehog, too fast for the naked eye.

1575
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic, he can really move.

1576
01:45:56,746 --> 01:45:58,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic, he's got an attitude.

1577
01:45:58,127 --> 01:45:59,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic, he's the fastest thing alive.

1578
01:46:00,069 --> 01:46:06,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, to me as a kid, that was the moment when video games started to be cool and not just goofy fun with ridiculous looking characters.

1579
01:46:06,594 --> 01:46:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll always have a soft spot for Sonic as a series.

1580
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:14,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Syl replied, Garrus, first time I thought an alien was damn hot.

1581
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:14,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, Syl.

1582
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:27,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya said Pantsless Rage Just kidding, in all seriousness I'd have to go with Solid Snake That was an old ass That was an old ass That was an old joke

1583
01:46:28,275 --> 01:46:32,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamer Girl says Sophie, later known as Protoss Hias.

1584
01:46:33,536 --> 01:46:35,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this music is starting to not do it for me.

1585
01:46:35,317 --> 01:46:35,617
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1586
01:46:36,637 --> 01:46:39,478
[SPEAKER_07]: From Tales of Grace's F because she's odd.

1587
01:46:40,658 --> 01:46:43,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Red the Haze says Renegade Femshep.

1588
01:46:43,879 --> 01:46:47,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had a favorite game character, but Renegade Femshep comes to mind.

1589
01:46:48,661 --> 01:46:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1590
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:53,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have to kind of agree with that playing Renegade FemShep is pretty fun.

1591
01:46:53,406 --> 01:46:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Except in some situations, then it's just bitchy.

1592
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:57,831
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm playing one right now with Ashley's face.

1593
01:46:58,192 --> 01:46:58,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.

1594
01:46:59,193 --> 01:47:01,155
[SPEAKER_07]: James S. replied and said, I have this game.

1595
01:47:08,684 --> 01:47:09,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

1596
01:47:09,545 --> 01:47:10,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, good choice.

1597
01:47:11,006 --> 01:47:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: The journey that young Will endures in hopes to find out what became of his father who ventured off before him ultimately changes the course of the entire world.

1598
01:47:19,053 --> 01:47:22,836
[SPEAKER_07]: This game came out during a time when games of this art style weren't just for children.

1599
01:47:23,177 --> 01:47:25,759
[SPEAKER_07]: The themes were adult and the story utterly breathtaking.

1600
01:47:25,799 --> 01:47:27,200
[SPEAKER_07]: The music alone gives me chills.

1601
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,322
[SPEAKER_07]: It was part of a three-part series, right?

1602
01:47:29,382 --> 01:47:30,943
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Soul Blazer was one of them.

1603
01:47:32,705 --> 01:47:35,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, I can't remember the other game in the series.

1604
01:47:37,165 --> 01:47:38,205
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one other game in the series.

1605
01:47:38,265 --> 01:47:40,226
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, and there was another one.

1606
01:47:41,147 --> 01:47:41,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

1607
01:47:41,547 --> 01:47:43,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, somebody in chat will remember.

1608
01:47:43,187 --> 01:47:44,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat, do our work for us.

1609
01:47:47,289 --> 01:47:50,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew S. said, The Chesire Cat from American McGee.

1610
01:47:50,611 --> 01:47:55,092
[SPEAKER_07]: He's creepy and psychologically sane and insane at the same time and always cool and collected.

1611
01:47:56,573 --> 01:47:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf says, The Dot in Adventure.

1612
01:47:59,354 --> 01:48:00,134
[SPEAKER_07]: He was so brave.

1613
01:48:01,155 --> 01:48:01,555
[SPEAKER_07]: He was.

1614
01:48:02,415 --> 01:48:03,796
[SPEAKER_07]: He had to figure out how to get through that maze.

1615
01:48:05,274 --> 01:48:07,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ross Steel UT, Terranigma, that was it.

1616
01:48:08,558 --> 01:48:10,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Prince Brightstar actually brought it up first too.

1617
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was Terranigma was the other game.

1618
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:18,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane replied and said, another vote for Commander Shepard, but only if he's full on Paragon.

1619
01:48:18,491 --> 01:48:22,636
[SPEAKER_07]: He sets the bar for what qualities I'm looking for in a man, video game character, I mean.

1620
01:48:25,289 --> 01:48:28,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Giovedea says, the eye tetromino.

1621
01:48:28,492 --> 01:48:30,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone always wants the eye.

1622
01:48:30,233 --> 01:48:32,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I have to go with Dante from the Devil May Cry series.

1623
01:48:33,056 --> 01:48:35,238
[SPEAKER_07]: A complete badass, also a bit of an asshole.

1624
01:48:35,538 --> 01:48:39,461
[SPEAKER_07]: You really get to see Dante go from reckless teen to equally reckless adult.

1625
01:48:40,963 --> 01:48:43,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Ronnie B says, Aiko, he took me through a great journey.

1626
01:48:43,965 --> 01:48:46,526
[SPEAKER_07]: He went through a lot in the story and overall the game was really original.

1627
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:50,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Extover says, Samus Aran, and I don't need to explain why.

1628
01:48:51,749 --> 01:48:52,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yes, you do.

1629
01:48:53,811 --> 01:48:57,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Alternate Universe Extover thinks Nathan Drake is his favorite based on ass physics.

1630
01:48:58,633 --> 01:49:01,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Matt, my boyfriend's favorite is Yoshi.

1631
01:49:02,656 --> 01:49:06,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonder Dog Harold says, Leon S. Kennedy, he's so dreamy.

1632
01:49:07,335 --> 01:49:10,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Degenerate Johnny says, Craya from Knights of the Old Republic 2.

1633
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:19,187
[SPEAKER_07]: From being one of your companions at the beginning to becoming the ultimate villain at the end, you'll find that she's one of the most unique and best written characters you'll ever meet in a video game.

1634
01:49:20,228 --> 01:49:23,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily C replied and said, the king of all cosmos in Katamari Damacy.

1635
01:49:24,132 --> 01:49:26,794
[SPEAKER_07]: He is so fun, flamboyant, and makes me laugh every time.

1636
01:49:26,835 --> 01:49:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really good choice.

1637
01:49:28,476 --> 01:49:33,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Barbara O says toss up between Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 and Balthier from Final Fantasy 12.

1638
01:49:33,741 --> 01:49:38,586
[SPEAKER_07]: We get to watch Cloud make a terrifying discovery about himself and then fight his way back from it.

1639
01:49:39,066 --> 01:49:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Balthier seems to be only a dashing pirate, but he slowly reveals both his trustworthiness and his strong moral convictions.

1640
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:47,454
[SPEAKER_21]: At least he's not talking about being a hero all the damn time.

1641
01:49:47,474 --> 01:49:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all really good answers.

1642
01:49:49,196 --> 01:49:53,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Austin replies and says woof old Donald from Star Fox because he can't let you do that.

1643
01:49:54,780 --> 01:50:21,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Wicked says my favorite has to be Kratos not because of anything relatable but due to his utter ferocity and severe brutality I had not seen in a video game character beforehand it was almost like playing a villain as cold hearted and brutal as he was Kyrian G says Mayak the liar because his dialogue is extremely entertaining that or Luther son of Scotia from Lands of Lore 2 Guardians of Destiny who provided many sound bites to my family throughout the years

1644
01:50:22,272 --> 01:50:39,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Edgar R replied Gene from God Hand There's nothing like roaming the post-apocalyptic world beating up mini Power Rangers and racing poison chihuahuas Rob H says Guybrush Threepwood He's a mighty pirate who can hold his breath for 10 minutes and he also has a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle How can you not like that?

1645
01:50:40,686 --> 01:50:42,367
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of unique answers tonight.

1646
01:50:42,407 --> 01:50:42,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this.

1647
01:50:42,867 --> 01:50:44,548
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm reading them all, because there's so many different ones.

1648
01:50:45,209 --> 01:50:47,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt J says, I feel equally about two characters.

1649
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:50,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Sama Saran, she's awesome and badass.

1650
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:52,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I fell in love with her in Super Metroid.

1651
01:50:53,473 --> 01:50:56,275
[SPEAKER_07]: My other all-time fave is the adorable and amazing Garrus.

1652
01:50:56,655 --> 01:51:00,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't too sure of him in Mass Effect 1, but by 2, they made his character so much better.

1653
01:51:00,638 --> 01:51:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: He's sweet, a bit of a dork, but kind.

1654
01:51:03,519 --> 01:51:06,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Jay Links says, Will from Illusion of Gaia.

1655
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:07,802
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two people that said that.

1656
01:51:08,402 --> 01:51:08,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

1657
01:51:10,044 --> 01:51:10,805
[SPEAKER_21]: People have good taste.

1658
01:51:10,945 --> 01:51:17,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I could relate at that age when I played the game about being the outcast strange kid in class and having a clique of dorky friends.

1659
01:51:17,373 --> 01:51:21,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It also didn't hurt that the game's story was amazing and I really fell in love with it as my first real RPG.

1660
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave Falcon says, Duke Nukem, why?

1661
01:51:25,484 --> 01:51:26,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Hail to the king, baby.

1662
01:51:27,486 --> 01:51:29,327
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, I'm going to have to say Mario.

1663
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:29,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1664
01:51:30,128 --> 01:51:31,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he always gets the girl in the end.

1665
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Marinko says, Knuckles the Echidna.

1666
01:51:35,772 --> 01:51:36,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Echidna.

1667
01:51:36,352 --> 01:51:36,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Echidna.

1668
01:51:36,752 --> 01:51:37,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I can never say that.

1669
01:51:37,793 --> 01:51:40,035
[SPEAKER_07]: No one has better background music than that red demon.

1670
01:51:40,155 --> 01:51:41,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Pumpkin Hill, anyone?

1671
01:51:41,996 --> 01:51:50,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And HaseoSumerWogara says, to be honest, I'd have to say Auron from Final Fantasy X, Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes, and Big Boss from the Metal Gear series.

1672
01:51:51,362 --> 01:51:53,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved Big Boss in the very first game.

1673
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing.

1674
01:51:55,725 --> 01:51:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly,

1675
01:51:57,106 --> 01:51:59,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Slagkick says Bayonetta.

1676
01:51:59,389 --> 01:52:02,372
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a fierce witch who kicks major ass and has great hair.

1677
01:52:02,712 --> 01:52:03,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Great hair.

1678
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:04,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Fabulous.

1679
01:52:05,255 --> 01:52:05,575
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1680
01:52:05,595 --> 01:52:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually starting that game next week.

1681
01:52:06,996 --> 01:52:07,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Good answers.

1682
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:09,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta is freaking amazing.

1683
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1684
01:52:11,221 --> 01:52:11,541
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1685
01:52:12,722 --> 01:52:14,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go around the table.

1686
01:52:14,164 --> 01:52:15,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious what you guys all think.

1687
01:52:15,805 --> 01:52:18,288
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, I'll start with you as if this is going to be a shock.

1688
01:52:18,648 --> 01:52:20,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite game character of all time?

1689
01:52:20,973 --> 01:52:22,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The Guardian from Guardian Legend

1690
01:52:51,578 --> 01:52:59,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a character that was going around and kicking a lot of ass in one of the most difficult games I have ever played in my life.

1691
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:02,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know how freaking hard that game is.

1692
01:53:02,574 --> 01:53:04,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have nearly half the skill I used to have at that game.

1693
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:06,079
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so amazing, though.

1694
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:06,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I've beaten it.

1695
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,162
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I wish that game would come back somehow.

1696
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:12,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really want a remake necessarily, but just a spiritual successor of sorts.

1697
01:53:12,765 --> 01:53:17,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to... I'm debating putting an MSX emulator on so I can play Guardic, the first one.

1698
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:20,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, anything else?

1699
01:53:21,092 --> 01:53:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Guardian effect, yeah.

1700
01:53:25,816 --> 01:53:31,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also would have to... I mean, as far as classic gaming, that would be probably my favorite character.

1701
01:53:32,521 --> 01:53:34,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything more modern?

1702
01:53:34,523 --> 01:53:35,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta.

1703
01:53:38,131 --> 01:53:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would like to go with my own Shepard, but I have my own weird headcanon.

1704
01:53:43,054 --> 01:53:44,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're playing with yourself.

1705
01:53:44,515 --> 01:53:47,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm playing with myself, and that can get dirty, especially the places my brain goes.

1706
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta, just because it's totally fabulous.

1707
01:53:55,962 --> 01:53:57,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her character concept.

1708
01:53:57,303 --> 01:53:58,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the game.

1709
01:53:58,184 --> 01:53:59,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It was completely over the top.

1710
01:54:00,525 --> 01:54:22,672
[SPEAKER_03]: and I watched Dan play through it for a little while because I didn't you know really do a lot of console gaming after my surgery except for playing Blue Dragon so um but I've got a lot more endurance in my hand now thanks to practicing a lot so I'm gonna sit down and try to play through Bayonetta so playing with yourself has gotten your hand a lot of practice no I've been drawing shut up all right uh Becky do you have a do you have a favorite that you'd want to mention

1711
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:31,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the last time I played video games before Jamie got me hooked on Mass Effect was on my parents' Commodore 64.

1712
01:54:32,036 --> 01:54:33,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Good choice.

1713
01:54:33,718 --> 01:54:37,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I would probably have to say FemShet.

1714
01:54:38,621 --> 01:54:43,805
[SPEAKER_20]: I really like her mostly Paragon with just a little bit of bitchiness here and there because it makes her feel human.

1715
01:54:44,906 --> 01:54:45,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1716
01:54:45,387 --> 01:54:46,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good answer.

1717
01:54:46,087 --> 01:54:47,709
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in good company with some of our listeners tonight.

1718
01:54:48,029 --> 01:54:48,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

1719
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:49,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1720
01:54:51,147 --> 01:54:58,490
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my favorite characters, and unfortunately, they better bring him back for the goddamn fourth game because that was a fucking mistake to kill him off.

1721
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:00,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny Gat from the Saints Row series.

1722
01:55:01,051 --> 01:55:03,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking awesome, awesome character.

1723
01:55:04,213 --> 01:55:09,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, voiced by Daniel Dae Kim, you know, from Lost and stuff.

1724
01:55:09,915 --> 01:55:11,796
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just awesome.

1725
01:55:11,816 --> 01:55:13,236
[SPEAKER_14]: He's just a really cool character.

1726
01:55:13,256 --> 01:55:13,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And the...

1727
01:55:16,448 --> 01:55:17,469
[SPEAKER_14]: That's probably it.

1728
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:23,716
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite video game character ever would probably be Rydia from Final Fantasy 4.

1729
01:55:24,076 --> 01:55:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good choice.

1730
01:55:27,941 --> 01:55:33,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally watching her grow up through the game and I have such an attachment to that story too because that game was so epic and

1731
01:55:34,268 --> 01:56:00,918
[SPEAKER_07]: you know that was really the first time most people in America saw the summoner you know and that was such a badass thing when she would come back to your party and she had all those you know summons and you'd go to her homeland and everything and she used the whip which was cool and you know had the black magic and she was great I and you know obviously she she had to grow up a lot fast in that story and went through tragedy and overcame it but I I just I have such an attachment to Final Fantasy 4 but Rydia was a amazing character

1732
01:56:01,297 --> 01:56:01,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Robo and Luka together.

1733
01:56:01,937 --> 01:56:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Twins.

1734
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:02,518
[SPEAKER_03]: OTP.

1735
01:56:25,697 --> 01:56:26,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice.

1736
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:26,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice.

1737
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:27,439
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1738
01:56:27,459 --> 01:56:29,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for participating with the Fugle Question of the Week.

1739
01:56:29,782 --> 01:56:31,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was a lot this week.

1740
01:56:31,244 --> 01:56:33,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I read every single answer because you know what?

1741
01:56:33,387 --> 01:56:34,809
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a show where every gamer has a voice.

1742
01:56:34,909 --> 01:56:35,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1743
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:37,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back into some news.

1744
01:56:37,632 --> 01:56:37,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1745
01:56:38,675 --> 01:56:42,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so let's talk about some more Xbox rumors.

1746
01:56:42,519 --> 01:56:47,003
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully, I don't know, I hope these are all rumors, so I don't know.

1747
01:56:47,043 --> 01:56:49,686
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of almost like the whole online thing.

1748
01:56:50,667 --> 01:56:56,313
[SPEAKER_14]: But once again, I still am under the assumption, at least, I guess, hopeful assumption that...

1749
01:56:56,793 --> 01:57:22,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft isn't dumb enough to have a console that's online only that you know would be a major gaming console that's online only and maybe some of this kind of ties into it and it's this leaked roadmap that's been our new roadmap that they had now this is coming from VG leaks so who knows but basically saying that there's going to be two Xboxes the next time around there's going

1750
01:57:22,383 --> 01:57:23,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1751
01:57:44,272 --> 01:57:45,113
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1752
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:03,405
[SPEAKER_14]: XBLA and 360 Game Support

1753
01:58:20,151 --> 01:58:30,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Come from the smaller Xbox unit, which may not have a disk drive like Apple TV, it would require a network connection and internet to provide any real functionality.

1754
01:58:30,659 --> 01:58:33,741
[SPEAKER_14]: It may be possible they will design both consoles to be stackable.

1755
01:58:35,082 --> 01:58:43,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, of course, the original rumor was that Durango is not going to be, you know, backwards compatible, which makes sense.

1756
01:58:43,568 --> 01:58:45,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's a different processor altogether.

1757
01:58:45,690 --> 01:58:49,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the PS4 is not going to be backwards compatible either.

1758
01:58:50,294 --> 01:58:56,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the Kinect, they're saying that a different department within Xbox handles the Kinect hardware and software.

1759
01:58:56,582 --> 01:59:00,627
[SPEAKER_14]: The focus was more on developing and networking both consoles with Kinect.

1760
01:59:01,227 --> 01:59:02,970
[SPEAKER_14]: More of an afterthought at that point.

1761
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:06,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, considering dealing with it is less an issue than hardware changes.

1762
01:59:06,654 --> 01:59:08,956
[SPEAKER_14]: The main console, Kinect, isn't the primary focus.

1763
01:59:09,437 --> 01:59:24,910
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it says development kits require several pieces of hardware combined, all the potential hardware, which may or may not be required to work with each other, which also includes the potential for any devices to require a network connection, which is where that required rumor comes from.

1764
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:30,593
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm thinking, I'm just hoping that it's not all online only.

1765
01:59:30,613 --> 01:59:36,196
[SPEAKER_14]: This sounds a little bit more Microsoft, because Microsoft's always been about, like, streaming crap to your TV.

1766
01:59:36,216 --> 01:59:40,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they have the whole Windows XP Media Center edition and that kind of shit.

1767
01:59:40,838 --> 01:59:46,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I could see them wanting to be in your living room and kind of be this focus and stuff.

1768
01:59:46,565 --> 01:59:48,086
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I don't know.

1769
01:59:48,106 --> 01:59:53,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just hoping that they don't make the mistake of having a console that's going to be a next-gen console that's only online.

1770
01:59:54,133 --> 01:59:59,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, after all, Microsoft's live service hasn't been working very well the last few days.

1771
01:59:59,059 --> 01:59:59,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, right.

1772
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:01,742
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's not a good idea to say...

1773
02:00:02,042 --> 02:00:03,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, yeah, we're going to be online only.

1774
02:00:04,063 --> 02:00:07,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, ignore the fact that you couldn't connect to live the last few days.

1775
02:00:07,524 --> 02:00:08,765
[SPEAKER_14]: But hey, yeah.

1776
02:00:08,965 --> 02:00:12,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask this, though, because here we go again reporting on rumors.

1777
02:00:12,926 --> 02:00:18,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we keep – I'm not saying us specifically, but I'm just talking like the internet and the whole hype machine.

1778
02:00:19,009 --> 02:00:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we keep reporting on rumors?

1779
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we don't have anything to go off of from them.

1780
02:00:24,712 --> 02:00:33,156
[SPEAKER_14]: All we know is that they're going to have, you know, some sort of, the rumor is that they're going to have some sort of reveal at the end of May.

1781
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:37,078
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now we have no information about it other than what's supposedly leaking out.

1782
02:00:37,618 --> 02:00:40,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, mainly discussing this, I'm not saying this is all fact.

1783
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:42,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying here's the rumor.

1784
02:00:42,421 --> 02:00:42,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

1785
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:48,464
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is a little bit, I hope it's a little bit more on this side than it's always online.

1786
02:00:48,904 --> 02:00:51,225
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there is no other, you know, way about it.

1787
02:00:51,385 --> 02:00:55,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well I want to know how important talking about Xbox rumors are.

1788
02:00:55,411 --> 02:00:56,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what it's time for?

1789
02:00:56,413 --> 02:00:59,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's time for us to poll the listeners.

1790
02:01:00,609 --> 02:01:04,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to put up a live poll right now at live.vognetwork.com.

1791
02:01:04,931 --> 02:01:06,692
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to vote in the poll, make sure you're logged in.

1792
02:01:06,752 --> 02:01:08,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Live.vognetwork.com.

1793
02:01:09,073 --> 02:01:12,455
[SPEAKER_07]: How much weight do you give to Xbox rumors?

1794
02:01:13,096 --> 02:01:13,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Microsoft.

1795
02:01:13,936 --> 02:01:14,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all true.

1796
02:01:15,177 --> 02:01:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of it is true, but I'm still quite skeptical.

1797
02:01:17,998 --> 02:01:21,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.

1798
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:26,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the internet is full of lies and slander, and I don't believe any of it.

1799
02:01:27,643 --> 02:01:28,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote now!

1800
02:01:28,204 --> 02:01:31,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Live.VogNetwork.com in our instant poll.

1801
02:01:33,231 --> 02:01:37,297
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll read the results here in a moment and try to get some of the answers as they come in.

1802
02:01:39,073 --> 02:01:39,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Rob.

1803
02:01:40,033 --> 02:01:45,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And then one other thing also there, another rumor going along with some of the launch titles.

1804
02:01:45,695 --> 02:01:48,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Next Gen Forza game, Rise, remember?

1805
02:01:48,595 --> 02:01:54,277
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple weeks ago I've been talking about Rise saying, where the fuck was that Gladiator game that they showed that was supposed to be a Kinect title?

1806
02:01:54,977 --> 02:01:57,497
[SPEAKER_14]: So that may be something that's going to be there.

1807
02:01:57,657 --> 02:02:02,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And then some sort of, you know, kind of Nintendo Land-esque Kinect game.

1808
02:02:03,559 --> 02:02:07,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I am seeing a lot of Kinect titles, two of those being Kinect required titles, so...

1809
02:02:10,141 --> 02:02:12,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Not interested, but Forza sounds cool.

1810
02:02:13,083 --> 02:02:13,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Forza Horizon.

1811
02:02:14,244 --> 02:02:15,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Next gen Forza Horizon, I could be down with that.

1812
02:02:16,901 --> 02:02:22,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now in our instant poll, it's very tilted towards the bullshit side of things.

1813
02:02:23,364 --> 02:02:28,527
[SPEAKER_07]: 67% of the vote for, I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.

1814
02:02:28,907 --> 02:02:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: 21% saying the internet is full of lies and slanders.

1815
02:02:30,828 --> 02:02:31,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe any of it.

1816
02:02:32,188 --> 02:02:34,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So only 13% of the vote at this point.

1817
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:37,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the math doesn't add up because it just updated.

1818
02:02:37,711 --> 02:02:40,152
[SPEAKER_07]: 13% of the vote right now only slightly leans true.

1819
02:02:40,592 --> 02:02:42,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero people saying it's all true.

1820
02:02:43,394 --> 02:02:43,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero.

1821
02:02:43,734 --> 02:02:43,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero.

1822
02:02:45,572 --> 02:02:46,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, it's on the internet.

1823
02:02:46,493 --> 02:02:47,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it's true.

1824
02:02:47,573 --> 02:02:48,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some people would think that.

1825
02:02:49,435 --> 02:02:49,935
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1826
02:02:50,075 --> 02:02:52,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I almost lean towards that top option.

1827
02:02:52,517 --> 02:02:57,020
[SPEAKER_07]: With Microsoft, there's very little that's fake anymore, it seems.

1828
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:57,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

1829
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,822
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll leave that poll up for about another minute.

1830
02:02:59,882 --> 02:03:03,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, live.vognetwork.com, live on this Sunday evening if you want to vote in that poll.

1831
02:03:03,644 --> 02:03:06,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all still UT has it wrong instead of the internet being 10% lies and 90% porn.

1832
02:03:06,766 --> 02:03:07,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 10% lies, 10% hate, and 80% porn.

1833
02:03:14,999 --> 02:03:17,041
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR in our chat room asking, where is the poll?

1834
02:03:17,521 --> 02:03:23,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It will show up automatically at live.vognetwork.com if you are logged into the site.

1835
02:03:23,425 --> 02:03:23,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1836
02:03:23,845 --> 02:03:27,127
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not logged into the site, it may not show up for you.

1837
02:03:27,928 --> 02:03:31,050
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is a feature that's in beta right now, trademark.

1838
02:03:32,671 --> 02:03:34,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't talk about it to anybody.

1839
02:03:34,232 --> 02:03:37,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally, this was not tested.

1840
02:03:38,434 --> 02:03:40,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We are testing it as the show goes on.

1841
02:03:40,236 --> 02:03:41,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1842
02:03:42,117 --> 02:03:42,417
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1843
02:03:43,254 --> 02:03:46,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing, optional in New Leaf

1844
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:08,154
[SPEAKER_07]: He is not there by default, and this is because of QQ Online.

1845
02:04:08,675 --> 02:04:11,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, okay, tell people about Mr. Resetti, for those that don't know DarkSakura.

1846
02:04:11,957 --> 02:04:19,742
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't save your game and just turned off your Animal Crossing, you turned off the system, well, you had Animal Crossing loading.

1847
02:04:20,303 --> 02:04:27,208
[SPEAKER_03]: When you started your game back up, this mole comes out of the ground and yells at you for ten minutes.

1848
02:04:27,228 --> 02:04:27,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1849
02:04:28,108 --> 02:04:30,390
[SPEAKER_03]: in all capital, huge letters.

1850
02:04:31,150 --> 02:04:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I understand, because I tried doing it on my Japanese version, he's really freaking rude.

1851
02:04:36,493 --> 02:04:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just absolutely hilarious.

1852
02:04:38,934 --> 02:04:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what did you do in resetting this form?

1853
02:04:40,595 --> 02:04:42,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1854
02:04:42,376 --> 02:04:43,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And he freaking chews you out.

1855
02:04:44,398 --> 02:04:53,563
[SPEAKER_03]: This mole, bitter, crass, grumpy old mole digs itself out of a hole just to give you shit for not saving your game.

1856
02:04:54,448 --> 02:04:56,129
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not popular in our chat.

1857
02:04:56,389 --> 02:04:57,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Girl says, what?

1858
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:58,571
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the best part of the game.

1859
02:04:58,751 --> 02:05:00,312
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR says, it's blasphemy.

1860
02:05:00,793 --> 02:05:02,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Guru says, Mr. Resetti has been fired.

1861
02:05:03,334 --> 02:05:04,475
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he's not fired.

1862
02:05:04,515 --> 02:05:05,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me clarify here.

1863
02:05:06,437 --> 02:05:13,902
[SPEAKER_07]: In a column called Iwata Asks, Resetti's status was updated, apparently out of guilt.

1864
02:05:14,282 --> 02:05:20,407
[SPEAKER_07]: The developers made him optional in Animal Crossing New Leaf because apparently he brought some players to tears.

1865
02:05:21,207 --> 02:05:21,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Good!

1866
02:05:22,368 --> 02:05:23,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Save your game!

1867
02:05:24,751 --> 02:05:29,916
[SPEAKER_07]: They also changed the goal of the game from paying off Tom Nook to improving the town as the mayor.

1868
02:05:29,996 --> 02:05:32,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tom Nook is no longer your pimp.

1869
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:36,102
[SPEAKER_03]: YYR says Mr. Resetti is a critical feature of Animal Crossing.

1870
02:05:37,143 --> 02:05:38,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It is required for the game to work properly.

1871
02:05:38,705 --> 02:05:42,769
[SPEAKER_03]: He handles many of the game's calculations, so it's technically impossible to run Animal Crossing without it.

1872
02:05:43,539 --> 02:06:08,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Strudels89 says he was a dick lol Loki's a dick but we all love him we keep him around he's a vital part of this show we couldn't do calculations without him you know what we used to do all the time fucking time travel fuck that Rosetti I'm time traveling like fucking Marty McFly I would travel to my birthday every year just to get more shit

1873
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:21,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Now in an article on Destructoid, I really like this point about it, but in an article published on Destructoid, they talked about how it was one of the more creative fourth wall breaking moments in gaming history along with Psycho Mantis reading your save files on the PlayStation card.

1874
02:06:21,946 --> 02:06:24,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you like Final Fantasy.

1875
02:06:24,887 --> 02:06:26,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan and I had Sweet Coden Sweet Coden

1876
02:06:49,485 --> 02:06:50,286
[SPEAKER_07]: But what do you guys think?

1877
02:06:50,727 --> 02:06:52,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a great fourth wall breaking?

1878
02:06:52,649 --> 02:06:54,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I think more games should break the fourth wall, to be honest.

1879
02:06:54,572 --> 02:06:55,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, too.

1880
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:58,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was pretty cool watching the controller move on the floor with Psycho Mantis.

1881
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1882
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:04,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to bring our poll to an end at live.vognetwork.com.

1883
02:07:04,104 --> 02:07:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So from the last story, here it is, the results.

1884
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:10,012
[SPEAKER_07]: How much weight do you give to Xbox rumors?

1885
02:07:10,413 --> 02:07:15,380
[SPEAKER_07]: 62% of the vote saying, I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.

1886
02:07:15,661 --> 02:07:19,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, finally a vote, 3% of the vote for, it's Microsoft, it's all true.

1887
02:07:21,102 --> 02:07:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, poor naive child.

1888
02:07:23,063 --> 02:07:24,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody voted for it.

1889
02:07:24,804 --> 02:07:27,105
[SPEAKER_07]: 12%, I think a lot of it is true, but I'm still quite skeptical.

1890
02:07:27,125 --> 02:07:29,966
[SPEAKER_07]: 22%, the internet is full of lies and slanders.

1891
02:07:30,406 --> 02:07:31,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe any of it.

1892
02:07:31,366 --> 02:07:33,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Haseo Sumirogawa says a good point.

1893
02:07:33,367 --> 02:07:34,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadpool will, I'm excited.

1894
02:07:35,048 --> 02:07:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But Deadpool, you expected of Deadpool.

1895
02:07:36,989 --> 02:07:39,210
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't quite expect that in Animal Crossing.

1896
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:42,711
[SPEAKER_03]: To have a character come out of the ground and yell at you for 10 minutes.

1897
02:07:43,291 --> 02:07:48,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, I mean, didn't you ever read Deadpool in comics?

1898
02:07:48,473 --> 02:07:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to happen, hi.

1899
02:07:50,216 --> 02:07:51,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Video Game Match Game Video Game Match Game

1900
02:08:16,747 --> 02:08:22,709
[SPEAKER_07]: What were the potato chips that Jamie got excited about when they were set on the table earlier in the evening?

1901
02:08:22,749 --> 02:08:24,329
[SPEAKER_07]: This is test your memory earlier in the show.

1902
02:08:24,729 --> 02:08:27,490
[SPEAKER_07]: First person to remember and shout it out in chat will get to play.

1903
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:32,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll take the first caller right now on the Skype line.

1904
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:36,352
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1905
02:08:36,392 --> 02:08:43,434
[SPEAKER_07]: The first person to get through will get to play a video game match game against our chat room listener.

1906
02:08:43,994 --> 02:08:47,635
[SPEAKER_07]: who answers first, which is Mako-chan or Joby Deya got the right answer.

[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

1908
02:08:48,656 --> 02:08:49,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Mako-chan.

1909
02:08:49,336 --> 02:08:53,237
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so let me open up a chat window with Mako-chan.

1910
02:08:53,737 --> 02:08:55,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Mako-chan from Makoto.

1911
02:08:55,878 --> 02:08:56,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my bad.

1912
02:08:56,838 --> 02:08:57,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm drunk.

1913
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:00,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I keep thinking of the Mako from Mass Effect.

1914
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1915
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:06,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept calling it Mako because I took too much Japanese.

1916
02:09:07,742 --> 02:09:16,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer was Chicken and Waffles And Jason XV after that, Codeman, Tim TRP, got it What was in the cheese bread?

1917
02:09:16,328 --> 02:09:24,073

[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this?

1921
02:09:29,967 --> 02:09:30,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Raven's Dolphin

1922
02:09:52,310 --> 02:09:53,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally love your icon, by the way.

1923
02:09:54,050 --> 02:09:54,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gorgeous.

1924
02:09:54,671 --> 02:09:56,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

1925
02:09:56,091 --> 02:09:58,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Flattery will get you everywhere, but it won't win you the match game.

1926
02:09:58,932 --> 02:10:00,492
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come over and have murder brownies.

1927
02:10:01,652 --> 02:10:02,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like a murder brownie?

1928
02:10:03,833 --> 02:10:05,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, just send it over the internet, please.

1929
02:10:05,633 --> 02:10:08,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you have to get the match game, but I have to know one question.

1930
02:10:08,614 --> 02:10:09,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, fair enough.

1931
02:10:11,055 --> 02:10:13,295
[SPEAKER_15]: So you've been doing this show for 11 years.

1932
02:10:14,516 --> 02:10:18,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Was there a time that you said, I don't know if I can go on?

1933
02:10:19,457 --> 02:10:19,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1934
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1935
02:10:23,522 --> 02:10:27,927
[SPEAKER_07]: That was episode two.

1936
02:10:28,127 --> 02:10:28,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1937
02:10:28,748 --> 02:10:34,714
[SPEAKER_07]: If I followed through every time I threatened to quit the show, there would have been about 20 Orange Lounge radios by now.

1938
02:10:34,814 --> 02:10:38,678
[SPEAKER_07]: But you find your motivation and you keep going.

1939
02:10:38,758 --> 02:10:41,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the drama tends to work itself out.

1940
02:10:41,561 --> 02:10:42,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And drama is drama.

1941
02:10:43,323 --> 02:10:43,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And drama...

1942
02:10:44,784 --> 02:10:47,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Drama was something I thrived a lot more on when I was in my 20s.

1943
02:10:48,046 --> 02:10:53,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm in my 30s, it's like, I don't know what else I'd have if I didn't have OLR.

1944
02:10:53,868 --> 02:10:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: The sad reality is, the sad reality is this show will end someday.

1945
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it has to.

1946
02:11:00,071 --> 02:11:00,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything comes to an end.

1947
02:11:01,271 --> 02:11:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like to think it's going to end because, you know...

1948
02:11:04,973 --> 02:11:05,474
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1949
02:11:24,173 --> 02:11:27,755
[SPEAKER_07]: or that we all sit down and we agree, you know what?

1950
02:11:27,995 --> 02:11:29,876
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the passion for this we once did.

1951
02:11:30,196 --> 02:11:39,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mentioned on a previous episode, I sometimes worry about where the gaming industry is going when we talk about all this always online and the management thinking they know what's best for gamers.

1952
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:42,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I sometimes sit here and wonder, am I going to be a video game fan?

1953
02:11:43,322 --> 02:11:44,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Orange on Radio 2DX

1954
02:12:04,355 --> 02:12:27,226
[SPEAKER_15]: which Loki still needs to update the freaking thing no it's on a different PSP website oh really yeah it was on like this called like PSP Drive and it was formatted for PSP and you were on there and I remember downloading it this was before the other sites and all that stuff this was before Black Wolf and A1 and I'm like oh Orange Lines Radio I'll download this oh VGN I'll download this and then yeah

1955
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:34,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have to admit, Loki got on that PSP bandwagon really early, and a lot of the PSP community really supported that older website.

1956
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:39,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We were on whatever the AOL blog was for PSP before they all merged into Joystick.

1957
02:12:39,321 --> 02:12:41,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We were featured on there once, and that was really cool.

1958
02:12:42,062 --> 02:12:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So as much as we joke about the PSP and that website and how out of date it is, that community really embraced Loki's little project, so we really appreciate that.

1959
02:12:51,624 --> 02:12:54,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, now it's Stitcher and iTunes.

1960
02:12:54,245 --> 02:12:56,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's all about Stitcher and iTunes.

1961
02:12:56,066 --> 02:13:04,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially Stitcher, I think, is really the wave of the future, especially as iTunes kind of continues to, you know, shove podcasting under the table.

1962
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:06,171
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's for another episode.

1963
02:13:06,231 --> 02:13:07,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to share this.

1964
02:13:07,091 --> 02:13:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, when that happens, convert OLR to food in Disneyland talk.

1965
02:13:10,873 --> 02:13:13,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And so John's like, episode 501, dull whips.

1966
02:13:15,655 --> 02:13:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Ragenator in chat says, I've been a fan of gaming for 32 years.

1967
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:20,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see myself losing my gaming passion.

1968
02:13:21,077 --> 02:13:23,318
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I think ultimately I tend to agree.

1969
02:13:23,499 --> 02:13:29,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I may get really pissed off at some of the decisions that happen in the gaming industry, but at the end of the day, I could always come on here and talk about Commodore 64.

1970
02:13:32,943 --> 02:13:33,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1971
02:13:33,163 --> 02:13:33,803
[SPEAKER_15]: I keep going.

1972
02:13:33,903 --> 02:13:34,503
[SPEAKER_15]: You keep going.

1973
02:13:34,623 --> 02:13:35,784
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready to play match game?

1974
02:13:35,984 --> 02:13:36,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1975
02:13:36,544 --> 02:13:39,125
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to the match game.

1976
02:13:40,246 --> 02:13:40,686
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1977
02:13:40,806 --> 02:13:42,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how the match game works, Raven's Dolphin?

1978
02:13:42,547 --> 02:13:42,767
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1979
02:13:43,382 --> 02:13:44,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, do I know.

1980
02:13:44,808 --> 02:13:48,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, too bad we don't even have Charles Nelson Reilly or that guy from...

1981
02:13:50,185 --> 02:13:51,166
[SPEAKER_15]: from Family Feud.

1982
02:13:51,186 --> 02:13:53,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've got me, Richard Dawson.

1983
02:13:53,227 --> 02:13:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got me.

1984
02:13:54,188 --> 02:13:59,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got on the panel tonight, you've got Techmaster Loki is here joining us on the panel tonight.

1985
02:13:59,572 --> 02:13:59,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1986
02:14:00,233 --> 02:14:01,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura is here.

1987
02:14:01,734 --> 02:14:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1988
02:14:02,354 --> 02:14:03,135

[SPEAKER_07]: Or excuse me, is it Lil' Alan tonight?

1999
02:14:26,223 --> 02:14:27,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Lil' Edie, it's just Alan.

2003
02:14:33,587 --> 02:14:39,590
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to read some statements, and these statements will have a blank at the end of them or near the end of them.

2004
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:48,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to Raven's Dolphin and Mako Chan playing along in our chat room to guess what will be said in that blank by the hosts on the panel.

2005
02:14:49,334 --> 02:14:52,616
[SPEAKER_07]: For every answer they get right, they will get a point.

2006
02:14:53,616 --> 02:15:20,157
[SPEAKER_07]: but like whose line is it anyway the points really don't matter but we'll give our we'll give our winner a little something we'll send you a no prize all right so here we go and Mako Chan if you're sitting there in our chat room uh be sure to send your message your answers over private message to me as I give them to you all right uh so here we go here is question number one tonight Bobby Blackwolf it's the first question it's got to be about Bobby

2008
02:15:29,456 --> 02:15:35,698
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't really seem to care at first, but he really lost it when they came for his blank.

2009
02:15:40,614 --> 02:15:45,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf brought on the ire of 4chan this week by voicing his opinion on Twitter.

2010
02:15:45,556 --> 02:15:51,118

02:15:57,918 --> 02:16:01,379
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I actually did miss the whole 4chan thing.

2013
02:16:01,419 --> 02:16:02,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know.

2014
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,580
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't really that serious.

2015
02:16:06,101 --> 02:16:08,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby had an opinion and some folks disagreed with it.

2016
02:16:08,381 --> 02:16:09,302
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what 4chan's for?

02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2038
02:17:41,119 --> 02:17:42,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and see if we've got any match.

[SPEAKER_07]: Fence.

02:17:48,023 --> 02:17:49,544
[SPEAKER_07]: When they came for his fence.

2044
02:17:50,584 --> 02:17:53,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a match if you've been following the recent drama online.

2045
02:17:53,145 --> 02:17:54,886
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and they came for his fence.

[SPEAKER_07]: That's two for fence.

2049
02:18:02,169 --> 02:18:05,570
[SPEAKER_07]: He really lost it when they came for his... Those damn kids and his fence.

2050
02:18:06,224 --> 02:18:07,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Allen, what did you say when they came for his?

2051
02:18:08,706 --> 02:18:10,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-brony propaganda.

2052
02:18:10,667 --> 02:18:12,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Anti-brony propaganda.

2053
02:18:13,469 --> 02:18:13,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, damn it.

2054
02:18:13,989 --> 02:18:14,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a match.

[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2057
02:18:16,011 --> 02:18:21,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said that he really lost it when they came for his clicky pen.

2058
02:18:21,995 --> 02:18:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Clicky.

2059
02:18:22,835 --> 02:18:23,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Clicky pen.

2060
02:18:24,216 --> 02:18:25,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was clicky the pen.

2061
02:18:25,677 --> 02:18:28,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Also not a match, but it's a clicky pen.

2062
02:18:29,099 --> 02:18:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2063
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,322
[SPEAKER_07]: The score, let's look at the leaderboard right now.

2064
02:18:33,923 --> 02:18:34,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero to zero.

2067
02:18:37,785 --> 02:18:38,945
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's all right, Raven's Dolphin.

2068
02:18:38,965 --> 02:18:41,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make it all up on question number two out of four tonight.

2069
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:42,787
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

2070
02:18:43,327 --> 02:18:45,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Question number two.

2071
02:18:46,889 --> 02:18:55,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Question number two is, the cast of Orange Lounge Radio was really appreciative that Becky baked brownies for their 500th episode.

2072
02:18:57,250 --> 02:19:01,811
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would top this for our 666th show though, said Rob?

2073
02:19:02,731 --> 02:19:06,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki piped up and said, yeah, you should cook the blank.

2074
02:19:08,752 --> 02:19:09,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding.

2075
02:19:10,972 --> 02:19:13,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding, I guess.

2076
02:19:13,813 --> 02:19:15,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Becky baked brownies.

2077
02:19:16,293 --> 02:19:20,674
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would top this for our 666th show though, said Rob?

2078
02:19:21,014 --> 02:19:24,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki piped up and said, yeah, you should cook the blank.

2079
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:27,361
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2080
02:19:28,782 --> 02:19:29,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding.

2081
02:19:29,443 --> 02:19:30,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki said ding.

2082
02:19:30,164 --> 02:19:30,865
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, ding.

2083
02:19:31,265 --> 02:19:31,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, ding.

2084
02:19:32,307 --> 02:19:32,607
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2085
02:19:32,647 --> 02:19:32,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding.

2086
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:33,588
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2087
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:36,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mako's in as well.

2088
02:19:36,312 --> 02:19:37,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven, you got an answer?

2089
02:19:37,834 --> 02:19:38,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

2090
02:19:38,494 --> 02:19:38,855
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2091
02:19:38,975 --> 02:19:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2092
02:19:39,496 --> 02:19:43,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki piped up and said, yeah, you should cook the... Ferret.

2093
02:19:43,941 --> 02:19:45,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Cook the ferret.

2094
02:19:46,264 --> 02:19:51,406
[SPEAKER_07]: and Mako Chan in chat said, you should cook the ferret.

2095
02:19:53,026 --> 02:19:53,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boy.

2096
02:19:53,806 --> 02:19:54,266
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2097
02:19:54,326 --> 02:19:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see what happens.

2098
02:19:56,887 --> 02:20:00,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a tie either way, but let's see how many points this may or may not earn them.

2099
02:20:00,948 --> 02:20:02,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, yeah.

2100
02:20:02,449 --> 02:20:03,049
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you say?

2101
02:20:03,149 --> 02:20:05,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she should cook the... Bacon El Diablo.

2102
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:10,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Bacon El Diablo.

2103
02:20:10,351 --> 02:20:12,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Great answer, but not a match.

2104
02:20:13,492 --> 02:20:13,912
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2105
02:20:14,692 --> 02:20:15,692
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

2106
02:20:15,852 --> 02:20:17,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go for obvious and say The Ferret.

2107
02:20:17,673 --> 02:20:18,313
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ferret.

2108
02:20:18,733 --> 02:20:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

2109
02:20:20,193 --> 02:20:23,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a score on the match game leaderboard.

2110
02:20:23,994 --> 02:20:24,734
[SPEAKER_07]: One to one.

2111
02:20:25,635 --> 02:20:26,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

2112
02:20:26,655 --> 02:20:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more points than people usually get during this.

2113
02:20:29,255 --> 02:20:29,636
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2114
02:20:29,756 --> 02:20:30,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

2115
02:20:30,936 --> 02:20:31,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan.

2116
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:38,174
[SPEAKER_09]: She should cook the... I think this still counts, but my answer was the bungee ferret.

2117
02:20:38,755 --> 02:20:40,056
[SPEAKER_07]: The bungee ferret.

2118
02:20:40,196 --> 02:20:41,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the judges.

2119
02:20:41,517 --> 02:20:42,938
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, the judges will allow it.

2120
02:20:42,998 --> 02:20:45,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Two to two for the ferret.

2121
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:46,921
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and lastly, my answer.

2122
02:20:48,102 --> 02:20:52,766
[SPEAKER_07]: She should cook the... Cylon-occupied Caprica cake.

2123
02:20:54,327 --> 02:20:56,969
[SPEAKER_07]: The Cylon-occupied Caprica cake.

2124
02:20:57,269 --> 02:20:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Old, old joke.

2125
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:59,551
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there it is.

2126
02:21:00,912 --> 02:21:01,533
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-2 though!

2127
02:21:02,935 --> 02:21:05,338
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be the highest score ever in the history of video game action.

2128
02:21:05,358 --> 02:21:07,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our highest score was 3, to be honest.

2129
02:21:07,982 --> 02:21:08,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

2130
02:21:08,622 --> 02:21:09,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 3.

2131
02:21:09,604 --> 02:21:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: There is still two questions to go.

2132
02:21:11,626 --> 02:21:12,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2133
02:21:12,147 --> 02:21:13,589
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two questions.

2134
02:21:13,629 --> 02:21:14,690
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two questions.

2135
02:21:14,710 --> 02:21:15,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch your grammar, drunkie.

2136
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:18,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

2137
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:19,540
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

2138
02:21:20,261 --> 02:21:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a question about Jamie.

2139
02:21:21,462 --> 02:21:21,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2140
02:21:22,723 --> 02:21:23,724
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready, Raven's Dolphin?

2141
02:21:23,764 --> 02:21:24,244
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready for it?

2142
02:21:24,304 --> 02:21:24,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready.

2143
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:25,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready.

2144
02:21:26,185 --> 02:21:33,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie decided to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give up coffee forever.

2145
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Lies!

2146
02:21:34,755 --> 02:21:35,435
[SPEAKER_07]: This is make-believe.

2147
02:21:35,455 --> 02:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2148
02:21:36,536 --> 02:21:40,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie decided to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give up coffee forever.

2149
02:21:40,598 --> 02:21:51,084
[SPEAKER_07]: She came to episode 501 and in a coffee-deprived rage, instantly screamed into the mic, first one to mention blank dies.

2150
02:22:01,644 --> 02:22:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: she came to episode 501 and in a coffee deprived rage instantly screamed into the mic first one to mention blank dies I didn't think of an answer for this one and you wrote it I know right first one to mention ding

2151
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:31,912
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

2152
02:22:32,813 --> 02:22:33,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven, you got an answer?

2153
02:22:34,274 --> 02:22:34,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

2154
02:22:34,954 --> 02:22:35,735
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

2155
02:22:36,456 --> 02:22:38,197
[SPEAKER_07]: She gave up coffee on episode 500.

2156
02:22:38,518 --> 02:22:43,442
[SPEAKER_07]: She came to episode 501 and in a coffee-depraved rage, instantly screamed into the mic.

2157
02:22:43,522 --> 02:22:44,783

[SPEAKER_15]: Double Shot Mochaccino.

2159
02:22:47,485 --> 02:22:49,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Double Shot Mochaccino dies.

2160
02:22:50,007 --> 02:22:50,928
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds amazing.

2161
02:22:50,988 --> 02:22:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I want one.

2162
02:22:52,569 --> 02:22:57,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Mako Chan in our chat room says, first one to mention, Mail Shep dies!

2163
02:22:58,388 --> 02:22:59,048
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, BroShep

2164
02:23:25,578 --> 02:23:27,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Bro Shep, really?

2165
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:30,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, alright, I think we're going to count it.

2166
02:23:30,441 --> 02:23:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly couldn't think of anything else.

2167
02:23:31,962 --> 02:23:34,384
[SPEAKER_07]: MakoCham pulls ahead 3-2.

2168
02:23:35,104 --> 02:23:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Alan, first one to mention?

2169
02:23:38,809 --> 02:23:39,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Mocha Pinkberry.

2170
02:23:40,571 --> 02:23:41,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Mocha Pinkberry.

2171
02:23:41,812 --> 02:23:43,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That was... Why does this not exist?

2172
02:23:43,534 --> 02:23:48,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really close to what Raven said, but I don't think it's close enough, unfortunately.

2173
02:23:48,539 --> 02:23:49,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does this not exist?

2174
02:23:49,961 --> 02:23:50,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2175
02:23:50,902 --> 02:23:52,183
[SPEAKER_07]: You should write Pinkberry.

2176
02:23:53,104 --> 02:23:53,404
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2177
02:23:53,765 --> 02:23:55,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And my answer was, first one to mention...

2178
02:23:59,537 --> 02:24:02,980
[SPEAKER_07]: First one to mention Final Fantasy XI dies.

2179
02:24:04,402 --> 02:24:04,802
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2180
02:24:05,082 --> 02:24:05,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a match.

2181
02:24:06,103 --> 02:24:07,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But one more question.

2182
02:24:07,504 --> 02:24:08,305
[SPEAKER_07]: One more question.

2183
02:24:08,505 --> 02:24:09,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So close.

2184
02:24:09,246 --> 02:24:09,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So close.

2185
02:24:09,686 --> 02:24:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Ravenstolphin, you can do it.

2186
02:24:11,388 --> 02:24:12,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I have faith in you.

2187
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:14,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I have faith in you.

2188
02:24:14,771 --> 02:24:15,111
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2189
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:16,132
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about the chatter?

2190
02:24:16,933 --> 02:24:17,173
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2191
02:24:17,213 --> 02:24:17,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2192
02:24:19,696 --> 02:24:20,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Question number four.

2193
02:24:21,057 --> 02:24:21,758
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one.

2194
02:24:21,818 --> 02:24:23,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Ravenstolphin, your only hope.

2195
02:24:24,917 --> 02:24:50,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki was very happy with the poster that Codeman drew to celebrate episode 500 of the show upon careful examination of the poster though he exclaimed Rob I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of blank Rob I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of blank

2196
02:24:54,673 --> 02:24:55,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding.

2197
02:24:55,413 --> 02:24:55,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

2198
02:24:55,833 --> 02:24:56,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding.

2199
02:24:56,574 --> 02:24:58,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that was really quick on all the hosts.

2200
02:24:59,015 --> 02:25:06,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still waiting on Mako-chan to ping in there in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com where some people are going to feed the answers right now.

2201
02:25:07,257 --> 02:25:15,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, very happy with the poster the codeman drew, but on careful examination of the poster, exclaimed, Rob, I'm surprised he didn't just draw you as a fan of blank.

2202
02:25:16,841 --> 02:25:18,421
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Mako-chan's got an answer.

2203
02:25:18,461 --> 02:25:19,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven's Dolphin you about good to go?

2204
02:25:20,558 --> 02:25:21,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got one.

2205
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:22,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then here we go.

2206
02:25:23,462 --> 02:25:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of...

2207
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:30,700
[SPEAKER_15]: DDDR 4th Mix.

2208
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:32,821
[SPEAKER_07]: DDDR 4th Mix!

2209
02:25:32,961 --> 02:25:33,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Good answer.

2210
02:25:34,201 --> 02:25:35,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a fan of DDDR 4th.

2211
02:25:36,021 --> 02:25:39,082
[SPEAKER_07]: 4th Plus, to be specific, but we'd let that slide.

2212
02:25:39,842 --> 02:25:46,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Mako Chan in our chatroom says, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of Rocky Horror.

2213
02:25:47,944 --> 02:25:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good answer.

2214
02:25:49,744 --> 02:25:51,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go around and see if there's a match.

2215
02:25:52,265 --> 02:25:52,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

2216
02:25:53,624 --> 02:25:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of?

2217
02:25:56,706 --> 02:25:57,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Nino Cooney's ending.

2218
02:25:58,087 --> 02:25:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Nino Cooney's ending!

2219
02:26:00,029 --> 02:26:00,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

2220
02:26:02,911 --> 02:26:03,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2221
02:26:04,291 --> 02:26:05,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a match, I'm sorry to say.

2222
02:26:06,473 --> 02:26:10,836
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of?

2223
02:26:11,036 --> 02:26:13,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Parapara Paradise Complete in Kogal outfit.

2224
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:14,979
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2225
02:26:16,202 --> 02:26:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be such a cute getter.

2226
02:26:17,282 --> 02:26:24,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You almost named the right Bomani game to match with Raven's Dolphin, but unfortunately, nope, not going to do it.

2227
02:26:24,944 --> 02:26:27,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you what came with this, is watching you play the damn ABBA game.

2228
02:26:30,266 --> 02:26:30,626
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2229
02:26:31,226 --> 02:26:36,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan, Alan, and not as a fan of Miss Nude World 96.

2230
02:26:38,041 --> 02:26:39,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss Nude World 96.

2231
02:26:39,282 --> 02:26:41,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, I should have said that.

2232
02:26:42,425 --> 02:26:43,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, classic.

2233
02:26:43,946 --> 02:26:44,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic answer.

2234
02:26:46,028 --> 02:26:51,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of... Hey, I can be self-deprecating here.

2235
02:26:52,093 --> 02:26:56,437
[SPEAKER_07]: My answer was, not as a fan of... Surprise butt sex!

2236
02:26:59,073 --> 02:27:00,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, ladies and gentlemen!

2237
02:27:24,824 --> 02:27:25,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2238
02:27:25,284 --> 02:27:26,205
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for playing.

2239
02:27:26,505 --> 02:27:27,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You lose.

2240
02:27:27,446 --> 02:27:28,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Good day, sir.

2241
02:27:29,347 --> 02:27:29,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

2242
02:27:29,987 --> 02:27:30,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We still love you.

2243
02:27:30,708 --> 02:27:31,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2244
02:27:31,328 --> 02:27:32,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for playing Raven's Dolphin.

2245
02:27:32,749 --> 02:27:33,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy your nothing.

2246
02:27:40,874 --> 02:27:42,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you need to drink more often.

2247
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:44,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2248
02:27:44,899 --> 02:27:48,724
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a requisite two double shots.

2249
02:27:48,924 --> 02:27:55,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I am actually under straight orders from my doctor not to drink, and I'm being a very naughty boy tonight, but what can you do?

2250
02:27:55,853 --> 02:27:56,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we get out the paddle?

2251
02:27:58,115 --> 02:27:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did a second shot.

2252
02:28:01,836 --> 02:28:03,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're double shots, but hey, who cares?

2253
02:28:05,278 --> 02:28:06,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You only live once, right, Rob?

2254
02:28:06,759 --> 02:28:07,359
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2255
02:28:07,459 --> 02:28:10,080
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you for playing along with Match Game tonight, everybody.

2256
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,821
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope you had fun.

2257
02:28:11,521 --> 02:28:11,841
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2258
02:28:13,182 --> 02:28:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mako-chan, what do we give Mako-chan for winning tonight?

2259
02:28:16,704 --> 02:28:17,164
[SPEAKER_07]: My love.

2260
02:28:17,824 --> 02:28:27,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Mako-chan, if you have something you want to plug, I have a feeling I know what it might be, but send me a private message and you can get a free plug for your Twitter, for your podcast, whatever you want.

2261
02:28:27,089 --> 02:28:27,829
[SPEAKER_03]: But not a butt plug.

2262
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: No, definitely not that.

2263
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:31,951
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see.

2264
02:28:32,451 --> 02:28:33,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, it's time for the mailbag.

2265
02:28:34,313 --> 02:28:35,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, crap.

2266
02:28:36,114 --> 02:28:43,819
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is always excited to get into the mailbag and read some emails that you guys send to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2267
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:47,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So, DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind jumping into the email bag there.

2268
02:28:48,322 --> 02:28:51,684
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get a lot of spam that arrived after the real email.

2269
02:28:51,804 --> 02:28:52,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hooray.

2270
02:28:52,645 --> 02:28:53,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I deleted it.

2271
02:28:53,185 --> 02:28:55,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't delete it, but we need to delete a lot of old email.

2272
02:28:56,387 --> 02:28:56,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2273
02:28:57,853 --> 02:28:58,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready?

2274
02:28:58,575 --> 02:28:59,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Shall I do this?

2275
02:28:59,297 --> 02:28:59,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, yep.

2276
02:29:00,339 --> 02:29:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR.

2277
02:29:01,703 --> 02:29:05,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thought I'd write in and respond to that email about the graphic violence in Bioshock Infinite.

2278
02:29:06,154 --> 02:29:06,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

2279
02:29:07,975 --> 02:29:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Not spoiling any major plot points here, but Booker's history is full of violence.

2280
02:29:12,518 --> 02:29:18,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a major part of his character that he has done many terrible things in the past and has a very violent history.

2281
02:29:18,942 --> 02:29:25,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you perform one of those brutal finishing moves with your skyhook, Elizabeth will always audibly shudder at the act.

2282
02:29:25,687 --> 02:29:32,011
[SPEAKER_03]: As you get deeper in the game, Elizabeth questions the need for so much violence from both sides of the conflict and wonders if it's really helping anybody.

2283
02:29:32,672 --> 02:29:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: In that way, I think it's the approach to graphic violence is done in a way that serves the story and the characters.

2284
02:29:38,415 --> 02:30:04,151
[SPEAKER_03]: now there is some gratuitous stuff in there but I'm a little tired of the comparisons to Call of Duty or that these were changes that made to these changes were made to appeal to that audience I played a couple of Call of Duty games and the violence though not the plot always seemed to ride closer to the side of realistic and not hyper real as it is in the Bioshock games including Infinite where you can electrocute someone to stun them then blast their entire head off dude I need to play that

2285
02:30:04,963 --> 02:30:07,086
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do that in Bioshock Infinite, too.

2286
02:30:07,126 --> 02:30:11,551
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what he's talking about, Bioshock Infinite?

2287
02:30:11,591 --> 02:30:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's awesome.

2288
02:30:13,673 --> 02:30:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2289
02:30:14,574 --> 02:30:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Call of Duty games I played, I don't remember any heads popping off like corks, but I did only play single player mode, so who knows?

2290
02:30:21,923 --> 02:30:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is Bioshock games have always been violent and they've always been first person shooters so I don't think the game had to compromise anything for sales or to appeal to a certain crowd and in fact would only have been compromising if it toned itself down.

2291
02:30:35,791 --> 02:30:37,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all that was on my mind.

2292
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:43,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats on an amazing 500 episodes even if you guys don't think it's such a big deal anymore.

2293
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:45,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually really is.

2294
02:30:45,838 --> 02:30:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad I've been listening for the last 200 or so.

2295
02:30:49,019 --> 02:30:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Flaco Jones.

2296
02:30:50,834 --> 02:30:54,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care if you've been listening since episode one or if this is your very first episode.

2297
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:57,383
[SPEAKER_07]: We say welcome aboard and thanks for being a part of the family.

2298
02:30:57,843 --> 02:30:59,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're totally awesome.

2299
02:31:03,334 --> 02:31:03,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2300
02:31:03,995 --> 02:31:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

2301
02:31:04,876 --> 02:31:05,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.

2302
02:31:05,557 --> 02:31:08,460
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, congratulations on your 500th episode.

2303
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:11,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's amazing that you've been going for over 10 years.

2304
02:31:12,044 --> 02:31:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an unshakable love of video games and a cast iron army of dedicated fans, too.

2305
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:18,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you guys are made of cast iron?

2306
02:31:19,011 --> 02:31:19,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.

2307
02:31:20,893 --> 02:31:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2308
02:31:22,074 --> 02:31:22,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's something.

2309
02:31:22,855 --> 02:31:23,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I can fry in you.

2310
02:31:24,617 --> 02:31:25,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you fry us an egg?

2311
02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:29,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you get really hot on warm days.

2312
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:31,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's something that may interest you.

2313
02:31:32,301 --> 02:31:35,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember me talking about Project Possum a while ago?

2314
02:31:36,264 --> 02:31:42,888
[SPEAKER_03]: When the Inside Xbox UK team were given the sack, they went off on Kickstarter to start their own show about video games.

2315
02:31:43,308 --> 02:31:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they finished the pilot and it's not what you'd call your average video game show.

2316
02:31:47,550 --> 02:31:50,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Thank You For Playing and you can find it at thankyouforplaying.com.

2317
02:31:51,093 --> 02:31:52,734
[SPEAKER_03]: There are dashes in between each word.

2318
02:31:53,614 --> 02:32:02,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's structured much like a game, letting you view the features in order that you want and has unlockables in the form of extra goodies and editorials, expanding on the themes touched in the videos.

2319
02:32:03,841 --> 02:32:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: The plot's all about multiplayer and I really recommend you take a look.

2320
02:32:06,903 --> 02:32:10,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was really interesting and hope to see a lot more from them soon.

2321
02:32:11,205 --> 02:32:16,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I hope to keep hearing from you guys for many years to come, take care and once again, congratulations, Picaruno.

2322
02:32:18,325 --> 02:32:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your support.

2323
02:32:21,308 --> 02:32:23,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

2324
02:32:25,231 --> 02:32:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that's my favorite line from Grease.

2325
02:32:27,233 --> 02:32:27,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2326
02:32:27,773 --> 02:32:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an OLR PSA from Catastrophic Magi.

2327
02:32:31,456 --> 02:32:33,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's my friend Magi who I chat with every day on Steam.

2328
02:32:34,499 --> 02:32:34,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys.

2329
02:32:34,999 --> 02:32:39,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I think after 500 episodes, we can give the whole Loki in a tingle costume thing a rest.

2330
02:32:40,364 --> 02:32:41,125
[SPEAKER_07]: He might like that.

2331
02:32:42,166 --> 02:32:45,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, for the next 500, we need to get Loki in a kitty costume.

2332
02:32:49,196 --> 02:32:52,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to say Meowth, that's right!

2333
02:32:52,342 --> 02:32:54,787
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it has to be a kitty in costume.

2334
02:32:56,255 --> 02:32:57,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he'd do that.

2335
02:32:57,176 --> 02:32:58,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That's worse than Dingle.

2336
02:32:58,537 --> 02:33:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent an image to you, but it didn't embed.

2337
02:33:01,519 --> 02:33:01,899
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

2338
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:05,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have left an audio message, but Rob is a meanie.

2339
02:33:05,562 --> 02:33:10,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I stayed up late enough, I wouldn't be able to Skype after the disaster that was last time.

2340
02:33:10,546 --> 02:33:12,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you don't get any congratulations from Moggy.

2341
02:33:15,390 --> 02:33:17,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Send an MP3.

2342
02:33:17,691 --> 02:33:18,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Send an MP3.

2343
02:33:18,272 --> 02:33:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you talk to me on Steam.

2344
02:33:20,654 --> 02:33:22,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Just attach me a file or something.

2345
02:33:25,945 --> 02:33:32,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello is the one and only often imitated never duplicated DDR dollar bill I just wanted to write and congratulate you guys on your 500th episode

2346
02:33:47,208 --> 02:33:47,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

2347
02:34:09,463 --> 02:34:10,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone can podcast.

2348
02:34:10,864 --> 02:34:17,530
[SPEAKER_03]: True, we all wish to be heard, but it takes something special to keep going for a long time and not just make it into a small hobby that you grow out of.

2349
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a labor of love, one that the OL Army slash family have grown to be a part of, whether they hang around, come back once in a while when they can, or just move on.

2350
02:34:27,097 --> 02:34:31,322
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, I'd just like to take a moment to say why I do recommend your show to other listeners.

2351
02:34:32,183 --> 02:34:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: One, the host.

2352
02:34:33,124 --> 02:34:33,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, thank you.

2353
02:34:34,345 --> 02:34:41,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Every show you have three amazing, entertaining, intelligent, yet human hosts who talk about gaming that can appeal to the hardcore fans as well as the casuals.

2354
02:34:41,572 --> 02:34:43,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to let you know, I'm really from another planet.

2355
02:34:44,535 --> 02:34:44,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a month.

2356
02:34:47,037 --> 02:35:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: they are people who actually do game as part of their lives not game because it's their job to they talk about gaming like fans who talk about sports or comics or sci-fi with that casual yet knowledgeable flair and when they speak about gaming news they do it on a dual level of professionalism that gives a great analysis and yet keeps it simple and fun

2357
02:35:06,341 --> 02:35:08,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I say something really quick about the sponsor thing?

2358
02:35:08,623 --> 02:35:11,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have a lot of friend podcasters that do do the sponsor thing.

2359
02:35:11,944 --> 02:35:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've even, you know, we have had donations before in the past and so forth.

2360
02:35:15,586 --> 02:35:23,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to say, like, there's nothing wrong with podcasters who want to get sponsors because contrary to popular belief, this shit ain't free for us to do.

2361
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:25,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It is costing us money to do.

2362
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:27,411
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's, you know, it's okay.

2363
02:35:27,531 --> 02:35:29,732
[SPEAKER_07]: We pay the money because it's our hobby.

2364
02:35:29,853 --> 02:35:30,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know...

2365
02:35:31,113 --> 02:35:36,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the tax you pay to your club, your dues or whatever.

2366
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:38,662
[SPEAKER_07]: For us, that's fine.

2367
02:35:39,122 --> 02:35:47,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have no problem with people that want to get sponsors to offset the cost of hosting, offset the cost of producing the show and so forth.

2368
02:35:48,092 --> 02:35:52,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do start to get into a problem when – and I can think of particular –

2369
02:35:52,977 --> 02:36:21,979
[SPEAKER_07]: individual podcast things that have gone up saying we need $30,000 to do this podcast this one podcast because we're going to rent a studio and we have to travel to conventions and this and this and this and I'm sorry but if they can get it and the listeners support them enough that's great I guess but I'm just kind of like you ain't fooling anybody I can tell you how much it costs to do a podcast and it's not as much as you're telling people it is

2370
02:36:23,466 --> 02:36:26,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've had generous donations in the past.

2371
02:36:26,728 --> 02:36:29,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like what Kristen did.

2372
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:32,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we would not have new equipment if not for her.

2373
02:36:32,912 --> 02:36:39,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want to be clear because I have several peer podcasters that do raise money through sponsors and so forth.

2374
02:36:39,757 --> 02:36:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the ads on the site.

2375
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:52,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been super effing lucky that our website has been donated very generously for many years or else we would probably have to turn to that too because that could get very expensive.

2376
02:36:54,046 --> 02:36:58,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to clear the air and make sure that's understood.

2377
02:36:59,392 --> 02:37:12,857
[SPEAKER_03]: so and I've sat up for I mean just on my own hours working on graphics and stuff for not just for Orange Niles but for VOG in general you know we've all put a lot of time and effort into this

2378
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:14,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're not doing ads for the man grate.

2379
02:37:34,019 --> 02:37:34,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2380
02:37:34,921 --> 02:37:35,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2381
02:37:35,702 --> 02:37:41,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, you know, my overwhelming love for Greg Proops.

2382
02:37:41,513 --> 02:37:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2383
02:37:41,893 --> 02:37:43,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do laugh every time he does the ad for The Man Great.

2384
02:37:43,997 --> 02:37:45,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I apologize to interrupt the email.

2385
02:37:46,533 --> 02:37:46,913
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.

2386
02:37:46,573 --> 02:37:46,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The show.

2387
02:37:47,213 --> 02:37:52,036
[SPEAKER_03]: This show, while keeping the basic format, always finds a way to grow and yet never loses its focus.

2388
02:37:52,436 --> 02:38:04,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they go off on tangents such as Pinkberry, trips to Disneyland, and other aspects of their daily lives, but I find that to be the greatest asset because you, the listener, participate in the show in any fashion.

2389
02:38:04,584 --> 02:38:07,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so laid back and friendly that you do not feel they are corporate shills.

2390
02:38:08,386 --> 02:38:32,357
[SPEAKER_03]: if you are right or wrong you can discuss this openly and even when it gets heated it's still more personal than some shows where the sense of keeping it professional loses that intimacy that's required for some difficult and passionate topics also each segment does include something for the listener whether it's mailbag to submit your letters and I actually do enjoy reading the email just throw on a hissy fit just for fun skyplanes to call in even when

2391
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: even if just wish to get on and say what's up the classic game of the week my favorite part why thank you we used to do the website of the week there's website of the week and the advice DarkSakura's advice column yeah I could still give advice like I don't know pay your hose or you might get cut there's DarkSakura's advice

2392
02:39:01,127 --> 02:39:03,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it never bet with a Sicilian when death is on the line?

2393
02:39:04,931 --> 02:39:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Finish the email.

2394
02:39:05,872 --> 02:39:06,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2395
02:39:07,674 --> 02:39:08,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Google question of the week.

2396
02:39:09,095 --> 02:39:14,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always welcoming listener input, which leads into... The audience.

2397
02:39:15,322 --> 02:39:15,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That was number three.

2398
02:39:16,463 --> 02:39:17,704
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2399
02:39:38,502 --> 02:39:41,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if this went on a bit more, but it was just something to note.

2400
02:39:41,604 --> 02:39:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's to another 500 episodes.

2401
02:39:43,185 --> 02:39:45,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how the future of gaming would look in another 11 years.

2402
02:39:45,686 --> 02:39:46,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in and find out.

2403
02:39:46,947 --> 02:39:47,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Wink.

2404
02:39:48,608 --> 02:39:49,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was sweet.

2405
02:39:49,629 --> 02:39:50,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very nice email.

2406
02:39:50,549 --> 02:39:52,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a quick sweep.

2407
02:39:52,891 --> 02:39:53,311
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

2408
02:39:53,371 --> 02:39:53,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

2409
02:39:53,791 --> 02:39:55,952
[SPEAKER_07]: The audience is the best part.

2410
02:39:57,153 --> 02:39:57,794
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you guys.

2411
02:39:58,774 --> 02:39:59,274
[SPEAKER_03]: For dinner.

2412
02:39:59,735 --> 02:40:00,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which.

2413
02:40:01,216 --> 02:40:01,876
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

2414
02:40:02,016 --> 02:40:05,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And BlackWolfInChat actually follows up with that.

2415
02:40:05,398 --> 02:40:06,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have anybody banned.

2416
02:40:08,488 --> 02:40:11,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I've smacked a few people around with a giant trout.

2417
02:40:28,134 --> 02:40:34,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, speaking of audience, Mako-chan has her plug ready to go that she won for Match Game.

2418
02:40:34,437 --> 02:40:35,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I even have to mention this?

2419
02:40:36,198 --> 02:40:37,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow knew it would be this.

2420
02:40:37,978 --> 02:40:40,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Anime Jam Session on Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2421
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: 9.30 p.m.

2422
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern is when the pre-show starts.

2423
02:40:43,861 --> 02:40:46,302
[SPEAKER_07]: At 9.15, excuse me, is the pre-show at 9.15.

2424
02:40:46,342 --> 02:40:47,322
[SPEAKER_07]: 9.30 is the show.

2425
02:40:48,142 --> 02:40:50,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Mako-chan gets to choose the pre-show music this week.

2426
02:40:50,884 --> 02:40:51,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

2427
02:40:51,924 --> 02:40:52,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And happy 500th.

2428
02:40:53,164 --> 02:40:54,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, listen to Anime Jam Session.

2429
02:40:54,305 --> 02:40:54,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good time.

2430
02:40:55,265 --> 02:40:56,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally a good time.

2431
02:40:57,441 --> 02:41:02,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back and watch some classic anime, dude.

2432
02:41:02,403 --> 02:41:02,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Get to the roots of it.

2433
02:41:02,964 --> 02:41:04,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Go watch some Yamato or some Gatchaman.

2434
02:41:27,977 --> 02:41:54,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Go 80s style and watch Bubblegum Crisis Let's do the FUs of the Week And Minecraft Server FUs of the Week time Yeah, we did ban a song on the show

2435
02:41:54,946 --> 02:41:56,247
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, and we banned a website.

2436
02:41:56,267 --> 02:41:57,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We banned solitary.

2437
02:41:57,428 --> 02:41:58,909
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your FU, please.

2438
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to the hobag who was driving behind me in the Mercedes trying to do her makeup while tailgating me.

2439
02:42:08,277 --> 02:42:15,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been incredibly hilarious if I had brake-checked you and you completely ruined the back end of my car so that I get a new car and you have to pay for it.

2440
02:42:16,284 --> 02:42:16,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

2441
02:42:18,165 --> 02:42:21,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do your makeup while you drive and get off your damn phone and pull up your pants.

2442
02:42:23,508 --> 02:42:24,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, any FUs?

2443
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:52,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess an FU to the driver that I encountered last week when I was leaving the show about to enter onto the freeway when I had a guy pass me on the right in the actually off the road pass me on the right and then cut across into the next lane to not go on the freeway I don't even know why he was doing that it's just stupid, he could have just gone to the left and changed lanes but no, he had to pass me at the same time too for no reason

2444
02:42:52,731 --> 02:42:54,092
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, what else?

2445
02:42:54,293 --> 02:43:03,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and to my co-workers for not wanting to play games during lunch because they will flake on me unless we get all four people to play, including myself.

2446
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:08,005
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of times we can't do that because my boss will be gone or something.

2447
02:43:08,705 --> 02:43:11,928
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't want to play games with just me because I kick their ass.

2448
02:43:13,069 --> 02:43:14,050
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're so humble about it.

2449
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:15,331
[SPEAKER_21]: So FU to being good?

2450
02:43:15,952 --> 02:43:17,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm just too good for them, unfortunately.

2451
02:43:19,745 --> 02:43:21,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my F.U.

2452
02:43:21,066 --> 02:43:24,588
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week goes to car repairs and the bills that go with them.

2453
02:43:25,089 --> 02:43:26,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, robbery!

2454
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:28,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So much money.

2455
02:43:28,931 --> 02:43:30,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And everything breaks at once.

2456
02:43:30,793 --> 02:43:31,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Not okay.

2457
02:43:33,134 --> 02:43:33,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We all gave F.U.

2458
02:43:33,935 --> 02:43:34,995
[SPEAKER_07]: to traffic related things.

2459
02:43:35,075 --> 02:43:36,917
[SPEAKER_07]: How appropriate for our 500th episode.

2460
02:43:37,097 --> 02:43:39,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We always freaking complain about drivers.

2461
02:43:40,359 --> 02:43:40,799
[SPEAKER_03]: The hell.

2462
02:43:41,119 --> 02:43:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Becky, you wanna throw out an F.U.

2463
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:43,421
[SPEAKER_07]: to cars too while you're at it?

2464
02:43:45,122 --> 02:43:45,883
[SPEAKER_03]: You can throw out an F.U.

2465
02:43:45,903 --> 02:43:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: to Power Rangers.

2466
02:43:46,643 --> 02:43:47,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2467
02:43:49,585 --> 02:43:51,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Shane might take issue to this F.U.

2468
02:43:52,047 --> 02:44:08,037
[SPEAKER_20]: to Power Rangers Megaforce which my son wants to watch constantly and my brains are dribbling out my ears it is horrifying the acting makes me want to strangle my own brain by the way Megaforce is getting a brand new 3DS game coming this year

2469
02:44:09,708 --> 02:44:12,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, Shane will be offended by that, and that makes me happy.

2470
02:44:13,749 --> 02:44:17,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I do still want to watch the Japanese version because I do like the Sentai series.

2471
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:22,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane in chat is like, why F you to Power Rangers?

2472
02:44:22,852 --> 02:44:24,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's a mom.

2473
02:44:25,153 --> 02:44:27,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And little boys watch Power Rangers, Shane.

2474
02:44:27,796 --> 02:44:28,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Not 30 year olds.

2475
02:44:28,356 --> 02:44:30,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But Shane said that Megaforce is pretty bad.

2476
02:44:30,999 --> 02:44:34,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I wish I was still a 30 year old.

2477
02:44:35,423 --> 02:44:41,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the Power Rangers fan of chat is saying it's bad, then you are fully justified.

2478
02:44:42,131 --> 02:44:43,613
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2479
02:44:43,873 --> 02:44:51,220
[SPEAKER_07]: All kidding aside, we got a couple more stories for you guys quickly, and then we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2480
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,823
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be a few of you that want to call in tonight, so we'll get to that shortly.

2481
02:44:53,863 --> 02:44:54,864
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, a couple quick stories.

2482
02:44:54,924 --> 02:44:55,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

2483
02:44:55,625 --> 02:44:55,945
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2484
02:44:56,005 --> 02:45:04,934
[SPEAKER_14]: So Nintendo totally figuring out ways to revitalize the Wii U. Not sure if this is going to be one of those ways, but they have a new patent.

2485
02:45:05,715 --> 02:45:11,217
[SPEAKER_14]: A patent that allows them to use the Wii Remote to remotely control mobile devices.

2486
02:45:12,318 --> 02:45:13,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a robot.

2487
02:45:13,859 --> 02:45:14,979
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what they have in the picture.

2488
02:45:15,039 --> 02:45:18,381
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a robot with a Wii Remote in it.

2489
02:45:19,441 --> 02:45:20,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob 2.0?

2490
02:45:21,462 --> 02:45:24,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Or as the joke I made on Facebook, Rob you?

2491
02:45:26,964 --> 02:45:27,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will!

2492
02:45:29,601 --> 02:45:31,282
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell would a Rob 2.0 do?

2493
02:45:31,322 --> 02:45:34,463
[SPEAKER_07]: The first Rob was a really niche, stupid thing.

2494
02:45:34,483 --> 02:45:36,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It just played Gyromite, right?

2495
02:45:36,344 --> 02:45:36,984
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one other.

2496
02:45:37,164 --> 02:45:37,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Stack'em?

2497
02:45:37,764 --> 02:45:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Stack'em.

2498
02:45:38,364 --> 02:45:38,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2499
02:45:39,405 --> 02:45:47,228
[SPEAKER_14]: It would run up to people that are playing the Wii games, not standing up, because you're supposed to be active, and punch you in the balls.

2500
02:45:47,288 --> 02:45:48,028
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it would do.

2501
02:45:48,788 --> 02:45:49,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Get off your couch.

2502
02:45:50,069 --> 02:45:50,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom!

2503
02:45:50,429 --> 02:45:50,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom!

2504
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:53,911
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2505
02:46:10,749 --> 02:46:14,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Swapnote has a new version that's available now.

2506
02:46:14,310 --> 02:46:16,831
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go get that right there in the little e-shop.

2507
02:46:17,191 --> 02:46:21,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the free update, and there's a note that you should have got reminding you of that.

2508
02:46:21,392 --> 02:46:24,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I've added some new OLR listeners recently, and I gotta say, it's like a Swapnote resurgence.

2509
02:46:25,453 --> 02:46:27,094
[SPEAKER_07]: My little blue light is on almost every day.

2510
02:46:27,134 --> 02:46:27,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

2511
02:46:28,214 --> 02:46:35,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the new features, you can now use a different color on each page of a message, so you don't just have to use black anymore.

2512
02:46:36,056 --> 02:47:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: you can do photos and audio while you write you don't have to import them from the SD card you can filter notes by who sent them if you want to find a note from somebody you can delete multiple notes at once you can see how many replies a note has received and you can slide the circle pad left to slow down writing and drawing animations from notes or use circle pad right to speed it up so it's like a speed up slow down

2513
02:47:03,519 --> 02:47:04,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So very cool.

2514
02:47:04,859 --> 02:47:11,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically trying to modernize Swapnote a little bit with some functionality that you kind of go, wow, that wasn't there before?

2515
02:47:12,201 --> 02:47:12,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

2516
02:47:12,841 --> 02:47:13,521
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's there now.

2517
02:47:14,942 --> 02:47:15,402
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2518
02:47:15,462 --> 02:47:18,402
[SPEAKER_07]: That brings us to the Skype line.

2519
02:47:18,422 --> 02:47:19,443
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2520
02:47:19,523 --> 02:47:21,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2521
02:47:21,323 --> 02:47:29,425
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call on this, our 500th episode to talk about whatever, we will take a few calls until we decide it's time to end the show or the calls stop coming in.

2522
02:47:29,445 --> 02:47:30,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we run out of brownies.

2523
02:47:31,229 --> 02:47:32,329
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Code Man

2524
02:48:02,019 --> 02:48:04,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We are loving these posters you made, just so you know.

2525
02:48:05,541 --> 02:48:07,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no problem, man.

2526
02:48:07,483 --> 02:48:11,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope I captured Orange Lounge Radio as much as I could.

2527
02:48:11,646 --> 02:48:11,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2528
02:48:13,187 --> 02:48:15,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to ask, is the little kitten on the bottom, is that Midna?

2529
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:19,152
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be Midna, or it could be Shermie.

2530
02:48:20,433 --> 02:48:21,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to kind of...

2531
02:48:22,344 --> 02:48:24,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I was gonna say, because it looks kind of like Midna.

2532
02:48:44,861 --> 02:48:47,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a JPEG that you can forward me of this?

2533
02:48:47,682 --> 02:48:50,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think DarkSakura, do we talk about the album art thing?

2534
02:48:51,003 --> 02:48:51,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2535
02:48:51,404 --> 02:48:51,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that going to happen?

2536
02:48:52,484 --> 02:48:52,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2537
02:48:53,304 --> 02:48:55,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome!

2538
02:48:55,105 --> 02:48:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, the listeners can know what we're talking about because it's going to be the new album art to the show and it's fantastic.

2539
02:49:00,207 --> 02:49:03,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for, I got your message from Dropbox.

2540
02:49:03,288 --> 02:49:03,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2541
02:49:03,768 --> 02:49:05,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be printing out a copy for my wall.

2542
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:15,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and you can actually, if Loki wants a JPEG, you can probably just switch that over to a JPEG and then just send it to him.

2543
02:49:15,246 --> 02:49:16,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like just the full 300 DPI PSD?

2544
02:49:19,031 --> 02:49:21,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a PDF.

2545
02:49:21,412 --> 02:49:22,212
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 18 by 24.

2546
02:49:22,912 --> 02:49:26,173
[SPEAKER_13]: You can open it up in Illustrator because I did it all in Illustrator.

2547
02:49:27,714 --> 02:49:30,375
[SPEAKER_13]: And you should be able to just export it as a JPEG.

2548
02:49:32,175 --> 02:49:33,115
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you nerds.

2549
02:49:33,155 --> 02:49:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about video games.

2550
02:49:35,016 --> 02:49:36,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to resize it for the frame I have.

2551
02:49:37,117 --> 02:49:37,397
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2552
02:49:38,237 --> 02:49:41,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Codeman, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?

2553
02:49:41,741 --> 02:49:45,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to just call in and congratulate you guys on 500 shows, basically.

2554
02:49:46,664 --> 02:49:56,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I started listening kind of at the end of my high school, my senior year of high school, all the way through college up until now.

2555
02:49:56,669 --> 02:49:58,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Christ, how old are you now?

2556
02:49:59,051 --> 02:50:02,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I am 27, I'll be 28 in September.

2557
02:50:02,493 --> 02:50:04,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god!

2558
02:50:04,934 --> 02:50:10,257
[SPEAKER_03]: You realize I'm going to be 37 on next Friday, right?

2559
02:50:10,357 --> 02:50:16,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just, you know, and like I said in the chat room earlier, I said if this show ever dies, a piece of my heart will die.

2560
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Because...

2561
02:50:18,201 --> 02:50:26,863
[SPEAKER_13]: This show has been like, I think a lot of the listeners has gotten me through a lot of hard times in past issues in my life and stuff like that.

2562
02:50:27,263 --> 02:50:36,805
[SPEAKER_13]: And just sitting down and when I'm at work and I'm listening to you guys, it brings a positivity to my day that I didn't have before.

2563
02:50:36,905 --> 02:50:39,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's one of the reasons why I called.

2564
02:50:39,065 --> 02:50:43,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to tell you guys that you have done so many good things to a lot of people

2565
02:50:44,406 --> 02:51:02,158
[SPEAKER_13]: that are out there listening to you every Sunday or on the podcast feed throughout the week and I know that every time somebody listens to you guys there is a positive, jokingly feeling of like they're in the same room as you guys and we're just all friends and that's amazing.

2566
02:51:02,338 --> 02:51:03,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make me cry, Code Man.

2567
02:51:03,539 --> 02:51:04,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it.

2568
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:05,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it.

2569
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:18,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to tell you, too, that just in the fact that we've been talking, what, over the last month's worth of shows, it's really nice to have a colleague who listens to, you know.

2570
02:51:18,665 --> 02:51:26,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been really cool chatting with you and, you know, sort of exchanging, you know, not just the video game stuff, but having the design thing in common, too.

2571
02:51:27,119 --> 02:51:54,044
[SPEAKER_07]: well and and Codeman let me say this and I'm sure it it goes for DarkSakura and Loki as well because I know we've had we've all had these very difficult shows this show has helped us get through a lot of hard times as well like you know I'll talk about myself since I have the mic right now but you know a few years ago I had a near-death experience and that was very um you know very humbling in a way and and uh there's a lot of jokes about I don't want to turn 30

2572
02:51:54,264 --> 02:51:54,884
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2573
02:52:21,053 --> 02:52:43,536
[SPEAKER_13]: so yes but no that's that's basically what I called in I mean as far as video games go I mean I've ever I'm still struggling through Tomb Raider I I don't know Rob you've been playing it too I think and I don't know I just I haven't gotten to pick it up again when are we playing the very average multiplayer that I I shouldn't raz it because I haven't tried it yet but when are we gonna give it a try

2574
02:52:44,684 --> 02:52:49,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2575
02:52:49,409 --> 02:52:54,213
[SPEAKER_13]: All kinds of video games out right now that are just eating me up.

2576
02:52:54,493 --> 02:52:57,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I mentioned before, I have a daughter, so most of the time I don't even get to play video games.

2577
02:52:57,977 --> 02:53:04,302
[SPEAKER_13]: But when I do, I try to sit down for long periods of time and play video games.

2578
02:53:04,403 --> 02:53:04,763
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes...

2579
02:53:06,064 --> 02:53:06,685
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2580
02:53:23,243 --> 02:53:25,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Code Man, we talked about the crying thing.

2581
02:53:25,504 --> 02:53:26,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't do it.

2582
02:53:26,424 --> 02:53:27,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you better cry.

2583
02:53:27,604 --> 02:53:27,844
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the $500.

2584
02:53:43,001 --> 02:53:44,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when Rob drinks more, he'll cry.

2585
02:53:44,422 --> 02:53:45,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make you cry.

2586
02:53:46,182 --> 02:53:48,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Rob, is he an emotional drunk?

2587
02:53:49,003 --> 02:53:49,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I am.

2588
02:53:49,603 --> 02:53:51,084
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just loud.

2589
02:53:52,585 --> 02:53:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And horny, apparently, if these other stories are to be believed.

2590
02:53:55,186 --> 02:53:57,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

2591
02:53:57,606 --> 02:53:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

2592
02:53:58,507 --> 02:54:01,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, by the way, Shane reminded me, that's where dunk came from.

2593
02:54:02,208 --> 02:54:03,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, all right, look.

2594
02:54:04,330 --> 02:54:12,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Codeman, thank you so much, and I'm so glad everybody gets to see your talent now in our album art, and the fact that that is listener-created.

2595
02:54:12,519 --> 02:54:24,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Jamie did great work beforehand for a previous era of the show, but this show really is about the listeners, and so that the listeners could contribute to that, and the way you capture that by having everybody's name in there...

2596
02:54:25,191 --> 02:54:27,252
[SPEAKER_07]: or I should say not everybody, but a good chunk of the people.

2597
02:54:27,272 --> 02:54:27,993
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great touch.

2598
02:54:28,033 --> 02:54:29,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great touch.

2599
02:54:29,613 --> 02:54:30,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved it.

2600
02:54:30,634 --> 02:54:31,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was my favorite part.

2601
02:54:31,975 --> 02:54:34,356
[SPEAKER_13]: It's wherever every gamer has a voice.

2602
02:54:34,676 --> 02:54:36,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

2603
02:54:36,457 --> 02:54:46,282
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not only about the hosts that are on the show, but it's about the people that could participate in the chat room and give a voice to the actual podcast itself.

2604
02:54:46,322 --> 02:54:51,665
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you guys for doing so much for everybody and just...

2605
02:54:52,365 --> 02:54:52,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2606
02:54:52,865 --> 02:54:54,946
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say.

2607
02:54:54,966 --> 02:54:55,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2608
02:54:55,586 --> 02:54:57,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys still doing the Down for Maintenance show?

2609
02:54:57,727 --> 02:54:58,267
[SPEAKER_13]: We are.

2610
02:54:59,448 --> 02:55:06,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we have taken a couple of weekends off due to just really busy, busy lives.

2611
02:55:06,170 --> 02:55:09,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been doing a lot of graphics for people on YouTube, and I've just been really, really, really busy.

2612
02:55:11,112 --> 02:55:15,454
[SPEAKER_13]: But other than that, yeah, we're still on Stitcher now, which is awesome.

2613
02:55:15,534 --> 02:55:15,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2614
02:55:17,275 --> 02:55:20,236
[SPEAKER_13]: And iTunes is kind of fuzzy because we –

2615
02:55:20,856 --> 02:55:23,957
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not running the kind of server that iTunes accepts.

2616
02:55:24,417 --> 02:55:28,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I hate... This is why iTunes is going to... Anyway, rabble, rabble.

2617
02:55:29,219 --> 02:55:33,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But look them up at least on Stitcher, right?

2618
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:34,660
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a website, though, now.

2619
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:35,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Please.

2620
02:55:36,121 --> 02:55:39,302
[SPEAKER_13]: www.thedfmpodcast.com

2621
02:55:40,022 --> 02:55:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

2622
02:55:40,623 --> 02:55:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great show.

2623
02:55:41,564 --> 02:55:44,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the most ultimate compliment we get on this show.

2624
02:55:44,466 --> 02:55:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying this is necessarily true of your show, but I get this so much is that you guys helped inspire me.

2625
02:55:51,211 --> 02:55:54,994
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys showed me that anybody can really do this and that I can do this too.

2626
02:55:55,054 --> 02:56:00,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the greatest compliment when we see these other shows arise of our listenerships.

2627
02:56:00,258 --> 02:56:00,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

2628
02:56:01,439 --> 02:56:02,900
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the reasons why we did it.

2629
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:03,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

2630
02:56:04,041 --> 02:56:04,421
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, buddy.

2631
02:56:04,441 --> 02:56:05,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2632
02:56:06,215 --> 02:56:06,735
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, man.

2633
02:56:06,755 --> 02:56:10,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you guys enjoy 500th show and I'm going to go to bed because I'm sleepy.

2634
02:56:10,718 --> 02:56:10,958
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2635
02:56:10,978 --> 02:56:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

2636
02:56:11,439 --> 02:56:12,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

2637
02:56:12,399 --> 02:56:12,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye bye.

2638
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:13,760
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2639
02:56:13,780 --> 02:56:14,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk to you guys later.

2640
02:56:14,641 --> 02:56:14,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2641
02:56:14,941 --> 02:56:15,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Code man.

2642
02:56:15,782 --> 02:56:16,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Great call.

2643
02:56:16,482 --> 02:56:16,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2644
02:56:16,862 --> 02:56:17,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you're going to make me cry.

2645
02:56:17,923 --> 02:56:20,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I was feeling a little sniffly.

2646
02:56:20,285 --> 02:56:21,465
[SPEAKER_07]: The phone is ringing off the hooks.

2647
02:56:21,546 --> 02:56:22,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to another call.

2648
02:56:22,386 --> 02:56:23,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2649
02:56:23,387 --> 02:56:23,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2650
02:56:26,109 --> 02:56:26,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Hola.

2651
02:56:26,509 --> 02:56:28,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

2652
02:56:28,330 --> 02:56:28,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you muted?

2653
02:56:30,191 --> 02:56:30,812
[SPEAKER_21]: I see you.

2654
02:56:31,570 --> 02:56:33,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, one more time.

2655
02:56:33,591 --> 02:56:34,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Come in, Tokyo.

2656
02:56:34,671 --> 02:56:35,451
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't hear you.

2657
02:56:36,331 --> 02:56:36,651
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2658
02:56:37,592 --> 02:56:40,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo 123 to test your connection, folks.

2659
02:56:40,332 --> 02:56:42,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's off at the esthetician.

2660
02:56:43,293 --> 02:56:43,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Tsk, tsk.

2661
02:56:43,773 --> 02:56:45,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't bring up that joke.

2662
02:56:45,074 --> 02:56:46,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's try another call.

2663
02:56:46,174 --> 02:56:47,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2664
02:56:47,174 --> 02:56:47,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2665
02:56:47,994 --> 02:56:49,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.

2666
02:56:49,635 --> 02:56:50,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and we see him.

2667
02:56:50,495 --> 02:56:51,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We see him.

2668
02:56:51,575 --> 02:56:52,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Brad from PodCulture.

2669
02:56:52,836 --> 02:56:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2670
02:56:54,526 --> 02:56:57,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Just going to say congratulations on 500, guys.

2671
02:56:57,807 --> 02:56:59,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

2672
02:56:59,387 --> 02:57:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not that far behind.

2673
02:57:01,248 --> 02:57:04,349
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture's been going quite a while itself, hasn't it?

2674
02:57:06,749 --> 02:57:07,769
[SPEAKER_10]: In our eighth year, I guess.

2675
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:09,110
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something.

2676
02:57:09,210 --> 02:57:09,830
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something.

2677
02:57:09,870 --> 02:57:10,450
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

2678
02:57:10,830 --> 02:57:13,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You and I have the same color microphone, I just realized.

2679
02:57:15,171 --> 02:57:15,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, I wonder why.

2680
02:57:15,991 --> 02:57:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2681
02:57:17,132 --> 02:57:21,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You've done a lot to help this show out over the years, PodCulture, from getting us drunk to getting us heard.

2682
02:57:22,276 --> 02:57:26,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for all of the discs full of Doctor Who you've sent me in the past.

2683
02:57:27,221 --> 02:57:28,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no problem, no problem.

2684
02:57:28,622 --> 02:57:29,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to do it.

2685
02:57:30,825 --> 02:57:35,409
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, without you guys, I don't think we would have lasted as long as we have.

2686
02:57:35,469 --> 02:57:39,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And thanks for inviting us into the VOG community.

2687
02:57:40,689 --> 02:57:41,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, duh.

2688
02:57:41,870 --> 02:57:42,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to have you.

2689
02:57:43,472 --> 02:57:55,505
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew when we were starting, when we knew we wanted to do something that was not just games, but a celebration of everything geek, and some of our favorite shows came to mind, and absolutely, you were near the top of that list.

2690
02:57:55,525 --> 02:57:56,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You were seriously up there.

2691
02:57:56,886 --> 02:57:57,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2692
02:57:57,447 --> 02:57:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you.

2693
02:57:58,628 --> 02:58:01,872
[SPEAKER_10]: But congratulations, and I'm going to let you guys go, and...

2694
02:58:02,952 --> 02:58:05,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Get some more calls in, and this one's for you guys.

2695
02:58:05,373 --> 02:58:06,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look at that.

2696
02:58:06,273 --> 02:58:07,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a shot on air.

2697
02:58:07,434 --> 02:58:07,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2698
02:58:09,474 --> 02:58:10,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo-hoo.

2699
02:58:10,074 --> 02:58:11,735
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the best video calls we've ever got.

2700
02:58:11,755 --> 02:58:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: See, you took it far better than Rob did, because Rob turned red in the face, and it was awesome.

2701
02:58:16,156 --> 02:58:17,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've had more practice.

2702
02:58:19,277 --> 02:58:20,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It's become a regular thing on the show.

2703
02:58:21,198 --> 02:58:21,518
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2704
02:58:21,798 --> 02:58:28,821
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCultures, Monday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network, continuing a celebration of the various doctors on TARDIS Interruptus tomorrow.

2705
02:58:28,861 --> 02:58:29,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Fourth doctor, right?

2706
02:58:30,362 --> 02:58:30,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.

2707
02:58:30,942 --> 02:58:31,323
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2708
02:58:31,483 --> 02:58:33,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth doctor was my doctor.

2709
02:58:33,324 --> 02:58:34,164
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2710
02:58:34,645 --> 02:58:35,945
[SPEAKER_07]: He was pretty well known.

2711
02:58:35,965 --> 02:58:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2712
02:58:37,486 --> 02:58:37,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night, guys.

2713
02:58:37,886 --> 02:58:38,147
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2714
02:58:38,167 --> 02:58:38,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

2715
02:58:39,888 --> 02:58:40,248
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2716
02:58:40,328 --> 02:58:43,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Always a pleasure to hear from Brad from another great podcast.

2717
02:58:43,890 --> 02:58:44,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2718
02:58:44,811 --> 02:58:45,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2719
02:58:46,692 --> 02:58:48,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me, Mario.

2720
02:58:49,373 --> 02:58:50,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Mario.

2721
02:58:51,214 --> 02:58:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

2722
02:58:51,915 --> 02:58:52,475
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

2723
02:58:52,535 --> 02:58:53,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this really Extifer?

2724
02:58:54,837 --> 02:58:55,237
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2725
02:58:55,257 --> 02:58:56,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's me.

2726
02:58:59,306 --> 02:59:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, Extover?

2727
02:59:01,808 --> 02:59:02,769
[SPEAKER_18]: What is on my mind?

2728
02:59:02,829 --> 02:59:03,170
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2729
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:04,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just calling.

2730
02:59:04,551 --> 02:59:07,134
[SPEAKER_07]: You just wanted to see what's up?

2731
02:59:08,373 --> 02:59:11,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I wanted to see what's up in his house.

2732
02:59:11,596 --> 02:59:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're doing this autism multiple sclerosis walk one week from today, and everybody should donate at HordeHouse.com through the link, right?

2733
02:59:21,865 --> 02:59:23,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, totally.

2734
02:59:23,266 --> 02:59:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2735
02:59:24,347 --> 02:59:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up for multiple sclerosis walks.

2736
02:59:28,111 --> 02:59:29,752
[SPEAKER_07]: We broke $1,000 today.

2737
02:59:29,932 --> 02:59:30,413
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

2738
02:59:30,453 --> 02:59:31,514
[SPEAKER_18]: We did break it.

2739
02:59:31,834 --> 02:59:32,475
[SPEAKER_18]: We broke it.

2740
02:59:33,095 --> 02:59:33,796
[SPEAKER_18]: We took it out.

2741
02:59:34,912 --> 02:59:38,896
[SPEAKER_18]: We did take it out, and I'm very happy about that.

2742
02:59:39,736 --> 02:59:41,558
[SPEAKER_07]: What video games have you been playing lately, Extover?

2743
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:48,544
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Jetpack Joyride, and I don't know nothing else.

2744
02:59:50,586 --> 02:59:51,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm boring.

2745
02:59:51,647 --> 02:59:52,668
[SPEAKER_18]: You should know this already.

2746
02:59:53,328 --> 02:59:55,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what did you call to say tonight?

2747
02:59:55,770 --> 02:59:58,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want to wish us well on our 500th episode?

2748
02:59:59,414 --> 03:00:01,736
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I just thought I'd call and say hi.

2749
03:00:01,756 --> 03:00:02,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2750
03:00:02,910 --> 03:00:03,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, okay.

2751
03:00:04,012 --> 03:00:04,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

2752
03:00:05,794 --> 03:00:06,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

2753
03:00:07,136 --> 03:00:08,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

2754
03:00:08,097 --> 03:00:09,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Got any plans tomorrow?

2755
03:00:09,399 --> 03:00:09,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Want to hang?

2756
03:00:10,521 --> 03:00:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2757
03:00:11,162 --> 03:00:15,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You still need to come over and finish watching Firefly with me after five years of us not watching Firefly.

2758
03:00:16,429 --> 03:00:17,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's getting called out?

2759
03:00:17,150 --> 03:00:18,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you know what?

2760
03:00:18,232 --> 03:00:19,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll check my calendar.

2761
03:00:20,865 --> 03:00:23,886
[SPEAKER_18]: stuff for that and get back to you.

2762
03:00:23,906 --> 03:00:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

2763
03:00:24,907 --> 03:00:28,248
[SPEAKER_03]: My week is not working, not working, not working, not working, not working birthday.

2764
03:00:28,288 --> 03:00:28,729
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come.

2765
03:00:29,689 --> 03:00:31,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, let me check my calendar.

2766
03:00:31,610 --> 03:00:34,631
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not working, not working, not working, not working.

2767
03:00:35,391 --> 03:00:36,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And then birthday.

2768
03:00:36,772 --> 03:00:39,253
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess we have the same calendar.

2769
03:00:39,613 --> 03:00:40,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2770
03:00:40,314 --> 03:00:40,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Amazing.

2771
03:00:43,255 --> 03:00:45,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Extover, do you want to plug Horde House?

2772
03:00:46,876 --> 03:00:50,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I will plug Horde House up the asshole for you.

2773
03:00:51,490 --> 03:00:52,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it bleached?

2774
03:00:53,257 --> 03:00:58,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it's a nicely bleached, freshly bleached asshole that Hornhouse has.

2775
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:05,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you this, Extifer, since we have a lot of old school listeners that are revisiting us tonight and so forth.

2776
03:01:05,285 --> 03:01:09,688
[SPEAKER_07]: For a while, you and I were roommates and OLR Studios was at your house.

2777
03:01:10,188 --> 03:01:15,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So what would the listeners be most surprised to know about Orange Lounge Radio behind the scenes?

2778
03:01:15,892 --> 03:01:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think the OLR listeners would be most surprised to know behind the scenes?

2779
03:01:22,423 --> 03:01:28,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, our studio in our apartment was freaking filthy.

2780
03:01:30,829 --> 03:01:34,232
[SPEAKER_18]: And Rob falls asleep in random places.

2781
03:01:34,712 --> 03:01:35,953
[SPEAKER_18]: It's totally true.

2782
03:01:36,013 --> 03:01:37,214
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just when he's drunk.

2783
03:01:37,294 --> 03:01:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That is totally hilarious, too.

2784
03:01:40,696 --> 03:01:45,700
[SPEAKER_18]: I would come home and he'd be asleep on the floor and be like, Oh, I'm glad I didn't trip over you.

2785
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:46,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't see you down there.

2786
03:01:48,883 --> 03:01:54,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember coming over to that apartment and being absolutely thrilled that you were totally into Devil's Crush.

2787
03:01:55,829 --> 03:01:56,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

2788
03:01:56,449 --> 03:01:57,730
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Devil's Crush.

2789
03:01:58,150 --> 03:02:03,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Although the... Actually, it was... Alien's Crush.

2790
03:02:03,435 --> 03:02:05,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Alien's Crush, or whatever.

2791
03:02:05,837 --> 03:02:09,720
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite extra for memory was when you stood out in the line to get me the Wii.

2792
03:02:11,381 --> 03:02:12,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, right?

2793
03:02:12,562 --> 03:02:15,344
[SPEAKER_18]: And how many times did you play that thing?

2794
03:02:15,364 --> 03:02:15,925
[SPEAKER_18]: You did it.

2795
03:02:17,518 --> 03:02:19,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Every day is what I want to say.

2796
03:02:19,659 --> 03:02:20,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a huge Wii fan.

2797
03:02:21,659 --> 03:02:23,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you were a total Wii fan.

2798
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:28,921
[SPEAKER_18]: You were like, it was like five years after it launched and you were like, Wii!

2799
03:02:29,541 --> 03:02:31,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Like every single chance you would get, you would say that.

2800
03:02:32,002 --> 03:02:33,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It was kind of weird and depressing.

2801
03:02:33,983 --> 03:02:34,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little awkward.

2802
03:02:35,103 --> 03:02:38,924
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Extover, before we let you go, is there any other final thoughts for listeners tonight?

2803
03:02:40,889 --> 03:02:48,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, well, I gotta go wash my hands because I did some dirty work before you guys gave me a call.

2804
03:02:48,732 --> 03:02:59,055
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, when you called me earlier, I didn't say anything because I had just came and you didn't want to hear what my voice sounds like right after that.

2805
03:03:00,336 --> 03:03:01,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you just better go wash your hands.

2806
03:03:01,756 --> 03:03:03,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you touching yourself to the show?

2807
03:03:03,417 --> 03:03:04,317
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little awkward.

2808
03:03:04,397 --> 03:03:05,838
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're like jerking it to my voice.

2809
03:03:05,858 --> 03:03:08,238
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I took a shit on my chair and I was cleaning.

2810
03:03:08,478 --> 03:03:09,779
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think I was doing?

2811
03:03:10,845 --> 03:03:12,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Never change, please.

2812
03:03:12,247 --> 03:03:12,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Never change.

2813
03:03:13,448 --> 03:03:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Extifer, I'm letting you go now.

2814
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:16,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Aw, thank you.

2815
03:03:16,971 --> 03:03:17,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye.

2816
03:03:18,753 --> 03:03:20,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we holding him for any reason?

2817
03:03:22,657 --> 03:03:23,618
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck?

2818
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:27,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, seriously.

2819
03:03:27,242 --> 03:03:30,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally miss Extifer and the utter randomness.

2820
03:03:33,895 --> 03:03:34,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, lordy.

2821
03:03:34,736 --> 03:03:35,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Rob.

2822
03:03:35,116 --> 03:03:35,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2823
03:03:35,736 --> 03:03:36,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

2824
03:03:37,057 --> 03:03:38,738
[SPEAKER_04]: School bus reference in the chat room.

2825
03:03:39,899 --> 03:03:41,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, here on Orange Sounds Radio.

2826
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:41,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2827
03:03:43,081 --> 03:03:43,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

2828
03:03:43,822 --> 03:03:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Swag Kick.

2829
03:03:44,682 --> 03:03:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, girl.

2830
03:03:45,623 --> 03:03:46,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

2831
03:03:46,123 --> 03:03:46,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And guy.

2832
03:03:46,964 --> 03:03:47,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, girl.

2833
03:03:47,804 --> 03:03:48,285
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

2834
03:03:48,525 --> 03:03:49,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Rob.

2835
03:03:49,085 --> 03:03:49,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Rob.

2836
03:03:49,605 --> 03:03:51,207
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not the guy.

2837
03:03:51,247 --> 03:03:52,027
[SPEAKER_08]: You're one of the girls.

2838
03:03:52,728 --> 03:03:53,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

2839
03:03:53,308 --> 03:03:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Swag Kick?

2840
03:03:55,209 --> 03:03:58,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I just wanted to congratulate you like everyone else.

2841
03:03:58,491 --> 03:04:00,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know it's totally not original.

2842
03:04:00,873 --> 03:04:02,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, how do I follow up, um...

2843
03:04:03,243 --> 03:04:13,370
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that call that Exifer just made, you know, I can't really, I am not touching myself, but I just wanted to congratulate all of you on your great achievement.

2844
03:04:13,870 --> 03:04:15,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, that's amazing.

2845
03:04:15,571 --> 03:04:17,713
[SPEAKER_08]: 500, like, I can't believe that.

2846
03:04:17,833 --> 03:04:18,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, baby.

2847
03:04:18,713 --> 03:04:19,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel so nervous.

2848
03:04:19,474 --> 03:04:20,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm on the radio.

2849
03:04:21,915 --> 03:04:22,616
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of famous.

2850
03:04:23,136 --> 03:04:24,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just me.

2851
03:04:24,417 --> 03:04:25,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You know me.

2852
03:04:25,098 --> 03:04:25,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You've met me.

2853
03:04:26,318 --> 03:04:27,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not that scary.

2854
03:04:27,299 --> 03:04:28,480
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not that scary, right?

2855
03:04:30,721 --> 03:04:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a little scary.

2856
03:04:34,728 --> 03:04:36,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shoot, slide, kick.

2857
03:04:36,049 --> 03:04:37,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to talk any games with us?

2858
03:04:37,529 --> 03:04:38,609
[SPEAKER_07]: What games have you been playing lately?

2859
03:04:40,750 --> 03:04:42,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually playing Fire Emblem Awakening.

2860
03:04:43,311 --> 03:04:43,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

2861
03:04:43,671 --> 03:04:44,091
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that?

2862
03:04:44,451 --> 03:04:48,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of suck at it, but it's cool.

2863
03:04:48,332 --> 03:04:49,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it a lot.

2864
03:04:49,312 --> 03:04:55,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never really played a lot of tactical strategy RPGs, so it's cool.

2865
03:04:55,134 --> 03:04:55,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

2866
03:04:56,414 --> 03:05:03,356
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people that are really into Fire Emblem on the 3DS, so I can't really blame you for being a fan of that.

2867
03:05:05,461 --> 03:05:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: for sure so Slykick you've done a couple podcasts of your own too I know you used to do a podcast with Alan not everybody knows about this but you used to do the amazing Warcraft podcast Fabulous Flames right Alan?

2868
03:05:17,683 --> 03:05:34,107
[SPEAKER_08]: yes we did and I have to say Alan has been amazing tonight yes he has I was a big fan of the Miss Nude World 96 shout out I'm always a fan for Miss Nude World 96 what are you doing these days in podcasting?

2869
03:05:34,127 --> 03:05:35,047
[SPEAKER_07]: do you have anything you want to plug?

2870
03:05:37,399 --> 03:05:47,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and since Exifer took the butt plug joke, I'll just go ahead and shout out to my podcast, which is GameBooey.

2871
03:05:47,526 --> 03:05:53,971
[SPEAKER_08]: We're over at GameBooey.org, and we bring you gaming news and views that may be on your radar, but most definitely should be.

2872
03:05:54,831 --> 03:06:04,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are definitely inspired and pretty much owe everything about who we are to Orange Sounds Radio, so thank you for being an inspiration and making it, you know, making...

2873
03:06:05,566 --> 03:06:16,501
[SPEAKER_08]: a community out there for people to have a voice in gaming because it's super important for not just all the blogs and journalists

2874
03:06:17,253 --> 03:06:19,075
[SPEAKER_08]: to be the only ones talking about games.

2875
03:06:19,235 --> 03:06:20,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

2876
03:06:20,177 --> 03:06:21,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It means a lot.

2877
03:06:21,298 --> 03:06:23,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And your show is very good.

2878
03:06:23,521 --> 03:06:24,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it.

2879
03:06:24,342 --> 03:06:29,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though in those first few episodes I wanted to kill you over your sound quality, you guys have improved so much.

2880
03:06:29,268 --> 03:06:29,808
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2881
03:06:29,828 --> 03:06:30,770
[SPEAKER_07]: You sound great now.

2882
03:06:31,110 --> 03:06:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually better than it was in the previous one.

2883
03:06:35,035 --> 03:06:36,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I do miss Fabulous Flames, just saying.

2884
03:06:37,618 --> 03:06:55,858
[SPEAKER_07]: you sound great now and your content is very good and well researched and you and Spike are great and what I love most about your show is that you always pay it forward at the end and you do give shout outs and keep it indie and I think that's great and you know if we helped inspire that attitude then that's a huge compliment

2885
03:06:57,614 --> 03:06:58,735
[SPEAKER_08]: We're your biggest fans.

2886
03:06:58,915 --> 03:07:00,937
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you so much.

2887
03:07:01,057 --> 03:07:03,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been begging to come on your show for like six months.

2888
03:07:03,779 --> 03:07:04,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at this.

2889
03:07:04,579 --> 03:07:07,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally miss, though, planning webcomics with you.

2890
03:07:10,244 --> 03:07:11,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have the WoW viewer.

2891
03:07:12,005 --> 03:07:12,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We can still do it.

2892
03:07:16,228 --> 03:07:16,468
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2893
03:07:16,709 --> 03:07:19,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Slidekick, I'm going to let you go since I can get more calls.

2894
03:07:19,351 --> 03:07:20,892
[SPEAKER_07]: But anything else real quick before I let you go?

2895
03:07:23,045 --> 03:07:28,007
[SPEAKER_08]: No, except I need to get up there and have an OLR party sometime.

2896
03:07:28,147 --> 03:07:29,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome anytime.

2897
03:07:29,147 --> 03:07:30,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Get up here on Sunday night.

2898
03:07:30,208 --> 03:07:31,228
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to come up on Friday.

2899
03:07:32,368 --> 03:07:33,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring Captain Spike with you.

2900
03:07:33,149 --> 03:07:33,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I will try.

2901
03:07:33,989 --> 03:07:34,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I will try.

2902
03:07:34,529 --> 03:07:35,149
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2903
03:07:35,529 --> 03:07:35,729
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2904
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:36,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

2905
03:07:36,310 --> 03:07:36,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

2906
03:07:37,930 --> 03:07:38,250
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2907
03:07:38,270 --> 03:07:38,791
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

2908
03:07:38,931 --> 03:07:39,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2909
03:07:39,131 --> 03:07:39,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a happy 500.

2910
03:07:40,291 --> 03:07:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2911
03:07:41,131 --> 03:07:42,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2912
03:07:42,652 --> 03:07:43,232
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2913
03:07:43,252 --> 03:07:44,312
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2914
03:07:44,392 --> 03:07:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2915
03:07:46,313 --> 03:07:47,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to another call.

2916
03:07:47,133 --> 03:07:47,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2917
03:07:47,994 --> 03:07:48,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2918
03:07:49,016 --> 03:07:51,717
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the undertaker of the internet, Raven Stolfen.

2919
03:07:51,777 --> 03:07:52,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, weren't you just here?

2920
03:07:53,717 --> 03:07:55,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I was, but give me two minutes, Rob.

2921
03:07:56,318 --> 03:07:58,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope your pallbearer didn't die.

2922
03:07:59,759 --> 03:08:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Time starts now.

2923
03:08:01,459 --> 03:08:08,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so I want to congratulate Orange Lines Radio for 500 shows and inspiring me to do my show.

2924
03:08:08,581 --> 03:08:14,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to plug it, but I'm just going to say, Rob, your cast and your people have

2925
03:08:14,758 --> 03:08:17,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Very diverse, and you kept me entertained for years.

2926
03:08:17,819 --> 03:08:22,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I am now 26, and I've been listening since I was in high school as well.

2927
03:08:24,861 --> 03:08:25,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

2928
03:08:25,781 --> 03:08:27,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we're so old!

2929
03:08:28,302 --> 03:08:30,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel myself aging.

2930
03:08:30,582 --> 03:08:31,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got cancer now.

2931
03:08:31,922 --> 03:08:34,383
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's amazing.

2932
03:08:34,663 --> 03:08:36,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is amazing.

2933
03:08:36,444 --> 03:08:37,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I also really like your voice.

2934
03:08:38,868 --> 03:08:39,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

2935
03:08:40,589 --> 03:08:41,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Your voice is very much mature.

2936
03:08:42,069 --> 03:08:47,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when you used to call this show all the time when you were in high school and the years right after that and so forth.

2937
03:08:47,791 --> 03:08:49,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Your voice really has matured.

2938
03:08:49,752 --> 03:08:53,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear it through undoubtedly your own podcast and so forth.

2939
03:08:53,554 --> 03:08:55,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pleasant.

2940
03:08:56,094 --> 03:08:57,155
[SPEAKER_15]: It came a long way.

2941
03:08:57,295 --> 03:08:58,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything came a long way.

2942
03:08:58,535 --> 03:09:05,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have to say, if Orange Silence Radio was a lighthouse in the beacon of the dark, you are awesome.

2943
03:09:06,092 --> 03:09:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I appreciate it so much, Raven Stolfen, and thank you so much for sticking with us for all the years.

2944
03:09:10,374 --> 03:09:11,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pleasure as always to hear from you.

2945
03:09:12,495 --> 03:09:14,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I listen to every archive.

2946
03:09:14,576 --> 03:09:15,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I never leave.

2947
03:09:15,817 --> 03:09:17,698
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just sometimes I do my things on Sunday.

2948
03:09:17,718 --> 03:09:18,318
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes it hard.

2949
03:09:18,358 --> 03:09:22,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to cancel my own show for you guys because I had to be here for your special day.

2950
03:09:22,980 --> 03:09:23,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

2951
03:09:23,340 --> 03:09:23,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2952
03:09:23,861 --> 03:09:25,221
[SPEAKER_07]: That's – oh, my gosh.

2953
03:09:25,762 --> 03:09:25,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2954
03:09:26,242 --> 03:09:28,423
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you have talked about on your show tonight?

2955
03:09:28,483 --> 03:09:32,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can work a little bit of it in here, a little crossover episode.

2956
03:09:32,385 --> 03:09:32,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2957
03:09:33,103 --> 03:09:39,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was going to talk about, and you guys didn't do it, it was the whole thing about Twitch TV, about that handicapped guy that wasn't handicapped.

2958
03:09:40,164 --> 03:09:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard about this.

2959
03:09:41,685 --> 03:09:43,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So what, let me see if I can summarize.

2960
03:09:43,645 --> 03:09:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, so he was getting donations because he was sick, and I guess it was donations for a surgery, right?

2961
03:09:50,047 --> 03:09:56,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, the cameras weren't stopping on Twitch TV, he didn't turn them off, and they caught him getting up out of his wheelchair.

2962
03:09:56,588 --> 03:09:56,728
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2963
03:09:57,568 --> 03:09:58,208
[SPEAKER_07]: No funny business, people

2964
03:10:25,716 --> 03:10:27,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so we were going to talk about that.

2965
03:10:27,957 --> 03:10:29,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I had problems in the past.

2966
03:10:29,939 --> 03:10:32,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm on Social Security right now.

2967
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I had major problems, went to special schools.

2968
03:10:35,582 --> 03:10:40,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So for me, for someone that faces an illness like that, you just slap me in the face.

2969
03:10:40,464 --> 03:10:43,626
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not trying to get donations for what I'm doing, but...

2970
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:45,371
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's worse.

2971
03:11:05,567 --> 03:11:07,328
[SPEAKER_07]: The wheelchair thing is bad.

2972
03:11:07,368 --> 03:11:08,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That's evil.

2973
03:11:08,468 --> 03:11:10,989
[SPEAKER_07]: But jerking it on Twitch, that's funny.

2974
03:11:11,870 --> 03:11:14,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Any live streaming site, you're going to see dick or boobs anyway.

2975
03:11:14,631 --> 03:11:20,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was going to say, or the one dude that had sex with his girlfriend or something like that in the background, or he just forgot it was on.

2976
03:11:21,078 --> 03:11:22,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he forgot it was on.

2977
03:11:22,399 --> 03:11:24,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm very careful about when I have that.

2978
03:11:24,662 --> 03:11:27,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not live stream 24-7 just because.

2979
03:11:27,084 --> 03:11:28,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra for shame.

2980
03:11:28,906 --> 03:11:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I know something bad would happen.

2981
03:11:30,427 --> 03:11:33,931
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, RavensDolphin, I'm going to let you go to get more calls, but thank you so much for the kind words.

2982
03:11:34,311 --> 03:11:35,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for taking my call.

2983
03:11:35,412 --> 03:11:35,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2984
03:11:35,753 --> 03:11:37,414
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

2985
03:11:37,474 --> 03:11:37,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2986
03:11:37,595 --> 03:11:39,957
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2987
03:11:40,477 --> 03:11:40,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

2988
03:11:40,698 --> 03:11:41,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do a couple more calls, right?

2989
03:11:41,719 --> 03:11:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only at 930.

2990
03:11:44,341 --> 03:11:47,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We are being horribly rude to our East Coast people.

2991
03:11:47,522 --> 03:11:47,783
[SPEAKER_07]: We are.

2992
03:11:47,903 --> 03:11:48,783
[SPEAKER_07]: How about one more call?

2993
03:11:48,963 --> 03:11:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: One more call.

2994
03:11:49,803 --> 03:11:50,264
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call.

2995
03:11:50,504 --> 03:11:51,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see who gets in.

2996
03:11:51,224 --> 03:11:52,505
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2997
03:11:52,885 --> 03:11:53,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally jealous.

2998
03:11:53,585 --> 03:11:53,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

2999
03:11:53,925 --> 03:11:55,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally jealous of all of them who have jobs.

3000
03:11:57,547 --> 03:11:57,727
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

3001
03:11:57,847 --> 03:11:58,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep them up all night.

3002
03:11:59,888 --> 03:12:00,228
[SPEAKER_03]: All night.

3003
03:12:00,668 --> 03:12:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You all right?

3004
03:12:01,669 --> 03:12:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing my Ronda Shearer impersonation.

3005
03:12:03,489 --> 03:12:03,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

3006
03:12:04,010 --> 03:12:04,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

3007
03:12:04,470 --> 03:12:04,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

3008
03:12:04,730 --> 03:12:07,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I'm not wearing, you know, extra padding in the boob region.

3009
03:12:07,311 --> 03:12:07,531
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

3010
03:12:07,571 --> 03:12:08,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go to one more call.

3011
03:12:08,572 --> 03:12:09,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3012
03:12:09,572 --> 03:12:09,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

3013
03:12:10,653 --> 03:12:11,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

3014
03:12:11,233 --> 03:12:11,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Tiger Claw.

3015
03:12:11,993 --> 03:12:12,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Tiger Claw.

3016
03:12:12,874 --> 03:12:13,594
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

3017
03:12:14,494 --> 03:12:15,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, not much.

3018
03:12:15,494 --> 03:12:18,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to congratulate you guys on your 500th episode.

3019
03:12:19,836 --> 03:12:26,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you guys can go on record maybe as being the longest running podcast in history or something like that.

3020
03:12:27,198 --> 03:12:30,879
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not the longest running podcast, but we are the longest running video game podcast.

3021
03:12:30,919 --> 03:12:31,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.

3022
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you guys have been around way before podcasting was a thing, so...

3023
03:12:36,741 --> 03:12:53,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say live show that's what gives us a jump on the other people is that we had the live 365 years and so we kind of slid right into the podcasting thing but I would say I usually say we are the longest running internet show about video games weekly internet show about video games

3024
03:12:54,573 --> 03:12:54,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

3025
03:12:55,134 --> 03:12:56,315
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

3026
03:12:56,435 --> 03:12:59,296
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet is a big place.

3027
03:12:59,557 --> 03:13:08,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been putting together this special interest group on Facebook recently with some friends, and I found that there's all these other podcasters I didn't even know were out there.

3028
03:13:08,222 --> 03:13:10,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know these shows existed.

3029
03:13:10,484 --> 03:13:14,507
[SPEAKER_07]: They're celebrating episode 100 and 60, and I'm like, what?

3030
03:13:15,287 --> 03:13:21,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So you never know what's out there, which is why I'm very cautious to stake a claim like, we're the longest running show, bitches.

3031
03:13:21,852 --> 03:13:23,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to be careful.

3032
03:13:25,133 --> 03:13:34,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, and just keep on doing what you're doing and hopefully people will listen and I don't know what else to say.

3033
03:13:35,618 --> 03:13:41,240
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter how old you get, just keep on gaming because you'll still feel the same way.

3034
03:13:42,101 --> 03:13:45,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Tigerclaw, I appreciate your support over the years.

3035
03:13:46,203 --> 03:13:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It means an awful lot.

3036
03:13:48,497 --> 03:13:49,558
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem, you're welcome.

3037
03:13:49,698 --> 03:13:52,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So better let some other people call in.

3038
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:54,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see if maybe we'll let one more sneak in since you were short.

3039
03:13:55,022 --> 03:13:56,002
[SPEAKER_07]: But have a good one, Tigerclaw.

3040
03:13:56,323 --> 03:13:56,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks.

3041
03:13:57,283 --> 03:13:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

3042
03:13:58,164 --> 03:13:58,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

3043
03:13:58,504 --> 03:13:58,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

3044
03:14:00,706 --> 03:14:01,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do one more.

3045
03:14:01,446 --> 03:14:02,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do one more.

3046
03:14:02,907 --> 03:14:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: One more, come on.

3047
03:14:03,768 --> 03:14:04,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

3048
03:14:05,449 --> 03:14:06,309
[SPEAKER_07]: One more, one more.

3049
03:14:06,449 --> 03:14:07,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially this one.

3050
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:07,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hi.

3051
03:14:08,411 --> 03:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

3052
03:14:09,351 --> 03:14:09,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh!

3053
03:14:10,312 --> 03:14:12,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a scary black man on the cam.

3054
03:14:12,153 --> 03:14:12,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

3055
03:14:16,005 --> 03:14:17,487
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding, you guys.

3056
03:14:17,547 --> 03:14:20,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It's DJ Ranma S. You are looking sharp in your VOG shirt.

3057
03:14:20,149 --> 03:14:21,930
[SPEAKER_07]: You are looking very sharp today, young man.

3058
03:14:21,990 --> 03:14:22,370
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

3059
03:14:23,091 --> 03:14:23,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing fine.

3060
03:14:23,952 --> 03:14:26,193
[SPEAKER_11]: How is everybody in the Sacramento studios?

3061
03:14:27,274 --> 03:14:28,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sobering up, sadly.

3062
03:14:29,296 --> 03:14:32,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you should not be sobering up because I have a problem with that good sir.

3063
03:14:32,759 --> 03:14:33,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, what's that?

3064
03:14:34,580 --> 03:14:36,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... What are you drinking?

3065
03:14:38,268 --> 03:14:40,532
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can see what I got here.

3066
03:14:40,812 --> 03:14:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you and I need to be at your house right now.

3067
03:14:45,940 --> 03:14:47,402
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a bottle of Glenn Fittich.

3068
03:14:48,224 --> 03:14:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of two bottles of Glenn Fittich I have.

3069
03:14:50,888 --> 03:14:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm at BRB going on a plane.

3070
03:14:55,678 --> 03:15:00,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And also... Do you see this glass right here?

3071
03:15:00,201 --> 03:15:00,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

3072
03:15:01,522 --> 03:15:02,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, hold it.

3073
03:15:02,323 --> 03:15:04,545
[SPEAKER_11]: XFR once said something about a Luigi hat.

3074
03:15:04,685 --> 03:15:05,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me one quick second.

3075
03:15:06,106 --> 03:15:06,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Lord.

3076
03:15:06,766 --> 03:15:10,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, they can't... They can't... We're the only ones that can see you.

3077
03:15:11,130 --> 03:15:11,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, he's wearing that.

3078
03:15:12,130 --> 03:15:12,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's wearing the VOG shirt.

3079
03:15:12,931 --> 03:15:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, do you know what print screen is?

3080
03:15:14,793 --> 03:15:14,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

3081
03:15:15,573 --> 03:15:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

3082
03:15:16,593 --> 03:15:17,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do know print screen.

3083
03:15:17,734 --> 03:15:18,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, look.

3084
03:15:18,414 --> 03:15:19,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Photoshop, right?

3085
03:15:19,274 --> 03:15:19,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I got it.

3086
03:15:19,875 --> 03:15:20,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

3087
03:15:21,115 --> 03:15:21,475
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

3088
03:15:21,595 --> 03:15:22,196
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll print screen.

3089
03:15:22,216 --> 03:15:22,996
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll just get that window.

3090
03:15:23,016 --> 03:15:23,316
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

3091
03:15:23,356 --> 03:15:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3092
03:15:23,636 --> 03:15:24,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I got them.

3093
03:15:24,256 --> 03:15:24,597
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

3094
03:15:25,397 --> 03:15:25,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo-hoo.

3095
03:15:25,857 --> 03:15:26,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

3096
03:15:27,418 --> 03:15:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I even have PaintShop Pro on this computer or whatever?

3097
03:15:30,039 --> 03:15:31,099
[SPEAKER_07]: God, PaintShop Pro.

3098
03:15:31,179 --> 03:15:31,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

3099
03:15:33,240 --> 03:15:34,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, PaintShop Pro.

3100
03:15:34,440 --> 03:15:35,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have MS Paint.

3101
03:15:36,561 --> 03:15:36,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

3102
03:15:36,921 --> 03:15:38,062
[SPEAKER_04]: You can paste it in paint.

3103
03:15:40,366 --> 03:15:41,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I got it.

3104
03:15:41,166 --> 03:15:41,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo.

3105
03:15:41,707 --> 03:15:43,947
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll save it as a paint thing and fix that up later.

3106
03:15:44,428 --> 03:15:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so anyhow.

3107
03:15:45,268 --> 03:15:46,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitmap!

3108
03:15:46,428 --> 03:15:47,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

3109
03:15:47,749 --> 03:15:48,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was I?

3110
03:15:48,469 --> 03:15:51,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to save it with the very clever untitled.bmp.

3111
03:15:52,471 --> 03:15:52,751
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3112
03:15:54,671 --> 03:15:56,632
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking... Ranma already took the damn picture.

3113
03:15:57,533 --> 03:15:59,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma's sadly not on a Mac.

3114
03:15:59,573 --> 03:16:07,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll continue to wear it to the end of the video broadcast, but as you can see, I am popping this bad boy open that has been in my freezer for the past two weeks.

3115
03:16:08,437 --> 03:16:09,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

3116
03:16:10,567 --> 03:16:14,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I pour this, I want to thank each and every single one of you.

3117
03:16:14,730 --> 03:16:18,973
[SPEAKER_11]: As everyone said before, if it wasn't for OLR, there wouldn't be no Anime Jam Session.

3118
03:16:20,594 --> 03:16:26,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I will not be one of those podcasters that will beg for money to do my show.

3119
03:16:26,779 --> 03:16:32,863
[SPEAKER_11]: What me, Mako, and Ari, what we all do, we do it for love, and we pick up all our money and we do it together.

3120
03:16:34,301 --> 03:16:37,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do it for dollar bills to show my tatas, but that's it.

3121
03:16:41,150 --> 03:16:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone did send me money one time.

3122
03:16:42,692 --> 03:16:43,573
[SPEAKER_07]: For showing your tatas?

3123
03:16:43,633 --> 03:16:43,853
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

3124
03:16:44,855 --> 03:16:45,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that for free.

3125
03:16:47,979 --> 03:16:49,140
[SPEAKER_03]: To Dan, to Dan.

3126
03:16:49,820 --> 03:16:50,620
[SPEAKER_07]: She does that for drinks.

3127
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,881
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, remember when I had Pump Up the Volume?

3128
03:16:53,201 --> 03:16:53,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

3129
03:16:53,602 --> 03:16:56,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki put it in my intro to tune in and give me a dollar?

3130
03:16:56,723 --> 03:16:57,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, somebody actually sent you a dollar.

3131
03:16:57,803 --> 03:16:58,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sent me a dollar.

3132
03:16:58,644 --> 03:16:59,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

3133
03:16:59,144 --> 03:16:59,764
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good times.

3134
03:17:01,405 --> 03:17:02,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, thank you so much for the toast.

3135
03:17:02,986 --> 03:17:11,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I was saying before to some of the other callers, that is really the ultimate compliment to hear that, you know, we might have inspired even a portion of somebody else's show.

3136
03:17:11,669 --> 03:17:13,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, it's outstanding.

3137
03:17:13,590 --> 03:17:14,771
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to come back for Afoname.

3138
03:17:14,811 --> 03:17:15,891
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just here having a good time.

3139
03:17:15,911 --> 03:17:16,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

3140
03:17:18,896 --> 03:17:19,657
[SPEAKER_07]: You cut out.

3141
03:17:19,697 --> 03:17:20,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Ranma.

3142
03:17:20,878 --> 03:17:24,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was going to say, OLR is not just a podcast.

3143
03:17:24,082 --> 03:17:25,744
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like a freaking family.

3144
03:17:26,064 --> 03:17:28,347
[SPEAKER_11]: A giant dysfunctional family.

3145
03:17:30,209 --> 03:17:31,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We put the fun in dysfunction.

3146
03:17:31,630 --> 03:17:32,171
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

3147
03:17:33,212 --> 03:17:34,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I will go on record right now.

3148
03:17:36,658 --> 03:18:05,854
[SPEAKER_11]: you guys really got me through the passing of my mother when I called that one night and asked for you guys to play Let's Screw that was one of my favorite songs you guys played it and I could not thank y'all enough for doing that I'm more than happy to do so especially if it'll help even just the slightest bit in somebody's really shitty day to put it lightly I'm happy to of course

3149
03:18:06,451 --> 03:18:11,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Now to Sky, Loki, DarkSakura.

3150
03:18:11,853 --> 03:18:16,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.

3151
03:18:16,474 --> 03:18:20,175
[SPEAKER_11]: If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you and here's to me.

3152
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:21,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you too, buddy.

3153
03:18:22,836 --> 03:18:24,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that puts you on the floor.

3154
03:18:24,417 --> 03:18:27,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That is seriously my second favorite toast ever.

3155
03:18:27,538 --> 03:18:28,198
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

3156
03:18:29,301 --> 03:18:32,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And before I go, I did say I have a little treat for you.

3157
03:18:32,722 --> 03:18:34,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I love your hand flailing, that's cute.

3158
03:18:34,383 --> 03:18:36,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was the treat.

3159
03:18:36,163 --> 03:18:40,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I just came back from a J-pop concert I got in for free, okay?

3160
03:18:40,865 --> 03:18:41,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

3161
03:18:42,825 --> 03:18:51,968
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was at PAX East, I happened to run into a famous nerdcore rapper, and I asked him to do a favor, and hopefully this will play through.

3162
03:18:53,529 --> 03:18:54,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And here we go.

3163
03:18:55,251 --> 03:18:59,894
[SPEAKER_12]: This is MC Frontalot and you are participating with the Voice of Geeks Network.

3164
03:19:01,995 --> 03:19:03,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut the front door!

3165
03:19:04,156 --> 03:19:05,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god!

3166
03:19:07,058 --> 03:19:09,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's amazing!

3167
03:19:10,920 --> 03:19:11,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

3168
03:19:13,081 --> 03:19:13,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you forever.

3169
03:19:15,546 --> 03:19:16,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm buying you drinks.

3170
03:19:17,027 --> 03:19:17,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it.

3171
03:19:18,008 --> 03:19:19,068
[SPEAKER_07]: New York, where we going?

3172
03:19:19,408 --> 03:19:20,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, bye.

3173
03:19:20,389 --> 03:19:21,590
[SPEAKER_11]: BRB, heading to New York.

3174
03:19:21,650 --> 03:19:22,550
[SPEAKER_07]: BRB, New York.

3175
03:19:24,271 --> 03:19:29,414
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to pick up Mako as you go because if you go take me without her, she's going to kick everybody's ass.

3176
03:19:29,454 --> 03:19:30,935
[SPEAKER_11]: BRB stopping in New Jersey.

3177
03:19:33,796 --> 03:19:35,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ranma, that was amazing.

3178
03:19:36,118 --> 03:19:36,818
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.

3179
03:19:36,838 --> 03:19:41,400
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been an amazing support over the years and thank you so much, buddy.

3180
03:19:41,561 --> 03:19:42,161
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even know.

3181
03:19:43,621 --> 03:19:56,290
[SPEAKER_11]: No, thank you, because you guys gave me this opportunity to do this, so me running around, finding these opportunities to give you guys bumpers, interviews, this and that, this is more than my way of saying thank you, you know, this is...

3182
03:19:57,850 --> 03:20:01,775
[SPEAKER_11]: All I ever wanted was to get my show on, and Rob, you gave me that opportunity.

3183
03:20:02,156 --> 03:20:05,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So believe it or not, I'm in your eternal thanks for all of this.

3184
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:07,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's the least I could do.

3185
03:20:09,125 --> 03:20:09,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3186
03:20:09,906 --> 03:20:10,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, my friend.

3187
03:20:10,787 --> 03:20:11,669
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to go wrap up.

3188
03:20:12,570 --> 03:20:13,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a marathon show.

3189
03:20:13,491 --> 03:20:13,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

3190
03:20:14,452 --> 03:20:15,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black, my brother.

3191
03:20:15,413 --> 03:20:16,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I will, absolutely.

3192
03:20:18,014 --> 03:20:18,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

3193
03:20:18,554 --> 03:20:19,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ranchan?

3194
03:20:20,274 --> 03:20:21,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Yasukachan.

3195
03:20:21,675 --> 03:20:22,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay drunk.

3196
03:20:24,676 --> 03:20:25,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, my friend.

3197
03:20:25,517 --> 03:20:26,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have the absinthe.

3198
03:20:27,257 --> 03:20:27,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3199
03:20:27,978 --> 03:20:30,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hitting hang up now because I've said bye like five times.

3200
03:20:30,579 --> 03:20:30,899
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3201
03:20:30,939 --> 03:20:32,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing.

3202
03:20:32,980 --> 03:20:34,480
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll always be my Ranchan.

3203
03:20:36,181 --> 03:20:36,881
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great show.

3204
03:20:37,762 --> 03:20:38,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting a little of the clemt.

3205
03:20:39,318 --> 03:20:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a last minute story I like these brownies, they're awesome

3206
03:20:53,368 --> 03:20:59,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say just kind of like a blanket thank you to the kind words on Twitter.

3207
03:20:59,332 --> 03:21:04,815
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of tweet activity tonight, and I just want to say a big thank you for all of that.

3208
03:21:05,655 --> 03:21:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the time yet because we're running way over to read each and every single one of them, but I just want to say thank you.

3209
03:21:11,659 --> 03:21:13,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly, some of these tweets real quick.

3210
03:21:14,400 --> 03:21:29,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft tweeting us about Shadowrun returns backers for the DRM free copy of the game may have gotten screwed by Microsoft and in a nutshell the game will be free but the original game will be DRM free but the DLC will not.

3211
03:21:30,791 --> 03:21:52,445
[SPEAKER_14]: so they're holding up their end of the bargain what it is is you get two versions of the game you get DRM free version of the game you get a Steam version of the game Steam version will support the DLC beyond the Kickstarter or Kickstarter exclusive DLC and then the free to play game or the DRM free game will only support the Kickstarter DRM or the Kickstarter DLC but no additional DLC

3212
03:21:53,793 --> 03:21:58,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw tweeting us that Ska Studios challenges the view that Microsoft is bad for indies.

3213
03:21:58,738 --> 03:22:01,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So not everybody is saying that Microsoft is this evil indie thing.

3214
03:22:02,621 --> 03:22:06,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf tweeting us about this is a travesty and a story about Disneyland.

3215
03:22:06,885 --> 03:22:11,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Space Mountain was closed while Disneyland reviews safety.

3216
03:22:11,449 --> 03:22:17,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Mountain, the Matterhorn bobsleds and Soarin' Over California were out of service today.

3217
03:22:17,434 --> 03:22:19,496
[SPEAKER_07]: What a shitty day to be at Disneyland.

3218
03:22:19,556 --> 03:22:20,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, we weren't there.

3219
03:22:20,777 --> 03:22:22,718
[SPEAKER_07]: You poor guys that went to Disneyland today.

3220
03:22:22,958 --> 03:22:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did reopen Matterhorn bobsleds already, which, you know, is kind of... I'm just still irritated they took out the basketball court.

3221
03:22:29,319 --> 03:22:29,960
[SPEAKER_03]: They did?

3222
03:22:30,260 --> 03:22:32,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they took out the basketball court when they redid the tracks.

3223
03:22:33,881 --> 03:22:41,743
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know their Disney trivia, the Matterhorn had a half court up in the very top of the mountain for cast members to go during their break.

3224
03:22:43,567 --> 03:23:04,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft tweeting us saying Forza Horizon getting a new free DLC pack called the 1000 Club I like free DLC, I'm on board with that Also, Actdeft tweeting us I think I went over his too, but that's okay A New Jersey Assemblywoman wants to ban violent video games in public places Yeah, was that the same one where they want to ban M-rated arcade games?

3225
03:23:04,573 --> 03:23:10,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they want to ban M-rated and AO-rated arcade games Problem being, the SRB does not rate arcade games

3226
03:23:11,115 --> 03:23:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to do your research How about if you don't like them don't take your children there And I just want to give some quick shout outs I know I said I wasn't going to read each and every one of these but we actually had some other fellow podcasters that tweeted us and said congratulations and I think it's important to give these guys a shout out because community makes us great and us indie podcasters we really really have to stick together so I do want to give a shout out to Godfrey from Gamertag Radio who sent a tweet earlier today

3227
03:23:39,941 --> 03:23:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and they've been going a very long time as well.

3228
03:23:42,283 --> 03:23:44,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they were one of the first shows on iTunes as well.

3229
03:23:44,644 --> 03:23:47,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's had many, many great accomplishments.

3230
03:23:47,826 --> 03:23:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to you, Godfrey.

3231
03:23:50,107 --> 03:23:53,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Buoy, who you heard slide kick earlier, also sent us a tweet.

3232
03:23:53,870 --> 03:23:57,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Those guys are a lot of fun, even though I think they should go weekly.

3233
03:23:57,452 --> 03:24:01,414
[SPEAKER_07]: But when they do put out a show, it is fabulous and very well researched.

3234
03:24:01,434 --> 03:24:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We always love when they put out.

3235
03:24:03,996 --> 03:24:05,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't love it when they put out?

3236
03:24:06,138 --> 03:24:09,541
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rich from the Video Game Show tweeted us and said congrats on 500.

3237
03:24:09,881 --> 03:24:24,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Video Game Show, I think, as far as I know, I could be wrong, but as far as I know, Video Game Show is the only other podcast in iTunes when it went live about gaming, the day it went live, that is still going.

3238
03:24:24,434 --> 03:24:25,415
[SPEAKER_07]: They're about to hit episode 400.

3239
03:24:26,656 --> 03:24:26,976
[SPEAKER_07]: and IndieRadio.

3240
03:24:55,591 --> 03:25:00,153
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course to our pal Bobby Blackwolf who's always before us here.

3241
03:25:00,194 --> 03:25:01,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Bobby so much.

3242
03:25:01,954 --> 03:25:03,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And Brad from PodCulture.

3243
03:25:04,135 --> 03:25:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Critical Myth who's hitting 300 episodes tomorrow.

3244
03:25:08,017 --> 03:25:08,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

3245
03:25:09,358 --> 03:25:15,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And Anime Jam Session and Horde House and Girls Gone Wow and British Invaders.

3246
03:25:15,621 --> 03:25:16,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Have I named everybody now?

3247
03:25:16,581 --> 03:25:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have.

3248
03:25:17,362 --> 03:25:18,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Under Station Live!

3249
03:25:18,142 --> 03:25:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god!

3250
03:25:18,602 --> 03:25:19,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Under Station Live!

3251
03:25:20,083 --> 03:25:22,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think that we would be here without them.

3252
03:25:22,745 --> 03:25:23,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that funny?

3253
03:25:23,806 --> 03:25:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

3254
03:25:24,106 --> 03:25:28,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that everybody's calling in saying, OLR, you inspired me to do this.

3255
03:25:28,389 --> 03:25:29,389
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR, you did this.

3256
03:25:29,429 --> 03:25:31,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is a good note for us to end on tonight.

3257
03:25:31,251 --> 03:25:31,511
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

3258
03:25:31,531 --> 03:25:33,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sit on this for a minute because I want to end on that note.

3259
03:25:33,952 --> 03:25:35,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me go around and get everybody's final thought.

3260
03:25:36,634 --> 03:25:38,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Becky, thank you so much for being here.

3261
03:25:38,095 --> 03:25:44,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you didn't get a chance to say an awful lot, but we really appreciate the culinary delights and your support still means the world to us.

3262
03:25:44,599 --> 03:25:45,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for being here.

3263
03:25:47,590 --> 03:25:48,390
[SPEAKER_20]: It's okay.

3264
03:25:48,530 --> 03:25:49,651
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a very quiet person.

3265
03:25:49,691 --> 03:25:50,111
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

3266
03:25:50,151 --> 03:25:52,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Any final thoughts for our listeners, though, while you're at it?

3267
03:25:52,932 --> 03:25:54,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Any last words of wisdom?

3268
03:25:57,193 --> 03:25:59,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't let your kids watch SpongeBob.

3269
03:26:01,174 --> 03:26:04,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It's horrible.

3270
03:26:04,315 --> 03:26:06,956
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight.

3271
03:26:07,076 --> 03:26:08,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, why the fuck not?

3272
03:26:08,257 --> 03:26:09,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

3273
03:26:09,955 --> 03:26:11,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, taking it back a notch.

3274
03:26:12,518 --> 03:26:13,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

3275
03:26:13,840 --> 03:26:14,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two things.

3276
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:15,902
[SPEAKER_14]: One, I have a picture of poop on my phone.

3277
03:26:16,042 --> 03:26:18,745
[SPEAKER_14]: And two... Wow.

3278
03:26:19,506 --> 03:26:22,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do this Mark Forrest style, motherfuckers.

3279
03:26:24,125 --> 03:26:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight, as promised, I want to say a lot of you gave props to us for helping inspire what you do.

3280
03:26:31,489 --> 03:26:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really have to say, and I got into this on Facebook a little bit before, but I really just want to say that I studied radio in college.

3281
03:26:39,352 --> 03:26:41,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually originally was going to be a weatherman.

3282
03:26:42,013 --> 03:26:44,495
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what I was in college to study originally.

3283
03:26:45,235 --> 03:26:51,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I interned at a broadcast station at an actual news broadcast in the town I went to school in.

3284
03:26:52,296 --> 03:27:03,085
[SPEAKER_07]: and although everybody was really nice and it was a really great eye-opening experience, the way my eyes were opened was that most people were very miserable in the jobs that they were doing and it really didn't want to be something I wanted to continue.

3285
03:27:03,465 --> 03:27:11,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of got into radio as a result of that, but I felt a lot of that same stuff that in commercial radio, it's really not about who you know, but it's about who you blow.

3286
03:27:12,112 --> 03:27:17,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And that wasn't really what I wanted, you know, contrary to what Jamie might tell you about when I drink, that wasn't really what I wanted to pursue.

3287
03:27:18,277 --> 03:27:18,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.

3288
03:27:18,697 --> 03:27:22,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't finish school because I am very jaded with a lot of it.

3289
03:27:23,039 --> 03:27:25,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was kind of like, what the hell am I wasting my time for?

3290
03:27:25,060 --> 03:27:26,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need to go out into the working world.

3291
03:27:27,021 --> 03:27:35,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And while I don't hate school and I think it's great that a lot of people do go to school and finish college and all that, for me at that time, it was what I needed to do and it was a great thing.

3292
03:27:35,385 --> 03:27:37,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love where I ended up in my career, so I'm happy.

3293
03:27:38,347 --> 03:27:45,850
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm really thankful to my time I did spend at the college radio station, my very first radio show at KCSC.

3294
03:27:46,431 --> 03:27:46,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

3295
03:27:47,311 --> 03:27:47,792
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

3296
03:28:05,094 --> 03:28:19,775
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was so much fun he asked me to come back and I came back over and over and over again and through him I learned how easy it was to do a show on live through CC5 and so I, like DJ Ranma was talking about with his show and what Codeman was talking about with his show and everybody else

3297
03:28:20,456 --> 03:28:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

3298
03:28:40,673 --> 03:28:41,894
[SPEAKER_07]: This show would not be the same without him.

3299
03:28:42,014 --> 03:28:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I do need to thank Travis too for having me on as a guest so much and filling in for Jessica.

3300
03:28:45,756 --> 03:28:46,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

3301
03:28:46,697 --> 03:28:47,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

3302
03:28:47,357 --> 03:28:53,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I guess this is in a way 500 episodes of paying it forward.

3303
03:28:53,781 --> 03:28:55,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So really appreciate it.

3304
03:28:56,002 --> 03:28:56,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what else to say.

3305
03:28:57,803 --> 03:28:59,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I see lots of great stuff in the chat room right now.

3306
03:29:00,084 --> 03:29:06,808
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR says, thank you guys for 500 great episodes and for devoting so much of your time and energy to contribute towards all of our lives, ours and yours.

3307
03:29:07,548 --> 03:29:13,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim TRP says, Rob, you have a voice for radio, a face for TV news, and a body for hardcore pornography.

3308
03:29:13,994 --> 03:29:14,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

3309
03:29:15,315 --> 03:29:16,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

3310
03:29:17,357 --> 03:29:17,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Tim.

3311
03:29:18,578 --> 03:29:19,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Tim.

3312
03:29:20,400 --> 03:29:20,760
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

3313
03:29:21,541 --> 03:29:22,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cry in a second, by the way.

3314
03:29:23,362 --> 03:29:23,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you?

3315
03:29:23,662 --> 03:29:24,863
[SPEAKER_07]: What else can I say to make you cry?

3316
03:29:24,924 --> 03:29:25,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

3317
03:29:27,586 --> 03:29:29,107
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone else brings up Shermie, maybe.

3318
03:29:29,928 --> 03:29:30,929
[SPEAKER_14]: The chips are gone.

3319
03:29:36,010 --> 03:29:38,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I think it's time we end the show.

3320
03:29:38,592 --> 03:29:40,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for 500 great episodes.

3321
03:29:41,214 --> 03:29:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try to be less sappy next week, you guys.

3322
03:29:43,376 --> 03:29:46,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I did pick something very, very, very classic for Cookie.

3323
03:29:47,138 --> 03:29:48,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.

3324
03:29:48,800 --> 03:29:49,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it.

3325
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:49,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

3326
03:29:50,181 --> 03:29:50,941
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you say, guys?

3327
03:29:51,141 --> 03:29:52,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do it all again next week, alright?

3328
03:29:53,343 --> 03:29:54,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on back next week for episode 501.

3329
03:29:55,505 --> 03:30:00,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, have a great week.

3330
03:30:00,829 --> 03:30:01,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be a dick.

3331
03:30:02,950 --> 03:30:04,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And have fun.

3332
03:30:04,111 --> 03:30:04,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a game.

3333
03:30:05,012 --> 03:30:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Goodnight.

3334
03:30:06,610 --> 03:30:09,632
