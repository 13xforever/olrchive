Tonight, April 7th, 2013, one landmark game studio is shut down, Donkey Kong Country Returns will get a little easier, and one series of tweets rocks the gaming world.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 499, April the 7th, 2013.
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games and gaming news and gaming lols and so forth with my co-host.
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
Greetings and salivations.
How you doing?
I'm full.
You're full?
I'm full!
What's that commercial?
Full of useless knowledge and gas.
No!
Rob, again, you're confusing me for your car.
My car has useless knowledge?
No, your car's full of gas.
Not right now, it ain't.
Well, with prices.
Anyway, I did my customary stop by Panda, and I have eaten a panda.
Well, you shouldn't eat pandas.
They're a species going extinct.
Because when you think of panda bears, orange chicken is so representative of Chinese culture.
Seriously.
If I go to China and order orange chicken, I wonder what kind of stares I'm going to get.
I've seen real Chinese food.
I don't think orange chicken is among real Chinese food.
I told you the story about my ex and my ex's family when it got really awkward one night, right?
Okay, wait, I'll tell this in a minute.
Okay, tell it in a minute.
First off, Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
Hi, how are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
Alright, you ready to hear awkward stories about my ex?
Alright, let's go.
Alright, here we go.
So my ex was Chinese, right?
Is this the ex I'm thinking of?
That area, right?
So the deal was we were going to go to Chinese food for dinner.
And they're all very out there.
They're all from Hong Kong, born and raised.
I think he moved here when he was 10 and so forth.
So we went and they had already ordered by the time we got there.
I guess we got there a little late or something.
And on the table is all this food.
And a lot of it is very seafood.
And it's a lot of dishes I haven't really had before.
And there's a fish on the plate with all the meat picked off and the bones.
But I'm like, all right, I'm going to...
I'm going to be cultured.
I'm going to just have a little bit.
So I'm putting just like a little bit of everything.
I just pick a little bit of everything and put it on my plate.
Not because I think it's gross.
I just want to try it, make sure I like it before I put a whole scoop.
And so his sister looks over at me and kind of has this epiphany.
You see this moment of like, oh no.
And looks at me and goes, oh, I'm so sorry.
Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
And I'm like, that's racist.
In a weird way.
Should I order you sweet and sour chicken or something?
Well, she's trying to be considerate, I suppose.
I know, but it's like, I'm trying to just sample, and we didn't order anything.
I ate, there was something there that I really liked, and I had a whole heaping of it.
Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.
See, I have no... If it's good enough for my ex, it was good enough for me, okay?
Well, when I was little in Alabama, I would go over to my friend Dom Noy's house, and her family's from Laos, and I have actually easier time eating Laotian food than actual real Chinese food, because I really can't recognize much of anything I'm eating.
I'm all for it.
I love food.
Food is a great gateway to different cultures around the world.
I will say, though, probably the only culture's food I'm never having again is Filipino.
Sorry.
Sorry, guys.
But Rob, I thought balut was your favorite.
Nope.
Nope.
And some of those dishes, nope.
Balut, Rob.
Sorry, but if you like it, more power to you.
Have you ever heard of virgin boy eggs?
have virgin boy eggs no they are eggs that have been marinated in the pee of young children so how about we move on let's talk about video games shall we
Yeah, that was pretty much it.
Just kind of hung around.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Do you eat a lot of Easter candy?
I was at Target the other day and it's all on sale, half off.
No, not really.
I didn't eat any.
We got one of those hollow rabbits and I haven't touched it.
Just don't care.
I heard there was some candy company suing another over those hollow rabbits or something.
I'm probably grossly simplifying it.
But anyway, we should probably get to gaming news.
That's what you all signed up for.
But I do want to say hello and how you doing to everybody in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
The other ever-present fourth guest on our show because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
And some comments in our chat room there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
AlanAlchemy in chat says, I imagine Nelly isn't really that about the pure sugar toddler crash and meltdown.
I'm sure she's fine without that in her life.
He had a lot of sugar yesterday.
We went over to her parents' house because they had a family over.
A lot of people haven't seen him yet.
He had some cake and stuff, and there's a lot of sugar in that.
He was jumping off the walls yesterday.
So he's going to be four?
Three?
Yeah.
Three.
Three?
Wow.
Have the terrible twos been that terrible?
He's been pretty... Yeah, it's not necessarily terrible, but it's just they start testing their limits.
Tiger Claw in chat saying, holy crap, episode 499, the pressure is really high to make episode 500 the most memorable.
Don't set the bar too high, you guys.
It's going to be all about DDR.
Don't put it too high.
There's a bar.
There comes a point.
You mean the bar we limbo under?
I'm going to let y'all in on a podcasting secret, all right?
So this goes out to all the other podcasters out there and everybody that wants to know what it's like to do a podcast.
All right, so you celebrate one year, you celebrate 100 episodes, you celebrate two years, you celebrate three years, 200, 300.
You know, there comes a point where you're just sick of celebrating.
It's like birthdays.
Like after your 21st birthday, you're like, what do I have left to celebrate?
The fact that my car insurance went down?
Do you realize I take an entire week off for my birthday?
Maybe you're not the best example I am not the best example However, I have gotten the confirmation from my BFF That we will be having red velvet brownies God, Becky, I love you I am buying the red food coloring because she will not
Why not?
Because it's like, I don't know.
Is it that whole it's not safe thing?
I have no idea, but she never has a reason for it.
But I found out that the recipe calls for two whole ounces.
Well, I appreciate anyone willing to put their morals aside.
I was going to the baking store to buy like a gallon jug.
That's why you need to use virgin blood.
It's just virgin boy eggs.
Did I tell you the story about my friend Diane making a red velvet cake?
No, but here we go with food again.
We will get to games at some point, right?
We will get to games.
Alright.
Okay, so she was living in northern Alabama at the time and making a red velvet cake and the Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door and she had just gotten done cutting the cake with a butcher knife while listening to tubular bells so she opened the door with a WHAT?!
This is the same person, by the way, who joined our WoW guild.
Oh, fantastic.
Gwen.
Yeah, I love Gwen.
She was nice.
Yeah, she told you all the embarrassing stories about me in college, too.
So that is always, whenever I think of Red Velvet, I always think of the expression on her face when she told that story.
It was priceless.
All right, here's a good transition comment in our chat room from CriticalMyth, live.vognetwork.com, saying, This is foreshadowing, isn't it?
After 500, it's all about food and the video games they play while eating that food.
That's what it's been about.
Where have you been?
And I wish to remind everyone, and I've told this story a billion times on the show, but how was OLR born?
Because Jamie, Matt, and I all used to play DDR all night, and then what did we do?
We went right over to the cafe in the parking lot and shoved our faces full of, what, tortilla soup and mozzarella sticks.
And Matt with his glass of, not this one, you remember Tall Matt?
Yeah.
With his glass of Merlot.
Yes, Tall Matt.
With his glass of Merlot.
I like a glass of Merlot.
Is it Merlot?
Is it Merlot?
Is it Merlot?
Like suddenly he's French.
Alright, anyhow.
Or how Dan goes, Merlet.
TigerClaw on chat says, for episode 500, are you guys taking voicemails with messages for congratulating you guys?
That's really sweet, but no.
Well, we have something else planned.
I'll talk about that later.
But my ego, Rob.
What?
You know what?
You can send a message congratulating Jamie.
Yeah, send me a message and send me money with it.
Alright.
Again, I'm just saying, after so many episodes, you have to mix it up a little bit.
Alright.
Let's get into gaming.
Yes, it is a show about video games, believe it or not.
I play more games, Rob.
You play more games?
Well, we'll get into Gaming Week, but we have to do the pre-Gaming Week banter.
Okay, okay.
and since we were off last week this week's pre-week or pre-gaming week banter will consist of last week's news set to holic it's a new segment last week yes it's a new segment we're debuting on OLR tonight it's called last week's news set to holic and in this segment we will recap last week's news set to holic so here we go last week's news
Last week in gaming news, the Phantom Pain was revealed to be Metal Gear Solid V. What?
To no one's surprise.
David Hayter apparently wasn't asked to be a Metal Gear Solid V, but it's very interesting because he signed his letter about why he's not in it April 1st.
Hmm, so to be continued on that.
And I really thought it was strange that they went with Bobcat Goldwage, you know, to do the voice, but hey, I trust them.
Why did you hear Bobcat?
I thought they got Gilbert Gottfried.
On the Sony PlayStation 4 Game Developers Conference, more information about friends, system sharing, and the unit or interface.
Nothing too earth-shattering, I thought, except the whole, you have your PlayStation name and your real name, but the real name comes off of Facebook.
Ha ha.
Oh, is that like YouTube where they're trying to get me to use my real name?
I'm like, no.
And they're like, let's tell you more about this.
Oh, I'm sorry.
There's no option not to do that.
Miyamoto teased that a Nintendo theme park could be a possibility.
But, you know, a lot of things could be a possibility.
Will it be called Nintendo Land?
Capcom wants to work with WayForward again.
but probably that'll only happen if DuckTales actually sells a lot of copies.
Speaking of DuckTales Remastered, it was announced that DuckTales Remastered is in consideration for the PC.
Yay!
And lastly, on Kickstarter, Big Blue from the Echo the Dolphin team trying a Kickstarter there for something new.
There it is, last week's news.
That Kickstarter is a little too tree-hugger for me, though.
we need to worry about the planet and all this stuff and we just we're not necessarily making a game now listen if I wanted a game that was like Echo the Dolphin but not Echo the Dolphin I would here's the next evolution in the game and it's already been made this is the best part about it it's called Laser Dolphin yes Laser Dolphin does exist and it's Echo the Dolphin with a giant fucking laser in your head and that's seriously what it is and they have turtles with goddamn dynamite stuck to them and stuff it's Laser Dolphin that sounds like my kind of game Laser Dolphin
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But I'm going to start with Mass Effect because I played Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I've been busy modding.
I'm actually also using Mass Effect 3 for art references.
I don't know if you saw the crap I've been posting.
I played, I finally, finally bought the game that we talked about on our British Friends podcast that we guested on last week.
I downloaded Drunken Robot Pornography.
It is the greatest game in the universe.
It seriously, it's like, okay, you know...
There's a quote for the back of the box.
Okay, you know my overwhelming love for jumping flash?
It's like jumping flash with guns.
Not, you know, shooting carrots at things, but like actual pew-pew die lasers.
And what you have to do is you get these, like, ginormous big robots, but you have to get a number of points before the robot will appear.
They're called titans.
and they have these long appendages and they shoot lasers everywhere and other shit tries to kill you and it's really fucking hard so I finally beat the second stage after a week of trying and I did it while live streaming so I didn't totally embarrass myself okay I was like okay I quit I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm not playing the game I'm not gonna do it live again until I'm sure I can beat the third level
and then um I uh I got something else oh I finally went ahead and downloaded Gratuitous Space Battles but I haven't played it yet I just like the name and uh I'm thinking I'm still thinking about getting Hotline Miami just because all the blood and shooting shit that's really fun good times I played WoW
Oh, that's right.
I saw you log in the other night.
I was like, well, I'm paying for it.
May as well play it.
That's right.
I'm still debating quitting it.
I might wait for another MMO that I am not supposed to let any indication out that I've actually seen it in motion.
So I'm waiting for that to come out before I reserve my judgment and see if I actually jump off the WoW bandwagon.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what I found though when I was, okay, I got a whole, we went to Dan's mom's house where most of the vault is in storage and I was tearing things up looking for my light box which I could not find.
I found a bag full of my art supplies but when I opened it to go through it when I got home, I found a demo disc for a Magic the Gathering card game.
Oh, the old school one on PC?
The old school one, the demos that we got at E3 that first year.
That game was, oh no, that's not as old school.
There was one I bought at Software Etc.
back in like 97 or 98.
That game was bomb.
It came with the giant card from the Astral Deck or whatever.
And you know what else I found in there?
Actually, speaking of magic, I found my Japanese Legends.
The only set of my magic cards that I never sold off.
DarkSakura, you might be a nerd.
Just saying.
So that was really it.
Then let's go to Loki.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Dingo Games
Yes, free download or you can buy it for $20.
But please don't buy it for $20.
That's really a waste of $20.
So let's see.
This week I didn't play any Bioshock Infinite because I was playing other things.
I did end up playing quite a bit of Saints Row the Third, just trying to kind of 100% everything on the PC.
Although I don't know why because it's like I sort of did that or I almost did that on the 360, but then I got...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The last mission is kind of cool, but it's just so quick.
The first mission, you're searching for this clone of Johnny Gat, who's actually this brute.
And then it just goes by so fast.
It's basically one of those, oh, someone's driving the car.
You have to fire the rockets out of the back.
Okay, cool.
I've done that in a bunch of other missions already.
Then the second mission, you have a cross-dressing guy who's singing some Aisha songs.
And then you have to fire this B-gun at people.
Which is cool, I like the B-Gun, but that's the only mission you get it in.
You don't unlock it for playing the rest of the game.
That's the only thing you get that weapon in, and it's stupid.
And then the last mission is kind of cool, where you have the superhero powers.
It's kind of almost like a preview of 4.
Aren't there a lot of video games where there might be a special stage, and you're like, why can't the whole game just be this?
Saints Row The Four
Saints Row 4 I think we should call it Saints Row the 4th why not?
Saints Row 4 and I'm just so cautious about it because they're like oh yeah we have this big DLC plan well all your DLC has sucked it's really sucked like $7 for 30 minutes of gameplay is really crappy I mean that is just absolutely terrible
That's actually worse than movies.
I mean, you can't go to a theater and watch a movie for seven bucks anymore.
Maybe a matinee.
I was going to say matinees are $5.50.
But I don't really count that, though, because you have to buy popcorn.
Popcorn counts.
You have to have popcorn.
You can't watch a movie without popcorn.
Um, okay, anyway, so, I've been playing some of that, and, you know, here's the other thing, I got really frustrated with one of the missions, because I couldn't, um, the lag or whatever from, like, rain and stuff was causing, my rockets weren't firing fast enough, so, thankfully, since I'm playing on the PC version, I can mod the weapons one there, up to my liking, so I made my rocket launcher fire a lot faster, and lock on a lot faster, so, it's now acceptable for my use.
Um, let's see what else.
And then I played a little bit of, um, very little bit of Defiance.
I spent most of the time doing the typical MMO launch stuff, whereas installing the game and then...
Updating the game and then I connected to the servers and played for about 30 minutes going through the tutorial portion of the game which is fucking boring and the game itself is not very exciting right now either but I mean I am in the tutorial section of the game so I don't expect it to be that exciting but like I
I noticed the enemies respawning almost instantly.
I shoot a guy and pops up another one.
I'm like, okay, that's a little weird.
But sure, okay, we'll go.
That happens in a lot of MMOs when they're first out, though, and the newbie areas are really camped.
It's strange.
The thing I do like about it, though, is it's not necessarily a game that's just all stat-based, like Final Fantasy or I'm sure WoW to a certain extent.
You actually, it will help you if you have first person shooter skills because you're actually aiming your weapon and firing and doing all the dodging and stuff like that.
So it's like a third person shooter but you have an MMO.
However, because it is just launched and like anything that's online and especially with MMOs, the servers were a little spotty and so I got kicked off the server about 30 minutes in and then I couldn't connect to it again.
I haven't really tried.
I was going to play this weekend, but I forgot my hard drive that I installed the game to at my work.
And so I was unable to play it last night and today.
But I'm hopefully going to get into it a little bit more this week.
And then I picked up Borderlands 2 on PC because it was $25 for the Borderlands 2 and the Season Pass.
And so I'm probably going to start that again on PC, even though I've beaten it twice on the 360.
They've upped the level cap, didn't they?
Yeah, but it just makes everything... It doesn't really do anything.
It just makes the enemies harder.
Like, have more life.
Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, is Defiance a buy-once game or a monthly sub?
Buy-once.
Nice.
Yeah, so it's buy-once, and then you can play it for whatever.
The other thing, too, is, I mean, if you're into... If you want to kind of help yourself out in the game, there's these shift... Not shift codes.
There are these...
I did that like a few weeks ago and so that helped me out quite a bit although I haven't gotten any of that stuff yet but it's gonna help me out so whenever I get to that
but the game they say it's sort of like um sort of like Borderlands I guess you know because the way it plays and it's sure a ripoff I mean at the beginning it seemed like such a ripoff of Borderlands like you start off and you're this arc hunter instead of a vault hunter and you know um there's this
AI person that only you can see that's helping you out.
Your imaginary friend.
Come on, this is totally Halo and fucking Borderlands.
They just completely ripped the plots out of there.
And the other thing, and I don't know if this ties into those whole microtransactions for things.
The characters that you can create, their character creator or whatever, where you can tweak the appearance and everything, sucks.
It looks all like this really ugly, old-ass person.
And I'm thinking that you can buy better facial features or something like that later on.
Buy a better face.
Hey, just like real life.
No, seriously, because it's like I couldn't get anything that looked interesting.
It just all looked like this grisly dude.
I mean, it's like, okay, here's the three different face types.
And it's like, okay, those are all crap.
It's like different layers of, you know, crap.
So, whatever, you know, I'm actually looking at the dude's face, you know, while I'm playing the game anyways.
Okay.
But I don't know.
It'd be something I'm interested in.
I'm just hoping more people I know are actually playing it because right now it kind of sucks just playing the game by yourself.
Extra First Partner's playing it.
That's the only other person I know that's playing it.
Yeah.
He seems to like it, though.
Yeah, I'm just willing to check it out.
I mean, hopefully it'll drop in price and then people will be able to pick it up because we're going to have $60 on PC.
It's kind of expensive.
Well, a game can be a shameless ripoff and still be fun.
That's true.
I didn't have high standards for it anyways, or a high bar set for it, because it's based off a sci-fi show.
I mean, come on.
It's sci-fi.
No one's expecting gold from sci-fi.
You know what sci-fi shows are like.
I wish it was as awesome as the sci-fi movies they do, like Sharktopus and stuff.
That would be kind of cool.
By the way.
Who doesn't want to play an MMO like Sharktopus?
Or just like a weird monster thing.
I said yes!
Thanks for watching!
Yes!
That one rules!
It was six bucks at Dimple and I came really close to getting it for you.
And I gotta say that the woman alien that they have in this show, and I understand that she's not supposed to be like this sex symbol or whatever in this thing.
She is fucking ugly.
I mean, she is the ugliest weirdest looking alien thing ever.
It's like this dreadlocked man-woman thing.
I don't even know what it is.
It's just weird.
She probably thinks humans look weird too.
It's just like, I couldn't possibly watch this show and have to stare at this thing.
I always love an excuse to play a clip from Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
Holy shit!
Okay, I have to get this movie.
Okay, Rob.
The shark eats the plane!
Rob, we need to get that movie.
And I have Battle Royale on Blu-ray now.
We need to do the really stupid violent movie...
Birdemic 2.
They're making a sequel to Birdemic.
I don't know if you know Birdemic.
Birdemic, shock and awe.
It was this movie where this guy thought it was actually really good and their CG birds are like clip art birds.
Like GIF birds that fucking flip.
And the guy literally thinks that his movie is so fucking fantastic and he wanted a sequel and he did the birds exactly the same way.
They're just shit.
It's absolute shit.
That's what the station needs, you know?
We need a shitty movie podcast.
It's funny, you should bring that up.
I was going to do a joke and it's gone.
Alright, let's move on.
Do you have anything else for your gaming week?
No, that's it.
My son played Angry Birds.
It's a slippery slope.
Is it his first game?
Yeah, he sort of figured.
I mean, he had it a little bit.
I had a video of him trying it out because his cousins were there.
And so they were showing them on their iPads.
And he started doing it okay.
And then he started launching them backwards.
So I don't really know if he gets the game yet.
But it's a slippery slope, man.
Those kids are so fucking into Angry Birds.
Man, that is just some scary cultist shit.
Julian plays it too.
And then it takes over their lives.
He also has gotten pretty good at Pac-Man.
Oh, cool.
Like Championship Edition or Old School?
Like whatever the Flash version on that education site that he goes on is, but it's like a, it's Pac-Man.
And which Angry Birds you say?
Well, he started off playing Angry Birds Seasons, but then he tried Angry Birds Star Wars.
They had all of them, so, you know.
Of course, of course.
Back in my day, you played Number Munchers and you liked it.
Josh and Apple 2E
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and some of the stages it kind of changes the mechanic a little bit where you have left right up and down in it too and it is just like Space Channel 5 which was kind of awesome so Harmonite is kind of like a little bit of a platformy music thing meets Space Channel 5 and that's pretty cool to me
and some of the 3D effects.
Pretty good.
It's made by the guys who make Pokemon, so that's kind of interesting that they have some stages that'll have the gym battle theme and some of that stuff, but that's kind of whatever.
I don't super care about that stuff, but I know there's some people that get really excited about it.
So, yeah.
I like Harmonite for $15, not bad, and I love music games.
Not a lot of multiplayer mechanics or anything like that, so it is very much a single-player game, but I think $15 is an appropriate price for it.
Another game I played is a free-to-play game on PlayStation 3.
Yeah, PlayStation 3 has a handful of free-to-download stuff and play.
DC Universe is one of them and that crappy Free Realms or whatever it's called.
Jetpack Joyride Temple Run vs. Techno Kitten Adventure
That's all you do, and you go up and down.
And you collect coins, you dodge these lasers and rockets and other things, and you use those coins to buy upgrades, which you get at a very slow pace, or you can spend real money and get them at a much faster pace.
It's like the Temple Run mechanic.
Well, yeah, it was on the iOS and Android already, so yeah, that's why.
The graphics, very 16-bit retro-inspired, but I gotta admit...
As much as that sounds like it all might be crap, the game is stupid addicting.
Like it is just so stupid addicting.
And it's addicting in that way that like classic video games are addicting.
Like, you know, think back to a game that was on the Atari 2600.
Usually it was just one gimmick, but you would sit there for hours trying to improve your score.
Think of a game like, I don't know, Stampede, right?
People would drop 40 bucks to get Stampede on the Atari 2600.
and all it is is the little horse runs and you lasso up the other horses or the, I'm sorry, the cows or you run into the cows to kind of make them go further out in the field and that's the game.
That's the whole game and yet you would sit there and play it more and more and more and try to increase your score and that, like, I don't know, like, I sat there and played Jetpack Joyride for like an hour at least earlier today just to try and top the leaderboard which I did do on my friends list.
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.
So, yeah, I gotta say, it's free.
Why not?
And it's got trophies.
So, hey, I can't really talk too bad about Jetpack Joyride.
I don't think I'd go spend a lot of money on it, but, you know, if somebody wanted to to get ahead, then more power to you.
It's your money.
Spend it on whatever you want.
Um, I thought there was one other game I wanted to talk about before I talk about a classic.
Oh, I guess I'll talk about this other free to play game because Alan always teases me about it.
And that's Guardian Cross, which is this, um, it's like a, it's, it's by Square Enix and it's a trading card game.
And I'm making little quote fingers when I say that trading card game, because it is not like magic and it is not like even like Hearthstone or whatever other types of trading card games you can think of because all the battles are automatic.
so it's all just about making your cards as powerful as possible but yet I can't stop hunting down the little animals and playing that game and turning them into cards and then combining the cards together and then the whole NPC story and it's Square Enix so all the artwork's really good and the music's good too and yeah so I've been suckered into that but like any it plays just like a freaking Facebook game and like any Facebook game I'll be really into it for like two weeks and then I'll be like what the fuck is this fuckery and then stop playing it.
That'll be the story of Guardian Cross.
So...
One other classic game I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy V, also on iOS now.
A total remake.
This is different because Final Fantasy I on iPad and II were based off the PSP version, III and IV off the DS version, but there has not been a Final Fantasy V remake save the Game Boy version, the Game Boy Advance version.
And that's the version that this is closest to is because it has the extra dungeon and all that, but they've totally redone the sprites and
and all that and it looks great like especially I have an iPad that has the retina display and it looks gorgeous the controls not bad they've changed it so that your characters move in eight directions but basically you put your thumb anywhere what is this eight directions that you speak of I know witchcraft
There's only up, down, left, and right.
I know, right?
But actually, it really helps the whole touch thing because you basically put your thumb anywhere on the screen and that's where the joystick is and then you move it and then we lift your thumb.
You don't have a joystick anymore until you put your thumbs down again.
So, you know, that's...
The controls actually work.
And they went back and redid the battles so that the whole battle is by touch.
My only bitch about that is that they should have made enough room for all the possible squares that can appear.
Because right now, let's say you have a mage that has, like, you know, an ability and then white magic and black magic.
Because, you know, in Final Fantasy V you can learn one job and then...
DarkSakura can't count everybody.
Hey.
No, I'm just going to all the wank.
I would bet that they're going to do Final Fantasy VI in a style like this for the holiday.
V is probably testing the waters a little bit.
It's a little more expensive.
It's $16.99.
It is iPad and iPhone universal.
It's a universal app, which some of their older games weren't.
So I'm happy about that.
But I love the battle system in V. I love the way that you can kind of mix and match the jobs because it really reminds me of when Final Fantasy went MMO in Final Fantasy XI.
which by the way had an expansion come out this last week and so of course Shane hits me up on the internet and says Rob you should come back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion I want to play a Geomancer and I want someone to play with Rob Rob you should come back you should come back and I'm like no I'm not coming back no no no finally we cut a deal I said all right
if I'm going to do something I don't really want to do and you're going to do something you really don't want to do I will come back to Final Fantasy XI for one month if you buy Civilization V next time it's on sale and he said deal and then he even went and played the demo for Civ V and he's like oh it's not that bad it is kind of like SimCity I'm like I told you
but anyway so my part of the deal was to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little while so I have been playing that with the I didn't buy the expansion though Shane has it and so I've been playing with him a little bit and I've looked at his Geomancer and Runefencer and I'm like alright cool new jobs but otherwise I've been leveling my Corsair and she's level 37 now it was double XP weekend this weekend and we were fighting mobs and dungeons duoing and leveling up
So, you know, that part's really fun.
The job system in Final Fantasy XI is insanely fun.
And a lot of the classes are really good.
And I love the fact that there's so many mix and match that is really viable in Final Fantasy XI.
Like, it used to have to be like, oh no, you don't play a Corsair without a Ranger sub.
You just, you don't do it.
You're an idiot.
If you don't do a Corsair with Ranger sub, that's how you have to do it.
But now it's like, okay, you can kind of actually do Corsair Dancer makes a lot of sense.
Corsair Black Mage, Corsair Red Mage.
There's a lot of different possibilities, and so that I really enjoy.
I still think the game is missing so many quality of life things that make other MMOs more enjoyable, such as World of Warcraft, which you all know I play a lot, or even other MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and things like that.
A lot of it has to do with travel, and the battle system is still kind of slow, especially when you're soloing and duoing.
No jokes.
It takes me two minutes to take out a mob by myself at level 37.
I know it doesn't sound like a long time, but it's slow when you have to kill six of them in order to get one bag of experience, basically.
Is being a white mage still hell on earth?
Um, no.
Because it's just the way people level at the earlier levels is so different now.
You're in a party with 18 people and it's just like, alright, as long as you're carrying somebody, people are fine.
There's like hardly any tanks in those parties.
Do they still have the text macro system?
Oh yeah, that's all.
That really got on my nerves after a while just because I'd have all my text macro set up before casting and no, we're not gonna come and get healed and buffed and blah blah.
So I'm like, fine, quit.
If you use a controller, it's actually really easy now to set up a macro that does cure and then you use up and down to select which party member you want to cast it on.
I think that's hilarious because back when I was playing it, I played on a controller.
You're like, no, you gotta play on a keyboard.
You can't do your macros without a keyboard.
I'm like, watch me flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, trigger finger.
I'm going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.
Cial in chat says, DarkSakura, a healer in any game is a pain, I would imagine.
Not necessarily for WoW.
It depends on your healing class.
In World of Warcraft, it can be super fun, actually.
I actually like healing paladins, but I really did not like playing a priest.
See, I love priest damage healing with atonement.
After they changed the Smackdown priest, you know, what was it, Disc Priest?
Shadow?
Oh, Disc, yeah, yeah.
I like Shadow.
Shadow was fun for leveling, but Disc Priest, they completely buffed him up for Panda.
Ragenator in chat says, I remember that being in Valkrym Dunes was hell on earth.
Well, that's gone.
People don't do that anymore.
You go to Gusken Mines and you level in a group with 18 people and what happens is everybody level sinks.
Sounds like a clusterfuck.
It kind of is, but it's... Well, we live stream some of it.
If you've been watching the Twitch TV Orange Lounge Radio, we live streamed some earlier this week so you can see this in action.
um but uh yeah we we played some of that and uh you basically level sync to someone who's around level 15 because everyone gets the xp it's just that everybody's abilities are set to level 15 and then they're just pulling skeletons over and over and it's called book burning because every zone now has a book that has five or six pages and a page will say like in Guskin Minds it says kill six members of the skeleton family do you want to repeat and you hit yes so you just kill skeletons over and over and over again and every time you kill six you
You got 600 XP.
You got 700 XP.
All the way up to, I think, 1,200 is the cap around there or something like that.
And then it's just you do that over and over again.
And before you know it, you're level 35.
And now you're going to Crawler's Nest to do the same thing.
It's crazy.
People leveled to 99 in like two weeks now.
That just takes out some of the fun, but then again... No.
But then again, you know me, the queen of impatience on Wellnet.
Well, no.
I'm still 87.
SSJ100Matt says, yeah, you guys were in the mines for two plus hours.
That's true, but in that time, we went from level 12 to level... I want to say I was 26 by the time we were out of there.
And compared to the... In Valkyrum Dunes parties, I was lucky to go from 12 to 14 in two hours.
Remember Valkyrum Dunes parties, Loki?
Yeah.
Remember that?
Yeah.
Is that that place that's like right outside the main starting area that you used to make me start in?
It was the... No.
The stupid desert that had the port, the docks out on the side?
Okay, I remember that.
You know me.
I don't know what places are called.
I just know landmarks.
That's not a thing anymore.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
No, Gusken Mines is the scary... You would go in there and you would hear this siren go off randomly that sounds like the siren from Silent Hill.
Oh no, I never went there.
I just went to this other place when one of my friends in New York was playing with me that had like a Bahamut running around.
Oh, like a summoner or something?
No, it was just like a big like uber creature that would follow around and we tried to take him out at 14.
No, that wasn't smart.
That wasn't going to happen.
All right.
Anyway, that's enough talk about a game that's like 11 years old.
So let's get into... Like us.
Ha ha ha.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you should check that out because it's hosted by Syl from Girls Gone Wow.
I love Syl.
And Razorbug who's, you know, a part of that whole, you know, kind of, he does a lot of the Warcraft other stuff too.
Yes.
And he's great.
And we had a really good time.
So it's, I think, the only time all three of us guessed.
No.
If you go back to like some of the E3 specials back when it was the all games, all that stuff, I'm pretty sure we all guessed it on a couple shows doing that.
But
I forgot to write down the episode number.
Did anyone catch what episode number it is?
La la la la la
Look for the one that went up April 2nd, I think was the day it went up.
That was indeed because it was the day after.
No, it wasn't.
Was it April 2nd?
Yeah, it was the day after April Fool's.
We taped it on April Fool's.
Okay.
Alrighty, also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course next week is episode 500 And everybody keeps asking us, what are you going to do?
And the answer is, we're going to do a show Like we always do There you go Alright, let's talk about some video game news I'm going to be in a red velvet brownie coma That's true We're getting food made for us, that's a great reward And my friend Carly might come and bring German chocolate cake
You know, I need to be losing weight right now.
Alright, anyhow.
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, radio.
Let's go to some gaming news, because there were some pretty big things that happened this week, right, Loki?
Yes, LucasArts was closed by Disney, and their quote is...
After evaluating our position in the games market we decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model minimizing the company's risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.
um as a result or as a result of this change we had layoffs across the organization we're incredibly appreciative and proud of the talented teams who have been developing our new titles so basically instead of now you know making everything in-house they're going to license off their properties to other developers to make games for it so it's not like you're not going to see any more Star Wars games it's just you may see Star Wars games from EA although actually I guess we kind of already have seen that
or other companies.
And I would assume that also includes other properties like Maniac Mansion and all those adventure games that no one else makes except for, you know, Telltale Games.
And of course, as a result of that, Star Wars 1313 is on hold because obviously they're not developing in-house anymore.
Is it on hold or did they just cancel it?
It is halted.
So it's still going to come out, I think, just maybe a while.
All depends on who picks it up.
Well... Well... Who of us saw this happening?
Because, I mean, I was like, you know they're going to start closing things and making changes and... I don't know.
I didn't really necessarily think that they were going to do it.
I didn't think it would happen that fast.
I don't know, I had a feeling, but...
It sucks.
I don't like talking about things where people lose their jobs and so forth, but maybe the management was not picking the right games to greenlight.
Who is it that Disney usually goes for for their development, though, for all of their proprietary games?
Well, all over the map, really.
I mean, think about it.
Disney has their own studios.
I know, but I mean, I'm trying to think.
I thought they closed them.
They worked with Bethesda, too, for a while.
That's the interesting thing, is that this might not be as... Besides the job loss, which sucks, the other half of this might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is, because it's not like Disney doesn't license its stuff out pretty liberally.
uh even last week uh excuse me two weeks ago when we were last live on the show what game was everybody excited about two weeks ago what was everybody losing their shit over at PAX East
DuckTales, Freemastered
I just would hope that whoever they're going to choose for more of their publishing that they really go look at a company with a good reputation The depressing part of this though is that the games that those of us that are PC nerds really remember so fondly from the 90s such as Loom, Maniac Mansion, all the things that LucasArts did back in the day I don't know what can come of that
I'm completely, I think, in a kind of a sore spot over the whole thing just because I'm actually more worried about ILM, about what's going to happen with that.
Because I have, ever since I was a little kid, I have had, I guess, the big girl boner for ILM.
I wanted to work for them.
I wanted to grow up and work for ILM.
And, you know, that didn't happen.
But when we went to the Skywalker Ranch, you remember my friend Krista?
She used to work for LucasArts.
Worked on KOTOR.
And I got to go to Skywalker Ranch and bought my ILM shirt and everything.
And was in meatloaf flicking distance of George Lucas.
And if I had known then what I know now, I would have just kidnapped him and cloned him and made my own robot George.
No more prequels!
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This crushes all the Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts 3 talk.
Not necessarily Not at all, actually No I think it's quite the opposite I think there's a greater chance of something like that happening now I went in Indiana Jones level in Kingdom Hearts Now it's just a matter of getting to a Kingdom Hearts 3 square I know, they can't count either That's the part you should be concerned about They're hanging out with Valve these days, I think 3, we don't know what 3 is, her
I've seen people on Facebook that are like, Boycott Disney!
This is bull!
I'm just kind of like, Dude, you guys are hanging on to memories from the 90s.
Believe me, as I get older, I understand that.
But if you look at what LucasArts has done in the past few years, from a business perspective...
We did see it coming.
Game Developers Conference for one.
There's a lot of that great stuff that goes on where I feel like there'll at least be opportunities and the game developers are looking out for each other because unfortunately it can be a very volatile industry.
So I really hope that it has a happy ending for those folks at least.
Was that it?
Did we talk about the Star Wars 1313 part?
Yes, you did.
Sorry, I missed it.
Do you think that will happen?
Yeah, I think it will happen still.
You know what, though?
I'm just... The other thing with the changes, too, is that since they're wiping out the book canon, I know a lot of people who are pissed off.
There is a lot of nerd rage going on over the book canon.
Well, wiping out the canon's a bit extreme.
I don't think you should disrespect the book universe and all this, but the talk of making one of those books Star Wars 7, that was never going to happen.
That was never going to happen.
Like, that is way too...
there's way too much like I tried getting into the Star Wars books and I maybe read like one of the first trilogies and after that I was like no I can't do this anymore because it's just completely gone you know you sit and read the Star Wars wiki where they go through all the stuff about the books I was like okay I'm done it's way out of hand but they've built up that much lore and just to sort of dismiss it
Look at what Abrams did with Star Trek.
A lot of people were pissed about what was going to happen there, but I think it turned out great.
But he did stay with established lore.
They set an alternate universe.
Yeah, exactly.
But did he feel the need to turn a book into a movie?
No.
And now his universe has spawned new books.
In the new universe.
Yeah.
Anyhow.
Let's move on.
Let's talk about Harmonix.
Kind of had a bit of a uh-oh this week.
And I even got an email about this because I'm registered on rockband.com.
But yeah, Harmonix sent out an email.
If you're registered on rockband.com or dancecenter.com, you probably got this.
Servers went down over the weekend because of a third-party attack.
Not saying who did this, but somebody was trying to get into the servers.
Yeah.
Passwords for all these websites have been reset as a precautionary measure, so you're going to have to change your password when you log into the site again.
Note that no user's information was published or misused that they found.
Harmonix doesn't keep credit card or social security, I mean they didn't have any of that, so your personal information is not really at risk.
However...
As is good practice, if you use the same password on Harmonix, like if you use the same email password on that site that you use somewhere else, you probably want to change it.
Like your bank, if your bank password matches your Harmonix password.
If you use your bank password on anything video game related, then stop doing that.
Honestly, people, if you're going to make any of your passwords unique, your bank password needs to be unique and your PayPal password needs to be unique.
Not the same as your bank password.
They need to be separate.
don't ever ever ever use and your email password that's the third one because I'm going to say don't ever ever ever use your email password anywhere else because 99% of the time that's what they want and while I'm at it while I'm on my tangent people be careful what you share on Facebook think about it
What are the security questions that are usually asked?
It's all those memes that are going around on Facebook right now.
It's all those memes on Facebook.
Post your drag queen name, like and share.
The street you were born on.
The street you were born on in your pet.
Yeah.
Hello.
Those are common questions.
No, it's one, two, three, four, five.
Yeah, so just be careful.
You know what my rule of thumb is?
Stop using Facebook.
That would be a great security precaution right there.
Stop using it.
I practically have, except my mom sort of guilted me into going back.
Oh, except use it to like Orange Zones Radio.
Yeah, use it to like Orange Zones Radio.
We're not going to steal your shit, I promise.
I super promise.
But, um... Crap, I completely forgot.
Oh, yeah.
My rule of thumb for password, numbers, and another language.
There you go.
Now you just told everybody your password.
They don't know a language.
Aww.
Uno Dos Tres, that's her password Ichi Ni Which is as much as Rob can count in Japanese No, I remember that song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi Wasn't that a DDR song or a Beatmania song or something?
I don't remember It was on a Dance Mania album or something There's that little song that goes Ichi Ni San Shi So you can count to four I can count to four because of that song
Alright, don't we have stories to do or some shit?
Who cares?
We're gonna talk about food and languages.
Wait, there was something else I was gonna... Damn it, there was something else I was gonna share on it.
You know what, I lost it, so you know what, here's the shark eating the plane again.
Holy shit!
I still want to see that movie.
You know what else was six bucks?
Actually, there was Repo.
On Blu-ray.
I need to get Repo.
I love that movie.
Okay, so was it my turn?
Yes.
Well, a Microsoft creative director had a hissy fit online.
And it gave me a perfect excuse to use the term hissy fit because that's pretty much what it was.
Orthy, who is Adam Orth, the creative director, said, Sorry, I don't get the drama around having an always on console.
Every device now is always on.
That's the world we live in.
And the hashtag was deal with it.
well that of course got people up in arms because you know anytime I'm going to say this to anybody who works for any company when you work for a company and people know you work for that company you are always a representative of that company you cannot say anything in a public forum that isn't going to reflect back on the company that you work for which I just want to say sucks
Yeah, it sucks.
That's the kind of world we live in.
But like, you know, I work my day job.
A lot of people don't know this, but I work in health care.
So like, I try very hard to like not say anything about like, I can't tell you my opinion on Affordable Care Act.
Because if I were to tell you that, you know, one way or the other, you know, that might be construed as that's how my employer thinks.
And so I have to be careful not to talk about it.
When I worked for the mortgage company.
I couldn't really talk about Bank of America and when I worked for the inspection company too because they were all our clients it would have gotten back even though my Facebook is completely locked down and private so I do think I feel bad for this guy as much as you might not like his opinion and you might disagree with it and you might be ready to have your laundry list of well here's what's wrong with your opinion guy
It kind of sucks that he can't say his opinion without everybody going, Confirmation!
This is confirmation!
He said it!
It's gospel!
Oh my god!
I'm canceling my pre-order right now!
Microsoft is doomed!
I don't even think what he said was that bad.
It was adding the hashtag to it that made it sort of like the snarky, I don't care what you think kind of thing.
but Microsoft actually came back with an apology or a statement put out by Major Nelson and I'm just going to read this out we apologize for the inappropriate comments made by an employee on Twitter yesterday this person is not a spokesperson for Microsoft and his personal views do not reflect the customer centric approach blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we are very sorry if this offended anyone blah blah blah wink wink wink and we are making no further comments on this matter
I don't know.
I think he gets paid a lot more than I do.
So, I mean, he should, you know, he should at least use some discretion on Twitter.
It was not a good idea.
But the way everybody's raking him through the coals, people make mistakes.
God damn.
And here's the other thing.
Dungeon Buster in our chat saying some of the quick memes done around that were pretty hilarious.
And links us to quick meme where, you know, it's just all these memes around it.
I...
I actually looked at that stuff and I kind of winced.
I was like, you know, as humorous as some of this might be, I feel bad for this guy.
I mean, he's just getting dragged through all these parts of the internet over an opinion.
But that's the nature of the internet.
It just sucks.
He's on Twitter.
Doesn't he know what the internet is?
I mean...
I'm on Twitter.
Yeah, and you're probably smart enough to know that if you worked for a big company that may have a console that's coming out that people are thinking that it's always online and you make a comment like, well, I don't see what all your problems are with this always online thing.
I mean, it's not like, you know.
I don't talk about the healthcare industry on my Twitter.
It's the one thing you're not going to hear me talk about.
And I use a fake name.
This guy's position is as a creative director.
He's in a position of some power within the company.
I don't know exactly what area of creativity he happens to direct.
It could be marketing.
I'd have to research more, but I don't know too much about the guy.
But when you've got speculation coming out about a system, especially right now when E3 is in a couple months,
Yeah.
But the Xbox was already supposed to be announced.
Well, if rumors are to be believed... I thought this was the end of this month.
Well, we heard before it was going to be early April, but yet not even invites going out yet.
But yeah, but they're supposed... Okay, when you have anything coming up that's going to have information hopefully being made about it, people are still going to try to speculate to get the jump, especially in the news industry.
You know, any type of video game related news.
And, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Or confirm rumors.
I'm with you.
Go into some other comments in our chat room there real quick.
Marissa Congusto at live.vognetwork.com says, Make a troll account to bitch.
He should have made a troll account that wasn't attached to his name.
So I can talk openly about health care.
Actually, I have no desire to.
So I can do that.
I'm going to make a troll account.
I'll call it, instead of Rob Roberts, I'll be Robin Roberts.
That'll be my name, Robin Roberts.
Oh, wait.
Shit, I can't, I can't do that one.
Robert's Rob.
All right, let me read this other comment here from Queen Simia at live.vognetwork.com says, his comment was the cherry on top of the shit sundae that was Diablo 3, SimCity, hell, even Origin.
It just all adds up in the public eye to developers and publishers not giving a damn.
You know, I'm with that comment quite a bit because as much as I think it sucks that, you know, he's getting dragged across all the corners of the internet and
It does really show how out of touch some of the management level people are with what gamers really are looking for.
Or is it just a case of the vocal minority?
Are we the vocal minority?
I have this mental image of...
them sitting on their little cloud.
Yes.
Surrounded by their little... Because everything's in the cloud now.
In the cloud.
So they actually work in the cloud too.
They work in the cloud.
In the fluffy cloud.
And they have their huge walls up where they only get very small filtered information for they look for their little target.
And they're not really paying attention to what's really going on in the real world.
They're looking at their bottom lines.
They say... You've basically got executives up there who don't really have their... People love Angry Birds.
Yeah.
Let's do some more microtransactions, durr.
But here's the thing, though, is I think the way they're looking at it is that they make these decisions that are unpopular and people still buy it anyways.
And then they come out with a sequel later on that has these same kinds of decisions and people still buy it anyways.
It's like DLC for Call of Duty.
Everyone bitch to bitch to bitch about how there's like, you know, why am I paying $60 for maps after, you know, Call of Duty comes out?
Why am I having to do this?
People buy them.
And that's the thing.
They're going to keep doing it if people are going to keep buying them.
And that's why you see more microtransactions in these games because people buy them.
They wouldn't put them in there if people didn't buy them.
And that's the thing.
You may hate it all you want, but there are still people out there buying this crap.
Same with all these online stuff.
There are people that will still think it's a good thing.
They'll defend Microsoft saying it's a fantastic idea.
But what I think is the problem, aside from the fact that he's a creative director and he thinks like this because, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
A lot of their rumors end up being true.
And granted, this could be one of the ones that's not true.
However, I don't know.
There's just something in this case about where there's smoke, there's fire, and there's two... This won't fucking stop.
And so this says to me...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
refuse us to comment on it, and we still don't know when this thing is getting announced.
If Microsoft wanted to change something in light of what happened with SimCity and maybe some of this other reaction, they can still do that.
Well, here's the other thing, too, about the always online part.
It still kind of stings a little bit.
It's just, if it's always online, you're going to think, well, okay, well, then I should be able to play multiplayer online.
Oh, sorry, you've got to pay for Xbox Live Gold for that.
so it's gotta be always online because they always want you to use Xbox Live Gold and how many features of this always online console are they gonna hide behind Xbox Live Gold like Netflix in this one or Hulu Plus or YouTube the YouTube fucking app is behind Gold on the Xbox 360 it's kind of ridiculous
I don't know.
All I gotta say is, you know, I hope that the console's not online only because I can tell you right now, you know, the situation I'm in where I'm playing at my work and I'm in a spot of the building that doesn't have Wi-Fi at this point and that would not work for me.
I can't play a console that doesn't have, that doesn't allow me to play offline.
And so, I just won't buy it.
Simple as that.
I,
I think if they do make this thing always online and it's the whole you have to register maybe it's not so much the always online thing but if it's true that it boots you after three minutes of not being connected and if it's true that you have to register your games to prevent used games I mean Microsoft is just giving it to Sony
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The not looking at where your audience is, not looking at what your audience wants, marketing it in a completely stupid way.
What's the pro to offset that con?
It has to be a huge pro.
Are all the games $20?
They'd have to pay for my internet.
Is that the pro that all the games are $20 now because they have no resale value?
Is that the pro?
Because that's a pro worth...
Are they games on the caliber of Halo 4, but now they're $20?
Because that's a pro going, okay, well, now maybe you're talking, Microsoft.
No, they're too greedy.
The game industry is too greedy.
That's the problem.
It's just like saying, hey, the price of oil went down.
Gas prices are coming down, right?
Right?
Right?
No?
And if this story says anything, it's the internet saying, this is not a good thing.
Let's hope it's not too late for Microsoft to listen.
There's a part of me that's actually more hoping that this guy put that out as a feeler to see what the reaction would be, even though I know it's probably just some stupid comment.
But still, they got a pretty firm response from the community, so hopefully this would be enough that they go, okay, well, let's not do this, or at least not do it yet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Now there's also a rumor that's saying that the console is going to be about $500 or $300 subsidized with that plan they have right now where you pay so much a month because you're getting Xbox Live Gold tied in there as well and you pay over the life of the console or a couple years or something like that.
I mean, I seriously think if they do this with online only, it's like fucking PS3 all over again.
$499 and, you know, oh, by the way, it's always online.
The subsidy rumor about it only costing $300 getting some steam this week, which is so... That was in our list list at the end of the year last year, like what horrible gaming rumor is going to come true or something like that.
We called it!
Maybe.
We predict the futures.
DarkTetsuya in chat says, $20 games, LOL.
That's never gonna happen.
My iPad says hi.
I mean, I actually was thinking more if they made like a subscription service, you know, you have their, it's always online, you get Xbox Live, and then they do like a Steam model.
But even so, that doesn't seem likely.
What's the pro to offset the con that if I'm offline for three minutes, I get booted?
Because Steam, if I'm online and I get booted offline, I don't disconnect from everything.
And the other thing, too, is Steam games are usually pretty cheap.
Like Borderlands plus all the DLC for $25.
That's kind of hard to compete against $60 games and stuff.
I know Borderlands has come down in price a little bit.
But still, though, like Bioshock 1 and 2 for $4.
I don't see that.
You know, I'm not getting two copies of, you know, two Xbox 360 games for $4.
Well, on the same token, you remember how, you know, Origin is such a fuck-up right now.
Well, it has always been such a fuck-up.
It's not just right now.
Well, I mean, don't they require that, like, for now, most of the Origin games, you have to be online for those to work to?
I don't know, because the only thing I will play on Origin is a game that requires you, or that has, is a game that is meant to be played online, so I am online.
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, that's all I use Origin for.
Well, you remember when they did, what was it, Patch 4 for Mass Effect 3, and it totally screwed up on my online stuff.
Let me verify my DLC.
Sure.
and I couldn't play single player.
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
Stupid.
Origin's terrible.
But to be fair, Steam was terrible when it came out too.
And if this console is always online, I'm just telling you right now, it's all the more reason for people to hack the shit out of it because if it's something that people... Ain't that the truth.
If it's something that the vocal minority doesn't like, it's going to become a fucking target and you better believe that they will find a way to do it.
Alright, let me... I don't want to keep dragging this out especially because it's basically a rumor.
But this is a comment worth responding to, so this will be the last thing on this topic and then we'll move on.
BlackWolfInChat says, Here's the problem.
The internet is a small portion of their target audience.
So the internet doesn't like the Xbox.
Everyone else will get it anyway.
Not caring.
In theory, you're right, Bobby.
But the problem is that vocal minority starts that whole word of mouth.
It's all about who they tell other people about.
When people are considering buying a game console, do you know how many people have come to me and said, Rob, what game console should I get?
What should I buy?
A lot of those vocal minority are people that work for GameStop and other retailers.
Unless Microsoft's going to really sweeten the pot, which it might be a deal they're willing to sign to try and get those things to move, GameStop has already come out and said, we don't like this idea.
So that's really bad.
Now, you might come out and say, well, a lot of hardcore gamers didn't like the Wii either, and look at how well that did.
But there was a big difference.
People with the Wii were like, yeah, kids will like the Wii.
Oh, yeah, the Wii's something different.
Oh, yeah, I know you.
You're not looking for anything too hard.
You're a soccer mom.
You'll love the Wii.
Go get it.
It was a different type of situation.
Nobody outright hated what the Wii was doing.
or what about when you get these stories let's just assume that this is going to be like every other online only or online required thing to come out that oh hey I just paid $500 for my new system and I can't fucking play any games on it because their servers are down and wait till that hits mainstream news
I know it may not hit it right away, but it's going to get some attention if it's anti-consumer where, oh, by the way, it locks down all this stuff.
They have this technology in place.
You're not going to have retailers caring about it because, first of all, they don't make anything off the consoles anyways.
If this is a retailer that makes money off of used games, they're probably not going to want to support a console that doesn't make any sort of money back for them.
So I don't know.
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, I wonder who that is, Rob.
That's it.
We're docking your pay.
Rob, coffee.
It's almost like the next logical step here is to talk about that story.
I can't believe we don't have it.
That's what we have for having a fluid.
Nick Earl, Senior Vice President of EA's mobile and social all-play label
basically saying that the people that are responding to the microtransactions in Real Racing 3 are the vocal minority.
Ultimately, the numbers would show that they and others all support the freemium model better.
And basically saying that people were, I guess, annoyed at the fact that the all-you-can-eat model, or they're saying that the game, the DLC in it, I want to say there was like, what, 200 and some dollars of DLC in that game?
But once again, I think it kind of goes back to the fact that you have this model where people are hating on it, but there's people still buying that crap.
I want to talk about the Peter Moore consumerist thing.
That's what I want to talk about.
I'm getting to that.
All right, thank you.
I'm getting to that.
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, this guy, what he said, but then like, okay, then the real bomb was dropped later, so let's get to that.
So, okay, because every year they do this thing on this website, the Consumerist, where they vote for the worst company in America, basically.
They have the golden poo that they send out to them.
But it's like, whose line is it anyway?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
The points don't matter.
It's just, it's a popularity or anti-popularity contest or whatever.
And last year, EA took the prize because of Mass Effect or something like that.
And this year, they're into... Well, now, Loki, if you read what the consumers had to say, it was a lot more than just Mass Effect.
Okay, well, fine.
EA gets blamed for microtransactions, for inventing that model, for the online pass and inventing that model, for getting games rushed, da-da-da-da-da, blah-blah-blah, I'm very angry, and I'm on the internet.
Yes.
So, basically, you know, they...
They're in the finals, or pretty close to being in the finals And, you know, they come out, Peter Moore comes out And basically saying, hey, we can do better And some of the bullshit though, I mean, I love this quote The tallest trees catch the most wind Yes, we're hating on you because you're such a big company, that's it The tallest trees break the most wind
Wouldn't that just be the biggest asses?
Some of these complaints are 100% legitimate.
Like all companies, we are not perfect, but others just don't hold water.
Many continue to claim that the always-on function in SimCity is a DRM scheme.
It's not.
People still want to argue about it.
We can't be any clearer.
It's not.
Period.
I agree.
It's not.
That doesn't make it any less shitty.
It doesn't matter why it's broken.
It's just it's broken.
Some people claim that there's no room for Origin as a competitor to Steam.
45 million registered users are proving that wrong.
By the way, you have to fucking sign up on it to play console games that are by EA, PC games that are by EA.
How many satisfied customers out of that 45 million?
I dare you.
Pull each and every single one of them.
How are you satisfied with this service?
I dare you.
Dare you.
Well, I really just hate EA's customer service.
Okay, I got one good person the entire time I had that whole issue with my Mass Effect 3.
Well, the majority of it's outsourced.
Exactly, exactly.
I hate to say it, but that's actually a bigger problem than just in the video game industry.
You get what you pay for.
Exactly.
And that's true in any industry.
However, I completely forgot what I was going to say, so you were going to say?
Some people think that the free-to-play games and microtransactions are the pox on gaming.
Tens of millions more are playing and loving these games.
Oh.
Whatever, okay?
I'll give them that because... That's a valid point.
That's a valid point because they have the stuff that... You don't like it, don't fucking play it, stop spending money on it.
But people are, so... Because it would be a different story if they were putting out stuff that you could...
Get games that were like, I guess, but when you've got titles that people have gotten pretty much hooked on, then yeah, they do pretty much have a captive audience.
People want to get more of it.
It's kind of a catch-22.
You either do without it and do without their service.
Wait, wait.
So BlackWolfInChat says, I'm satisfied.
Great.
One person out of 45 million is satisfied.
Good, Bobby.
Bobby, how do we... And I'm just throwing out ideas here and he'll tell me to shut up if he doesn't like this.
But can we do something on VOG where I can have a poll, like an Insta poll, like a live listener poll, so I can go up and say, are you using Origin and are you satisfied?
And we can poll people live while the show's going on.
Is that possible?
Because I want that for next week.
Well, this is what...
Can we?
Please?
Please, Bobby?
This is what I have to say about Origin Story.
About their, you know, going, oh, so many people are using it.
Well, they did prove on Mythbusters that you could polish a turd.
Doesn't make it less of a turd.
One thing that I want to say about the free-to-play games and microtransactions, listen, it's a free-to-play game.
You're paying nothing for the game, and so paying microtransactions for something, or say, buying in-game items, spending like five bucks or something on in-game items isn't that big a deal because you paid nothing for the game.
The problem comes into when you have a $60 fucking game, and then you're still wanting these microtransactions.
Yes.
fee to pay is basically fee to pay, I love it fee to pay oh Bobby says it has been designed just not developed and maybe next week Bobby works very hard on coding VOGnetwork.com and he doesn't get paid anything for it so thank you Bobby Bobby gets paid in love I appreciate your consideration and I will withhold my feelings on SimCity for five more minutes out of thank you
Bobby gets paid in love, snark, and spite.
Exactly.
See, we've seen mailing lists that direct people to vote for EA because they disagree with the choice of the cover athlete on Madden NFL.
Yes, really.
Okay, well, fine.
Sports fans are crazy.
In the past year, we've received thousands of emails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games.
This week, we're seeing posts on conservative websites urging people to protest LGBT policy by voting EA for the worst company in America.
Okay, I give them props for promoting that community and stuff like that.
And yeah, there are assholes out there.
But at the same time, I don't think it's the majority of those votes you're getting because of that.
It's because, you know...
I don't know it's this weird kind of like you know I love that this letter is very staunch like if that's why you're voting us the worst company in America then fucking bring it because you're full of it so I love that kind of tone because you know clap clap clap I wish all people could get that but anyway I
It's weird to me that he calls that out because then I go, alright, I'm really appreciative that you're supportive of all that, but let's not use it as a weapon when things aren't going your way.
It does kind of... I appreciate your stance, but now's not the time.
And then the quote for last year, he says, the complaints against us last year were our support of SOPA and that they didn't like the ending of Mass Effect 3.
And this is back...
The response on Consumerist, they say, actually, our analysis of the reasons for EA's inclusion in last year's finale make no mention of Mass Effect 3 or SOPA.
Instead, it looks like the EA's history of buying smaller, successful developers with the intention of milking and arguably ruining intellectual properties.
And I'd like to mention in there too, especially as a factor of this year, maybe their idea that, hey, re-releasing a game, or I'm sorry, not re-releasing a game.
Putting out a game on the Wii, for example, FIFA 13, and basically just taking FIFA 12 and reskinning, say, FIFA 13 and updating the rosters, maybe not a good thing helping them, you know, with their argument that, you know, the quality in those games.
Oh, and that was also in the Vita and the Wii U version, by the way.
They ported the FIFA 12 game.
Is Peter Moore the next CEO of EA?
He is the CEO.
He is.
He's the CEO-o.
He's not the CEO-o.
No, wait a minute.
They replaced what's-his-fuck with somebody else.
With the former CEO.
But when I read that letter, I'm like, this guy is talking like he's the new CEO.
Look, despite the fact that we're flaming this whole thing a little bit,
I do appreciate some of the frankness of this and I appreciate the fact that at least they're trying and not just kind of like, la la la, we can't hear you, la la la, you're still buying our stuff anyway, screw you.
I appreciate that he's trying to respond to some of this in a very direct manner and I do applaud that.
My only problem is I'm like, it kind of really shows, really shows where some of the blindness is, I believe.
But once again, they're only going to go in a direction in their business that makes them money.
