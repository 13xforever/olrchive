7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, April 21st, 2013, Nintendo announces a sequel to one of their classics. Could a cancelled TV show be brought back for the new Xbox? And an old, unreleased Sega console is unearthed.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 501 for this, April the 21st of 2013.
45000	51000	It's our Blue Jeans episode, I guess you could say, coming off a high from last week in our 500th episode.
51000	54000	That's so 80s, they don't really use that marketing anymore, do they?
55000	61000	Well, hi there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I don't know if they use that marketing anymore. I don't know if that's a thing.
61000	65000	I remember those commercials where they would sing the blues, but then it was the 501 blues.
65000	70000	I just remember the Saturday Night Live commercials that were bad idea jeans. That was...
70000	71000	Yeah.
71000	76000	Do they have those classic clips on YouTube, or did NBC pull them all? Because if they have it on YouTube, look it up.
76000	80000	I have no idea. Well, they had a bunch of them on Hulu, like you could watch a lot of the goth talks and...
80000	81000	Oh, okay.
81000	82000	...cluffy talk.
82000	84000	The funny people were on Saturday Night Live, like Chris Farley.
84000	88000	The funny people were on Saturday Night Live my senior year of high school.
88000	95000	Or, I mean, to be fair, before somebody snaps at us, if you're not talking about the originals from 75...
95000	97000	The, what, not ready for primetime players?
97000	99000	Yeah, nodding my head at that, because clearly they...
99000	101000	Because, hello Belushi.
101000	103000	But I wasn't born yet, so...
103000	108000	But I have come to appreciate, after all this time, Gilda Radner, comic genius. Love that woman.
108000	109000	Ah, yeah.
109000	111000	And they were all great, really.
111000	114000	But, 1994. Best year of SNL.
114000	115000	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
115000	116000	Without a doubt.
116000	117000	Good stuff. Good stuff.
117000	119000	I'll say hello to Techmaster Loki.
121000	122000	Hi.
122000	124000	Did you ever watch Saturday Night Live back in the day?
124000	126000	Uh...
126000	128000	I've watched it off and on.
128000	132000	There was, you know, a time where there was a lot of people in there that, you know, I thought were funny,
132000	136000	and then I stopped watching them after a while, because I'm like, ah, they're not funny anymore,
136000	138000	and then I came back, and they're like, oh, okay, you're funny again.
138000	140000	Now we're kind of at that, oh, they're not funny anymore.
140000	144000	Well, I don't really watch it anymore. Like, if really funny things happen, the internet blows up about it,
144000	148000	and there's clips on Hulu, but I remember back in the day, like when I was in junior high school,
148000	152000	that was the thing, was staying up late on Saturday night to watch Saturday Night Live,
152000	156000	and like, could you get all the way, could you stay up late enough to make it to the end of the show,
156000	158000	or do you fall asleep after Weekend Update?
158000	159000	Really? You had that much problem?
159000	160000	Yeah.
160000	163000	For me, my Friday night, going into Saturday morning, was, um...
163000	165000	In junior high, yes, I had that problem.
165000	166000	Oh, well, this was high school, okay.
166000	167000	Okay.
167000	175000	It was a pot of coffee, probably two, and it was Saturday Night Live, followed by Headbangers Ball,
175000	177000	followed by 120 Minutes.
177000	183000	So I would, like, listen to, like, Pantera and all that all night, and then go into The Cure.
183000	184000	Ah.
184000	185000	And I love my prog rock.
185000	186000	Nice.
186000	189000	Oh, we're going to have a Kate Bush revival tonight.
189000	190000	Good times.
190000	192000	Yes, welcome to my senior year.
192000	196000	I remember there were some video games based off Saturday Night Live.
196000	198000	It was the Wayne's World game, which was awful.
198000	200000	Oh, the Wayne's World game was awful.
200000	201000	It was awful.
201000	204000	Bringing it back to video games, which the show is about,
204000	207000	with you guys live in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show,
207000	211000	live.vognetwork.com in our chat room, if you want to join us here,
211000	215000	as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
215000	218000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show.
218000	221000	So tying it back to games, Saturday Night Live games,
221000	223000	there was a Blues Brothers game, I'm pretty sure, too.
223000	224000	Yes.
224000	227000	When they had that movie, when they had the Blues Brothers 2000 or whatever,
227000	229000	there was that.
229000	231000	Were there other Saturday Night Live movies?
231000	236000	Now I'm just imagining what if there was an It's Pat game.
236000	237000	Did you ever see the movie, though?
237000	238000	It was weird.
238000	242000	I watched part of it, and I was like, the hell is this crap?
242000	246000	You know, the Wayne's World movies were great, but not a good game.
246000	249000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream,
249000	252000	in our chat, says, Keir Cross Pokemon.
252000	253000	Oh, lord.
253000	256000	Padov's Song, Why Can't I Be Mew?
256000	258000	The Love Me Offs.
258000	260000	Mr. Mime Eyes.
260000	262000	Amakism.
262000	265000	Where the hell did you get this from?
265000	270000	Only the, was that on Tumblr or some shit?
270000	273000	You need to post that somewhere where I can find it on Tumblr
273000	275000	and repost that, because...
275000	277000	That sounds like the type of thing that came off Tumblr.
277000	278000	I'm sorry, but...
278000	280000	Fifth Dream said it best, though, later on.
280000	282000	I want a John Belushi Samurai game.
282000	284000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
284000	285000	The Samurai Tailor.
285000	286000	That was it, right?
286000	287000	Well, there was also the Samurai Butcher.
287000	288000	Oh, that's right.
288000	289000	The Deli.
289000	290000	It was a thing.
290000	291000	It was always him in different things, yeah.
291000	295000	Yeah, but I also liked the one of Dana Carvey as...
295000	296000	God, no, who was it?
296000	297000	He was being...
297000	298000	Brian Adams, was it?
298000	299000	The Church Lady?
299000	300000	No, no, no.
300000	301000	Was it?
301000	302000	Satan?
302000	303000	Well, isn't that special?
303000	305000	No, no, no, no, no.
305000	307000	Listen, it was Dana Carvey.
307000	311000	I think it was being Brian Adams or somebody singing the broccoli song.
311000	312000	Chopping broccoli.
312000	313000	Whatever happened to Dana Carvey?
313000	314000	I don't know.
314000	315000	Like, I see him on billboards.
315000	319000	He performs in, like, Tahoe now, and I'm like, oh, it's so unfortunate.
319000	320000	I don't know.
320000	321000	Poor guy.
321000	323000	All right, anyhow.
323000	326000	From old school SNL people to video games.
326000	329000	Real quick before we get into our gaming week, so I'll make this quick.
329000	333000	We had a big show last week, so this week might be a little easier.
333000	334000	Taking it easy.
334000	335000	They had an Austin Powers game.
335000	336000	That's sort of...
336000	337000	Oh, they did.
337000	338000	That's sort of Saturday Night Live.
338000	339000	Sort of.
339000	340000	Sort of.
340000	341000	Thank you for looking that up.
341000	343000	I wanted to throw this out there real quick.
343000	348000	Technically, this was the other show that I do under the OLR Studios banner, which is
348000	351000	Horde House, but I just want to give this a shout out because I thought this was great.
351000	356000	This morning was that multiple sclerosis walk, and I've talked about it on this show a couple
356000	357000	of times.
357000	361000	That finally happened this morning, and a great turnout and great participation from
361000	366000	some folks here locally and the internet and the WoW community and the gaming community
366000	370000	in general raised over $1600, if you can believe it, for multiple sclerosis research.
370000	371000	That is great.
371000	372000	It's awesome.
372000	373000	It is awesome.
373000	376000	So now the goal next year is to outdo that.
376000	379000	We're going to push 2K next year, so watch yourselves.
379000	380000	I'll do it next year.
380000	384000	But now I'm thinking, you know, I had so much fun doing that, that we need to think of something
384000	387000	OLR charity related, like six months from now.
387000	390000	So it's like, you know, Horde House, OLR, Horde House.
390000	392000	But we're going to have to think of something to get involved with.
392000	400000	I want to do one of the autism charities that is not autism speaks because they're assholes.
400000	401000	Controversy!
401000	407000	But whatever, whatever, we'll find a charity that's near and dear to our causes here.
407000	408000	We need to have a car wash.
408000	409000	You want to have a car wash?
409000	411000	The OLR car wash.
411000	413000	We need something the whole internet can get involved with, though.
413000	415000	We'll put it on live cam.
415000	416000	Alright, whatever.
416000	419000	What else is I going to say about all that?
419000	424000	Oh, I want to give a shout out to one of our listeners, Evan, who I met today who drove
424000	430000	up from Bakersfield to come walk with us and was a huge donor and a huge part of that effort.
430000	432000	So I know he participates more with Horde House.
432000	436000	I don't see him in his OLR chat as much, but I want to say give a shout out to Evan.
436000	437000	It was great to meet you today.
437000	440000	I like meeting OLR fans and sometimes I meet them in very random places.
440000	443000	Is that the Evan that just friended me on Facebook yesterday?
443000	444000	Probably.
444000	445000	Did he have a Liara pic?
445000	446000	Oh, no, he has a MS pic now.
446000	448000	Yeah, he had a Liara pic and now it's a...
448000	450000	I don't know, but whoever that is, you're nice.
450000	451000	Yeah, he's nice.
451000	452000	I met him.
452000	453000	You should have come out today.
453000	454000	You could have met him.
454000	455000	Now he's going to have to come back.
455000	458000	I was busy sleeping.
458000	464000	Honestly, my goal was to get up this morning, but I think I still have like how much booze
464000	466000	did I drink on my birthday?
466000	467000	A lot.
467000	468000	All of it.
468000	469000	Most of it.
469000	470000	So thank you for the beer, by the way.
470000	471000	It was delicious.
471000	472000	You're welcome.
472000	473000	How was your birthday?
473000	474000	Happy late birthday to Dark Soccer, by the way.
474000	475000	Thank you.
476000	482000	My birthday was gamey, as in you did not sing any Alanis at my party, Rob.
482000	483000	I know.
483000	485000	We only made a cameo and I didn't get around to singing Alanis.
485000	486000	I'm sorry.
486000	490000	But Becky sang alone for me and I ended up singing in the background, I think, because
490000	491000	I was drunk.
491000	492000	I played keyboards for that.
492000	493000	You played keyboards.
493000	494000	It was good.
494000	500000	I downloaded the song just so that Becky would sing it, our resident, very good soprano.
500000	503000	I think I sang Band on the Run once.
504000	505000	OK, this was the funniest part.
505000	507000	This happened after you left.
507000	513000	Julian, Becky's son, who is going to be six in like a week or so, he wanted me to sing.
513000	514000	Cute kid.
514000	517000	Him and the other, is that Dan's little cousin?
517000	518000	Cousin's daughter.
518000	519000	That was Hannah's daughter, Sophia.
519000	521000	They were cute, being cute kids.
521000	522000	They were adorable.
522000	528000	But Julian was like, sing the pink robot song, which is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.
528000	534000	So about a third through the song, Julian has the chorus memorized.
534000	538000	So he's singing along to the song with me.
538000	541000	And it's like my second favorite song ever in the universe.
541000	543000	And we're sitting here swaying back and forth.
543000	546000	I've got a good three beers and a shot of vodka in me.
546000	548000	So we won't be able to get an encore now?
548000	549000	No.
549000	551000	And Julian is singing along with me.
551000	555000	And it is seriously the cutest thing that has ever happened in my entire life.
555000	560000	And then Midna decided to come out and be Little Miss Social, which I thought she was
560000	561000	going to go hide in the back room.
561000	564000	But no, she's like, oh, my God, people pet me.
564000	565000	She hates Gary.
565000	566000	Just saying.
566000	569000	She loves everybody else hated Gary, but he was being addicted.
569000	571000	Gary smell like dog.
571000	573000	Gary was like hissing at her.
573000	574000	Oh, that's not nice.
574000	576000	I was like, you be nice to my cat.
576000	577000	She's a good girl.
577000	578000	He's calling her demon.
578000	580000	I'm like, don't you dare call her that in front of me.
580000	581000	I will slap a bitch.
582000	585000	So, yeah, there's a lot of alcohol, a lot of alcohol because.
585000	587000	Oh, my God, Amanda, I love you forever.
587000	590000	She brought mocha vodka, like the good, expensive mocha vodka.
590000	592000	Wasn't she supposed to be here tonight?
592000	593000	Amanda?
593000	594000	No, she said she couldn't do it this night.
594000	597000	She had to do it later night because she has something Depeche Mode going on.
597000	600000	You know, she does a lot of blogging for Depeche Mode.
600000	601000	That's awesome.
601000	603000	And she's going to like seven of their shows.
603000	604000	Wow.
604000	608000	OK, well, she wants like like a series of twelve shows in Germany last year.
608000	609000	I wish I could do that.
609000	610000	Get your fangirl on.
610000	612000	Well, she saved up forever for it.
612000	617000	But anyway, so she brought this mocha and I had like four double shots.
617000	625000	And then I had two shots of this amazing, super expensive, like we're talking $100 plus bottle of tequila.
625000	626000	What?
626000	627000	That purple bottle that George had.
627000	628000	Oh, my God.
628000	629000	Oh, my God.
629000	631000	It's tequila that I don't hate.
631000	632000	It still kicked my ass.
632000	634000	I almost got you, Patron.
634000	635000	You know what?
635000	636000	You know what, Rob?
636000	638000	I will tell I'm going to tell you this for future reference.
638000	639000	No tequila.
639000	641000	But I thought you liked Patron.
641000	642000	I like Patron OK.
642000	644000	But do you know how long it took me to drink the last bottle you got me?
644000	645000	That's true.
645000	646000	That's true.
646000	648000	I finished it for my birthday last year and you got it for me when I turned 30.
648000	651000	Well, then I must have had a psychic moment because I was going to get it.
651000	654000	And then I was like, you know what, maybe I should just bring beer.
654000	657000	Rob brought me Guinness and Guinness is the best gift ever.
657000	659000	And I'm going to cook steak with it.
659000	660000	There you go.
660000	661000	So.
661000	667000	So, yeah, apparently the theme of my birthday was booze, which is pretty much the theme of every birthday every year.
667000	669000	If I'm not at Disneyland.
669000	671000	And they busted out.
671000	676000	George brought his Wii U and that Injustice game, whatever that DC game is.
676000	678000	You know how I feel about DC.
678000	685000	But it was actually kind of neat, except I thought that the character models were supremely bizarre.
685000	688000	I've heard a lot of good things about Injustice, but not on the Wii U.
688000	694000	It's interesting to me that that was the platform you got exposed to it on because I've heard the Wii U one is a little weak compared to the others.
694000	698000	Well, I had no basis of comparison and I'm sitting here like.
698000	702000	And I'm I'm just I'm just copy pasting Internet hearsay.
702000	709000	So I'm catching the end of the game when like three of my friends are passed out from booze and I'm sitting there sobering because you know how quickly that happens for me.
709000	715000	So I'm like watching this game and going, what the hell is up with Wonder Woman's hair?
715000	718000	That's the only thing I could focus on was Wonder Woman's hair.
718000	720000	And that there were two Batmans.
720000	724000	When I was playing Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, I was a little fixated on how weird Wonder Woman was, too.
724000	730000	And then like Joker looked bizarre, but it was the right Batman. It was Kevin Conroy.
730000	731000	Oh, nice.
731000	735000	So it was the right Batman. So. So, yeah.
735000	737000	And then let me go to some quick comments from our chat room here.
737000	743000	Actdeft in chat says Midna technically is a demon, though. I mean, she's the Twilight Princess.
743000	745000	No, she's an imp.
745000	747000	She's my baby.
747000	749000	Other comments in our chat room at Live.VogueNetwork.com.
749000	754000	Fifth Dream says The Cure and Depeche Mode in one podcast. It's like Goth Lounge radio.
754000	757000	No way. We're progressive. We're progressive.
757000	759000	I'm going to attack the darkness.
759000	763000	Let's see. Tiger Claw in our chat saying Injustice is pretty awesome. I beat the story mode.
763000	767000	Well, you see, it was Gary was playing it, but I didn't care because I was watching it.
767000	773000	And so. The big thing I remember is Amanda waking up in time to go,
773000	777000	that's where Depeche Mode is in this game and going to sleep.
777000	781000	So now I remember that the end song was done by Depeche Mode and it was actually a really neat song.
781000	787000	So. So, yeah, I mean, it was mostly, you know, a lot of us hanging out in the in the kitchen,
787000	791000	in the dining room, staring at the evil bell pepper pizza.
791000	795000	Oh, my God, it was so good. So gross. I had to pick all the peppers off because I'm allergic.
795000	801000	And then just drinking and then children running all over the place.
801000	806000	But cute children who don't piss me off. So it was good.
806000	812000	So that was my birthday. Well, I was going to ask about your gaming week, but I did a lot of it.
812000	815000	All right. Well, then why not? We'll just do our gaming weeks.
815000	820000	Well, Catastrophic Moggy gave me that Sam and Max game on steam and resonance.
820000	823000	And one other game I downloaded everything.
823000	829000	And I played some of the game. I'm not supposed to talk about trademark.
829000	836000	Oh, my God, I'm in love. I'm quitting. Well, so I.
836000	839000	Well, I play. Oh, yeah, I live streamed Mass Effect two.
839000	844000	And so what I'm going to do, since we don't have anybody on Thursday, we don't have any shows on Thursday,
844000	852000	is that I'm just going to play through Mass Effect two on the stream so that people can hear me talk shit about the characters,
852000	858000	which is basically all shame was there for that. And basically is all I do now when I play.
858000	864000	When I play any of the Mass Effect games is that I talk back to the characters and I'm pretty rude to most of them.
864000	867000	It's sort of like, what is my shepherd's inner monologue?
867000	873000	So if people want to see a play through where they're not talking back, don't look at your channel because you're a talker.
873000	877000	Well, no, it's like I'll play it mostly quiet, but sometimes somebody will say something.
877000	884000	And it's like because you know how I feel about a good portion of the writing and I will just go what or good.
884000	888000	No one cares what you have to say, Jacob. You know, move on. And it's that type of commentary.
888000	893000	OK, I'm sort of MST three king it as I play. Fair enough. Yeah, I'm done.
893000	897000	It's the dark soccer experience. I've had pinkberry and coffee and I'm very hyper.
897000	904000	Excuse me. Couldn't tell. All right. Say hello as well to Loki.
904000	910000	And how was your gaming week? Let's see my game week. I played Defiance.
910000	916000	I played lots of Defiance, actually. And I'm up to three hundred and forty now.
916000	922000	They don't really have like levels. It's just like size level. I should maybe get this game.
922000	926000	It's pretty fun. Yeah. Yeah. They don't have, like I said, levels.
926000	932000	It's just like your power level, I guess. Dragon Ball Z ish. But because you can do stuff.
932000	936000	I mean, you do level up and your power goes up by so much.
936000	940000	But you can do other things that level or raise your power level as well.
940000	943000	Like they have side stuff like very much like borderlands.
943000	948000	I mean, the whole game is very similar to the borderlands as far as the whole style of the game.
948000	951000	And so you can do like these time challenge, you know.
951000	957000	OK, this is a rampage and you have to kill this many people in this amount of time.
957000	963000	And it's kind of its own instance thing. And then there's also like races and stuff, which sucks because
963000	968000	when I first attempted some of these races, I was actually doing pretty well on them.
968000	972000	But there was like some sort of lag in it, like I'd finished the race in the correct amount of time.
972000	977000	But it would add two seconds to the clock every time. It wasn't like I was missing a pylon or something like that.
977000	982000	It would just lag out, I guess. I don't know. It was weird.
982000	992000	Thankfully, I did manage to hit silver on this, which is what you have to do to get your extra experience and levels and stuff.
992000	994000	But it's pretty fun.
994000	999000	The only thing I don't really like about it because I have some guns that I find that are really fun to use and stuff.
999000	1005000	But once you've maxed up the level on those guns, you stop gaining experience on that weapon class.
1005000	1015000	So I have to switch to a different saw now or a different light machine gun, I guess, to keep leveling that skill up.
1015000	1024000	But it's fun. Last night I stayed up until midnight playing, basically going from one arc fall to the next.
1024000	1032000	It's okay. They're kind of getting a little boring because it's the same boss enemy that you're fighting each time.
1032000	1038000	Although I did find one that was a different boss bug thing that you fought. Actually, it was three of them. Three different types now.
1038000	1042000	But they're always this boss bug thing that you have to fight.
1042000	1048000	It's alright, but I wish they had a little bit more variety to it. Maybe that will come out later on.
1048000	1058000	I did notice though, one of the things that they are doing is they have specific challenges for the entire season and then specific challenges for each episode.
1058000	1066000	So as the episodes play on TV, you get different stuff that ties in with the episodes on TV.
1066000	1070000	They have certain challenges that you have to do and stuff. So I thought that was kind of cool.
1070000	1074000	So yeah, I've really been just playing a lot of that.
1074000	1081000	It's kind of fun because it's one of those games where you may not necessarily want to play with anybody and you can do that.
1081000	1087000	I'm pretty much soloing the whole game myself, but it's just the way they have the partying. It's not even really partying.
1087000	1092000	It's just you kind of go to the same area as other people and you just kind of help out and you get experience for it.
1092000	1097000	And you get your own loot and you don't have to fight over it because everybody gets loot that drops exclusively for them.
1097000	1100000	And that's it. Whatever you see on the ground is yours.
1100000	1106000	That's kind of like Diablo. I'm starting to see that in other MMOs. I want to say Guild Wars did that too. I can't remember.
1106000	1108000	Or Guild Wars 2, excuse me.
1108000	1114000	It's kind of fun. So I have gotten some clan invites and stuff, but I just don't feel like joining the clan or something.
1114000	1116000	You're a loner.
1116000	1121000	Well, it's not that. I would be fine joining clans and talking with them and stuff.
1121000	1128000	But my wife reads or plays on the computer and she hates it when I talk over the headset while I'm playing games.
1128000	1134000	Because I have my noise canceling headphones on and so I tend to be loud because I think I'm talking on normal volume.
1135000	1139000	But I can't hear myself because I have a headset on or headphones on.
1139000	1143000	So yeah, it's been pretty fun. So I've been playing that.
1143000	1151000	I played a little bit of more Modern Warfare 3 just because I've been having trouble fighting.
1151000	1155000	Well, I want to play Defiance during work, like on lunch.
1155000	1158000	But our internet sucks where we're located right now.
1158000	1166000	One of the wireless hubs is over there that is not working so I can't get internet on my Xbox 360 over there.
1166000	1171000	So I've been doing kind of like the survival modes in Modern Warfare 3 and that's been kind of fun.
1171000	1176000	And multiplayer deathmatch when we can't get enough people over there.
1178000	1183000	And really, I think that was it this week. It's been pretty much just Defiance, just playing that.
1183000	1187000	Alright, well, those MMO type of games will take up a bit of time.
1187000	1193000	Yeah, I'm having fun even though it is very bland looking and it's not a whole lot of variety to it,
1193000	1196000	but it's entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.
1198000	1203000	Well, my gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff. I revisited a few old things.
1203000	1209000	I played World of Warcraft, of course, because I do that a lot. Still doing PvP and having fun with it.
1209000	1214000	I did cancel Final Fantasy XI, which I talked a little more about on Hoard House, but Shane was very upset.
1214000	1220000	But he's coping and I'm waiting for Civ 5 to go on sale so he can do his half of the bargain. That'll be fun.
1220000	1227000	Other old games I revisited, I random, super random started playing Dota 2 because I hadn't really ever played it.
1227000	1230000	Like I've had the game viewer for a while, but hadn't played it myself.
1230000	1234000	And the nice thing is in Dota 2, you can set up a bot game because I'm like too afraid to play with real people
1234000	1238000	because I have no idea what I'm doing and playing with the bots just reinforce that.
1238000	1241000	But I was telling another friend of mine about this today and he's like, why are you playing Dota 2?
1241000	1244000	You need to play League of Legends with me. I will teach you how to play League of Legends.
1244000	1252000	So Rob will be testing the waters of a few different MOBAs over the next couple weeks and I'll let you know which one I settle on.
1252000	1259000	But I'm kind of curious what you guys out there in the O.L. Army, if you guys are League of Legends, are you Dota 2?
1259000	1264000	There's a couple others, right? I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. I know there's the Blizzard All-Stars. That's not out yet.
1264000	1265000	There's a couple other MOBAs.
1265000	1270000	There's one that's not very good. It's the Guardians of Middle Earth.
1270000	1278000	That's not very good, but it's not really a genre I play.
1278000	1281000	Otherwise, I played some more Harmonite this week.
1281000	1286000	There is another new game I played this week, but you'll have to wait for my review at vognetwork.com on Tuesday.
1286000	1289000	So look for that on the site on Tuesday.
1290000	1293000	And I think that's really about it.
1293000	1299000	Since there's the Tuesday game and then, wow, it took up most of my time, honestly.
1299000	1302000	I was busy with out-of-town guests and so forth.
1302000	1305000	Are you at all interested in the Star Trek game coming out next week?
1305000	1307000	Yes, I would like to actually check that out.
1307000	1308000	Star Trek game?
1308000	1313000	Yeah, it's based in the movie universe. It kind of bridges the first two games together.
1313000	1315000	Yeah, I've read some stuff about it. I'm interested in it.
1315000	1318000	Some of the Star Trek games for home have been pretty bad, though.
1318000	1321000	They were supposed to have been in development for at least three years.
1321000	1324000	Well, it was supposed to come out with the first movie, and it didn't.
1324000	1328000	So they held it back to make it better or whatever, so let's hope it worked.
1328000	1333000	Some of the Star Trek games have been real stinkers, but I remember the Next Generation game on Super Nintendo was awesome.
1333000	1342000	I actually did Star Trek Online until they went free-to-play and ruined the skill system.
1343000	1348000	I'd like to see a game that plays like that, but on the single player.
1350000	1354000	I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1354000	1358000	I can never say that name. I'm so sorry, guy.
1358000	1361000	Syle says, I can't MOBA to save my ass.
1362000	1368000	Let's see. Queen Cymia says, now, I don't really get Dota 2. How did they work that out legally?
1368000	1370000	How did they work that out legally?
1370000	1379000	The creators of the Warcraft 3 mod, Valve did their Valve thing and saw this innovation in the modding community, so they hired them.
1379000	1383000	That's where Portal came from, right? Valve does this.
1383000	1386000	That's where Team Fortress came from. Team Fortress was a Quake mod, right?
1386000	1388000	So they do this.
1388000	1390000	So they hired them to make Dota 2.
1390000	1395000	Obviously, Blizzard was not a fan of that, but they settled, as these legal things usually go.
1395000	1400000	Blizzard is going to call their game Blizzard All-Stars now, is their MOBA game.
1400000	1404000	And League of Legends was never called anything in the same category,
1404000	1411000	but I believe someone else involved with the original Dota mod is with the League of Legends team and Riot Games.
1411000	1415000	I mean, Riot Games is doing very well with League of Legends, so, you know.
1415000	1419000	There's plenty of room at the table for all of them, apparently.
1419000	1421000	Prince Brightstar in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
1421000	1426000	If you want a free-to-play that isn't pay-to-win, PSO2 is a great game.
1426000	1430000	I'm dying to play PSO2, but you must be playing the Japanese version, right?
1430000	1431000	Because it's not out here yet, right?
1431000	1433000	No, I don't think they're remotely doing betas yet.
1433000	1437000	I signed up for the beta ages ago, but I don't think that we're even close to US beta.
1437000	1442000	Yeah, I am thinking that's an E3 thing. I'm thinking Sega's sitting on it till E3.
1442000	1445000	They have nothing. There's literally nothing on the table for them coming out.
1445000	1450000	Well, I tell you what, there's nothing on the table for them coming out right now except for a couple PC titles.
1450000	1457000	But there's nothing. They have no announcements so far. There's nothing pending.
1457000	1463000	Speaking of Sega, I did overlook an iOS game I played a little bit this week, Sonic Dash.
1463000	1468000	It's free on iOS. It is Temple Run Sonic. That is all it is.
1468000	1472000	If you want your Temple Run with Sonic rings, there you go.
1472000	1482000	I actually find it to be, I mean, the pros of Sonic Dash is that, oh, Sonic, pretty, bright, vibrant compared to Temple Run, which is a little bit drab.
1482000	1486000	I mean, I love Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but it's kind of a drab palette in those games.
1486000	1493000	Sonic is very bright, vibrant. Characters you know. The ring sound is always refreshing to use that.
1493000	1500000	But then I do find it as a game and so forth to be under polished compared to Temple Run, which isn't.
1500000	1504000	Because, like, Pitfall was really well done for a Temple Run ripoff.
1504000	1511000	It's very interesting to see all these, like, established franchises kind of ripping on what's going on now that's popular.
1511000	1515000	It's really fascinating to me how that kind of comes full circle.
1515000	1518000	You actually indirectly reminded me of another game that I started.
1518000	1521000	Final Fantasy Dimensions for iOS.
1521000	1522000	Oh, that's a good one.
1522000	1525000	I only just started it, but it's cute. It's very old school.
1525000	1527000	The control's interesting.
1527000	1529000	The good news about that one is that it's free.
1529000	1531000	But if you like that one, that's very similar to what Final Fantasy.
1531000	1532000	I'll get five.
1532000	1533000	Yeah, what five looks like.
1533000	1536000	Yeah. But I don't want to pay seventeen bucks for it yet.
1536000	1545000	I didn't mention it in my week because I haven't gotten it yet, but my Ouya has shipped, apparently, via DHL.
1545000	1548000	So there is a chance that I may get it.
1548000	1549000	So you'll get it next year.
1549000	1552000	You'll get it eventually. Maybe in time for Christmas.
1552000	1555000	Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week. I've said enough.
1555000	1561000	So just quick housekeeping. Not a lot. We don't have any off shows coming up soon.
1561000	1565000	Maybe gone Memorial Day weekend, though. I might be out of town.
1565000	1568000	But that's not until the end of May, so we'll keep you posted.
1568000	1570000	Well, if you go to Disneyland, take me.
1570000	1572000	No, I'm not going to. I don't have a pass anymore.
1572000	1573000	So?
1573000	1577000	If I go to Disneyland, the next time I will probably go is in E3.
1577000	1580000	I still have to figure all that out, which, you know, I've been a bad boy.
1580000	1582000	We should do DisCon.
1582000	1586000	There's two parts to registration. I've done the first part, but not the second part because I need to get off my ass and do it.
1586000	1589000	But I keep getting distracted with all this other stuff.
1589000	1594000	But regardless of whether I go to E3 or not, Bobby's going to represent VOG.
1594000	1599000	And there's a very good chance I'll go down there and go to Disneyland with him like we did last year, right?
1599000	1600000	We went to Tronica and all that.
1600000	1605000	Yeah. I'm actually kind of sort of interested in the Mad Tea Party now.
1605000	1610000	Just because I've seen... I have friends that ship the Mad Tea Party.
1610000	1614000	Yeah. No. Sorry, guys. No. Mad Flop Party. Always and forever.
1614000	1616000	Electronica for life. All right.
1618000	1621000	Okay. So Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1621000	1623000	Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
1623000	1625000	Please follow us in our fan communities.
1625000	1630000	And next week on the show, if all goes according to plan, which I don't see why it won't,
1630000	1636000	two longtime friends of mine who I've been trying to get on the show for years are finally going to be here next week.
1636000	1637000	Yay!
1637000	1639000	And I'm really excited about it.
1639000	1642000	One of them hosts another podcast that you all ought to be listening to.
1642000	1643000	And I'll tell you more about that next week.
1643000	1644000	Tease, tease.
1644000	1645000	We should all do lunch.
1645000	1647000	We will try to work it out.
1647000	1649000	Twerk it.
1649000	1650000	All right.
1652000	1654000	Let us get into the gaming news this week.
1654000	1656000	There was a lot of news out of Nintendo this week, right, Logie?
1656000	1658000	Yes. A lot of stuff.
1658000	1663000	They have their special Nintendo Direct thing that was all 3DS.
1663000	1665000	Mostly 3DS, I suppose.
1665000	1668000	3DS-centric, I guess.
1668000	1676000	And one of the big announcements there is, hey, we're doing a new 3DS game for the Legend of Zelda series on the 3DS.
1676000	1677000	And guess what?
1677000	1679000	It's a sequel to Link of the Past.
1679000	1683000	Yeah, we just took the best game we made, and we made a sequel.
1683000	1686000	I was very, very happy.
1686000	1691000	And I'm most happy it's not another frickin' remake, that they're doing something different with it.
1691000	1696000	And I really would urge you guys, if you are a 3DS owner, check out the trailer.
1696000	1698000	YouTube doesn't do it justice.
1698000	1700000	Like, seeing it on 3DS is pretty rad.
1700000	1703000	Even better than the trailer, they actually have some leaked gameplay of it.
1703000	1705000	And check that out.
1705000	1709000	There's, I think, at least five minutes of gameplay, and it looks pretty awesome.
1709000	1712000	But it takes place in the same world as Link of the Past.
1712000	1719000	In fact, actually, there were some people on NeoGaf, I think, that actually took some of the screenshots from the video
1719000	1722000	and lined it up with some of the stuff that's in-game.
1722000	1727000	And yes, there are a few minor changes, but yes, the map is pretty much the same.
1727000	1730000	Or at least it appears that's going to be what happened.
1730000	1732000	So that's pretty awesome.
1732000	1734000	And then a whole lot of other stuff.
1734000	1738000	So first off, you've got Pikmin 3.
1738000	1740000	We were wondering when the hell this was supposed to come out.
1740000	1746000	It was supposed to be a near-launch launch window title for the Wii U.
1746000	1750000	I'm still not sure if it's launch window, because it is now August 4th.
1751000	1754000	Game and Wario now coming out June 23rd.
1756000	1765000	There's going to be a brand new system update for the Wii U, I guess, pretty soon this coming week.
1765000	1770000	And it's supposed to add some stuff that they were teasing about before on some of the other Nintendo Directs.
1770000	1775000	One of those being the ability to install updates while playing other games.
1775000	1778000	So you're going to be able to install software and updates and that kind of stuff.
1778000	1788000	And also improve load times from starting new apps up to switching between stuff and returning back to the Wii U menu.
1788000	1793000	Also, if you hold the B button, when you start the system up, it will go into Wii mode.
1793000	1797000	In case you want to play a Wii game, you don't have to take all those extra steps, I guess.
1797000	1799000	So you can play with your Wii easier?
1799000	1805000	Yes. And you'll be able to transfer data between USB drives and some other stuff.
1805000	1807000	So that's kind of neat.
1809000	1810000	Let's see...
1810000	1815000	Also, to kind of coincide with the whole Legend of Zelda announcement,
1815000	1821000	they're going to be putting up Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on the 3DS eShop.
1821000	1823000	That's May 30th.
1825000	1828000	Wii U virtual consoles coming out next week as well.
1828000	1830000	They're going to be...
1831000	1833000	Which game are they launching with here?
1834000	1837000	Doesn't say what the brand new game is, but basically the launch line up.
1837000	1848000	Excitebike, Super Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch-Out!, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, F-Zero, and GBA games and Nintendo 64 games planned later on.
1853000	1856000	New Yoshi Island game coming to the 3DS.
1856000	1862000	I'm not sure if that's going to tie in with that new Yoshi yarn type game that they have coming out later on.
1863000	1867000	But they showed a little bit of footage of it and it looks just like Yoshi Island.
1867000	1872000	Mario and Donkey Kong minis on the move coming to the eShop on May 9th.
1872000	1879000	New Super Luigi U DLC coming to New Super Mario Brothers U later in the summer.
1879000	1882000	New Mario Party is supposed to be coming out this fall.
1882000	1892000	Mario and Luigi Dream Team coming out in Europe July 12th in North America August 11th.
1892000	1898000	I think Jamie and I want to piggyback on this with a few other announcements and then we'll kind of break this down a little bit because it was a very busy conference.
1898000	1904000	But one of the other things announced here is that the Wii U is going to get the spring system update next week is happening.
1904000	1907000	So that's nice. That's happening very soon.
1907000	1911000	This is going to be the one that helps improve the loading times dramatically apparently.
1911000	1914000	Changing between the different software is supposed to get better.
1914000	1916000	Yeah because it's super slow right now.
1916000	1917000	Yeah it's not that great right now.
1917000	1919000	Some other little features you might not have known about.
1919000	1923000	I mean that's the one everybody's waiting for but also you're going to be able to transfer data between the USB drives.
1923000	1927000	And you can install background downloaded software while playing other games.
1927000	1929000	I didn't realize you couldn't do that now.
1929000	1935000	I thought you could do like remember because remember the system updates you can kind of install those while you're playing.
1935000	1939000	Well regardless that whole thing is going to get better so that's good.
1939000	1944000	And the Wii U will continue to download and install software while the system is powered down.
1944000	1949000	Which you don't have to go set yourself on that screen and wait for it to do it.
1949000	1953000	I mean these are all things that seem very logical in this day and age so thankfully they're catching up there.
1953000	1959000	You can also, this is pretty cool, hold the B button at the start up to go right into the Wii mode.
1960000	1963000	So like if you just got Pandora's Tower or something and you're playing it on your Wii U.
1963000	1967000	It's a great way for you to just bypass all the crap and go right into the Wii if you want.
1967000	1972000	It's stupid that you can't just, can you just put in like a Wii game into your system and have it just boot up?
1972000	1976000	No it has to go into the Wii shell because I think the way the console-
1976000	1977000	That's so dumb.
1977000	1982000	No I think the way the console's built is that they have the, I think you have a Wii in there to do all that.
1982000	1984000	But that's still really dumb.
1984000	1991000	It's weird but I mean if they're using different graphics processors and all that then I get it.
1991000	1995000	I mean it's weird but it might just not be technically possible.
1995000	1999000	I think Loki touched on this a little bit talking about some of those Virtual Console releases.
1999000	2003000	But just to confirm, Virtual Console happens on Wii U next week.
2003000	2011000	Launch Lineup, Excitebike, Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight and F-Zero.
2011000	2014000	Some of those games have already come out through the 30 Cent program.
2014000	2018000	Like I know F-Zero is one of those, Balloon Fight, Punch Out.
2018000	2023000	Some of these haven't happened yet though. Super Mario World isn't one of them and I don't think it's in the lineup.
2023000	2024000	No.
2024000	2028000	I think, is the next game Super Metroid? No the next game's like a Yoshi game I think.
2028000	2031000	I was gonna say Super Mario World, that's like 30 cents, hell yeah.
2031000	2035000	But GBA Games, a part of this, which is cool because that wasn't on Wii.
2035000	2040000	You didn't have GBA Games on Wii, you had them on DS, 3DS, but not Wii.
2040000	2044000	And I think you only got Advance games through the Ambassador program.
2044000	2047000	Have they done Advance games? I don't even know. I don't think they have.
2047000	2051000	So this could be interesting, what'll happen there. Don't know why they wouldn't.
2051000	2055000	Yeah, Nintendo 64 games coming out in the future as well.
2055000	2061000	Which were on the Wii, so you know, for most people it'll be an upgrade I suppose.
2061000	2064000	And then Dark Soccer, I think you have a Whopper bit of news for us too right?
2064000	2067000	Yes I do, if Bobby will stop spoiling.
2067000	2073000	Seriously, stop telling about the future. You know what happens, you watch Doctor Who don't you?
2073000	2081000	Anyway, Earthbound is going to be coming out in North America and Europe as in Mother 2, as it was in Japan.
2081000	2087000	It will be on the Wii U Virtual Console towards the end of the year.
2087000	2092000	And there's not a, I don't see that there is an actual release date on it yet.
2092000	2097000	But I'm expecting them to have a date out before E3.
2097000	2101000	I mean, unless they're saving that date for E3 or whatever the hell they're doing.
2101000	2103000	That'd be a pretty good bullet point in E3 Ants about it.
2103000	2107000	Well that could be one of those things where it's like, oh yeah remember how we said Earthbound was coming out?
2107000	2108000	Go get it, it's up now, right now.
2108000	2110000	No, why don't we get Mother 3?
2110000	2118000	Well you know the fan translators offered to give it to Nintendo for free, but legally I don't think that can happen.
2119000	2122000	Why if they agree to it? I don't see what...
2122000	2126000	I think it's just weird territory.
2126000	2133000	Because they had to do things that Nintendo doesn't endorse per the terms of license in order to mod the game.
2133000	2138000	Like dumping a cartridge to your computer is not something you're supposed to do to begin with.
2138000	2142000	It's not in your user agreement that is that fine print in the manual.
2142000	2146000	So I think if Nintendo were to legally acknowledge that, it puts them in a really weird place.
2147000	2150000	Yeah but people do a lot of stuff they're not supposed to do all the time.
2150000	2151000	I know right.
2151000	2160000	I think that they would find a way around it if they wanted to find a way around it.
2160000	2165000	It's their property, they can give the permission. But, leaving it there.
2165000	2169000	But I'm excited even though I already have it.
2170000	2174000	Yeah I'm excited about Earthbound 2 just because it's a much...
2174000	2178000	For those of us that don't have a cartridge lying around, which I don't anymore.
2178000	2181000	Now I'm kicking myself for selling this shit years ago.
2181000	2184000	But it's a nice way to pick it up again.
2184000	2186000	And the Wii U Virtual Console is pretty good.
2186000	2193000	They pulled it off very well, the sound sounds great out of the four speakers between your TV and the gamepad.
2193000	2197000	Well I need to come over and actually just sit and play the Wii U for a while.
2197000	2204000	But we're probably holding out for the PS4 ourselves.
2204000	2208000	We're pretty... So far that's where we're landing at home.
2208000	2210000	Okay.
2211000	2216000	Alright well, so we're curious. There was a lot of Nintendo news.
2216000	2221000	I'm curious in here in the room, what were you guys most jazzed about from the Nintendo...
2221000	2224000	Well first off, I should take a big step back.
2224000	2229000	Because Loki, you're the biggest critic of Nintendo on this show.
2229000	2233000	Were you moved at all by this Nintendo Direct? Or were you like, meh?
2233000	2235000	I'm the biggest critic of everybody.
2235000	2237000	Okay fair enough.
2239000	2243000	None of the news... I mean once again I'm not gonna go buy a system.
2243000	2247000	I'm not gonna go get a 3DS again just for Legend of Zelda.
2247000	2250000	I think it's cool that they're doing that game.
2250000	2253000	A lot of the other announcements I couldn't really care about.
2253000	2256000	I mean like Yoshi's Island. Eh, whatever. It was cool.
2256000	2258000	You know, do a sequel I guess.
2258000	2264000	I'm just... I mean at the same time I like that they're doing sequels to their old titles.
2264000	2267000	But I kinda wish there was something new.
2267000	2271000	Like, just something new from Nintendo.
2271000	2274000	Because a lot of it seems to be going back to rehashes of old things.
2274000	2278000	And I know everybody loves nostalgia, but I just want something new.
2278000	2283000	Like a brand new property from Nintendo that doesn't resemble Wii Sports.
2283000	2285000	That doesn't resemble Nintendo Land.
2285000	2288000	It's not a 2D Mario remake or something like that.
2288000	2291000	I want something... like Mario Galaxy was a good example of something.
2291000	2293000	It's sort of like Mario 64, but...
2293000	2295000	Yeah, but it was so different.
2295000	2296000	Exactly.
2296000	2299000	Yeah, I mean it's Mario, but it's really not. You know?
2299000	2302000	Yeah, I want something like that.
2302000	2304000	You know? That would be...
2305000	2309000	Even if they put Mario or Link's face on it, you're okay. You just want some new ideas.
2309000	2311000	Yes, I just want something new.
2311000	2313000	I mean, because a lot of... and...
2313000	2319000	Don't get me wrong. I think that the whole, you know, new Zelda game is pretty awesome, but...
2319000	2322000	I mean, I guess it is a little bit different.
2322000	2324000	It's a different approach to it in the same world and stuff.
2324000	2326000	It's all 3D now, but...
2326000	2329000	I don't know. I just kinda want something new from them.
2329000	2331000	I guess. Something innovative.
2331000	2333000	Ross Steele, UT, in our chatroom says,
2333000	2336000	I wasn't really jazzed about anything. The 3DS is doing fine.
2336000	2339000	We need Wii U news and not fucking Earthbound.
2339000	2344000	I think there's a reason this is happening now and not at E3.
2344000	2348000	Because a lot of people are saying, like, shouldn't they have announced the Link to the Past sequel at E3?
2348000	2354000	That seems very weird that they would just on a random day of the week for no reason announce a Zelda sequel.
2354000	2356000	You know, it's a pretty big deal.
2356000	2359000	I'm hoping that means they are clearing space for...
2359000	2363000	Well, that's what they did last summer. They have three Nintendo Directs and their stupid press conference.
2363000	2367000	Yeah. Well, also, keep in mind, Nintendo can only really speak to a lot of Nintendo stuff.
2367000	2369000	They don't always get into third-party stuff.
2369000	2371000	They do, obviously. They do sometimes.
2371000	2375000	But, you know, sometimes a lot more third-party information comes out at E3.
2375000	2381000	Which, considering the Wii U could really use a boost from third parties, that would be a great thing.
2381000	2386000	Do you think maybe Bayonetta 2, this E3, do you think they've been able to push it out this fast or maybe not?
2386000	2387000	No.
2387000	2389000	It needs to be on stuff other than the Wii U.
2389000	2390000	It won't. It won't.
2390000	2392000	I know, but it needs to be.
2392000	2393000	It won't.
2393000	2395000	Never say never.
2395000	2396000	Yeah, never say never.
2396000	2398000	Never say never. And here's why. Here's why.
2398000	2399000	Because...
2399000	2400000	Don't stop believing.
2400000	2405000	Tecmakoe developed Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge for the Wii U.
2405000	2407000	It was published by Nintendo.
2407000	2410000	Came out in other systems later on. Published by Tecmakoe.
2410000	2414000	They could easily, if it flops, and I'm sure...
2414000	2420000	I'd hope that they have something in there that says, okay, this game flops, so we can put it out on other systems.
2420000	2423000	I think it'll come out later on. I think it's gonna be like a time delay.
2423000	2426000	Like, they're gonna have a window or something and then it'll come out later on.
2426000	2430000	All five of you who bought a Wii U here a month later. Here, everybody else.
2430000	2432000	I kinda think they're gonna price drop at E3.
2432000	2434000	I think that's just what the inevitable thing is gonna happen.
2434000	2437000	I think they might sneak out the Wii backwards compatibility.
2438000	2440000	I don't think a price drop's gonna help.
2440000	2442000	I mean, it'll help, but it's not gonna be enough.
2442000	2446000	Because the excuse is, right now, I think there's nothing I can play on it.
2446000	2449000	All they have to do is exactly what they did with the 3DS.
2449000	2453000	If they do exactly what they did with the 3DS at this E3.
2453000	2458000	If Reggie comes out on stage and says, you want some fucking games? Here's some fucking games.
2458000	2461000	And then bam, bam, bam. It's gonna fix everything.
2461000	2464000	It's easy to sit here now and say no.
2464000	2470000	But when he comes out on stage, if he goes F-Zero is fucking happening on the Wii U.
2470000	2474000	Like, done. Nintendo is saved. Hurry up.
2474000	2476000	I don't think they're gonna have time because, okay.
2476000	2481000	But they pulled Mario Kart 7 out of thin air. They pulled the, what was the other game that came out?
2481000	2483000	Well, let's just say it was being worked on behind the scenes.
2483000	2485000	Exactly. They could still be working on stuff that we don't know about.
2485000	2488000	There's such things as NDAs and people who don't break them.
2488000	2492000	I just think though that, but right now we know that there's no EA.
2492000	2496000	For example, there's no EA Sports titles for the Wii U at all. Nothing.
2496000	2499000	No Madden. No FIFA. That's it.
2499000	2502000	And so far, no NBA 2K either.
2502000	2507000	So, I mean, I understand if you're thinking about purchasing a new system.
2507000	2512000	And let's say a lot of mainstream people that buy games do play Madden or do play a sports title.
2512000	2515000	You know, not everybody. No, I don't.
2515000	2518000	But a lot of people do. And that's kind of disappointing.
2518000	2522000	That not, you know, it kind of makes you think, hmm, do I really want to get, you know, a Wii U?
2522000	2526000	Or do I want to pick up another system that's gonna actually have the games I want on it?
2526000	2530000	And it's also a photo of lack of confidence from these publishers.
2530000	2533000	And EA being a big publisher, you know, I don't know.
2533000	2536000	Activision supporting them with garbage right now.
2536000	2538000	But they're supporting the Wii U.
2538000	2542000	They have the, you know, their Walking Dead game, which is absolute shit.
2542000	2549000	And then followed by the Fast and the Furious showdown, which I'm sure is gonna be awesome.
2549000	2552000	And not total shit.
2552000	2556000	Call of Duty will be coming out, I'm sure.
2556000	2560000	Let's see. Some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2560000	2563000	Strudels89 says, Rob such the optimist.
2563000	2570000	Well, maybe a little bit. I just don't think they're gonna roll over and let all their critics get the best of them.
2570000	2572000	They didn't do it with the 3DS. Again, I'm just, you know...
2572000	2574000	I understand that, but what is...
2574000	2577000	Let me say this too, because this is important. This is an important follow-up comment.
2577000	2581000	Flaco Jones says, another third place finish like the GameCube, but they'll be fine.
2581000	2587000	And I could see that happening, that, you know, maybe the Wii U is not gonna shatter whatever this next Xbox.
2587000	2592000	Although, if some of these rumors about the next Xbox come to play, I don't know if Nintendo would necessarily be third.
2592000	2595000	But Sony's looking pretty good right now out of them all.
2595000	2598000	So, you know, even if they did finish third.
2598000	2603000	And another comment, WhatUpG says Nintendo will be fine because their handheld is doing well. Correct.
2603000	2607000	And it does put Nintendo in an interesting position where if they do decide to just, you know...
2607000	2610000	Okay, Wii U went all Virtual Boy, we're gonna write it off.
2610000	2619000	They might be in an interesting position where they could do another console after whatever Microsoft and PlayStation does, and Sony does, excuse me.
2619000	2624000	And it's gonna put them in a very interesting position if they fix their mistakes.
2624000	2627000	They're not. History has shown they are not gonna fix their mistakes.
2627000	2632000	I mean, how long has it taken them to understand how to do online?
2632000	2635000	Something that's been around for a decade now.
2635000	2640000	I'm not gonna disagree with you there. If they can't get online right, they're doomed.
2640000	2642000	I'm not gonna disagree with you there.
2642000	2645000	I still think that no matter what, Nintendo's gonna be fine.
2645000	2648000	They're gonna, they're making plenty of money with their handhelds.
2648000	2652000	I mean, basically, they could just put out a console for shits.
2652000	2656000	And say, Hey, look, we have a console. It's called the Lol U.
2656000	2660000	Lol at U for buying it. I know, right?
2660000	2667000	But either way, I mean, it's, and I've seen people draw comparisons between them and Sega with the Dreamcast.
2667000	2671000	Which I actually think that that's completely not even close to the same part.
2671000	2677000	Because what Sega was dealing with, they were coming off the fallout of the Saturn and the very, very awful marketing in the US.
2677000	2681000	They also didn't have oodles of money in the bank like Nintendo does.
2681000	2682000	Exactly.
2682000	2686000	Don't forget all that Wii money. They made a lot of money on the Wii.
2686000	2691000	The Wii turned a nice little profit because it wasn't the most powerful piece of hardware in the world.
2691000	2692000	That money's in the bank.
2692000	2693000	Yeah.
2693000	2700000	I mean, even, I'll admit, I was standing in line for my Wii at Target.
2700000	2704000	But we also bribed our way into the line with donuts and coffee, me and Kristen.
2704000	2713000	But at the same time, Nintendo is coming off a series of successes, of near failures that they've turned around.
2713000	2716000	They don't have that problem with the marketing that Sega came out of.
2716000	2719000	I don't really see where the comparison really is.
2719000	2724000	Except that, okay, so yeah, white systems don't really do very well in the US.
2724000	2725000	But look at the Wii.
2726000	2732000	I don't know what that was because in Japan it was, the Saturn was a silver box.
2732000	2734000	Over here it was a black box.
2734000	2736000	Just marketing is weird stuff.
2736000	2744000	All right, well, before we move on to our next story, since this Nintendo Direct was one of the biggest news stories in gaming this week,
2744000	2752000	we do want to take this opportunity to use our new feature on the website and go to a live listener poll.
2753000	2756000	Let's go to the live listener poll at vognetwork.com.
2757000	2763000	If you are at live.vognetwork.com right now, you can participate in our live poll.
2763000	2767000	What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?
2767000	2768000	Here are the answers.
2768000	2780000	OMG Earthbound, OMG Zelda Link to the Past sequel, OMG Yoshi's Island, OMG Super Luigi U, or meh, Nintendo.
2781000	2786000	Vote now, live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate in the poll, live.vognetwork.com.
2786000	2788000	We'll see it right underneath the chat box.
2788000	2790000	I agree with Bob Coffee.
2790000	2794000	Sega, he said Sega was dealing with shit management and no Segata Sanchiro.
2794000	2801000	We would have been, okay, I don't know if anyone other than like three of us knows about Segata Sanchiro.
2801000	2804000	Segata Sanchiro was the mascot of the Saturn in Japan.
2804000	2810000	This guy with floofy hair, wearing a gi, going around punching the hell out of everything.
2810000	2814000	And they did a commercial for him for the Dreamcast.
2814000	2818000	And there was even a Segata Sanchiro game that came out on Saturn.
2818000	2823000	If we had Segata Sanchiro, still the Dreamcast would have lived.
2824000	2827000	Interesting watching the live results of our poll coming in right now.
2827000	2830000	Mad Nintendo is winning with half the vote right now.
2830000	2834000	Interesting, watch this as it develops, live.vognetwork.com.
2834000	2837000	You do have to be registered at Vognetwork in order to be able to vote in the poll.
2837000	2842000	Because, you know, there might be some little incentives on the site tied to participating.
2842000	2844000	So you should check that out.
2844000	2850000	Okay, meanwhile, why don't we move on with more news besides just what's going on with Nintendo, right, Loki?
2850000	2856000	Yes, so there was a series that was on TV that I was really hopeful for.
2856000	2861000	And then the writer strike happened and the writing went downhill.
2861000	2863000	And that was Heroes.
2863000	2868000	Well, the rumor is that Microsoft wants to bring back Heroes, reboot the whole series.
2868000	2872000	Obviously with new people because a lot of the cast has moved on to other things.
2872000	2875000	But they kind of did this with Heroes on the web.
2875000	2883000	They had like their webisodes or something like that with some different hero characters that the fans designed which were crap.
2884000	2893000	And yeah, so I think it would be kind of cool to see a new series kick off.
2893000	2898000	Hopefully it just didn't fall into what I like to call the matrix problem.
2898000	2903000	Where you give a character like Neo way too much power too fast.
2903000	2909000	And you're like, fuck, how do I deal with this next, you know, the next movie or next season?
2910000	2914000	Crap. Yeah, so you just need to wrap it up slowly.
2914000	2920000	But apparently they're saying that this is going to be part of the whole TV focus.
2920000	2922000	And it might be some of the original Xbox programming.
2922000	2925000	And I can see this happening, especially since, you know, you have series now.
2925000	2934000	Well, you have Netflix and Amazon doing like reboots and brand new, you know, exclusive series for those content streamers.
2934000	2937000	So it makes sense that they could do that.
2937000	2943000	This certainly leads to the other, you know, interesting discussion that goes with this of what other series could be revived.
2943000	2948000	Because like, you know, I'm sure a lot of us go Firefly. Can we have Firefly? Can we have more Firefly?
2948000	2951000	You know, that's not going to happen because then Joss is just going to kill everybody else.
2951000	2956000	Yeah. And Fox would never. So Fox will, Fox will just not let it happen just to spite.
2956000	2960000	I think I saw that horse twitch. I'm going to kick it in its face again.
2961000	2967000	But, you know, it's very interesting kind of where and we'll get into this a little more with our Fugu question of the week later on.
2967000	2971000	But it's very interesting with all these, you know, content delivery services coming up with their own programming.
2971000	2975000	You see Netflix doing it too with the rest of development. You know, they brought back from the dead.
2975000	2978000	And we got Whose Line coming back.
2978000	2980000	Yeah, that's a CW show.
2980000	2984000	Yeah, but still I'm saying, you know, there are these series of revivals.
2984000	2986000	Technically Whose Line is a game show.
2986000	2992000	So it follows, I mean, I know it's kind of not, but it's, I think it actually follows the rules of a game show when it comes to TV.
2992000	2996000	So it's a weird, you know, game shows come and go all the time.
2996000	3002000	I am very disappointed that they didn't try to go all meta with, you know, Whose Line and have Bob Barker host it.
3002000	3005000	That would have been, did she just have him guest host one episode?
3005000	3007000	You know what though? Ayesha Tyler's a great choice.
3007000	3009000	And she is. She's a total gamer.
3009000	3010000	And she's one of us.
3010000	3014000	She's a total gamer, you know, and she's, she's funny. She's really funny. So I'm looking forward to seeing.
3014000	3017000	As long as I get my Greg Proops on there from time to time, I'll be happy.
3017000	3020000	Drew Carey was a great host, but he's got another gig.
3020000	3028000	So, which is weird because Ayesha Tyler does that talk show, but you know, they, they tape like a whole three months worth of shows in a day.
3028000	3031000	So, you know, they figured out.
3031000	3034000	All right. Uh, let me, what else do I want to say with this?
3034000	3042000	Oh, um, did we talk about what kind of potential extra cost could be if they're going to save a show like Heroes?
3042000	3049000	That's not going to come for free, right? Would that be Xbox Gold? Would maybe I get that as an Xbox Gold member?
3049000	3053000	Or maybe this is part of a new Xbox Platinum or something? Or what happens?
3053000	3056000	I don't think that they should be charged. I don't think they'll charge any, well.
3056000	3060000	Xbox Platinum was that crappy little card that did nothing.
3060000	3061000	No, yeah, yeah.
3061000	3063000	Let's say they ignored it like I did and did it again.
3063000	3068000	Okay. Well, I don't think, I don't think that they would do that per se.
3068000	3074000	I think that they could do more advertising, but who's to say that they're not going to be fucking greedy and still want more money on top of it?
3074000	3084000	Although, it's going to be a hard sell if, like say, the PlayStation 4 still has the same type of scheme where it's, you know, regular PlayStation.
3084000	3090000	You get online multiplayer and plus you get, you know, extra stuff.
3091000	3102000	Because I got to be honest, I mean, I do a lot of gaming on the 360, but I am jealous of, you know, the deal that you get with, you know, PlayStation Plus.
3102000	3106000	I mean, it's pretty nice with that instant game collection stuff.
3106000	3112000	But I, unfortunately, a lot of my friends are on Xbox Live, so.
3113000	3119000	Alright. Well, before we get into the next story, I want to go to the results of the live poll that we took earlier.
3119000	3122000	What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?
3122000	3130000	I got to say, I'm a little surprised with these answers, but this is why we do this, because then as we learn things, the winner of the poll, meh Nintendo, 50% of the vote.
3130000	3133000	50% don't care. Interesting.
3133000	3148000	And I was kind of looking in the chat room and just so you know, among the non-meh crowd, 25% of the vote for the Zelda Link to the Past sequel, 18.75% for Earthbound and 6.25% for Super Luigi U.
3148000	3150000	So, interesting.
3150000	3152000	Is that 6% Ronma?
3152000	3158000	It could be. It could be. I don't know. I could look at the results, but I'm not going to look at who voted for what.
3158000	3164000	But I was looking at chat to try to figure out, like, why people are voting the way they are.
3164000	3170000	And it seems like a lot of people are just like, you know, I haven't been convinced that I need to pick up these Nintendo consoles.
3170000	3173000	So, you know, this news doesn't really get me excited.
3174000	3180000	Here's my thing. I understand that they have a certain strategy with announcing titles because they don't know development cycles and how far.
3180000	3186000	They don't want to announce a title, Smash Brothers, well before it's going to come out.
3186000	3193000	But at the same time, I would think that, why would you waste time dicking around when your console's not selling very well?
3194000	3204000	And, you know, if you have stuff to announce, like a price drop, sure, you can wait until E3 and do it and make a little bit of a splash and stuff like that.
3204000	3209000	But I would think it would be in your best interest to help your console now instead of later.
3209000	3213000	Because the more time you wait, the worse it's going to get for you.
3213000	3218000	Because say you have someone that's waiting for Wii U, I really want a good title to come out.
3218000	3221000	And then it's just like nothing. You don't hear about anything for a long time.
3221000	3228000	You're like, you know what, I'm just going to go get an Xbox. Money's already spent, and aw crap, they announced a good title. Oh well.
3228000	3241000	Well, what also surprised me about some of the reaction I'm seeing in the chatroom as to why people voted that way is that, you know, a big reason why they do these Nintendo Directs is to get out there on the internet, why you should own a 3DS, because you don't already.
3241000	3245000	And a Zelda Link to the Past sequel didn't sell that for people yet?
3246000	3256000	Granted, to be fair, I totally know that people are like, I'm not going to buy a freaking system based off a two minute trailer. Show me the game and then we'll see. I can respect that.
3256000	3261000	The 3DS, I don't think it has any problems whatsoever saying reasons you need to buy a 3DS.
3261000	3267000	I think that there's plenty of games out there, they've got a lot of really good games, and I think there's plenty of reasons on it.
3267000	3271000	I'm talking about the Wii U. That isn't there. And if they're going to wait-
3271000	3273000	But the Nintendo Direct wasn't about Wii U.
3273000	3281000	I don't care if it's about the Wii U. The Wii U is hurting and they haven't had an Nintendo Direct about the Wii U. Except for the stupid way.
3281000	3288000	Oh dirty, you're just Luigi, let's announce all these Luigi things. And the biggest thing they haven't announced was DLC for a game that they already put out.
3288000	3291000	I mean, you need something that's-
3291000	3301000	Yeah, but like, I put this Super Luigi U DLC next to some of the DLC that other companies put out. Let's say the Saints Row DLC Loki.
3301000	3309000	Okay, yes, I'll give you that, but let's put it this way. Hasn't sold any systems. Did we see a big jump in numbers after they made that announcement? No.
3309000	3316000	No, because DLC will keep it afloat and keep people having their Wii U's plugged in, but it's not going to move the system.
3316000	3323000	All that's going to happen is when it gets dropped in price, they'll bundle it with New Super Mario Brothers U Game of the Year Edition or some garbage like that.
3323000	3329000	They'll have the New Luigi U DLC bundled in there. That's all that's going to happen.
3329000	3336000	Well, we'll see. E3, hopefully a game changer. If not, going to be very interesting next year for Nintendo.
3336000	3344000	I think Falco just made a good point. If the best thing about your next gen system is the release of a nearly 20 year old game, your next gen console sucks.
3344000	3348000	But that's relying on-
3348000	3354000	But that's only really considering what's coming out of this conference. But I get it, Nintendo needs to light a fire under the Wii U.
3354000	3360000	I'm not going to sit here and defend Nintendo. No, Nintendo needs to get more people excited about the Wii U.
3360000	3365000	They need to pull the curtain back a little bit on what they're working on, and E3 is the deadline for that to happen.
3365000	3371000	But is it just me, or is there a lot of developers now just sort of banking in on that nostalgia?
3371000	3381000	Well, why not? We run up to the trough and hit the feeder bar. How much did we all squee about Earthbound linked to the past?
3382000	3385000	Well, apparently not the listenership, but I know I did.
3385000	3393000	To be honest, I'm not super excited either. I don't have a 3DS, I didn't get one because it gives me a headache.
3393000	3403000	It's really hard for me to put this into words. I want to see something new and exciting, and that's why my attention has been on the indie developers.
3403000	3406000	Because they're doing the new and exciting.
3406000	3413000	Ross Steel UT in the chat room saying, why isn't the Link to the Past sequel on the Wii U? That'd help if they didn't ass it up with gimmicks.
3413000	3417000	Good point. Why not this game that gets people really excited on the Wii U?
3417000	3421000	My assumption is because we're going to get a Zelda trailer this year.
3421000	3427000	You won't get the new Zelda this year, but you're going to get that trailer that gets you just enough fan wank to get people excited.
3427000	3430000	I'm going to get the new Zelda. It's the Wind Waker thing. It's supposed to be a remake.
3430000	3433000	Oh yeah, the Wind Waker. I meant like, you know...
3433000	3435000	Just wake me when the wank is over.
3435000	3443000	I'm telling you, it makes perfect sense, and the setup is so perfect that I would be shocked if...
3443000	3449000	Maybe not this year, because they are a little slow to adopt virtual consoles now just coming out.
3449000	3453000	How many months later? Six months later?
3453000	3461000	I mean, so they're a little slow to adopt things, but I would be shocked that we do not see a way to play 3DS games on the Wii U.
3461000	3468000	Or, let's just say that they're not going to do that, seeing some HD remakes of 3DS games coming to the Wii U.
3468000	3471000	It only makes sense that they're going to do that.
3471000	3473000	Alright, well let's move on.
3473000	3479000	Dark Soccer brought up indie developers, and this could be a place where Nintendo could...
3479000	3482000	And it seems like something could be happening there, who knows?
3482000	3487000	But this would be the group you would want to get in bed with if you were a game developer.
3487000	3489000	It looks like they're in bed with Microsoft, though.
3489000	3490000	So is it sexy times?
3490000	3502000	Yeah, but Mojang, Marcus Pearson, of course Notch, and Jens Bergensten, they have made Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2013.
3502000	3508000	Now, Time's 100 list kind of gets some, you know...
3508000	3514000	I think Lady Gaga won or came in second place in an online poll of who's...
3514000	3519000	Take some of this stuff with a grain of salt, but it is nice to see gaming represented and indie gaming at that.
3519000	3525000	And the cool thing is that Will Wright, you know, SimCity before it was, you know, this last one,
3525000	3530000	actually wrote the introduction talking that Minecraft was, quote,
3530000	3536000	a wonderful combination of accessibility and depth allowing for complex output with simple input.
3536000	3542000	And, you know, Minecraft was an amazing thing for gaming.
3542000	3546000	So I'm glad this is getting acknowledged.
3546000	3555000	I went from payter to tolerator to digging holes in the ground prairie dogger.
3555000	3558000	I'm going to make it a point this week because I've been really bad at not going to the server.
3558000	3562000	I'm going to play every single day this week.
3562000	3565000	I live streamed it last week.
3565000	3566000	I'm going to play every single day.
3566000	3568000	My prairie doghouse.
3568000	3577000	I guess apparently Time did that poll online, and this is saying that Notch ranked second in the poll.
3577000	3580000	So it was Notch or it was Lady Gaga.
3580000	3584000	I mean, you know, what's the difference, right?
3584000	3585000	Lady Notch, Notch.
3585000	3589000	They're essentially the same person.
3589000	3591000	All right, so congrats to them.
3591000	3592000	I'm curious.
3592000	3595000	Now the question is, what's next?
3595000	3599000	You know, they had that unit with the universe game was their next big project, right?
3599000	3602000	The camera, the name of the scrolls that they're doing.
3602000	3603000	Yes.
3603000	3607000	They've got the you know, the fuck the games call.
3607000	3608000	It's like 0x00.
3608000	3611000	That's that's the one I'm thinking of.
3611000	3612000	Yeah.
3612000	3613000	Yeah.
3613000	3618000	So although that one, he's claiming that he's running to kind of like a writer's block almost with it.
3618000	3623000	So he's working on other things right now until he figures out what to do with it.
3623000	3624000	Gotcha.
3624000	3625000	All right.
3625000	3626000	Let's move on.
3626000	3628000	We're still a little ways from the classic game of the week.
3628000	3629000	Some more news for you first.
3629000	3637000	Well, now, this is something I'm excited about, even though, yeah, it's kind of me biting myself because of the nostalgia thing.
3637000	3639000	But I was super happy.
3639000	3645000	Castle of Illusion is getting remade for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.
3645000	3652000	It is being developed by Sega Studios Australia and it will be a, I guess, a 2.5D kind of game.
3652000	3665000	This is a 2D 3D hybrid and it is basically based off of the Genesis slash Mega Drive game with the original director working with the developer now.
3665000	3669000	So there's a trailer out for it.
3669000	3672000	I totally recommend everybody watch it because it looks super good.
3672000	3675000	But I do not see a date on it.
3675000	3677000	Yeah, I don't think they have a date for it yet.
3677000	3678000	Yeah.
3678000	3681000	However, I mean, I played the shit out of this game.
3681000	3694000	I even, when I graduated high school, I traded my Super Nintendo for my friend's Genesis and sat playing this game for just the whole night.
3694000	3700000	And then I found his Master System converter and then was playing Alex Kidd in Shinobi World and that was pretty awesome too.
3700000	3705000	But yeah, Castle of Illusion is one of my top Disney games.
3705000	3708000	Yeah, that was a great game so it's exciting to hear about this.
3708000	3711000	The pictures are absolutely gorgeous but seriously, watch the trailer.
3711000	3718000	It is maybe not as orgasm inducing as DuckTales but, you know, there's lots of wank.
3718000	3721000	It'll still get you going down there a little bit?
3721000	3723000	It'll make one moist.
3723000	3725000	Ew.
3725000	3727000	That's just a fun word.
3727000	3728000	Moist?
3728000	3729000	Moist.
3729000	3734000	I was going to bring it up here in studio real quick just to be able to see some of this here in action.
3734000	3739000	Let me get to the actual gameplay part of the trailer.
3739000	3742000	It does look really good.
3742000	3744000	The graphics.
3744000	3747000	Yeah, this is more, there's not much of the gameplay.
3747000	3749000	Yeah, Maleficent.
3749000	3751000	Was that Maleficent?
3751000	3754000	Her face looks a little weird though.
3754000	3758000	Yeah, they don't have any gameplay in that but they actually have some screenshots that look pretty sweet.
3758000	3759000	Yeah.
3759000	3761000	Good times.
3762000	3764000	Oh, Codeman, I'm sorry.
3764000	3765000	What?
3765000	3769000	This isn't you. We actually have a friend, our friend Beanie.
3769000	3773000	You say the word moist around her, she full body shudders. It's hilarious.
3773000	3775000	Wasn't that the mom in Dead Like Me?
3775000	3776000	I never watched that.
3776000	3778000	Dead Like Me was a great show.
3778000	3780000	Well, I know it was a great show but I never watched it.
3780000	3782000	Critical Myth, back me up. You like that show, right?
3782000	3784000	You're the TV connoisseur around here.
3784000	3786000	Rob Moist.
3786000	3788000	I love that word.
3788000	3789000	I like cake.
3789000	3791000	Anyhow, Toilette.
3791000	3792000	Alright.
3792000	3793000	Moist Toilette.
3793000	3798000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming to a gaming store near you, Loki.
3798000	3803000	Today, Lego City Undercover The Chase Begins came out on the 3DS.
3803000	3810000	Tuesday, Dead Island Riptide coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.
3810000	3816000	Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, it's kind of like the game re-released with their expansion in there.
3816000	3819000	That's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3819000	3825000	And then Star Trek on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3825000	3828000	And those would be your games for this week.
3828000	3832000	Because it is April and hardly anything comes out in April.
3832000	3834000	Well, I mean Star Trek and Dead Island Riptide are...
3834000	3835000	Yeah, it's a decent release.
3835000	3838000	It's not as dry as some of the weeks have been lately.
3838000	3841000	Next week, on the other hand, Deadly Premonition.
3841000	3843000	And that's it.
3844000	3845000	Eww.
3845000	3850000	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what is coming out in the Japanese release dates this week.
3850000	3854000	We will start off with the PlayStation 3.
3854000	3858000	And on the 25th of April, Bioshock Infinite gets its Japanese release.
3858000	3862000	So now you guys over there can see what we've all been raving about for a couple of weeks here.
3862000	3867000	Atuteki Yugi Mugen Scrolls, that comes in...
3867000	3872000	I think there's like a limited edition, a regular edition, and then some like selection edition.
3872000	3877000	Oh, you know what it is? The original Mugen Souls is getting a re-release price edition.
3877000	3880000	And there's Mugen Souls Z comes out this week. That's the deal there.
3880000	3883000	Dragon's Dogma from Capcom out this week on the 25th.
3883000	3889000	Shin Kamitachi no Yoro 11 Hitome no Suspect gets a price reduction this week.
3889000	3896000	Also in regular and limited editions, Steins Gate Senkei Kosuko no Phonogram comes out.
3896000	3900000	Tomb Raider gets its Japanese release this week. We talked a little bit about the...
3900000	3903000	DLC Japanese voice track.
3903000	3906000	No, not in Japan. You already get it.
3906000	3911000	But to give you an idea, if you want to import this baby into the US, $84 to import that guy.
3911000	3915000	So that's why it's, you know, games cost a little more in Japan.
3915000	3920000	Let's see, let's travel over. That's all PlayStation 3. Let's look at the Xbox 360.
3920000	3922000	Tomb Raider over there as well, of course.
3922000	3925000	Dragon's Dogma as well and Bioshock Infinite, most of the same stuff.
3925000	3927000	Steins Gate 2.
3927000	3931000	Colladrius also in regular and limited edition this week on the Xbox 360.
3931000	3934000	Taking a look real quick at some of the handhelds.
3934000	3936000	PlayStation Vita.
3936000	3941000	Kajiri Kamui Kagura Akebono no Hikari in regular and limited editions.
3941000	3945000	Katamari Damacy no Vita gets a price reduction this week.
3945000	3947000	That would be the Katamari Damacy game that was out at launch.
3947000	3949000	The music's still stuck in my head.
3949000	3953000	Make You Cross Blood Infinity out on the Vita this week as well.
3953000	3958000	Photokano Kiss and Ragnarok Odyssey and Ridge Racer getting price reductions this week in Japan.
3958000	3960000	Lots of price reductions on games this week.
3960000	3961000	Shinsengoku Musou next.
3961000	3963000	Tales of Innocence R.
3963000	3968000	So if you are a Japanese Vita owner, this is a great week to stock up on games you might have missed.
3968000	3974000	On the Wii U this week, nothing.
3974000	3978000	Absolutely nothing on the Wii U this week. That really shouldn't be a surprise.
3979000	3984000	On other systems, checking out the Nintendo 3DS.
3984000	3988000	I'm showing that we're still sending to the feed, so I'm going to move on for the podcast.
3988000	3992000	Nintendo 3DS says Detective Conan, Marionette no Kuyo Yoko Yoko.
3992000	3998000	Pocket Monster PC covers for the 3DS XL, you know, for those you Pocket Monster fans.
3998000	4003000	And Starry Sky in Spring 3D in regular and limited editions.
4003000	4007000	There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.
4007000	4009000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4009000	4011000	We have some stuff in the UK.
4011000	4015000	We have, and this is the wrong window, because I'm special.
4015000	4019000	Goddamn stupid iPad. Sorry.
4019000	4027000	Okay. We have, on the 24th, Draw Slasher for the Vita, and Thomas Was Alone for the Vita and PS3.
4027000	4035000	On the 26th, Dead Island Riptide, Deadly Premonition, The Director's Cut, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arisen, and Star Trek.
4037000	4038000	That's it.
4042000	4045000	It did, the feed did drop on our end, just so you know.
4045000	4047000	Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
4047000	4053000	Well, we always do a, you know, before, well now it's showing it's connected.
4053000	4060000	Before we start OLR every night, we always reset the router, reset the modems and everything in the house, you know.
4060000	4066000	Just think, if we were an always connected game console, we would not be working right now.
4066000	4069000	Keep that in mind for your future game console needs.
4069000	4073000	Dear Microsoft, listen to our podcast every week, 6 o'clock Central Time.
4073000	4076000	I mean, Central Public Time.
4076000	4078000	Is my computer, Alan, is my computer on?
4078000	4079000	Yes.
4079000	4083000	No? Okay. I just want to make sure, like, I didn't have, like, Dropbox running or something, so just, you know.
4083000	4086000	Yeah, Rob did mention Detective Conan.
4086000	4087000	I did.
4087000	4090000	Which is a very popular anime series from the 90s.
4090000	4094000	Yes, which is getting a game release in Japan that I already closed the window for.
4096000	4099000	All right, do we do UK release dates? Sorry.
4099000	4100000	Yes.
4100000	4101000	All right, then we got-
4101000	4102000	A bunch of crap.
4102000	4105000	A few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4105000	4109000	All right, so we've already talked about how the Wii U isn't selling very well.
4109000	4110000	Rob isn't selling very well.
4110000	4117000	And we don't have the, technically we don't have the NPD numbers out for hardware because Nintendo's not going to come out bragging that,
4118000	4123000	Hey, we only sold, like, 67,000 units. Yeah.
4123000	4135000	But, apparently, according to a leak on NeoGaf, they have the console numbers, which is possible because I get email updates occasionally of NPD numbers.
4135000	4143000	So, yes, the Wii U apparently only sold 67,000 units in the U.S. during the five weeks from March 3rd to April 6th.
4143000	4155000	And then, also, I guess, roughly, the Vita didn't do much better, actually. Let's see here.
4155000	4160000	They did only 33,000 units during March.
4160000	4164000	Were there any Vita games during March?
4164000	4168000	Quick, name me games on the Vita to get excited about right now.
4169000	4174000	I'm thinking the Persona 4 release, but that was, that already happened, so I'm like,
4174000	4175000	Tearaway if you're into
4175000	4176000	Project D.Va
4176000	4178000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4178000	4180000	Tearaway if you're into Media Molecule.
4180000	4184000	There is Killzone, if you like Killzone.
4184000	4194000	So, here's a question for you all. We sit here and we razz Nintendo about, you know, well, you know, they're just not getting those titles out there, but look at the frickin' Vita.
4194000	4201000	Here's the thing, I think, with the Vita, and it's like, Nintendo, we recognize the potential is there that they could be doing much better.
4201000	4208000	The Vita, I don't think we have much expectations for them, other than, hey, it's a nice piece of hardware, but for some reason, all the games that come out on it aren't very good.
4208000	4217000	Like, dude, they had Call of Duty, Black Ops, come out on the Vita. That should have been System Accelerate there.
4217000	4225000	But, no. Instead, they just had a quick rush of a game come out by someone that did Resistance, and it sucked ass.
4225000	4234000	Thankfully, they're taking all that stuff first party now, and they're gonna be developing, instead of having third parties develop their games for them.
4234000	4239000	So, Killzone hopefully will be much better, but, I don't know.
4239000	4242000	I don't know if Tearaway's gonna, well, Tearaway's not gonna say that system.
4242000	4249000	What's gonna save that system, I think, a little bit is the fact that PlayStation Network is a really good place right now for indies, and there's a lot of indie games coming out in there.
4249000	4251000	So, I think we'll see some interesting stuff from there.
4251000	4261000	And maybe what develops with the PlayStation 4, because before I get accused of being a Nintendo fanboy and always defending them here on this show, although I like to think of myself as devil's advocate against gamers hate everything.
4261000	4268000	But, I think the PlayStation 4 is in a good place. I think it has a lot of good buzz around it.
4268000	4279000	And, you know, PlayStation 4 is gonna be a real contender for the Wii U, which doesn't, you know, unless they really knock our socks off at E3, you definitely are gonna have PlayStation 4 on another level.
4279000	4281000	You're gonna have to come out with something absolutely amazing.
4281000	4286000	And it could be interesting how the Vita could tie into that. I mean, we've already seen a little bit of that early press conference.
4286000	4292000	You know, so I'm really curious to see how that enriches as time goes on here.
4292000	4300000	Kuma JP mentioned a game called Oboro Muramasa. I guess, does that have to do with the sword?
4300000	4302000	Well, he linked us to the game there in our chat room.
4302000	4303000	Well, let's take a look.
4303000	4308000	So, if I can bring it up without destroying our feed again.
4308000	4314000	It's Muramasa Rebirth. It's the HD, well, not really HD, but remake of Muramasa.
4315000	4317000	Oh, neat.
4317000	4319000	That's cool.
4319000	4321000	Oh, that looks pretty fun.
4321000	4323000	Screenshots are taking forever to load. There we go.
4323000	4324000	Yeah, it's at the end of...
4324000	4326000	The Vita does have such a pretty screen.
4326000	4328000	It is a great piece of tech.
4328000	4336000	Well, they do have some good Japanese games coming out. They've got, you know, the Persona stuff. They've got Muramasa Rebirth.
4336000	4341000	There's also Odin's, well, not Odin's Sphere. There's Dragonblade.
4341000	4343000	Is that chick naked?
4343000	4345000	Look at her. They're skinny dipping or something.
4345000	4347000	Rob.
4347000	4349000	This is a perverse game.
4349000	4351000	You know what?
4351000	4353000	You need to stop being so white boy about it.
4355000	4358000	Oh my god, boobs. Oh my god.
4358000	4368000	It's only here that people have a big stick up their ass, a big rough sandpapery stick up their ass about boobs.
4368000	4372000	Exactly. I believe that we should have more boobs on TV. I fully support this.
4372000	4374000	Darsakir, are you saying I have a stick up my ass?
4378000	4380000	I like boobs too.
4380000	4387000	Boobs are great, but I mean people in general. We're fine with violence and blood and gore and, you know, saw and everything.
4387000	4389000	I like boobs covered in blood.
4389000	4392000	But show a tit and everyone loses their shit. Hey, that rhymed.
4392000	4396000	That's gonna be my new motto about America. Show a tit, lose your shit.
4396000	4407000	We haven't come to that part of the show yet, but we do have a story later on about the evil within, which did have a four-armed demon chick with boobs and blood on her boobs.
4407000	4409000	So there you go.
4409000	4411000	The violence boob quota.
4411000	4413000	Blood orgy, yay.
4413000	4416000	Organ orgy. It's just like organs launched at the screen. It was great.
4417000	4419000	More boobs.
4419000	4421000	Let's see, did you do the other sales story about-
4421000	4423000	Yeah, MPD.
4423000	4425000	March MPD.
4425000	4427000	Repeat what you just said again.
4427000	4432000	No, no problem. The March MPD stuff, Bioshock Infinite, obviously the top selling game.
4432000	4438000	The utter disappointment of a game sequel, Tomb Raider, only placed second.
4438000	4440000	Heads will roll.
4440000	4442000	Oh, what a disappointment.
4442000	4450000	Ironically, Gears of War Judgment 360 and then God of War Ascension on PS3 were three and four.
4450000	4462000	I'm sorry. I have to say this. This is going to be so wrong and I apologize in advance, but only an Asian company like Square Enix would be like, why can you only be the second best selling game?
4465000	4467000	Am I right? Am I right?
4467000	4473000	Only the parent company in Asia would be like, why weren't you the number one game?
4475000	4477000	Why you get an A minus?
4477000	4479000	You came out in the beginning of the month.
4479000	4481000	Call of Duty harder.
4481000	4483000	Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
4483000	4489000	Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon actually on there, number six. MLB 13, the show on number seven.
4489000	4491000	NBA 2K13, eight.
4491000	4501000	Walking Dead Survival Instinct just began proving that Walking Dead, the franchise, will actually sell anything, whether it be a good game or absolute shit.
4501000	4507000	So that was number nine. Naruto, ship it in. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, number 10.
4507000	4518000	What's not on this list? The two big titles for the Wii U, Lego City Undercover and Monster Hunter 3. Not even the top 10. So that's got to hurt.
4518000	4521000	Maybe Laura should have been a doctor.
4522000	4529000	Alright, moving on to fighting game news, or maybe a little change going on or another perspective.
4529000	4540000	Vice President Christian Svensson over at Capcom has made a remark about a fan-submitted question on the Ask Capcom forums.
4540000	4546000	This was about stories in fighting games. You know, I don't know how many people really play fighting games for the story.
4546000	4548000	Although some of them do have good stories, I guess.
4548000	4550000	Will you raise your hand over there?
4550000	4555000	Yes. Okay, if I don't play fighting games for the stories, I would have never touched any of the Tekken games.
4555000	4556000	I guess that's true.
4556000	4562000	I assume the people that play the fighting games for their stories are the same people that read Playboy for their articles.
4562000	4566000	Well, anyhow, here's the interesting comment about story mode in fighting games.
4566000	4578000	Quote, the strategic marketing group here has for quite a while been pushing for our fighting franchises to have more and more better single-player content, of which full-fledged story modes are one component.
4578000	4584000	How and when those requirements manifest in our future roadmap, I'm not prepared to speak about at this time.
4584000	4593000	Which a lot of people are reading in between the lines of that, that, you know, the single-player content or the story modes in fighting games are not good.
4593000	4595000	In Capcom fighting games.
4596000	4602000	I don't know. But then again, you know, you look at a franchise like Mortal Kombat.
4602000	4608000	Mortal Kombat's done really well with their story modes in their recent releases, especially this last one.
4611000	4618000	Tigerclaw mentions that the story in Injustice is really good and is getting Capcom thinking about making better stories in their fighting games.
4618000	4625000	Well, Injustice is just NetherRealm Studios that just did the Mortal Kombat game, right? So, same, same.
4625000	4629000	Anyhow, one other thing to mention about Capcom.
4630000	4637000	Apparently, more DLC in Capcom's future, which, you know, isn't really unexpected.
4637000	4642000	But this is talking about Capcom's recent strategy.
4642000	4650000	There was a lot of very interesting revelations here in Capcom's forecast about where the company's going.
4650000	4656000	Saying that apparently they don't want to outsource games to Western developers as much anymore.
4656000	4659000	That it has caused a drop in quality.
4659000	4663000	They're gonna promote DLC in the consumer business.
4663000	4669000	Aim for growth, surpassing the market by reinforcing the online and mobile contents business.
4669000	4672000	iPhone games, Android games.
4672000	4678000	And strengthen earnings base by expanding the title lineup in the P&S business.
4680000	4683000	More DLC, just hopefully not included on the disc.
4685000	4689000	Or just announce the Mega Man rebirth already.
4689000	4691000	We all know it's coming.
4691000	4693000	A Mega Man reboot.
4694000	4695000	Alright.
4695000	4696000	Alright.
4697000	4704000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, band.
4704000	4708000	That just about brings us to the end of the first half of our show.
4708000	4716000	But we have to take a trip down memory lane first off with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4719000	4722000	You know, back in the time, we didn't have reboots back in the day.
4722000	4724000	You didn't reboot a gaming franchise.
4724000	4729000	No, you just put out some crappy sequels and then try to make people forgive you with the third one.
4729000	4733000	That's right. Well, let's see if that is the case with tonight's Classic Game of the Week.
4733000	4734000	Not really.
4734000	4736000	Alright, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week tonight?
4736000	4738000	Son of the Hedgehog 3.
4738000	4744000	Because I couldn't find anything else and I've been haunted by the Ice Cap music.
4744000	4746000	Oddly enough for some reason.
4747000	4749000	Which is what's in the background.
4750000	4753000	Which is the best music ever in any video game in the universe.
4753000	4756000	So Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was the special one.
4756000	4759000	It was completely tied to its direct sequel, Sonic and Knuckles.
4759000	4763000	And they could latch on to each other and be awesome.
4763000	4767000	It was like the gestalt of game perfection.
4768000	4771000	So yeah, I mean, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog.
4771000	4775000	I mean, I really liked the first one. I really liked the second one.
4775000	4778000	Sonic 3 for me just, like, lit everything up.
4778000	4780000	It was the last real- actually, no, I take that back.
4780000	4785000	Sonic CD was the last really good Sonic game as far as platforming goes.
4785000	4790000	But this, I actually, I actually will even put Sonic 3 above Sonic CD.
4790000	4795000	And Bobby the Japanese music was better for Sonic CD, just saying.
4795000	4800000	So Sonic 3 also had some interesting things going on with it too.
4800000	4805000	You basically could pick between Sonic or Tails, as you could in Sonic 2.
4805000	4808000	And it was basically the same type of gameplay.
4808000	4812000	You had all the same usual stuff. You had your six levels with two parts.
4812000	4815000	You had a boss at the end of the very full thing.
4815000	4817000	You could keep going back to the level.
4818000	4823000	You have new abilities, like you could hold the jump button while in mid-air.
4823000	4826000	And do, like, a quick shield for protection.
4826000	4832000	Tails could fly or swim underwater for a short time before getting tired and going back down.
4832000	4835000	So Tails could actually go to places that Sonic could not.
4835000	4839000	And his tail could actually be used to attack enemies.
4839000	4844000	And if you have a second player controlling Tails, then he can carry Sonic while flying.
4844000	4847000	So basically it opened up to all kinds of exploration.
4847000	4851000	And then there were the different shields in the game, like there was the fire shield.
4851000	4858000	And my favorite was, was it the lightning shield that attracted coins? Not coins, rings.
4858000	4859000	That was my favorite.
4859000	4864000	And if you hit a checkpoint while holding 50 or more rings, you got a bonus stage, which was the bumper stage.
4864000	4869000	Which, I'm sorry, the bumper stage pissed me off.
4869000	4877000	Of any bonus stage ever in any game, for some reason it was that sort of, was it semi-isometric point of view?
4877000	4881000	Would just give me a headache and I couldn't do it at all. So now I make Dan do it.
4881000	4885000	But that's how you earn your Chaos Emeralds.
4885000	4891000	And, like, someone even took the time to chart out how the various bonus stages were.
4891000	4897000	There was also a thing you could do with Sonic and Knuckles, where if you attached an older cartridge to it.
4897000	4900000	Like, you could play Sonic 2 with Sonic and Knuckles.
4900000	4905000	But if you did another one, if you hold, like, a certain button press, then you could go on.
4905000	4909000	Now, I want to talk about the music for a minute, okay?
4909000	4920000	There was a big thing going around with the music, saying that Michael Jackson had done a lot of the music and then he removed himself from the cartridge or something.
4920000	4931000	There's a series of, what am I mentioning, clips on YouTube, where people have compared music in Sonic 3 to Michael Jackson songs.
4931000	4936000	So, I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean, the Ice Cap Zone sounds like Smooth Criminal.
4936000	4939000	This is actually my second favorite music in the game.
4943000	4946000	It's the Lava Reef Zone. Really good music.
4946000	4959000	So, yeah, so basically, you know, you can, if you got all of the Chaos Emeralds, you can turn into Super Sonic and then Knuckles punches the crap out of him and takes the Chaos Emeralds.
4959000	4963000	And you have to go to the Death Egg. Rawr.
4963000	4972000	You know, which, I always like, yeah, they called him Robotnik, but it really did make a lot more sense to call him Eggman because the dude looked like a freaking egg.
4972000	4975000	And, hey, he was in Wreck-It Ralph.
4975000	4981000	So, yeah, so basically there have been a bajillion different releases of this game.
4981000	4987000	We had Sonic Jam in 1997 for the Saturn, Sonic and Knuckles collection, and the Sonic and Garfield pack.
4987000	4990000	What the fuck? Sonic and Garfield pack? For PC?
4990000	5005000	Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PS2, Xbox, and PC, Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3, and Sonic Classic Collection for Nintendo DS.
5005000	5009000	Plus, you can get, like, these various packs on Steam.
5009000	5015000	I'll be honest, the only one of those I've ever bought was Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because, hello, it's Puyo Puyo.
5015000	5029000	There have been, like I said, the digital releases for Steam, there's been the Wii Virtual Console one in 2007, Xbox Live Arcade in 2009, and it even has a split-screen multiplayer on Xbox Live.
5029000	5035000	So it was given, when it was released, EGM gave it a 9.5 out of 10.
5035000	5041000	And, honestly, I think it was well-deserved. It's one of the best games to ever come out.
5042000	5044000	So...
5044000	5047000	Alright. That's it?
5047000	5048000	That's it.
5048000	5052000	There it is. A real classic. A real classic game of the week there. Sonic 3.
5052000	5056000	I think I'm saving the Sonic series for my... Damn, I can't think of a game this week.
5056000	5060000	So I've got Sonic 2 and the first one to go. We'll see what happens, right?
5060000	5063000	Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week. Sonic 3.
5063000	5070000	We will be back after a quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, guys. We'll be right back.
5071000	5087000	Welcome back to Part B of Orange Lounge Radio for this April the 21st, 2013, the 501st episode of our show.
5087000	5092000	Alright, so we had a little bit of a long break there live. Sorry about that. But, you know, just taking care of it.
5092000	5093000	Blame me!
5093000	5095000	Alright, I will blame Dark Sakura. It's all her fault.
5095000	5099000	But, I don't get it. Loki was giggling like mad during the break.
5099000	5100000	This is the funniest shit ever.
5100000	5105000	It's apparently some gay... I haven't seen this yet, so I'm about to check this out. What is this game, Loki?
5105000	5108000	It's Surgeon Simulator 2013.
5108000	5110000	Okay, and what's the deal with this game?
5110000	5121000	It's basically a surgery simulator. Like, they have different surgeries you perform. There's like brain transplants, kidney transplants, and I think like a heart transplant or something.
5121000	5129000	And what makes the game unique is that you control it using the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard, you put your hand on the Q, W, E, F, and space.
5129000	5135000	Each one of the keys represents one of your fingers in the game. So you have to grip instruments and actually do stuff.
5135000	5144000	And so more times than not, you're just like flopping around all over the place.
5144000	5147000	So it's kind of like Q-Op or something.
5148000	5151000	Yeah, go earlier in the video there.
5151000	5153000	Go earlier in the video here? Alright.
5159000	5163000	So they're ripping out organs of this patient? What?
5163000	5166000	You can even go earlier than that. This is the funny Swedish guy.
5166000	5171000	Perform a double kidney transplant.
5171000	5174000	In an ambulance. The ambulance is moving, so stuff is bouncing around.
5174000	5176000	Oh great, the ambulance is moving.
5178000	5180000	Hey, guts.
5180000	5182000	Sausage in your stomach, Bob.
5182000	5185000	The kidney is just floating around in the back there.
5185000	5187000	I love that.
5188000	5190000	Oh, lordy.
5190000	5193000	I am buying this when I get home.
5193000	5197000	You need to wait and don't play it until you can livestream it.
5197000	5199000	Here we go, Bob.
5199000	5201000	I'll do it tonight.
5202000	5207000	I'll put that in our chat. Sorry to the podcast folks, but just look it up on YouTube.
5207000	5210000	There's a ton of them. It was great about the game.
5210000	5212000	Surgeon Simulator 2013.
5212000	5214000	They have records. They have people doing record surgery.
5214000	5218000	The times, how quickly you can do surgery, and murder times.
5218000	5221000	So like how quickly you can kill your patient.
5221000	5225000	Sj100matt says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
5225000	5229000	Hey, I remember playing the original surgery game, Life and Death 2.
5229000	5231000	Oh yeah, I remember that.
5231000	5233000	Those games were scary shit.
5233000	5236000	Sorry, for me it was Trauma Center.
5236000	5239000	You know, we got Trauma Center on Wii when it came out.
5239000	5240000	Oh yeah, me too.
5240000	5243000	And I remember, I think I was drunk on something.
5243000	5245000	No, no, no, it was the Vicodin.
5245000	5248000	When I'm sitting here, leaning back in my chair, I was on Vicodin.
5248000	5252000	It was right after, I think I was playing it right after my surgery.
5252000	5256000	So I'm sitting here with my hand in a cast, trying to hold the Wii-mote,
5256000	5258000	going, can't hold it!
5258000	5262000	And then I ended up using my left hand, and so I was slicing people to bits.
5262000	5263000	It was hilarious.
5263000	5269000	Sj100matt though, I was playing the original surgery game, Operation, by Milton Bradley.
5269000	5274000	Yeah, the only thing about Life and Death 1 that kind of sucked was that,
5274000	5277000	from what I remember, at least we can only get to the first surgery,
5277000	5281000	which was removing an appendix.
5282000	5286000	Unfortunately, they do not allow you to play tic-tac-toe using the scalpel.
5286000	5289000	That will kill the patient, apparently.
5289000	5291000	Nice.
5291000	5295000	Alright, let's move on, do some rapid-fire news,
5295000	5298000	quickly covering some of the other things going on in the gaming world this week.
5298000	5300000	And then we'll get to the Fookle question of the week.
5300000	5302000	But first, rapid-fire news, Logie.
5302000	5306000	So, Deadpool, supposed to be coming out June 25th.
5306000	5309000	And that's all you need to know, because Deadpool's awesome.
5309000	5312000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, June 25th.
5312000	5320000	The Ouya's got a firmware update that's allowing people to change their credit card information.
5320000	5322000	And apparently you can change this at any time.
5322000	5329000	And also, they're going to be adding some different payment options as well later on.
5329000	5333000	But right now, you can change your credit card information, fantastic.
5333000	5336000	And they've signed up 10,000 registered developers,
5336000	5341000	because technically everybody with an Ouya could be a registered developer at some point,
5341000	5344000	because you can develop stuff on your own system.
5344000	5347000	But yeah, that sounds kind of cool.
5347000	5356000	And I think one of the announcements was that Papa and Yo, developers,
5356000	5358000	was supposed to be making a game for Ouya.
5358000	5361000	So that's kind of neat.
5361000	5365000	And last but not least, Bethesda was teasing all week long.
5365000	5369000	And then finally released a trailer for The Evil Within,
5369000	5373000	which is the brand new game from Shinji Mikami.
5373000	5376000	They're known for the Resident Evil series.
5376000	5378000	And I got to say, after watching the trailer,
5378000	5382000	other than the fact that there is a lot of organs and stuff,
5382000	5386000	it looks very Silent Hill-ish. Like, good Silent Hill-ish.
5386000	5390000	I was a little bit scared just watching the trailer.
5391000	5394000	Let me bring this up here in studio.
5394000	5397000	I like brains.
5397000	5399000	Oh, I thought there was a YouTube here.
5399000	5401000	I'll look it up when I get home.
5401000	5404000	I like anything that's Silent Hill in a good way.
5404000	5411000	But I have to get Shane's review of it, because I trust Shane in all things remotely Silent Hill-looking.
5411000	5415000	Oh, don't inflate his ego like that.
5415000	5418000	Okay, here, this is like a two-minute trailer, though.
5418000	5421000	And there's ads on it. Hooray.
5421000	5423000	Well, let's come back to this in a minute. That's what we'll do.
5423000	5425000	That's fine.
5425000	5427000	In the meantime, I will read a few stories here.
5427000	5430000	The bonus games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet revealed.
5430000	5434000	If you bought all the games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, all the download stuff,
5434000	5437000	you will get two free games.
5437000	5442000	And the bonus games were 1943 Kai. That is the laser 1943.
5442000	5444000	Awesome.
5444000	5450000	And Vulgus, which was the very first Capcom game in arcades.
5450000	5456000	By the way, just so you know, the other pack of games came out for Capcom that rounds out this pack.
5456000	5461000	That's Sun Sun 1942 and Pirate Ship Higemaru, which I love that game.
5461000	5463000	Higemaru is a pretty neat game.
5463000	5467000	But if you want just classic shooter, you can't get any better than 1942.
5467000	5470000	Well, for vertical shooters.
5470000	5472000	Right.
5472000	5474000	Okay, is that guy doing surgery on a brain?
5474000	5476000	No, Shane hadn't seen the trailer yet, so I was linking him.
5476000	5478000	Don't watch this yet. Don't watch this yet. Okay.
5478000	5480000	I have other news.
5480000	5483000	Mad Dog McCree 2, The Lost Gold.
5483000	5484000	No incur.
5484000	5487000	Well, if you're a PSN owner, you might care.
5487000	5489000	It has move control.
5489000	5491000	HD scrub down.
5491000	5494000	Good, because this is the only way someone can play it anymore since light guns don't work.
5494000	5496000	New difficulty modes.
5496000	5498000	And online leaderboards.
5498000	5501000	You know, because everybody wants to compete on Mad Dog McCree.
5501000	5509000	Also, a rating has shown up on a Korean rating site for Metal Gear Solid The Legacy Collection.
5509000	5512000	This would make sense, though, if there's a Metal Gear Solid 5 on the horizon.
5512000	5515000	Why wouldn't they want to bundle the first four games together?
5515000	5517000	You can't really call four games a trilogy.
5517000	5519000	So this would make sense.
5519000	5522000	There was also a tweet from Hideo Kojima that kind of points to this as well.
5522000	5525000	Why wouldn't this be a thing on PlayStation 3?
5525000	5527000	Why wouldn't it?
5527000	5529000	Makes a lot of sense.
5529000	5533000	Now, this trailer's like two minutes long, so I can't do the whole thing.
5533000	5536000	But here's some parts of the trailer, Dark Sakura.
5539000	5542000	I'm going to fast forward a little bit.
5542000	5544000	All the good stuff's towards the end.
5544000	5546000	All the good stuff's at the end.
5551000	5553000	That's really realistic.
5553000	5555000	Yeah.
5555000	5560000	Let's go a little further.
5560000	5562000	Ooh, blood.
5567000	5569000	Okay, I want to play this.
5572000	5574000	Organs.
5574000	5576000	Yay, I like organs.
5576000	5578000	Ew.
5578000	5581000	Rob, why are you showing me that, Rob?
5581000	5584000	That's one of those games to get my mom to watch me play.
5585000	5590000	We need to get your mom watching you play one of those games, and we need to stream it.
5590000	5595000	Well, I was thinking a great one to have my mom react to would be Bioshock Infinite.
5595000	5597000	So I'll work on that.
5597000	5600000	We should do Rob's Mom, the series.
5600000	5602000	Yeah, maybe like a YouTube thing. We'll see.
5602000	5605000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura, you have some game news for us.
5605000	5609000	I do, and one of them has to do with a game that we have covered before.
5609000	5611000	It's actually a game hack.
5612000	5616000	And now it's actually showing up in arcades.
5616000	5619000	There's a guy named Clay Cowgill.
5619000	5623000	I almost said cowgirl, and I knew better, so I caught myself.
5623000	5625000	Bangadoo bang.
5625000	5627000	Geez, thanks.
5627000	5632000	Did a ROM hack that basically installs it in place of the original game chips on the motherboard.
5632000	5637000	So there is a YouTube video going around of the arcade version.
5638000	5644000	And a site called This Old Game is doing the artwork for the Pauline edition.
5644000	5653000	So it will be like $100 and has a marquee, monitor, glass, control panel, side art, and instruction stickers.
5653000	5658000	They even have Mario being held by Donkey Kong and stuff.
5658000	5660000	Oh, that's awesome, because that's like...
5660000	5663000	I mean, it's even in the right style, too. I love it.
5664000	5671000	So next up, the 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is finally in North America. Yay.
5671000	5674000	And it costs 20 bucks. Boo.
5674000	5678000	But you can order it on Nintendo's official online store.
5678000	5680000	That is the only place that you can find it.
5680000	5682000	But not too many games use it.
5682000	5688000	Mostly Monster Hunter 3 and Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.
5689000	5692000	It has the best theme song of any game ever.
5693000	5701000	And now there is a third-person shooter called God Mode that launches on Steam and Xbox Live Arcade this kind of Friday.
5701000	5702000	This game looked kind of fun.
5702000	5703000	It did.
5703000	5706000	It looked like a big orgy of death, like Quake Arena.
5706000	5707000	It really did.
5707000	5713000	It was done by Old School Games, which is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive.
5713000	5716000	And it's basically, like you were saying, a health-themed arena shooter.
5716000	5718000	Go around, shoot things.
5718000	5722000	You have modes called Test of Faith that alter the rulesets.
5722000	5725000	You have party hats, Rob.
5725000	5726000	Party hats are great.
5726000	5728000	Oh, I love party hats.
5728000	5733000	And then basically it's just lots of fun.
5733000	5735000	Lots of crazy fun.
5735000	5740000	And it costs 10 bucks on Steam or 800 Microsoft points.
5740000	5744000	Or £6.99 for our friends in the UK.
5744000	5746000	Very nice.
5746000	5748000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
5749000	5752000	Prince Brightstar asking a question about one of the stories you just did, Dark Saga.
5752000	5756000	Can arcades legally earn money from the Donkey Kong Pauline game?
5759000	5760000	That's a good question.
5760000	5764000	Probably not. In all honesty, probably not.
5764000	5768000	I would think this is more of a novelty that shows up at trade shows and private owners.
5768000	5773000	Not something you put down at a miniature golf place or at a bowling alley to actually make money.
5773000	5775000	That would probably get you some hot water.
5775000	5779000	Well, I don't know. It's a ROM hack, so it's not necessarily that they're selling pirated stuff.
5779000	5781000	It's basically modifying your system.
5781000	5785000	It also wouldn't be the first pirated game to ever show up in an arcade.
5785000	5789000	Well, at Classic Gaming Expo, someone had done a Donkey Kong 2.
5789000	5796000	It was basically just a re-hack of Donkey Kong where you found unused sprites and basically redid levels.
5796000	5801000	I mean, it plays exactly Donkey Kong style, but he put up his dump and everything.
5801000	5804000	That sounded awful. I'm sorry.
5804000	5809000	He put the ROM dump up. Shut up, Rob.
5811000	5813000	You're five. You served it up.
5813000	5816000	Five years old, Rab.
5816000	5818000	Here's my dump, y'all.
5818000	5822000	Well, it wasn't my dump. It was his dump, and I just happened to be there for it.
5823000	5825000	It was number two.
5827000	5829000	I quit. Bye. I'm going home.
5830000	5833000	I'm done with y'all. This is...
5833000	5836000	backwards. Fuck this shit. Later.
5837000	5839000	Thanks for the pinkberry bye.
5840000	5846000	No, but I remembered that he had distributed it to some arcades.
5847000	5849000	You're still red in the face.
5849000	5854000	Because it's funny, his little comment about what it was number two. That was funny.
5855000	5861000	Isn't Prince Brightstar so happy that his question led to that?
5861000	5865000	A really good serious question led to, yeah, poop.
5869000	5872000	Yeah, and we supposedly have a mature rating because we're not.
5873000	5878000	Let's get to the Fugu question of the week. Let's class it up a little bit here with some listener feedback.
5878000	5880000	Good fucking luck.
5885000	5889000	Facebook and Google Plus. Throw them together, you get Fugu.
5889000	5894000	Fugu Plus. And we ask a question of the week every week on Fugu.
5894000	5898000	And this week has to do with the Heroes show reboot, Rumors.
5898000	5905000	Rumor is that Heroes, a TV show that used to be on NBC, could get a second chance as a television show on the next Xbox.
5905000	5907000	Would you watch something like this via Xbox?
5907000	5913000	Do you think this type of content delivery poses a threat to cable television as we know it now?
5913000	5918000	What are your thoughts? We'll start on Facebook tonight with Critical Myth. Love this answer, by the way.
5918000	5925000	Setting aside the fan perception that the show quickly went downhill after the first season, and thus bringing it back doesn't make a lot of sense,
5925000	5928000	I don't think this alone is a threat to network or cable television.
5928000	5935000	It would only be the combined success of these alternative outlets like Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV, and so on.
5935000	5944000	What it does say, along with some of the other outlets, is that a cancelled show may have many other options than might have been the case just a few short years ago.
5944000	5952000	Add to that the crowdsourcing possibilities, Veronica Mars, and the initial end of a show might not be the final end after all.
5952000	5960000	You know, there's a show on ABC that I really like, I think it's really funny, called Happy Endings, but it's supposedly kind of done because the ratings haven't been very good,
5960000	5967000	but everybody's already talking about, like, can it be on cable or something like that? So, I don't know.
5967000	5976000	Alright, going to Red the Haze. Would you support Heroes or what have you?
5976000	5982000	Nope, I haven't paid for a live subscription in ages, and I'm satisfied everywhere else with my gaming and entertainment needs.
5982000	5986000	My internet connection isn't fast enough, and a large percentage of the US has the same issue.
5986000	5997000	This won't threaten cable TV, but other reliable services that are catching on, like Netflix and Hulu, are more of a threat because of the low barrier of entry with Roku's and smart TVs.
5997000	6002000	Rebooting a cancelled TV show that nobody remembers fondly isn't a good gamble.
6002000	6006000	Now, somebody else jumped in there and said, hey, wait a minute, nobody remembers fondly.
6006000	6011000	I liked, what was the dude's name, was it Hero?
6011000	6012000	Yeah, Hero.
6012000	6014000	I liked him, and I liked his buddy.
6014000	6019000	Unfortunately, he's not probably, I would say that most of the cast would not be back because you have them all doing their own things.
6019000	6021000	They're all in other shows now.
6021000	6025000	He's on Hawaii Five-0 right now, and The One Chick's on Dallas.
6025000	6026000	Nashville.
6026000	6027000	Or Nashville, yeah.
6027000	6037000	I mean, but there's always the possibility that they could do cameos or what have you, and Heroes wasn't necessarily, the idea was the Heroes were going to get all killed off in the first season anyway.
6037000	6040000	It was supposed to always be new people, and it just didn't work out that way.
6040000	6051000	I thought Heroes was awesome the first season. I was so into it. I'm sure I talked about it on this show because this show's been on long enough.
6051000	6059000	I remember downloading the preview on Xbox and all that stuff. There's things in the preview that was on Xbox that never was even in the real show.
6059000	6060000	I watched it. There's George Takei.
6060000	6062000	There you go.
6062000	6063000	Because you know he's my gay daddy.
6063000	6070000	But I'm of the mindset that when they started introducing all these other characters in season two, it really went downhill.
6070000	6079000	I stopped watching season three. I couldn't take it anymore, but I heard the show started to get back to its roots and got a lot better season four and maybe ended a little bit before.
6079000	6080000	I never saw season four.
6080000	6088000	Yeah, I never gave it that second chance, but I would be down with a reboot, but if you're going to ask me to pay a lot of extra money for it, eh.
6088000	6093000	But if it's part of a service that's something else with it, I might be open to it.
6093000	6100000	I still wanted to go. I tried actually watching the first season, but all I would do is just watch the Hero Anando scenes.
6100000	6105000	And I wanted to like Cheerleader Wolverine. Could not get into it.
6105000	6108000	But one of my friends was on that show.
6108000	6112000	This is supposed to be about the listeners. Let me read the rest of the answers here.
6112000	6115000	Dark Charger says if the writing and acting is good, I will watch it.
6115000	6120000	I already pay for Xbox Live, as do millions of subscribers, and this just adds much needed value.
6120000	6124000	There isn't a single show or channel that will usurp cable.
6124000	6133000	However, I believe consumers are willing to dump on an antiquated business model if an IPTV model is perceived as an equivalent or superior.
6134000	6145000	Remember this whole thing, the theory was that cable providers could then offer their cable channels over the internet to other people that would be out of the area.
6145000	6147000	Like if you don't have Comcast in your area, thank God.
6147000	6153000	And you wanted to get Comcast channels, although they all kind of have the same channels anyways.
6153000	6158000	But that was supposed to be a way to do it, was with this box.
6158000	6163000	But remember HBO is talking about doing internet only.
6163000	6171000	So that would be kind of neat, although I just don't want to pay $8 for each channel.
6171000	6177000	Burr replies and says never cared for heroes, but I would gladly watch a show on my Xbox if it was good.
6177000	6186000	I don't know if it's a threat to the whole system, but it's yet another step towards the a la carte delivery consumers have been clamoring for, much to the cable company's chagrin.
6186000	6195000	Pete Garuno says if it ain't 1 versus 100, dot dot dot. High five, sir. Amen. Preach.
6195000	6203000	If they say the next Xbox is bringing back 1 versus 100, I would have to give it serious consideration on that merit alone.
6203000	6206000	But they need to guarantee me it'll be up for at least a couple years.
6206000	6211000	Let's see, Nicky E. replied and said I liked the first season, they blew it in the second.
6211000	6213000	I would probably check out a reboot.
6213000	6219000	As for the whole deal of getting services via Xbox or Netflix or any other streaming service, I don't like it one bit if it's an exclusive thing.
6219000	6222000	I pay for Netflix to be able to watch what I want, when I want.
6222000	6228000	If some other service has an exclusive thing, I would either not care, buy it on DVD later, or maybe end up downloading it.
6228000	6235000	I think too much competition via exclusive deals and making content only for your own streaming service would just lead to more piracy.
6235000	6238000	Just when the streaming services were beginning to compete with the conveniency of the internet.
6238000	6240000	Thanks for a great show. Thank you.
6240000	6246000	That's a good point. I don't want to have to give every content publisher 10 bucks a month to watch their show.
6246000	6250000	I think that dilution is going to lead to a lose-lose situation.
6250000	6251000	Piracy, yeah.
6251000	6254000	Yeah, piracy. People get what they want to see, you know.
6254000	6257000	Yes, people do get what they want to see.
6257000	6261000	Degenerate Johnny says, I don't particularly think this service will pose a threat.
6261000	6268000	Yes, interactive entertainment has played a role in the steep decline of ratings within cable television through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and other various services.
6268000	6275000	Which is why you see cable news upholding the interest of those networks by focusing on the negative pertaining to interactive entertainment.
6275000	6282000	Ooh, interesting. Do you think maybe it's a whole little, that's why cable news has it out for games, is that it's competition?
6282000	6284000	That's an awfully little...
6284000	6287000	No, I think it's just, it's the same reason...
6287000	6288000	They are an easy target though.
6288000	6296000	It's the same reason why there's certain people on cable news that have very racist comments or, you know, I just think they're very short-minded.
6296000	6301000	Let's see, Andy R. says, depends what kind of pricing is involved, but I would like something like this.
6301000	6308000	I don't pay for cable because I don't watch much TV, which makes it difficult on the few occasions when there is a show I want to watch, like Game of Thrones.
6308000	6312000	If I can watch it in a manner where I'm not paying for a ton of services I don't want, I'm all for it.
6312000	6318000	Mike B. says, cable should be trying to keep up with the times. The future is a la carte programming.
6318000	6319000	He's not the first one to use that term.
6319000	6325000	Commercial-free shows and movies via the internet. I already do this now. It's a little pricey, but no commercials.
6325000	6334000	Let me go over to Google Plus and Redertainment, who said, this is what Microsoft tried and failed to do with Web TV.
6334000	6338000	Microsoft wanted Web TV to be centralized hub for all your entertainment.
6338000	6348000	The Xbox is succeeding where Web TV failed due to Xbox being a well-established brand and consumers generally being more web-savvy now than where Microsoft failed with Web TV.
6348000	6354000	As far as Heroes goes, I take the same approach to it as I do Arrested Development of Netflix or Zombieland on Amazon.
6354000	6359000	If I'm interested in the content, then I will seek it out. I'm not interested in Heroes, so I will not be seeking it out.
6359000	6365000	Again, that comment from Redertainment on Google Plus. I think the comparison of Web TV is very interesting.
6365000	6370000	If at first you don't succeed, try again. Very interesting.
6370000	6377000	Apologize I didn't get to all the comments, but do check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.
6377000	6382000	Just search for orange lounge radio to read all of the great comments in their entirety.
6382000	6383000	In the meantime...
6383000	6385000	Yeah, cause there's some wank going on.
6385000	6386000	What? Oh, the chatter's mad at you.
6386000	6387000	You didn't read mine, Rob.
6387000	6394000	Well, maybe because I read a lot of your other stuff and you guys call in pretty regularly, so I wanted to read people that don't get to participate as much with the show.
6394000	6396000	So just throw that out there.
6396000	6399000	I know, but you know, I have to give...
6399000	6401000	You have to fan the flames.
6401000	6403000	I have to fan them.
6403000	6404000	Alright.
6404000	6408000	I'm like, I'm like, um, Karl Lagerfeld and his fan.
6408000	6409000	But I appreciate...
6409000	6410000	Without being an asshole.
6410000	6416000	I appreciate all of the comments and encourage everybody to go read them in their entirety on Facebook and Google Plus.
6416000	6418000	Meanwhile, more news.
6418000	6424000	So the second round of THQ auctions are, well, they're happening.
6424000	6431000	And apparently the news will be out Monday afternoon on to who has what.
6431000	6442000	This included back catalog rights and also kind of different lots, including the Darksiders franchise, Red Faction, and Homeworld franchise.
6442000	6448000	Of course, you know, the original auctions, you know, sold off the other stuff like Saints Row and that kind of thing.
6448000	6455000	They're saying they're going to make six to seven million dollars from those sales.
6456000	6466000	One thing, though, that we do know that's going to happen, the whole crowdfunded movement to buy the rights to Homeworld failed.
6466000	6469000	They didn't have enough money to win the bid there.
6469000	6473000	So thankfully they are refunding everyone's money.
6473000	6474000	So that's nice.
6474000	6476000	So they have that going on.
6476000	6478000	That means somebody put up a lot of money for it.
6478000	6480000	So somebody recognized the value in it.
6480000	6482000	Then somebody outbid those guys.
6482000	6490000	So they had, I guess it looks like they had around 80 million dollars or set.
6490000	6492000	No, like 70 million.
6492000	6493000	No, no, no.
6493000	6494000	Eighty thousand.
6494000	6495000	I'm sorry.
6495000	6497000	Seventy five thousand dollars.
6497000	6499000	Eighty million dollars.
6499000	6501000	Well, it's the most successful.
6501000	6503000	Saints Row win for that much.
6503000	6504000	No, no, no.
6504000	6511000	So eighty thousand dollars is what they had between their Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.
6511000	6514000	Unfortunately, they were not able to get it for that.
6515000	6517000	It sold for the Price is Right rules.
6517000	6519000	Eighty thousand and one.
6521000	6522000	All right.
6522000	6527000	Well, this, I think, is some good news for gaming, because this was just causing a lot of fuckery in court.
6527000	6530000	And I really can't think of a better word to describe it.
6530000	6539000	But you might remember that there was a trademark on the term Edge, and this belonged to Tim Langdell, who was the founder of Edge Games.
6539000	6543000	Well, a court order has stripped him of that trademark.
6543000	6547000	That's because of a petition by DICE and EA, who made it Mirror's Edge.
6547000	6553000	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of the canceled registration on April 17th.
6553000	6556000	This whole thing has been going on since 2010.
6556000	6558000	Let's see.
6558000	6565000	Moby Game made a game called Edge, and they've discounted all versions of the game by 50% in celebration.
6565000	6570000	The game had been taken down from the App Store previously due to issues with this trademark.
6570000	6574000	So, you know, anything that had the word Edge in it, this guy was coming for you.
6574000	6576000	Hide your wife, hide your edge.
6576000	6579000	Hmm, that sort of sounds like Ville.
6579000	6584000	Yeah, so maybe this will set a very interesting precedent and send a message.
6584000	6588000	I'm going to create a game called Ville. Just Ville.
6588000	6593000	I mean, this guy is welcome to call his company Edge Games, I don't have a problem with that.
6593000	6599000	But where did Edge Games and Mirror's Edge? No. There's no similarity there.
6599000	6601000	It's just like monster cables.
6601000	6604000	I'm all for this. They should kill off more stupid trademarks.
6604000	6607000	I can think of a few we've come across in gaming that need to be canceled as well.
6607000	6612000	So, anyhow. Let's move on to some more news.
6612000	6619000	In other news. Now, the original link, by the way, didn't work, so I had to hunt it down.
6619000	6621000	Oops.
6621000	6629000	Oh well. It's okay. So, there is a prototype of a Sega machine that was called the Pluto, I believe.
6629000	6635000	And a guy's posting on Assembler Games forums with pictures of one of the second prototypes.
6635000	6636000	There were only two of them.
6636000	6646000	And basically says it's super heavy. It had two controller ports, a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a power button, and the reset button.
6646000	6656000	It still says Saturn on it, but this was, apparently, they were going to brand whatever this Pluto system was with the Saturn name.
6656000	6663000	When you plug it in, it actually has the Saturn loading screen. The drive empty screen.
6663000	6669000	So, yeah. Just looking this over. It apparently works.
6669000	6676000	It was, I'm sorry if I'm having to go through this because, unfortunately, the original thing didn't work for me.
6676000	6685000	It is region locked, but it is a USA NTSC Saturn. So, that's pretty cool. I think it had the networking capability.
6685000	6692000	They bought this for a dollar at a Stockton flea market. One dollar.
6693000	6701000	By the way, turning around and selling it on eBay right now, already up to like $67,000, or $7600.
6701000	6704000	For real? That was at a flea market? That's crazy.
6704000	6706000	Yeah. The other one was at a garage sale.
6706000	6707000	Wow.
6707000	6709000	And I think the Stockton area as well.
6709000	6712000	Yeah, okay. It's a Saturn with a Netlink built in.
6712000	6715000	This needs to be in my collection, dammit.
6715000	6717000	You have a few thousand dollars to pony up?
6717000	6720000	No, I have a desire to buy a house.
6720000	6722000	If only you'd been at that flea market.
6722000	6724000	I can't live in a Sega Pluto.
6724000	6726000	You can try.
6726000	6728000	It is pretty big.
6728000	6734000	I have to say, looking at it, it is pretty burly, but you know what? I have a Saturn and I'm happy with it.
6737000	6739000	Damn, it is a monster though.
6739000	6746000	I just want to read a quick comment on the Edge thing, because people in chat are still talking about the Edge story, and I think this insight from Dungeon Buster is pretty good in chat.
6746000	6752000	Langdell picked a fight with EA, and EA decided to litigate his trademark into oblivion and won.
6752000	6756000	The guy was nuts. He'd sue over anything that he thought infringed on his trademark.
6756000	6760000	He made up proof that others were using it, which the courts didn't appreciate. It was hilarious.
6760000	6763000	Again, that's from Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6763000	6768000	I also do want to repost the forum link, just because people need to see photos of this. It's pretty interesting.
6768000	6769000	Oh, of the Pluto?
6769000	6774000	Of the Pluto. I mean, I've seen the Neptune one, because they have it at Classic Gaming Expo every year.
6774000	6780000	This thing is huge, and it looks like a Saturn and a Sega CD had an ugly baby.
6780000	6785000	Poor Pluto keeps getting shit on. It's not a real planet. It's not a real system.
6788000	6792000	Good thing we didn't name this show Pluto Lounge Radio, or we might have been in trouble.
6792000	6795000	Her. No, good thing we weren't Pluto Edge Radio.
6797000	6798000	Alright.
6798000	6799000	You see what I did there?
6800000	6803000	Loki, were you going to get into something? Sorry, I think I cut you off.
6803000	6807000	Yeah, I was going to talk about how successful Microsoft is.
6807000	6813000	They turned a profit in their third quarter, which just ended March 31st.
6813000	6822000	And apparently, I guess, $2.53 billion. 56% increase over last year.
6822000	6831000	And, of course, citing that, you know, obviously, Halo 4 is a big part of that.
6831000	6847000	They were saying that, I guess, overall, they said the operating income of $342 million was up from a $242 million loss last year.
6847000	6851000	So, overall, they're up, but some of their costs went up as well.
6852000	6858000	And they're saying right now, specifically, Xbox Live memberships grew 18%, now 46 million members.
6858000	6872000	And they're saying that the console, I guess, it shipped 8.9 million units in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, down 3 million units from the same time last year.
6872000	6876000	But it's a big spend. It's been out for eight years now.
6876000	6878000	Yeah, yeah. You expect there's going to be a little decline.
6878000	6879000	Almost eight years.
6879000	6881000	No price drop or anything recently to motivate it, right?
6881000	6882000	Yeah.
6882000	6888000	All right. Well, we talked a lot in the first half of our show tonight about the Nintendo Direct conference that happened this week.
6888000	6893000	But this was something that wasn't really a part of that, probably because this is only happening in Japan.
6893000	6898000	But I found this interesting. If for nothing else, then it name checks Tumblr, which I know Dark Sakura is into that.
6898000	6902000	It's a web tool coming out for the 3DS internet browser.
6902000	6908000	And what you can do is you can share screenshots from certain compatible games right onto Twitter and Tumblr.
6908000	6915000	The games it supports right now, Animal Crossing New Leaf and Tomodachi Collection New Life, which isn't something we have here.
6915000	6917000	But those are the games that are going to work with the service.
6917000	6923000	And you can even see in a little screenshot here, you see the games and I guess you take the screenshot and you just put them right up on Twitter and Tumblr.
6923000	6927000	Which I find interesting that those are the two that are picked, not like Facebook or something.
6927000	6931000	But again, it's Japan. Facebook might not be in Japan when it is here.
6931000	6935000	And honestly, do you want more of that shit on your Facebook?
6936000	6937000	Click block.
6940000	6942000	You're right, I don't want more of that shit on my Facebook.
6942000	6944000	God, Facebook is actually on my shit list for a big reason.
6944000	6948000	Well, I've been talking bad about it for a long time. Welcome to the party.
6948000	6955000	Alright, anyhow, no word, however, if this is something that's coming to our side of the pond, we'll see.
6955000	6958000	I imagine it's one of those things that might surprise us in the future, Nintendo Direct.
6958000	6963000	I would imagine maybe they are trying to incorporate some other services that are big here.
6963000	6967000	I can't imagine they wouldn't try to do Facebook. Try to think what other...
6967000	6971000	Look, I just hit Tom Nook with a bug catching net.
6971000	6972000	Right?
6975000	6977000	I just made somebody fall into a hole.
6977000	6982000	I hope they incorporate more of this stuff. They should do this type of instant screenshotting for virtual console games.
6982000	6989000	See, I would have loved something like this when I was playing the first, well, technically the second Animal Crossing on GameCube and had my town lesbian.
6990000	6993000	Or like, look what crazy shit I got this guy to say.
6993000	7001000	I know, well we had one character because I think we brought over your card to have our town people meet.
7001000	7004000	And now half of my town members started saying pussy.
7006000	7011000	And then we brought it over to Adam's house on his wife's game.
7011000	7015000	And then half of her town started saying it too.
7015000	7018000	Yeah, I caused an outbreak.
7018000	7019000	You're a virus.
7019000	7020000	I was.
7020000	7021000	Rob caused an outbreak of pussy.
7021000	7028000	I got one that said a really, really nasty word and there was a certain friend at the time that really did not like that word.
7028000	7029000	Was it?
7029000	7031000	And it ended up moving to her villa, it ended up moving to her village.
7034000	7039000	She worked for months to get, from what I hear, to get rid of it.
7039000	7040000	Oh man.
7040000	7041000	In retrospect, I feel bad.
7041000	7042000	Memories.
7042000	7046000	But yeah, memories. Animal Crossing ruining lives, left and right.
7046000	7051000	Alright, this is the part of the show where we would do the mailbag.
7051000	7054000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7054000	7056000	Lol, nope.
7056000	7058000	But, no emails tonight?
7058000	7060000	FreezePop emailed us.
7060000	7063000	They're selling merchandise to benefit the folks in Boston.
7063000	7066000	Oh, well that's cool. They are from Bob. That's great.
7066000	7069000	Yeah, so go check out FreezePop's merchandise. We love FreezePop.
7069000	7072000	I almost sang Sprode last night and then I was too drunk.
7073000	7078000	And the reason why I kind of snickered in the beginning is because we get a lot of stuff from them all the time about what's going on.
7078000	7081000	But that is definitely a cause worth plugging.
7081000	7084000	Well, I'm going to give it one more refresh just to see.
7084000	7085000	Just in case?
7085000	7088000	And if anybody sent me an asshole email in the interim, then you're banned.
7090000	7091000	Nope.
7091000	7093000	Send us one for next week. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7093000	7094000	Send me something funny.
7094000	7098000	I will throw another plug out here for this. The bumpers.
7098000	7101000	Now, don't forget, we're looking for more bumpers for the show.
7101000	7104000	I didn't play one tonight. I have one in the queue. I still need to play.
7104000	7109000	And I forgot to get it prepped today with all the stuff that was going on today.
7109000	7111000	I had visitors from out of town and all that.
7111000	7114000	So I didn't get around to doing that, so I apologize.
7114000	7118000	But you know what? It's okay because if I had played it tonight, I wouldn't have had anything for next week.
7118000	7120000	So don't forget to send in bumpers.
7120000	7123000	And more details are available at the VOG Network.com forums.
7123000	7126000	Use your gaming voices to tell people stuff.
7126000	7128000	Alright, what are you...
7128000	7129000	Something coming up.
7129000	7130000	Mewing out over there. Alright.
7130000	7131000	Something looks hideous.
7131000	7133000	Alright, well let's do the FUs of the week.
7133000	7136000	Speaking of hideous and wrong.
7136000	7138000	And horrible.
7153000	7156000	To the girl who is at Panda Express.
7156000	7158000	Not while I'm working there.
7158000	7161000	She walks up, this girl walks up to my car and says,
7161000	7165000	Hi, can you please buy us dinner? My mom just lost her job.
7165000	7168000	Which, she was totally lying.
7168000	7173000	I mean, it was, she was there with her friends hanging out and drinking cups of water from inside the...
7173000	7174000	Not an Oscar winner.
7174000	7175000	No.
7175000	7178000	And I was like, and so I just said to her, I said, no.
7178000	7181000	And she's like, but, but we need food.
7181000	7184000	I was like, there's assistance programs.
7184000	7186000	I'm not even going in Panda Express.
7186000	7188000	And I went into the Rite Aid.
7188000	7190000	Cause it's like right next door.
7190000	7195000	Cause I wanted to buy cheap crappy sunglasses to wear over my regular glasses.
7195000	7200000	And then, so I walked back in to go buy my food.
7200000	7202000	And I'm sorry to get you any kind of sour in the evening.
7202000	7203000	Can you get that?
7203000	7206000	It's fine. I actually ended up having Panda earlier today by coincidence.
7206000	7208000	So it works out.
7208000	7210000	Well, so anyway.
7210000	7213000	By the way, the guy who talked about my hair a couple weeks ago was there and he said,
7213000	7215000	You did your hair that way again?
7215000	7220000	Um, but, um, the girls were sitting out there just being completely stupid and harassing customers,
7220000	7222000	but they didn't have like any kind of security going on.
7222000	7225000	They could, they had no way to ask them to leave.
7225000	7227000	So I was like, Oh, I am so sorry.
7227000	7229000	Your customers are being harassed right now.
7229000	7234000	And then, um, to the Audi, the person driving the Audi who kept trying to pass me.
7234000	7235000	No.
7235000	7237000	You all know.
7237000	7238000	Hello Key.
7238000	7242000	Um, I don't want to go all Seinfeld, but seriously,
7242000	7245000	what's up with bicycles built for two?
7245000	7250000	I mean, seriously, I saw like on the way here, you know, there's a lot of bikers out right now.
7250000	7252000	Like a tandem?
7252000	7257000	Yeah, like it's a bike with two seats and people both pedal.
7257000	7258000	Yeah. Okay.
7258000	7259000	I don't understand.
7259000	7264000	You mean like the one in front, one in back, like the classic tandem bicycle or if it had a buggy or something?
7264000	7265000	No, no, no.
7265000	7269000	The classic, like you see it in cartoons where they, it's a bicycle built for two.
7269000	7270000	Riding through the park together.
7270000	7271000	Like the method movie.
7271000	7272000	Yeah.
7272000	7276000	Like I understand, you know, if you're on vacation or something like, well, let's get a bicycle built for two.
7276000	7281000	But these were people that were, you know, the bikers that you see out on the road that dress up.
7281000	7284000	The ones that like have their team sponsors.
7284000	7286000	You're not sponsored by any fucking person.
7286000	7287000	Okay.
7287000	7288000	You just have this stupid biker thing.
7288000	7290000	It looks ridiculous.
7290000	7292000	You look ridiculous.
7292000	7294000	And a bicycle built for two.
7294000	7300000	Like I'm supposed to be convinced that you're training for your bicycle built for two marathon race that you're going to be in.
7300000	7301000	I mean, come on.
7301000	7302000	It's just.
7302000	7304000	Now that song is stuck in my head.
7304000	7305000	It's just weird.
7305000	7306000	I don't know.
7306000	7309000	It just annoys me extra.
7309000	7312000	Uh, my a few of the week, I'll keep it short and sweet.
7312000	7318000	Um, F F you to those bastards that set the bombs off in Boston.
7318000	7321000	That was, that was some straight up fucked up crap.
7321000	7323000	So or the MIT shooter.
7323000	7324000	I am.
7324000	7325000	That was all.
7325000	7326000	That was all the same.
7326000	7327000	That was the same guys.
7327000	7328000	Oh, yeah.
7328000	7330000	Did you not see the fuckery that blew up everywhere?
7330000	7332000	I just saw that it was somebody I didn't see.
7332000	7333000	It was the same people.
7333000	7337000	It was some, it was, it was fucked up, but, um, you know what?
7337000	7349000	Props to the city for banding together to stay safe and, uh, find the guy and well, they killed one and arrested the other guy who's like half alive right now.
7349000	7351000	So maybe they'll be able to get some answers.
7351000	7354000	Let's hope these crazies were acting alone, you know?
7354000	7355000	Right.
7355000	7357000	Let's hope they weren't part of something bigger.
7357000	7359000	And that's, that would be even more fucked up.
7359000	7361000	May I add something to that please?
7361000	7362000	Please.
7362000	7368000	Um, also the F you to the people who were going around and showing people on the internet that had absolutely nothing to do with it.
7368000	7371000	I'm pointing fingers at them because it got a few innocent people arrested.
7371000	7373000	Yeah.
7373000	7374000	Everybody wants to be a crime.
7374000	7377000	So everybody's a little bit Nancy Drew.
7377000	7378000	Stick to the video games.
7378000	7380000	Don't be the Hardy boys.
7380000	7385000	Bobby Hammond interview with a very nice developer who's making crime games.
7385000	7387000	And if you want to go solve crimes, go play her games.
7387000	7394000	I do have to agree though that major kudos to the Boston police.
7394000	7396000	All right.
7396000	7398000	But also F you to CNN.
7398000	7400000	God, they fucked up this week.
7400000	7408000	Anyway, they've been CNN earns fuck up of the year already for me just because of how shitty their coverage is.
7408000	7410000	I go to BBC for my news.
7410000	7423000	I just, I just wait for the official press conferences because I, the thing I cannot stand, I cannot stand about situations like this is when there's a lull in actual news.
7423000	7426000	It's let's talk about the why.
7426000	7432000	Let's theorize on all this crap we don't know about what, why did they do it or make up these theories?
7432000	7435000	That's the stuff that drives me bonkers when it comes to news.
7435000	7437000	I think you played video games.
7437000	7445000	Well, there was that story around about the Moroccan kid who they pulled in because he happened to be there and happened to have a black bag.
7445000	7451000	He was a runner himself and not in the thing, but he was watching the marathon because it was his passion.
7451000	7452000	Inspiration.
7452000	7455000	It's just, it's the whole profiling mentality.
7455000	7456000	Yeah.
7456000	7461000	I mean, I'm really, Oh God, I got into it with my mother today too.
7461000	7467000	I was super disgusted over that sort of closed minded mentality that, Oh, they, why?
7467000	7468000	They must be in trouble.
7468000	7469000	Fuck that.
7469000	7470000	Fuck that.
7470000	7476000	When you literally cannot get, literally cannot get more Caucasian than these guys.
7476000	7479000	They were from the caucus mountains.
7480000	7481000	Hi.
7481000	7484000	That is like Uber Caucasian.
7484000	7486000	That is literal Caucasian.
7486000	7487000	I am with Misty.
7487000	7491000	See shit like this is why I stick to the bloody weather channel.
7491000	7492000	Amen.
7492000	7493000	It's going to rain.
7493000	7494000	You know what?
7494000	7497000	I'm about ready to sign up for that group going to Mars.
7497000	7498000	Fuck this planet.
7498000	7500000	I'm gone.
7500000	7502000	Not the show.
7502000	7504000	I will find a way to Skype from Mars.
7504000	7505000	Just saying.
7505000	7508000	Can we move on to more gaming news?
7509000	7512000	Let's talk about green people instead of white people.
7512000	7513000	Loki.
7513000	7514000	Uh, yes.
7514000	7522000	So they have a mod for Skyrim that turns the Argonians into Ninja Turtles.
7522000	7523000	That looked frightening.
7523000	7528000	And then if you don't want to be Argonian, you can put the shell on yourself and you
7528000	7535000	could be like some strange cat turtle or some chick turtle.
7536000	7541000	The dude that they have in the picture here looks kind of like the rock wearing turtle shell.
7541000	7542000	He's like, what?
7542000	7543000	I'm totally serious about this.
7543000	7545000	But yeah, you can check that out.
7545000	7551000	It's, I don't know if it's on ModDB or if it's actually one of the, it's probably
7551000	7552000	on ModDB.
7552000	7556000	And then, or Skyrim Nexus.
7556000	7559000	Yeah, Skyrim Nexus is where it's at.
7559000	7563000	And yeah, check it out if that's your thing.
7563000	7567000	And maybe this gives you an idea of what the new Michael Bay movie is going to look
7567000	7568000	like.
7568000	7569000	Because it's terrible.
7569000	7570000	Alright.
7570000	7576000	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or
7576000	7578000	a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio.
7578000	7579000	This is pretty cool.
7579000	7582000	A new album being produced for record label Game Chops.
7582000	7584000	It's called World 1-2.
7584000	7586000	It's not just about Mario.
7586000	7591000	It's about, it's about kind of like what's new and what's going on in, in, uh,
7591000	7593000	bit rock and all that stuff right now.
7593000	7600000	Uh, including people like super hexagon composer, Chip Zell, um, Manami Matsumae who is, who
7600000	7601000	did Mega Man.
7601000	7605000	And we talked about also doing some tracks for Shovel Knight, uh, Austin Wintory contributing
7605000	7606000	to this.
7606000	7608000	Akira Yamaoka, apparently going to be on this too.
7608000	7610000	I would marry that man.
7610000	7613000	Uh, the album comes out May 2nd for $10.
7613000	7620000	You can check out some of the tracks, uh, on the website music.gamechops.com.
7620000	7624000	Uh, the full URL is slash album slash world dash one dash two.
7624000	7628000	But I'm sure if you get yourself to music.gamechops.com, you'll get to see some of this.
7628000	7633000	Now, sadly, we can't preview the Akira Yamaoka track for you because it's not there, but
7633000	7635000	I could try to play a little bit of this.
7635000	7641000	This is the Manami, um, Matsumae song, one shot, one kill.
7641000	7642000	Matsumae.
7642000	7643000	Excuse me.
7643000	7645000	Can I play this?
7645000	7647000	I won't let you.
7647000	7650000	I want to play a little bit of it, but it's not working.
7650000	7652000	LOL Live Radio.
7652000	7653000	Crap.
7653000	7654000	LOL Live Radio.
7654000	7656000	Let me see if one of these others will work here.
7656000	7661000	Let's try this Chip Zell track real quick.
7661000	7663000	Da da da da da da.
7663000	7664000	Live Radio.
7664000	7666000	Yeah, it won't work for some reason.
7666000	7668000	Go to the, you gave them the website.
7668000	7669000	They can listen to it if they want to.
7669000	7670000	You can check it out for yourself.
7670000	7672000	After they've listened to us.
7672000	7673000	So.
7673000	7676000	Or you can try to run both at the same time, but it might give you a headache.
7676000	7680000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7680000	7682000	If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome.
7682000	7683000	We'll talk.
7683000	7684000	We can talk about whatever tonight.
7684000	7685000	I know it's, we're ending.
7685000	7688000	We're getting to the last part of the show a little sooner than usual, but let's be real.
7688000	7690000	Like the last few shows have all been like three and a half hours.
7690000	7693000	So now I can go get my grocery shopping.
7693000	7694000	Right.
7694000	7695000	Well, we'll see.
7695000	7697000	We still might have some calls coming in that, um, could be a good time.
7697000	7701000	So again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7701000	7703000	Uh, last minute stories.
7703000	7704000	Loki.
7704000	7705000	I don't know if you have anything tonight.
7705000	7707000	I just, I'm shopping on steam.
7707000	7709000	I picked up a surgeon simulator.
7709000	7711000	Of course you did.
7711000	7716000	And they also have a double pack of breath of death seven and kazoo blue saves the world for 99 cents.
7716000	7717000	Hmm.
7717000	7718000	So that's not bad.
7718000	7719000	Not bad at all.
7719000	7721000	And the portal games were on super sale this weekend.
7721000	7722000	Yeah.
7722000	7723000	But I already have portal.
7723000	7724000	Who does?
7724000	7727000	I would think most of our listeners pick that up by now, but if you didn't, for whatever reason,
7727000	7730000	I mean like I was surprised it's not 99 cents yet.
7730000	7732000	It's they'll probably give it away.
7732000	7736000	They gave portal away literally at one point and I'm sure portal to portal to right.
7736000	7738000	And I think was at a 50% off sale.
7738000	7739000	Hmm.
7739000	7740000	Um, just a few days ago.
7740000	7741000	Oh yeah.
7741000	7743000	I think that's the whole one this weekend anyway.
7743000	7744000	Yeah.
7744000	7745000	All right.
7745000	7746000	We do have a call coming in.
7746000	7747000	So let's get to the phones.
7747000	7748000	Hi.
7748000	7749000	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7749000	7750000	Who's this?
7750000	7751000	Hola.
7751000	7752000	Bienvenido.
7752000	7753000	Hey, this is excellent.
7753000	7754000	Hey, excellent.
7754000	7755000	How you doing?
7755000	7756000	Hey, doing good.
7756000	7757000	Oh, long time.
7757000	7758000	You'll talk.
7758000	7759000	How are you?
7759000	7760000	I've called in here.
7760000	7761000	Happy a last week.
7762000	7763000	Thank you very much.
7763000	7764000	That's been awesome.
7764000	7765000	500.
7765000	7766000	That's very, a lot of episodes.
7766000	7767000	So.
7767000	7771000	We're so old.
7771000	7774000	I was calling in because I was decided by Earthbound, but I was a little disappointed
7774000	7778360	because during the announcements for it, they were saying that it was coming for the Wii
7778360	7782760	U and I was hoping that it was also going to come for that for the 3DS because I do
7782760	7788360	own the 3DS for that and that is one of my favorite games playing well growing up.
7788720	7793440	I don't count out the 3DS, but I have a feeling they know a lot of people want Earthbound
7793440	7797440	and so they'll probably keep it exclusive to Wii U because if you could even sell a
7797440	7801320	handful of consoles to people that really want to play it again, they'll do it.
7801320	7804840	Again, I don't know why you just wouldn't get a Super Nintendo and get the cart, but
7804840	7810200	the cart is not exactly, I mean, it still goes on eBay for like 150 bucks.
7810200	7811760	I just like the portability of it.
7811760	7815640	I like the fact that usually when I go to work, sometimes I take the bus and stuff,
7815640	7819400	so it's kind of nice to have it so when I do the bus trips, it usually takes about 30,
7819400	7820400	40 minutes.
7820400	7824200	I can just sit there and just level up my character or do whatever it takes, just play
7824200	7825840	and have fun with it.
7825840	7829740	Why won't Nintendo just open it up so you buy one, get them on all consoles?
7829740	7834640	That would be the great, you know, they're still making money not doing it that way.
7834640	7838920	You know, they should take that, but then again, that's a playbook either Sony too.
7838920	7844600	Sony kind of does that with some of their games with the PSP to the PS3 or vice versa
7844600	7845960	kind of deal to that.
7845960	7848480	So I mean, I don't know about the Vita.
7848480	7850080	They have done some cross play.
7850080	7851960	They have done some cross play that's pretty awesome.
7851960	7852960	Like what?
7852960	7857980	Retro City Rampage had it and you know, the fighting game, the Super or the All Stars
7857980	7860160	PlayStation battle royale.
7860160	7863680	I was referring more to the fact that like you buy some like their quote unquote arcade
7863680	7867600	games or lower end games like the pinball and stuff that you can actually play on both
7867600	7870400	systems without worrying about rebinding it like six times.
7870400	7875000	So I got nothing against it because believe it or not, here in the household here between
7875000	7878400	me and my girlfriend, we had bought Plants vs Zombies like six different times for six
7878400	7880600	different, almost six different forms of platforms.
7880600	7884320	I think a lot of people did.
7884320	7886960	So you know, I do look forward to that.
7886960	7889760	Also really quickly, Rob, you really love League of Legends.
7889760	7891320	I would love to sit there and play with you.
7891320	7893720	I think you would have a lot of fun with that over DOA.
7893720	7897200	DOA is just, the game is a lot of fun.
7897200	7903460	There is a lot of different stuff they did with that through Steam and the Steam workshop
7903460	7908280	but also to the player base on there is a horde compared to that of League of Legends.
7908280	7912560	I swear I'm going to give League of Legends the good old once over but I got to finish
7912560	7913560	up a game.
7913560	7916580	I got to write a review for it first and then I can get into League of Legends over the
7916580	7920600	next week while there's still not a lot going on for me in WoW right now.
7920600	7924360	Well, it's one of those games where it's nice enough where I can go in there and play
7924360	7926520	a game for an hour or two and not worry about anything.
7926520	7930080	Like right now I'm level 19 out of 30 so I'm working my way up to 30 right now but
7930080	7934980	it's nice enough where I can sit there and play a game or two and not worry about that.
7934980	7938120	You know, I have to worry about subscription fee or anything like that on some other games
7938120	7939120	like WoW or something.
7939120	7941760	What worries me most about League of Legends though is the other people.
7941760	7944500	I hear the community is really awful in League of Legends.
7944500	7949200	No offense to the fans out there but I have heard your community is really awful.
7949200	7953580	There is a lot of people that are really awful in the game but there's also a lot of good
7953580	7954580	people in the game.
7955140	7957660	But WoW is not that much worse.
7957660	7959900	Look at the people on there from Cal and stuff.
7959900	7965780	I mean, it's just the horror stories I can tell you just sitting here talking about that.
7965780	7967220	But that's with any game in general.
7967220	7970820	You're going to have the good along with the bad.
7970820	7972940	That's the fun of it like playing with friends and stuff.
7972940	7975940	That way you don't have to worry about that so much.
7975940	7978620	It's like one of those things where if you do something wrong or something people will
7978620	7981620	point it out saying, hey, by the way, you do not do this right.
7981620	7983220	You should do this instead.
7983220	7985380	Just follow this or go here and look at this.
7985380	7988620	It's kind of like they do in WoW and it's kind of nice to know that there is a lot of
7988620	7993540	people that is willing to work as long as there is a lot of good as there is bad with
7993540	7995540	a lot of games.
7995540	7998340	I will give League of Legends a serious try.
7998340	8002580	I've fired it up a couple times but I haven't done anything serious with it but I will take
8002580	8006620	my friend's offer to help school me a little bit on it and I'll let you guys all know
8006620	8007620	how it turns out.
8007620	8008620	But give me a couple weeks.
8008620	8009620	Give me a couple weeks.
8009620	8012220	Like I said before, if you need any pointers or anything, I'll be more than happy to
8012220	8014700	How about I kick your ass at it?
8014700	8015700	Yeah, okay.
8015700	8016700	You want to do that, that's fine.
8016700	8018180	Be more than happy to do that.
8018180	8020500	Play a one-on-one game with you.
8020500	8022780	I can stream it on Twitch like everybody else.
8022780	8023780	It'll be fun.
8023780	8024780	All right.
8024780	8025780	Excellent.
8025780	8027340	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8027340	8028980	That's pretty much about it for right now.
8028980	8029980	All right.
8029980	8030980	We'll have a good one.
8030980	8032620	I was going to get my input out of Earthbound and stuff.
8032620	8036340	I'm also kind of worried too, the wondering what they're going to do because now they're
8036340	8037780	announcing this out for so many years.
8037780	8041340	I'm kind of wondering if they're going to sugarcoat it or take stuff out or what they're
8041340	8044180	going to do to replace it because I know a lot of the issues they were having with
8044180	8045700	that was with the music.
8045700	8048940	So I'm kind of curious to know what they're going to do to get around that.
8048940	8053340	I am very curious as well to see if it comes out unedited or if they make any changes.
8053340	8057060	It will be very interesting because they're not going to announce it until it's already
8057060	8058060	out.
8058060	8059060	So we'll see.
8059060	8060060	Yeah, of course.
8060060	8062140	So that's probably an E3 thing too.
8062140	8064220	As long as the happy, happy cultists are still there.
8064220	8065220	They're my favorite.
8065220	8066220	All right.
8066220	8067620	I'm sure it will be.
8067620	8069980	They remind me of Shane because everything has to be blue.
8069980	8070980	Blue, blue, blue, blue.
8071620	8072620	All right.
8072620	8073620	Take care, buddy.
8073620	8074620	You have a good night, man.
8074620	8075620	I'll talk to you later.
8075620	8076620	You too.
8076620	8077620	Bye.
8077620	8078620	Bye.
8078620	8082820	1877 game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8082820	8083820	All one word.
8083820	8088140	I am still, by the way, singing the praises of Drunken Robot Pornography.
8088140	8089140	Oh, yeah.
8089140	8091220	You've been raving about that game on Steam and all that.
8091220	8092220	Everyone needs to play it.
8092220	8093220	It's hard as hell, but fun.
8093220	8094220	It has a catchy theme song.
8094220	8095220	It has a very catchy theme song.
8095220	8097220	Have you played it?
8097220	8098220	No.
8098220	8099220	You need it.
8099220	8100220	How much is it?
8100460	8101460	That's not bad.
8101460	8102460	All right.
8102460	8103460	Let's go to the next call.
8103460	8104460	Hi.
8104460	8105460	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8105460	8106460	Who's this?
8106460	8107460	That's the one and only Ranma.
8107460	8108460	Hey, buddy.
8108460	8109460	How you doing?
8109460	8110460	Hi, John.
8110460	8111460	Hey.
8111460	8112460	I'm doing good.
8112460	8113460	I'm doing good.
8113460	8114460	I saw that Dark Sakura made some new album art for Anime Jam Session.
8114460	8115460	It looks good.
8115460	8116460	Yeah.
8116460	8117460	I mean-
8117460	8118460	She wants to fix the misspelling.
8118460	8119460	No.
8119460	8122220	She took my idea and just took it to the next level because that was not what I was expecting.
8122220	8126220	I'm just like, the entire staff pretty much loves the new logo.
8126220	8127220	Great.
8127220	8128980	Well, I'm glad that you like it.
8128980	8130380	Now tell people to hire me.
8130380	8131700	I did.
8131700	8136700	If you go to the official Facebook page, there is a link to your fan page where people can
8136700	8137700	contact you for commissions.
8137700	8138700	There you go.
8138700	8140460	Well, I would appreciate that.
8140460	8141460	Trust me.
8141460	8144460	I did not mean to derail your call with singing the praises of Dark Sakura.
8144460	8145460	What's on your mind tonight?
8145460	8146460	I did though.
8146460	8149180	It's a couple of things.
8149180	8150940	It's a little bit different from what you were talking about.
8150940	8154420	It's something I've been meaning to bring up in conversation prior.
8154420	8155500	Okay.
8155500	8161420	I remember Loki bitching about Smart Glass and truth be told, I understand where he's
8161420	8171360	coming from, but my thing is with Smart Glass and the new upcoming Xbox, I'd like to see
8171360	8175660	Microsoft use more Smart Glass integration when playing games.
8175660	8182580	I'd also like to see Sony get on the bandwagon with the PS4 because truth be told, not everybody's
8182580	8187600	going to have a Vita and if you're going to be beaming stuff to the Vita, which its
8187600	8193980	operating system is slightly similar to Android, maybe we can get a little app on our tablet
8193980	8196220	so we can have a little fun with that too.
8196220	8202980	I'm not sure it can work as fast as say a Wii U because a Wii U uses that whole dedicated
8202980	8206180	broadcasting channel to transmit to the pad.
8206180	8210820	It's a lot different than the technology in something like Smart Glass where your little
8210820	8216860	iDevice beams to your wireless and the Xbox or whatever is on that same device, everything's
8216860	8218420	kind of running through your router.
8218420	8223140	It actually slows things down a lot so it's not like your device can be a controller suddenly
8223140	8224260	or anything like that.
8224260	8225980	It's not going to work like that.
8225980	8229900	I wouldn't want it as a controller but like a secondary screen or something like that.
8229900	8233060	The weird thing about it is that that's what I always thought Smart Glass was supposed
8233060	8236500	to be and Smart Glass was really implemented poorly.
8236500	8240200	It's another example of something that Microsoft really half-assed.
8240200	8244080	They put on a great show at E3 and then they half-assed their way through it.
8244080	8247920	Connect Labs is another great example, Game Room.
8247920	8254000	They half-assed a lot of this shit, they didn't see it, XNA, sorry about it, but they didn't
8254000	8256360	really give it the due that it deserved.
8256360	8258360	The vision camera.
8258360	8260960	The vision camera, I mean the list goes on and on.
8260960	8265160	Just add Smart Glass to the list, it's really unfortunate because you kind of see the potential
8265160	8268320	there, especially with it being such a media device.
8268320	8273880	Then watch, at E3 this year when they're selling their little dedicated channel, they're going
8273880	8277680	to push the second screen technology again, they're going to push Smart Glass again.
8277680	8281400	But I really hope to hell someone calls them out on it like, well wasn't this supposed
8281400	8284240	to be there already and like what?
8284240	8289120	A handful of movies have it and then Dance Central and Halo.
8289120	8294020	And all Halo does is launch what is a separate app anyway.
8294020	8295520	You can download it as a separate app.
8295520	8300880	And I still can't, you know, Forza or whatever, that's another one, Forza Horizon uses it,
8300880	8305700	I still can't on my Android device actually pull up the map.
8305700	8310240	It doesn't have any of that actual Smart Glass function, it's just, hey look, Xbox apps,
8310240	8311660	we renamed the Smart Glass.
8311660	8315960	Smart Glass ought to be a hell of a lot better than it is, and it's really disappointing.
8315960	8319920	I mean they could be doing these, like it might not be fast enough to be controllers,
8319920	8324400	he can't even do like little submenus and things like that, but why not maps of levels
8324400	8325640	that you're playing?
8325640	8331120	Like static images that change, you know, it just, it blows my mind how ridiculous it
8331120	8332120	is.
8332120	8336680	And you're right, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you're right, but because of
8336680	8341920	the WiFi frequency, I mean, it is not as fast, but it gets up there because Smart Glass is
8341920	8345640	pretty much like an over-glorified controller.
8345640	8346920	That's pretty much what it is.
8346920	8356200	Hell, I use my tablet to tell it to play videos on YouTube on my TV through to 360 or to PS3.
8356200	8357200	That is awesome.
8357200	8358200	You know, it's pretty cool.
8358200	8359200	You know, pretty fast.
8359200	8362560	Here's the thing though, the new system is supposed to be running on Bluetooth versus
8362560	8367600	this WiFi thing, now they can have an app that directly communicates with it via Bluetooth
8367600	8372000	instead of over WiFi, and so you're going to have less latency, and you can do more
8372000	8374760	amazing things with it.
8374760	8381280	Well, E3 is going to be Microsoft touting all these features again, but we'll see
8381280	8386360	how many of them actually, excuse me, actually get implemented to its fullest.
8386360	8387360	Yep.
8387360	8390160	All right, anything else you want to share with us today?
8390160	8392560	I have a funny Paxi story.
8392560	8394280	Okay, go for it.
8394280	8398840	So we're all in one of the rooms, we're all sitting there, you know, we have our 3DSs
8398840	8403800	out, we're, you know, we're swapnoting and cross-friending and all that cool stuff.
8403840	8407760	And then Bobby happens to, you know, walk out of the room because he had to go take
8407760	8408760	care of something.
8408760	8415520	One of my friends in the room, he's going through his friends list, and he's like,
8415520	8420040	oh, Bobby Blackwell, I'm friending with him now.
8420040	8426980	Now, he just said it very nonchalantly, now the entire room just gets quiet and looks
8426980	8427980	at him.
8427980	8429920	And he's like, what?
8429920	8432840	I say, um, that was Bobby Blackwell.
8432880	8437040	He just walked out the room.
8437040	8440200	So this is somebody that was like a fan of the show that had no idea that Bobby was the
8440200	8441200	right in front of him?
8441200	8444640	My friend Paul, who goes by the name of Oshie, he used to be, I think he used to be like
8444640	8451480	a mod on the G4 forums in the chat room, so they go way back, so it's like, he didn't
8451480	8453880	realize that was Bobby in the room.
8453880	8454880	That's funny.
8454880	8459860	And we kind of raised, we kind of gave him hell for that the whole weekend.
8459860	8460860	That's funny.
8460860	8464980	Especially through this radio thing, I've met some people and they're like, you know,
8464980	8469220	you don't look anything like you sound, and I'm just like, all right, how do you respond
8469220	8470220	to that?
8470220	8471220	I think Bobby looks like a Bobby.
8471220	8474420	I don't know how to respond to that.
8474420	8475900	Is that an insult or a compliment?
8475900	8477900	It could go either way.
8477900	8484200	Rob, I still remember that cat to come walking around in the dealer's room, not even five
8484200	8488460	minutes in, the guy goes, you're Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio.
8488460	8489460	Yeah.
8489460	8490460	Blush.
8491060	8492060	Yeah, that happened.
8492060	8496260	You remember when we were at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza and one of our listeners was
8496260	8497260	there?
8497260	8498260	Hi, listener!
8498260	8504340	It's a very nice, like, it's an uber compliment, but one thing to remember, guys, like, I'm
8504340	8506020	not Tom Cruise, okay?
8506020	8507020	I'm really-
8507020	8508020	Thank God!
8508020	8509020	Thank God I'm not.
8509020	8510020	But I'm really-
8510020	8511020	You're like more Tom Cruise.
8511020	8514740	I'm a fan of video games just like the rest of you guys, so like, you know, when people
8514740	8519140	are like, oh my God, you're Rob, I'm just like, yeah, I'm Rob, hey, how you doing?
8519140	8520140	Tell me about yourself.
8520140	8521140	You know?
8521140	8523940	You've been listening to me for all this time, tell me about you.
8523940	8528980	So yeah, it's very humbling, but very flattering.
8528980	8529980	Cindy.
8529980	8530980	All right.
8530980	8535620	Well, I'm going to let you go, Rama, to see if anybody else comes through, okay?
8535620	8536620	You got it, bro.
8536620	8537620	All right, take care, buddy.
8537620	8538620	You too.
8538620	8539620	All right, Trun Trun.
8539620	8540620	Later.
8540620	8541620	All right.
8541620	8547300	1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is Orange- You all right over there in the kitchen?
8547300	8548300	Allen's making a mess.
8548460	8553900	All right, let's go to some tweets, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet.
8553900	8555620	You guys might have read about this in the news.
8555620	8559220	LulzSec member sentenced for Sony Pictures website hacking.
8559220	8562780	Yeah, they went after some of those guys that were involved in that and it looks like they've
8562780	8568060	sentenced a few of them and one of them for the hacking of Sony Pictures website.
8568060	8571660	Not related to the Sony PlayStation network hack though, right?
8571660	8572660	No.
8572660	8573660	Different, right?
8573660	8574660	Interesting.
8574660	8575660	Let's go to the phones.
8575660	8577140	We have one more call coming in we'll take.
8577140	8578140	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8578180	8579180	Who's this?
8579180	8580700	Hey, this is Prince Brightstar.
8580700	8581700	Hey, Prince Brightstar.
8581700	8582700	Hi.
8582700	8583700	How are you?
8583700	8584700	Doing good, yourself?
8584700	8585700	Good.
8585700	8588620	Now, you are the listener that was listening last week and you're like, this is my first
8588620	8594300	show in a long time, but I remember when you came to visit a very long time ago, right?
8594300	8595300	That's right.
8595300	8596980	Summer of 2003, I think.
8596980	8601660	To put it in perspective, you were out here at the tech TV buildings, right?
8601660	8602660	Right, exactly.
8602660	8603660	This show's-
8603660	8606820	And I'll never forgive Comcast for what they did.
8606820	8607820	I know.
8608020	8611940	Isn't it weird now that that's all really, really over, huh?
8611940	8612940	I know.
8612940	8614340	But, you know what?
8614340	8617260	Props to Attack of the Show for the ending.
8617260	8621900	That was a very nice way to end the show with the nod to a Leo Laporte and Alex and so forth.
8621900	8629180	Yeah, and I know Leo Laporte is still doing his podcast and such, and I think Chris Parilla
8629180	8630340	is doing live streaming.
8630340	8635180	Yeah, they have a studio in the North Bay out in Petaluma, I think it's located.
8635180	8639140	Everybody I know went over there for something, and yeah, so it's cool that they still kind
8639140	8640140	of have all that in the Bay Area.
8640140	8643860	It might not be in the city, but it's, you know, they're producing great content outside
8643860	8644860	the city.
8644860	8645860	Right.
8645860	8649260	Anyhow, I didn't mean to derail you, but what's on your mind tonight?
8649260	8653740	So once again, I did want to wish you congrats on the 500th episode.
8653740	8654740	Thank you.
8654740	8656700	Can you believe we're still here?
8656700	8657700	I know.
8657700	8663260	I feel old, and I need to see if I can find the old episode where I was there.
8663780	8665740	Do you remember what episode number it was?
8665740	8666740	I do not.
8666740	8670320	I know it was summer of 2003, but that's all I remember.
8670320	8671460	Two tips for you.
8671460	8677580	There is the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, and Dark Tetsuya
8677580	8681580	has put together an awesome little summary of like every single episode, so if you look
8681580	8686100	at the summer of 2003, you might find the topics, and you might go like, oh, I was there
8686100	8687440	when that happened.
8687440	8691220	And then there's another website, and Dark Tetsuya will correct me if I'm wrong on this,
8691220	8696980	but I think it's OLRxiv, I think it's O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot T-K.
8696980	8700740	I think he had to change the forwarder, so he'll give me the new address here in chat
8700740	8705540	in a minute, but look forward to the VOG Network forums, look for Dark Tetsuya.
8705540	8710820	He has the OLRxiv, and there's a lot of old episodes they have up on like a SkyDrive somewhere,
8710820	8713620	so there's a lot, a lot of old shit.
8713620	8714620	Gotcha.
8714620	8715620	You might find it.
8715620	8716620	All right, I'll have to check them out.
8716620	8717620	Thank you for the hookup, by the way.
8717620	8718620	Thank you.
8718620	8719620	There it is from Dark Tetsuya.
8719620	8724300	O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot L-Y, so bit.ly slash O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E.
8724300	8727220	So if you want to, and this goes out to the general listenership as well, if you want
8727220	8730940	to hear what Orange Andrado sounded like back in 2003, you can check that out.
8730940	8733100	But I do want to, I always kind of put this out there.
8733100	8735260	It was a very different show back then.
8735260	8740940	I was busy reading Harry Potter anyway.
8740940	8745380	So part of the reason why I'm calling here tonight as well, Dark Sakura, I just sent
8745380	8749460	over the details for Phantasy Star Online 2 for you.
8749460	8753300	But there's something on my mind aside from that that I kind of want to get out there.
8753300	8755220	It's got me a little bit worried here.
8755220	8756700	What did I do?
8756700	8761500	Regarding that game, it was announced that it was supposed to come out here in the West.
8761500	8767960	And then we rolled past the release date and all Sega had to say was, it's delayed and
8767960	8769980	nothing else.
8769980	8774300	And that's not the first time that this has happened.
8774300	8777380	Colonial Marines, that just happened as well for the Wii U.
8777380	8782220	Obviously that's under a different company, but it's got me wondering what's up with the
8782220	8787540	management because there have been other incidences with Sega recently, such as the recent Shining
8787540	8790180	Force debacle back in November.
8790180	8796460	It's kind of got me wondering what's going on there and are we potentially seeing Sega
8796460	8798800	of America closing soon?
8798800	8802140	When has Sega had good management in the US?
8802140	8807060	I am hoping you are just out here yelling the sky is falling, which is perfectly valid.
8807060	8809740	You have good reason for thinking that.
8809740	8815060	But I would say E3 is kind of Sega's chance to be like, alright, put it out on the table.
8815060	8816060	What's coming?
8816060	8818260	Is Phantasy Star 2 on that list or not?
8818260	8821740	And if it's not, then I would start to get worried.
8821740	8824780	But I kind of think that's the type of thing they keep in their pants till E3.
8824780	8828460	I seriously think that Sega is still going to have a US presence regardless, even if
8828460	8830260	they have to cut back operations here.
8830260	8834020	Well sure, a lot of Japanese companies still have an American presence in the games industry.
8834020	8835020	True.
8835020	8840940	They may have the translations done in-house at Sega of Japan, but I was just at PAX East
8840940	8842940	recently, they did not have a booth there.
8842940	8845860	So that's part of what's got me thinking this.
8845860	8849060	That is, I mean, PAX is kind of hit and miss.
8849060	8853000	It depends if they have something to show or not, but you know, there are some companies
8853000	8854700	that don't really do PAX.
8854700	8856840	I mean like, take Blizzard for example.
8856840	8859740	They were there at PAX East because they had something to show with this whole new like
8859740	8862340	Hearthstone game, but they don't usually do these cons.
8862340	8864580	Well Blizzard is like, LOL, we'll do our own cons.
8864580	8866540	But yeah, that's actually just it.
8866540	8870060	They don't usually do these things, so they kind of do it when it's convenient for them,
8870060	8871560	which I don't blame them for.
8871560	8873500	For the record, I would go to SegaCon.
8873500	8875300	Just saying.
8875300	8876300	Agreed.
8876300	8879980	Well, what are we missing?
8879980	8883220	You're playing Phantasy Star Online 2 obviously, what are the rest of us missing?
8883220	8886340	I really want to check it out at some point.
8886340	8888340	You mean in the game or other games?
8888340	8889340	Yeah, in the game.
8889340	8891900	In Phantasy Star Online 2, how is it?
8891900	8898660	It is what I would consider to be a very faithful upgrade from the original game that came out
8898660	8901220	back in 2000.
8901220	8908420	The character creator is, I'd say, even better than what you get out of Skyrim.
8908420	8915660	The level design is superb in that even though it's randomized, it's still got a lot of
8915660	8922740	familiar elements, and you can just randomly encounter a boss outside of the boss nets.
8922740	8923740	It's just crazy.
8923740	8928060	Does this mean that you can make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Phantasy Star Online 2?
8928060	8933460	I doubt it, but can I still headshot a Rappy?
8933460	8937380	You can definitely spend at least an hour per character just building it.
8937380	8939620	How many Rappys can I expect to kill?
8939620	8940620	Tons.
8940620	8941620	Yes!
8941620	8944220	I hate those things.
8944220	8949060	And they still play dead and then get back up and you can shoot them again or whatever.
8949060	8954660	My friend actually spent $100 to buy a Rappy plushie.
8954660	8958260	Is there a big English-speaking presence on the game?
8958260	8961700	Are there a lot of people like you who are playing it even though it's not out in this
8961700	8962860	country?
8962860	8967820	Not only is there an English presence, there is a fan patch available for English so that
8967820	8971900	you can translate a good bunch of the game into English.
8971900	8974940	That's pretty awesome.
8974940	8975940	That's a fan thing.
8975940	8978380	That's not something Sega sanctioned, right?
8978380	8979380	Exactly.
8979380	8986860	Basically, people got fed up with how long it was taken, so they just ran with it, basically.
8986860	8987860	Fan communities do amazing things.
8987860	8991900	I honestly don't see Sega really having too big of a problem with it, to be honest.
8991900	8995340	Because, I mean, remember the support that they gave when they closed down the original
8995340	8997060	Phantasy Star Online servers?
8997060	8998220	That's true.
8998220	9002060	They did open up the Japanese form.
9002060	9003060	Exactly.
9003060	9009260	But they also provided US players with the data for their character to transfer to private
9009260	9012100	servers.
9012100	9013460	I didn't think that happened.
9013460	9015900	I thought that was something that fans were hoping for.
9015900	9016900	No.
9016900	9020260	Because I was going to do it, but I ended up just sort of not caring because I hadn't
9020260	9022880	been playing Phantasy Star Online for a little while.
9022880	9029840	But they were allowing full character transfers into private servers.
9029840	9035160	It was a limited window that they did it, but they had it available.
9035160	9036600	I'll have to look that up again.
9036600	9037600	All right.
9037600	9039260	Well, Prince Brightstar, thanks so much for the call.
9039260	9040680	It's good to hear from you for so long.
9040680	9041680	So welcome back.
9041680	9042680	Yep.
9042680	9046320	I'm probably going to be here every week for a good bit here.
9046320	9047320	Awesome.
9047320	9048320	Appreciate the support.
9048320	9049320	Well, you have a good one.
9049320	9050320	Okay, buddy?
9050320	9051320	You too.
9051320	9052320	All right.
9052760	9057160	I think that's really awesome for somebody that's like, you know, I fell out of the habit
9057160	9058160	or whatever.
9058160	9060560	Real life gets in the way and you don't end up listening to the show anymore.
9060560	9061560	It's cool.
9061560	9064280	But then it's like, after all this time, it's like, wow, I came back and y'all are still
9064280	9065280	here.
9065280	9067040	And it hasn't really changed that much.
9067040	9069080	You know, it's a really awesome thing to hear.
9069080	9071480	So thank you very much.
9071480	9074920	We outlived Tech TV G4.
9074920	9078520	All right.
9078520	9080080	Let's see if we get a few more tweets out here.
9080080	9083680	I don't know if there's any other last minute stories, but quickly, some more tweets from
9083680	9084680	Tiger Claw.
9084680	9089320	Centipede creator sees lack of diversity in the game industry.
9089320	9090320	Hmm.
9090320	9094600	Is that just because it's SQL SQL SQL SQL milking out the IPs?
9094600	9095600	That's my assumption here.
9095600	9096600	Hold on.
9096600	9097600	I'm bringing up the article here.
9097600	9098600	Why would anyone be surprised by that?
9098600	9103320	I haven't seen these because they're tweeted to me.
9103320	9104640	It's also depending on where you're looking.
9104640	9107400	I mean, if you're looking at mainstream gaming, then yeah.
9107400	9108400	Okay.
9108560	9111400	Here's the headline they're pulling that quote from or I mean, here's the quote they're pulling
9111400	9112880	the headline from.
9112880	9116700	So much progress has been made in the development cycle and the way games are developed.
9116700	9121360	This is according to industry button Dona Bailey.
9121360	9125520	It seems there hasn't been enough progress in the diversity of game designers and gender
9125520	9128800	equality for game designers.
9128800	9130760	Hmm.
9130760	9132760	Hmm.
9132760	9134120	That does make sense.
9134120	9135640	And I probably totally butchered the name.
9135640	9138880	It's probably Donna Bailey, but I said it wrong because it's spelled a little differently
9138880	9139880	than what I'm used to.
9139880	9141880	So Hmm.
9141880	9147600	Well, sadly, it's something you know, it's not like we haven't heard it before.
9147600	9153320	But I think the best way to help combat that a little bit is prove some of these analysts
9153320	9154320	wrong.
9154320	9158920	The people that say that, you know, the masses won't support a game with a strong female
9158920	9160140	lead and so forth.
9160140	9163700	It's important that and I'm not saying you have to support a game just because it has
9163700	9165040	a female lead.
9165480	9169840	Find the one that you like and really rally behind it and you know, gather support for
9169840	9171860	it and so forth and show these guys they're wrong.
9171860	9175360	I honestly think that we need to see more games that give you a choice.
9175360	9176360	Hmm.
9176360	9180120	Well, I made I made this comment during Bobby show and I think it's it's worth kind of exploring
9180120	9181120	a little bit.
9181120	9184140	I'll bring this up with you, Jamie, is that it's obviously part of a larger problem with
9184140	9189360	society and my whole thing is that let's take the dude bros who buy Xbox and I'm totally
9189360	9191520	stereotyping here guys bear with me.
9191520	9195320	Let's take the dude bros that buy their Xboxes because they're only interested in Madden
9195320	9199040	games and the basketball games and all the sports games that come out every year.
9199040	9203880	Well, you can't play as a woman in Madden, but that's not video games fault.
9203880	9204880	That's football.
9204880	9205880	Right.
9205880	9211300	So I mean, but what if the NFL were to have a woman come into the league someday?
9211300	9215720	You know, there's a woman that that is that that is a strong football player and you know,
9215720	9220280	gets on a team and now you can play as a woman in Madden that that right there would break
9220280	9221880	down a barrier.
9221880	9222880	It would.
9222880	9225200	But I don't see it happening just because of that.
9225200	9228080	I mean, we're in a total patriarchal society right now.
9228080	9229080	Not just right now.
9229080	9230640	We've always been.
9230640	9234220	And it's completely disgusting.
9234220	9242600	And I'm going to say one thing that there are there there are degrees of this physical
9242600	9245500	expectation that's put out for sports.
9245500	9251320	But I've seen some women's NBA players who could totally school guys.
9251320	9253220	I mean, I don't see why we don't have an integrated team.
9253220	9256800	You look in the four and you hate to go refer to the movie, but you remember a league of
9256800	9257800	their own.
9257800	9258800	Yeah, sure.
9258800	9260340	That should happen where all men were in war.
9260340	9262860	They had female baseball teams fully on.
9262860	9264820	And then the WNBA is a thing.
9264820	9265820	Well, yeah, it is.
9265820	9270500	But I mean, I'm saying that it's not like we haven't had a precedent for having women
9270500	9273900	in sports or even having integrated sports teams like that.
9273900	9279740	It's just that people have this notion that it shouldn't be done, that it can't be done,
9279740	9280900	that there's a big physical difference.
9280900	9282500	Say that you get China out.
9282500	9287420	OK, I hate to use it, you know, old wash up wrestler, but say you have China, who, yes,
9287420	9290480	true, she did lots and lots of steroids, but she's got the bulk.
9290480	9291660	She's got the strength for it.
9291660	9293100	She wrestles dudes.
9293100	9294100	Well, she did.
9294100	9296180	Isn't she in TNA now, I think?
9296180	9300660	Anyway, but I mean, you've got someone with that type of physical capability who can stand
9300660	9302100	up with the guys.
9302100	9309940	I think that if a person is physically capable of being a part of whatever that sport is,
9309940	9318740	whatever that event is, they should be allowed to be in it without having to deal with judgment
9318740	9322700	because of their gender or because of any other factor.
9322700	9324300	By the way, I did close the Skype line for now.
9324300	9326300	I didn't mean to get on this discussion, but it's a good one.
9326300	9329420	So I'm sorry to those who didn't get through on Skype, but feel free to email us.
9329420	9331860	Mailbag at orangesontrated.com.
9331860	9333580	Comment from ShadowNextGen.
9333580	9337880	Has Dark Sakura seen how the UFC has started highlighting women's MMA?
9337880	9341560	The next season of the Ultimate Fighter has two female coaches that will coach both men
9341560	9342560	and women.
9342560	9343900	Just curious about your thoughts.
9343900	9346100	I actually don't watch much UFC.
9346100	9351620	I tried watching when, oh God, what was his name that was in WWF?
9351620	9358080	He, God, I can't, cause he was just like the most boring dude ever, but he was amazing
9358080	9359080	to watch.
9359080	9362080	I watched from UFC and then I think went back to UFC.
9362080	9368080	And I also watched when Brock Lesnar went to UFC for a little while, dude, he was vicious.
9368080	9371020	But I didn't really, I haven't kept up with it.
9371020	9374140	Let me ask a real weird question that might be a little bit.
9374140	9376760	And I'm not talking about Brock Lesnar, I'm talking about somebody else.
9376760	9379600	Let me ask you a weird question that might be a little bit off the wall and it might
9379600	9384560	even be a little bit difficult, but it's honestly something I'm wondering and I want to ask
9384560	9385560	a girl.
9385560	9386560	Okay.
9386560	9387560	Sorry.
9387560	9388560	I'm doing both.
9389040	9390040	Pay attention to me.
9390040	9391040	Okay.
9391040	9392040	But yes, it was Ken Shamrock.
9392040	9396920	So female sports people that have broken through, one of them I think of that I think a lot
9396920	9400000	of us think of is Danica Patrick in NASCAR, right?
9400000	9405240	Well, Danica Patrick is playable in a video game, but it's Sonic's All-Stars Racing, which
9405240	9408640	is a great game, but it's kind of cutesy lala.
9408640	9412520	You know, she's sitting there aside a lot of, you know, Sonic and a lot of cartoony
9412520	9413520	people.
9413640	9420160	Does this do the image of the woman in sports favors or does it hurt because, well, Danica
9420160	9422960	Patrick's in a game, but it's cutesy lala land.
9422960	9425640	Well, it's definitely not hurting her wallet.
9425640	9427040	Okay.
9427040	9429780	Props for that, right?
9429780	9435480	I don't look at it so much as a hindrance, although it is, I think going back to a little
9435480	9437600	bit more on the stereotype.
9437600	9442920	I think it's definitely getting her some, getting her exposure apart from just being
9442920	9444640	pretty awesome on her own.
9444640	9451280	I mean, aren't we now seeing like more women in NASCAR too, like more female drivers?
9451280	9453160	She's certainly not the last.
9453160	9454160	I know.
9454160	9457000	Well, I think that we, there was one who, God, I don't remember.
9457000	9461200	There's one who has, I think an F1 going into F1 circuit.
9461200	9463160	Dan would know more about this than I do since he watches Top Gear.
9463160	9465920	Yeah, I don't even really watch NASCAR, but I know about this one.
9465920	9470120	There's also that lady who sometimes goes on Jeremy Clarkson's show.
9470120	9475000	She's one of the hosts of British Top Gear and she's a driver.
9475000	9476120	She's amazing too.
9476120	9477120	Yeah.
9477120	9479560	And Bobby points out too, Danica wasn't the first female driver either.
9479560	9480560	She wasn't the first.
9480560	9482360	I just said she wasn't the last.
9482360	9483360	She wouldn't be left.
9483360	9489560	But my problem with Danica Patrick is that she is having to rely on stereotypes to keep
9489560	9491360	her popularity up.
9491360	9496420	You know, that whole, well, you got to show a little boob or you got to, you know, be
9496420	9497900	this.
9498460	9500660	You can't be just a talented driver.
9500660	9503180	You have to be a sex symbol too.
9503180	9504180	That I hate.
9504180	9505380	I hate, I hate, I hate.
9505380	9509460	And some people really, like you've got Rasteel UT in chat who says Danica Patrick didn't
9509460	9512540	break through because of her racing, she broke through because she sexualizes herself in
9512540	9513540	GoDaddy commercials.
9513540	9518500	So you've got, you know, people that kind of resent the whole T and A, if you will.
9518500	9523620	Well, I mean, and I'm even going to go into another, cause one of my heroes, cause you
9523620	9529620	know I've been trying to work out a lot more, is a weightlifter named Samantha Wright.
9529620	9531940	And she is adorable.
9531940	9533720	She's probably my height.
9533720	9538260	And I think that if I kept working out like she, you know, clearly does, I would probably
9538260	9539940	have, would be about the same build.
9539940	9544940	So she's been, I've looked at her because we do have a lot of physical traits in common.
9544940	9551860	I think that her body type would be a good ideal for me as far as working out and health.
9551860	9556860	Now she's getting all this extra attention because she is so absolutely adorable.
9556860	9558820	She is pretty.
9558820	9559820	She's pretty hot.
9559820	9563820	I mean, I will say that, but there've been other female weightlifters who have been just
9563820	9567620	as, if not more talented, if not stronger than her.
9567620	9572020	And if you look at people who are actually physically strong, and I'm not talking about
9572020	9578260	the people who, you know, are those muscle competitions, cause they starve themselves
9578260	9579260	to nothing.
9579260	9582780	They are at their least healthy when they're at a show.
9582780	9585820	You look at the actual strong people, the people who do the strong man contest who are
9585820	9590120	pulling semis with their body weight, they're built like trunks.
9590120	9596280	And the women who participate in these, they're built like, you know, complete.
9596280	9600080	It's funny you bring up the bodybuilding because it brings to mind one of, I think a great
9600080	9604680	example of where there were very memorable men and women in this, and I'm using this
9604680	9608820	term very loosely with my quotey fingers, sport, American gladiators.
9608820	9609820	Yeah.
9609820	9612140	Cause there were memorable men and women on that show.
9612140	9615900	I mean, it was really like an equal playing field of sorts.
9615900	9619180	I can tell you one thing about that, and just because I learned how to recognize it, oddly
9619180	9624380	enough when I worked at GNC, because we would have so many roided guys come in, teenagers
9624380	9629140	take in that andro because of, what was that stupid baseball player?
9629140	9630500	Fuck whatever his name was.
9630500	9637060	So anyway, there's a way to tell when a woman is roided.
9637100	9641300	There were some women on that show who were very naturally strong.
9641300	9643860	They looked like a strong woman.
9643860	9648500	You want to see what a woman looks like without steroids, who has worked out, who has a small
9648500	9650500	frame, Linda Hamilton and Terminator 2.
9650500	9652300	But I mean, I'm serious.
9652300	9655460	And that honestly, to me, people are like, oh, she looks so bulky.
9655460	9657020	I thought that was really attractive.
9657020	9659620	I thought that looking strong was a very good thing.
9659620	9660620	Yeah.
9660620	9661620	Martin McGuire.
9661620	9662620	Thank you.
9662620	9664300	Not Barry Bonds.
9664300	9669460	But then you had the other ones like, and I'm going to go back to using China.
9669460	9674500	A woman cannot carry that type of muscle structure naturally without having a genetic predisposition
9674500	9675560	towards it.
9675560	9681680	And you can tell how many people are augmented who have a breast enhancement surgery on top
9681680	9689860	of having taken steroids because it will very much give more masculine traits to a woman
9689860	9694580	because you're basically taking Jose Canseco.
9694580	9699780	I'm just giggling because some of our chatters are like, you know, AgDef's all sports lounge
9699780	9700780	radio.
9700780	9702060	I didn't mean to get this on this big tangent.
9702060	9706600	My whole point with this before we just kind of went on and on and on with it.
9706600	9713460	My whole point was the whole female leads in video games and we don't have enough of
9713460	9715340	them.
9715340	9717480	It's not right that that's happening.
9717480	9721840	But my point I'm making with it is that I think it's a reflection of a much larger problem
9721840	9722840	with society.
9722840	9724880	It's not specific to video games.
9724880	9726480	I didn't mean to go off on the other.
9726480	9727480	But no, no, no.
9727480	9728560	I mean, I think we agree.
9728560	9729560	Yeah.
9729560	9735760	The whole point is that, and this I think is going really towards anything, is that
9735760	9741520	unless you have, even the really brilliant women out there, like just even in academia,
9741520	9745640	are not drawing the biggest attention, are not being taken seriously if they don't also
9745640	9750500	have a certain type of aesthetic, you know, appearance to them.
9750500	9756900	And it's really a very sad thing because you can have, pardon me for saying this, the dumpiest
9756900	9757900	looking guy ever.
9757900	9765520	You can have neck bearded, you know, guy shorter than me waddling in and be taken completely
9765520	9768520	seriously just because he's a guy.
9768520	9773720	But if you had a woman who maybe was, you know, maybe a little overweight, maybe, you
9773720	9780600	know, a little gray, a few wrinkles here and there, even if she had three times the degree
9780600	9784640	this guy did and had done all this fantastic biomedical research, on appearances alone
9784640	9788280	she wouldn't be taken seriously by the majority of people.
9788280	9792000	And that's where I think that we're getting into the really sad part.
9792000	9795640	And it doesn't, and like I said, it's not just affecting our gaming world.
9795640	9798500	It's affecting culture across the board.
9798500	9804640	And I get absolutely so sick of living in this society sometimes just because of it.
9804640	9806260	I did think of another positive though.
9806260	9810020	I did think of another place where I think it's done well, where we get male and female
9810020	9814700	sports heroes that we failed to mention because this is one of the few sporting events I really
9814700	9815820	truly enjoy watching.
9815820	9816820	The Olympics.
9816820	9817820	Yeah.
9817820	9823500	I think the Olympics are great because you get a lot of, you get a lot of strong athletes
9823500	9827120	no matter what, you know, from all these different types of sports and great stories and things.
9827120	9828120	That's a great thing.
9828120	9829120	So.
9829120	9832880	But, you know, even then I hear, um, what was it on NBC?
9832880	9837720	Well, you know, the coverage of the Olympics this past one was dreadful to save the values.
9837720	9840320	Yeah, but that's, that's, that's, that's another issue.
9840320	9844320	But what I'm saying is that you, you get side commentary from people.
9844320	9848440	Like I would go and look at, you know, YouTube videos of some of the events because I wasn't
9848440	9850040	keeping up with it all the time.
9850040	9854900	And I would see comments, oh, well, she looks like, you know, a dude or she looks this or
9854900	9855900	she looks that.
9855900	9861020	I would go into a Southern accent when I imitate a stupid person, but, but you still
9861020	9865900	get that as trying to ascribe aesthetics to what should have nothing to do with it.
9865900	9866900	Yeah.
9866900	9867900	Yeah.
9867900	9869900	Anyhow, tangent train, tangent lounge radio.
9869900	9871500	That was a good discussion though.
9871500	9872500	Sorry.
9872500	9873500	Oh.
9873500	9874500	And, uh, some of the chatters talking about tennis.
9874500	9875500	That is a really good example too.
9875500	9876500	Tennis.
9876500	9877500	Tennis has a lot of good people.
9877500	9878500	Mixed doubles is pretty fun actually.
9878500	9879500	Yeah.
9879500	9880500	Yeah.
9880500	9881500	Yeah.
9881500	9882500	So good, good job chatters.
9882500	9883500	All right.
9883500	9884500	Anyhow.
9884500	9885500	Rob turned on my ranty switch.
9886100	9887100	We'll be back with more details next week.
9887100	9890680	Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com, but for now we have got to wrap up the show and say
9890680	9891680	good night.
9891680	9894060	Um, Oh, I didn't get, I may not have got all the Twitter topics.
9894060	9895060	I'm sorry.
9895060	9896940	Let me quickly try to grab some of these.
9896940	9900980	Uh, as Joan Hunter, Matt tweeting, one of the most popular card games is being made
9900980	9905980	into a game for three 60 Steve Jackson's munchkin.
9905980	9906980	I don't know.
9906980	9911580	Apparently a link on ain't it cool news of all places.
9911580	9914120	That site's been going on forever too.
9914120	9916200	So huh.
9916200	9917200	Very interesting.
9917200	9918200	Yeah.
9918200	9921300	Munchkin, the video game.
9921300	9922300	That's cool.
9922300	9923300	That'd be very cool.
9923300	9924640	All right.
9924640	9927380	That is, I'm going to put the, I'm going to put the phone down and no more Twitter topics
9927380	9928380	for tonight.
9928380	9929380	Twitter.com slash OLR though.
9929380	9932940	If you want to send us stuff for the future, uh, I'll get off my feminist pedestal for
9932940	9933940	right now.
9933940	9934940	There's nothing wrong with it.
9934940	9938240	It was, it was a, it was a discussion that needed to be had.
9938240	9939240	All right.
9939240	9940660	Let's uh, let's wrap up though.
9940660	9941660	We're about done.
9941660	9943160	We're closing up shop for the night.
9943200	9946880	Loki, you've been quiet over there while dark soccer and I've been, yep, yep, yep, and uh,
9946880	9948800	did you have a good time tonight?
9948800	9949800	Yeah.
9949800	9950800	All right.
9950800	9951800	Good.
9951800	9952800	All right.
9952800	9953800	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight as we're on our way out?
9953800	9957000	Uh, I'm probably not going to play Minecraft every single day this week.
9957000	9959080	I get boring since there's no one else on there.
9959080	9960080	Play two days this week.
9960080	9961080	Two or three.
9961080	9962080	Yeah.
9962080	9963080	That sounds good.
9963080	9965600	Um, so I guess I'll play some defiance then.
9965600	9968080	We should set up some time to live stream Minecraft.
9968080	9969080	That's that's where everything's going.
9969080	9971400	Like all of a sudden all the VOD people just got really into light.
9971400	9972400	Like Bobby's doing it.
9972400	9973400	Jamie's doing it.
9973400	9974400	I'm doing it.
9974400	9975400	Yeah.
9975400	9976400	See, that's the things I didn't know.
9976400	9980000	Like, I don't really know like when to be on when no one else is on.
9980000	9984400	Well, I think it's inevitable that some of us are like, I think I was trying to broadcast
9984400	9985400	when Jamie was on.
9985400	9987980	It's just, I didn't know she was, you know, like it's inevitable.
9987980	9990420	Some of us are going to step on toes, but I think it's a general rule of thumb.
9990420	9995120	We just try not to be live when a live, when, excuse me, a premier vlog show is on.
9995120	9998360	So like Monday nights are usually really bad, but you know, as long as we're not stepping
9998360	10001400	on the toes of, of you do commentary, do you do not?
10001400	10002400	Do you not do commentary?
10002400	10003720	What do you, what are you guys doing?
10003720	10005540	I mean, like I do commentary.
10005540	10006760	She does commentary.
10006760	10010720	Uh, when I was watching Bobby, he had very little commentary, but they, they have had
10010720	10011720	some commentary.
10011720	10015760	But the problem is though, is once again, it's the whole talking in the same room with
10015760	10016760	my wife.
10016760	10020760	She gets annoyed even if I'm in like in the back bedroom or something like that, it would
10020760	10021760	just, I could try it.
10021760	10022760	I'm sure it'd be fine.
10022760	10028160	Um, so yeah, I'll hopefully start doing some of that and maybe sell more games this week.
10028160	10030440	One of those being injustice on three 60.
10030440	10031440	Wow.
10031440	10032440	I was, I want it.
10032440	10033440	Oh wait.
10033440	10035440	All my friends have it on PS three.
10035440	10036440	Son of a bitch.
10036440	10037440	Yeah.
10037440	10039440	Cause I got a copy for free and I don't want it.
10039440	10044560	Um, so cause I don't, I don't mind the fighting games, so it'll start at, it'll start at one
10044560	10046600	penny tomorrow.
10046600	10048480	Act F says we were doing commentary yesterday.
10048480	10050880	I missed your stream yesterday cause I was out drinking.
10050880	10054840	Grandpa was in town from San Francisco buying me doubles.
10054840	10058800	I got a little more drunk last night and I did on the 500th episode.
10058800	10061240	Sorry it wasn't broadcast, but it's for the best.
10061240	10065040	Um, my final thought tonight is thank you all for continuing to listen to orange lounge
10065040	10070480	radio and showing up for an episode like five Oh one right after 500, uh, whether it be
10070480	10073140	live, whether it be podcast, appreciate your support.
10073140	10077240	And I think I forgot to say this last week, which was really stupid, but I want to say
10077240	10080280	as always, thank you for checking out the show.
10080280	10083580	And if you like what you hear, remember we don't ask for a lot.
10083580	10085400	Just tell a friend or two about the show.
10085400	10087380	Help spread the word about orange laundry.
10087380	10090860	Tell a person who stopped listening five years ago, Hey, did you know those schmoes
10090860	10095120	are still on broadcasting and help bring people's back into the fold.
10095120	10097660	Help grow our family a little bit.
10097660	10098980	And last but not least, dark soccer.
10098980	10104460	Your final thought, um, down with the patriarchy.
10104460	10105460	There we go.
10105460	10106460	All right.
10106460	10110060	That does it for a this week here on orange lunch radio next week on the show.
10110060	10112540	I'm hoping we'll have some special guests here in studio.
10112540	10113820	Sounds like that's going to happen.
10113820	10114820	Very exciting.
10115140	10121180	Could be a long show next week and a pretty cool interview with, with two, two people.
10121180	10122880	I really enjoy next week.
10122880	10128640	So, uh, come, come here live, be here live to ask questions next week, six Pacific nine
