13944	19170	Tonight, April 21st, 2013, Nintendo announces a sequel to one of their classics.
19470	22554	Could a cancelled TV show be brought back for the new Xbox?
22914	25477	And an old, unreleased Sega console is unearthed.
31857	37099	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37179	43982	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 501 for this April the 21st of 2013.
44822	51125	It's our blue jeans episode, I guess you could say, coming off a high from last week in our 500th episode.
51205	51945	That's so 80s.
51985	53806	They don't really use that marketing anymore, do they?
54787	56747	Well, hi there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
57648	59589	I don't know if they use that marketing anymore.
59629	60429	I don't know if that's a thing.
61164	64825	I remember those commercials where they would sing the blues and it was the 501 blues.
65045	68686	I just remember the Saturday Night Live commercials that were bad idea jeans.
71407	74367	Do they have those classic clips on YouTube or did NBC pull them all?
74408	75628	I have no idea.
75648	77488	They had a bunch of them on Hulu.
77508	80809	You could watch a lot of the goth talks and fluffy talk.
81089	84270	That was back when all the funny people were on Saturday Night Live.
84790	87571	The funny people were on Saturday Night Live my senior year of high school.
88460	94439	or I mean to be fair before somebody snaps at us if you're not talking about the originals from 75
95356	124660	the what not ready for primetime players nodding my head at that because clearly they hello Belushi but I wasn't born yet so but I have come to appreciate after all this time Gilda Radner comic genius love that woman yeah and they were all great really but 1994 best year of SNL oh yeah without a doubt good stuff I'll say hello to Techmaster Loki hi did you ever watch Saturday Night Live back in the day uh
126372	127453	I've watched it off and on.
128154	135559	There was a time where there was a lot of people in there that I thought were funny and then I stopped watching after a while because I'm like, eh, they're not funny anymore.
135599	138081	And then I came back and they're like, oh, okay, you're funny again.
138141	140222	Now we're kind of at that, oh, they're not funny anymore.
140823	142464	Well, I don't really watch it anymore.
142504	145866	If really funny things happen, the internet blows up about it and there's clips on Hulu.
146226	152371	But I remember back in the day when I was in junior high school, that was the thing, was staying up late on Saturday night to watch Saturday Night Live and like,
152691	153972	Could you get all the way?
154012	156473	Could you stay up late enough to make it to the end of the show?
156633	157953	Or do you fall asleep after weekend update?
157973	158874	You had that much problem?
159454	159754	Yeah.
159934	165237	For me, my Friday night going into Saturday morning was a pot of... In junior high, yes, I had that problem.
165257	166677	Well, this was high school, okay?
166697	166937	Okay.
167257	172940	Was a pot of coffee, probably two, and it was Saturday Night Live followed by Headbangers Ball.
175083	176764	Followed by 120 Minutes.
177504	182385	So I would like listen to like Pantera and all that all night and then go into The Cure.
183266	183386	Ah.
183806	184846	And all of my prog rock.
185406	185666	Nice.
186046	188107	Oh, we're going to have a Kate Bush revival tonight.
189067	189647	Good times.
189687	189928	Yes.
190008	191288	Welcome to my senior year.
192068	196311	I remember there were some video games based off Saturday Night Live.
197112	198653	It was the Wayne's World game, which was awful.
198673	200294	Oh, the Wayne's World game was awful.
200314	201775	It was awful.
201815	203956	Bringing it back to video games, which the show is about.
204537	211101	With you guys live in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, live.vognetwork.com in our chat room if you want to join us here.
211121	212502	We do tape live every Sunday night.
212802	218427	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
218507	222751	So tying it back to games, Saturday Night Live games, there was a Blues Brothers game, I'm pretty sure, too.
223292	223472	Yes.
223512	227736	When they had that movie, when they had the Blues Brothers 2000 or whatever, there was that.
229017	231159	Were there other Saturday Night Live movies that might have been, or...
231639	234060	Now I'm just imagining what if there was an It's Pat game.
235780	236861	Did you ever see the movie, though?
236881	237561	It was weird.
237581	242603	I watched part of it, and I was like, the hell is this crap?
242783	245044	You know, the Wayne's World movies were great, but not a good game.
246384	251886	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, fifth dream in our chat says, Kier cross Pokemon.
252186	253066	Oh, Lord.
253166	255727	Padov song, Why Can't I Be Mew.
256607	257248	The Love Meowths.
259009	281683	uh Mr. My My's where the hell did you get this from only the is that was that on tumblr or some shit you need to post that somewhere where I can find it on tumblr and repost that because that sounds like the type of thing that came off tumblr I'm sorry but fifth dream said it best though later on um I wanted John Belushi samurai game
282472	283053	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
283873	284734	The Samurai Taylor.
284854	285375	That was it, right?
285795	287957	Well, there was also the Samurai Butcher and the Deli.
287997	288578	It was a thing.
288658	290479	There's always him in different things, yeah.
290679	297946	Yeah, but I also liked the one of Dana Carvey as... God, no, who was it he was being... Brian Adams, was it?
298126	299287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
319421	320022	I don't know.
320542	320982	Poor guy.
321823	322483	Alright, anyhow.
323384	326146	From old school SNL people to video games.
326686	328868	Real quick before we get into our gaming week, so I'll make this quick.
328888	333231	We had a big show last week, so this week might be a little easier.
333631	334171	Taking it easy.
334732	335953	They had an Austin Powers game.
336013	337874	That's sort of... Oh, they did!
337934	339815	That's sort of Saturday Night Live.
339855	340536	Thank you for looking that up.
341476	370559	I wanted to throw this out there real quick technically this was the other show that I do under the OLR Studios banner which is Horde House but I just wanted to give this a shout out because I thought this was great this morning was that multiple sclerosis walk and I've talked about it on this show a couple times that finally happened this morning and great turnout and great participation from some folks here locally and the internet and the WoW community and the gaming community in general raised over $1,600 if you can believe it for multiple sclerosis research
370999	371660	It was great.
371920	372520	It was awesome.
372580	376363	So now the goal next year is to outdo that.
376523	377784	We're going to push 2K next year.
377864	378845	So watch yourselves.
379185	380006	I'll do it next year.
380146	387371	But now I'm thinking, you know, I had so much fun doing that that we need to think of something OLR charity related like six months from now.
387431	390534	So it's like, you know, Horde House, OLR, Horde House.
390834	392755	But we're going to have to think of something to get involved with.
392835	399340	I want to do one of the autism charities that is not Autism Speaks because they're assholes.
400481	407955	controversy but whatever we'll find a charity that's near and dear to our causes we need to have a car wash
408550	410471	The OLR Car Wash The OLR Car Wash
437438	440582	I like meeting OLR fans, and sometimes I meet them in very random places.
440822	443045	Is that the Evan that just friended me on Facebook yesterday?
443385	443806	Probably.
443966	444727	Did he have a Liara pic?
444787	446109	Oh no, he has an MS pic now.
446169	450174	Yeah, he had a Liara pic, and now it's a... I don't know, but whoever that is, you're nice.
450594	451115	Yeah, he's nice.
451275	451856	Yes, you're very nice.
451876	452136	I met him.
452156	452977	You should have come out today.
452997	453558	You could have met him.
454058	454979	Now he's going to have to come back.
454999	456241	Well, I was busy sleeping.
459256	465479	Honestly, my goal was to get up this morning, but I think I still have, like, how much booze did I drink on my birthday?
465499	466419	A lot.
466940	467360	All of it.
467640	468080	Most of it.
469040	470301	So, thank you for the beer, by the way.
470321	470901	It was delicious.
471141	471522	You're welcome.
471542	472142	How was your birthday?
472202	473662	Happy late birthday to DarkSakura, by the way.
473742	474163	Thank you.
474543	477204	My birthday was gamey.
478365	481686	As in, you did not sing any Atlantis at my party, Rob.
481926	484990	I know, we only made a cameo and I didn't get around to singing Alanis, I'm sorry.
485010	486813	But Becky sang Alone for me.
487834	490358	And I ended up singing in the background, I think, because I was drunk.
490378	491219	I played keyboards for that.
491239	492000	You played keyboards.
492100	492521	It was good.
492861	497547	I downloaded the song just so that Becky would sing it, our resident, very good soprano.
498208	498369	Okay.
499009	502351	and I think I sang Band on the Run once.
504412	505553	Okay, this was the funniest part.
505593	506513	This happened after you left.
507594	513757	Julian, Becky's son, who's going to be six in like a week or so, he wanted me to sing.
514178	516339	Is that Dan's little cousin?
516359	517660	Dan's cousin's daughter.
517800	519621	That was Hannah's daughter, Sophia.
519761	520941	They were cute, being cute kids.
520961	521562	They were adorable.
521582	521742	Yeah.
522182	524763	But Julian was like, sing the Pink Robot song!
525564	527665	Which is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.
528105	533728	So, about a third through the song, Julian has the chorus memorized.
534428	540271	So he's singing along to the song with me, and it's like my second favorite song ever in the universe.
541052	546315	And we're sitting here swaying back and forth, and I've got a good three beers and a shot of vodka in me.
546355	547755	So we won't be able to get an encore now?
547935	548015	No.
549196	554498	and Julian is singing along with me and it is seriously the cutest thing that has ever happened in my entire life.
555178	563781	And then Midna decided to come out and be Little Miss Social, which I thought she was going to go hide in the back room, but no, she's like, oh my god, people pet me.
563941	564581	She hates Gary.
566144	567525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
592287	592607	Amanda?
593168	594409	No, she said she couldn't do it this night.
594449	597372	She had to do it later tonight because she has something Depeche Mode-y going on.
598033	600235	You know she does a lot of blogging for Depeche Mode.
600435	600856	That's awesome.
601236	602597	And she's going to like seven of their shows.
602958	603218	Wow.
603498	603699	Okay.
604099	607863	Well, she went to like a series of 12 shows in Germany last year.
608163	609024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
629935	631456	It's tequila that I don't hate.
631756	632676	It still kicked my ass.
632696	633997	I almost got you Patron.
635017	635777	You know what, Rob?
636198	638459	I'm going to tell you this for future reference.
639239	639719	No tequila.
640539	641560	But I thought you liked Patron.
641932	645015	I like Patron OK, but do you know how long it took me to drink the last bottle you got me?
645135	645496	That's true.
645776	648479	I finished it for my birthday last year and you got it for me when I turned 30.
648839	653825	Well, then I must have had a psychic moment because I was going to get it and then I was like, you know what, maybe I should just bring beer.
654645	659130	Rob brought me Guinness and Guinness is the best gift ever and I'm going to cook steak with it.
659250	659611	There you go.
660291	668374	So yeah, apparently the theme of my birthday was booze, which is pretty much the theme of every birthday every year, if I'm not at Disneyland.
669455	677658	And they busted out, George brought his Wii U, and that Injustice game, whatever that DC game is, you know how I feel about DC.
678978	685141	But it was actually kind of neat, except I thought that the character models were supremely bizarre.
685788	693932	I've heard a lot of good things about Injustice, but not on the Wii U. It's interesting to me that that was the platform you got exposed to it on, because I've heard the Wii U one is a little weak compared to the others.
694032	705597	Well, I had no basis of comparison, and I'm sitting here like... And I'm just copy-pasting internet hearsay, so... I'm catching the end of the game when, like, three of my friends are passed out from booze.
706178	709079	And I'm sitting there sobering, because you know how quickly that happens for me.
709799	710620	So I'm like...
711540	730815	watching this game and going what the hell is up with Wonder Woman's hair that's the only thing I could focus on was Wonder Woman's hair and that there were two Batmans when I was playing Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe I was a little fixated on how weird Wonder Woman was too and then like Joker looked bizarre but it was the right Batman it was Kevin Conroy oh nice
731289	733051	The Cure and Depeche Mode in one podcast.
733912	735713	It's like goth lounge radio.
754392	755193	No way.
755314	756215	We're progressive.
756255	756876	We're progressive.
757036	758158	I'm going to attack the darkness.
759139	759540	Let's see.
759660	761963	TigerClaw in our chat saying Injustice is pretty awesome.
762144	762885	I beat the story mode.
763165	766830	Well, you see, Gary was playing it, but I didn't care because I was watching it.
766991	767331	And so...
769600	777083	The big thing I remember is Amanda waking up in time to go, that's where Depeche Mode is in this game, and going back to sleep.
777423	781364	So now I remember that the end song was done by Depeche Mode, and it was actually a really neat song.
781664	793088	So yeah, I mean, it was mostly a lot of us hanging out in the kitchen, in the dining room, staring at the evil bell pepper pizza that, oh my god, it was so gross.
793488	794969	I had to pick all the bell peppers off because I'm allergic.
795770	800262	and then just drinking and then children running all over the place.
801145	803552	But cute children who don't piss me off, so it was good.
806169	806929	That was my birthday.
807549	812131	Well, I was going to ask about your gaming week, but you did a lot of it.
812191	812431	All right.
812711	813431	Well, then why not?
813471	814612	We'll just do our gaming weeks.
814852	819513	Well, Catastrophic Moggy gave me that Sam & Max game on Steam and Resonance.
820574	822814	And one other game, I forgot what it was, but I downloaded everything.
823534	828336	And I played some of the game I'm not supposed to talk about, Trademark.
829946	837590	Oh my god, I'm in love, I'm quitting well So, um, I, uh, what else did I play?
837650	854261	Oh yeah, I live streamed Mass Effect 2 And so what I'm gonna do since we don't have anybody on Thursday We don't have any shows on Thursday Is that I'm just gonna play through Mass Effect 2 on the stream So that people can hear me talk shit about the characters Which is, basically, well Shane was there for that
855581	863813	and basically all I do now when I play any of the Mass Effect games is that I talk back to the characters and I'm pretty rude to most of them.
863833	866917	It's sort of like, what is my Shepard's Inner Monologue?
866937	872365	So if people want to see a playthrough where they're not talking back, don't look at your channel because you're a talker.
873005	883013	Well, no, it's like, I'll play it mostly quiet, but sometimes somebody will say something, and it's like, because you know how I feel about a good portion of the writing, and I will just go, what?
883894	888197	Or go, no one cares what you have to say, Jacob, you know, and move on, and it's that type of commentary.
888558	888838	Okay.
889238	891340	I'm sort of MST3K-ing it as I play.
891540	891900	Fair enough.
892341	892521	Yeah.
893281	893541	I'm done.
893701	894962	It's the DarkSakura experience.
895142	897763	I've had pink berry and coffee, and I'm very hyper, so excuse me.
899504	900144	Couldn't tell.
900624	900925	All right.
902645	904946	Say hello as well to Loki, and how was your gaming week?
906327	906767	Let's see.
906847	910029	My gaming week, I played Defiance.
910429	914711	I played lots of Defiance, actually, and I'm up to 340 now.
914871	918132	See, I don't really have levels.
918212	920593	It's just like power levels.
920673	921794	I should maybe get this game.
922617	923298	It's pretty fun.
923318	926201	Yeah, they don't have, like I said, levels.
926282	928404	It's just like your power level, I guess.
928684	929465	Dragon Ball Z-ish.
930326	940298	Because you can do stuff... I mean, you do level up and your power goes up by so much, but you can do other things that raise your power level as well.
940399	941800	They have side stuff, like...
942621	943462	Very much like Borderlands.
943482	947487	I mean, the whole game is very similar to Borderlands as far as, you know, the whole style of the game.
948008	956619	And so you can do, like, these time-challenged, you know, okay, this is a rampage and you have to kill, you know, this many people in this amount of time.
956739	959222	And, you know, it's kind of its own instance thing.
959282	961205	And then there's also, like, races and stuff.
961585	970114	Which sucks because when I first attempted some of these races, I was actually doing pretty well on them, but there was some sort of lag in it.
970154	974779	I'd finish the race in the correct amount of time, but it would add two seconds to the clock every time.
975840	977863	It wasn't like I was missing a pylon or something like that.
977923	978323	It would just...
980407	981828	I don't know, it was weird.
982688	992312	Thankfully I did manage to hit silver on those, which is what you have to do to get your extra experience and levels and stuff.
993393	994153	But it's pretty fun.
994173	1005418	The other thing I don't really like about it, because I have some guns that I find that are really fun to use and stuff, but once you've maxed out the level on those guns, you stop gaining experience on that weapon class.
1005518	1008119	So I have to switch to a different saw now to...
1009560	1010521	Thank you for watching!
1025362	1026603	Thanks for watching!
1042675	1070102	and it's, I don't know, it's alright but I wish they had a little bit more variety to it maybe that will come out later on I did notice though, one of the things that they are doing is they have, I think I mentioned it last week they have specific challenges for the entire season and then specific challenges for each episode so as the episodes play on TV you get different stuff that I guess ties in with the episodes on TV like they have certain challenges that you have to do and stuff so I thought that was kind of cool
1071402	1073024	And that's it.
1101042	1101523	Diablo You're a loner
1116562	1117503	Well, it's not that.
1118043	1138894	I would be fine joining clans and talking with them and stuff, but my wife reads or plays on the computer, and she hates it when I talk over the headset while I'm playing games because I have my noise-canceling headphones on, and so I tend to be loud because I think I'm talking on normal volume, but I can't hear myself because I have a headset on or headphones on.
1141035	1142255	So yeah, it's been pretty fun.
1142295	1143096	So I've been playing that.
1143556	1157783	I played a little bit of more Modern Warfare 3 just because I've been having trouble finding... Well, I wanted to play Defiance during work, like on lunch, but our internet sucks where we're located right now.
1158183	1165107	One of the wireless hubs is over there that is not working, so I can't get internet on my Xbox 360 over there.
1166127	1182678	so I've been doing kind of like the survival modes in Modern Warfare 3 and that's been kind of fun and you know multiplayer deathmatch when we can get enough people over there and really I think that was it this week it's been pretty much just Defiance just playing that
1184119	1187382	Those MMO type of games will, you know, take up a bit of time.
1187582	1190905	Yeah, I'm having fun, even though it is very bland looking.
1191246	1196030	And, you know, it's not a whole lot of variety to it, but it's entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.
1196090	1197171	So, I don't know.
1197191	1197511	All right.
1198212	1200494	Well, my gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff.
1201175	1202816	I revisited a few old things.
1203217	1206960	I played World of Warcraft, of course, because I do that a lot.
1207020	1208762	Still doing PvP and having fun with it.
1210102	1237650	I did cancel Final Fantasy XI which I talked a little more about on Horde House but Shane was very upset but he's coping and I'm waiting for Civ V to go on sale so he can do his half of the bargain that'll be fun other old games I revisited random, super random, started playing Dota 2 because I hadn't really ever played it I've had the game viewer for a while but hadn't played it myself and the nice thing is in Dota 2 you can set up a bot game because I'm too afraid to play with real people because I have no idea what I'm doing and playing with the bots just reinforced that
1237930	1238890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1264158	1266420	There's one that's not very good.
1266600	1269783	It's the Guardians of Middle-Earth.
1271904	1272685	That's not very good.
1272825	1277349	It's not really a genre I play.
1278630	1280812	Otherwise, I played some more of Harmonite this week.
1281252	1286496	There is another new game I played this week, but you'll have to wait for my review at vognitwork.com on Tuesday.
1287697	1288998	Look for that on the site on Tuesday.
1289018	1289078	And...
1292381	1293502	I think that's really about it.
1294262	1299525	Since there's the Tuesday game and then WOW took up most of my time, honestly.
1299665	1301786	I was busy with out-of-town guests and so forth.
1302427	1305488	Are you at all interested in the Star Trek game coming out next week?
1305528	1307349	Yes, I would like to actually check that out.
1307569	1308110	Star Trek game.
1308650	1333267	Yeah, it's based in the movie universe, it kind of bridges the first two games together Yeah, I've read some stuff about it, I'm interested in it Some of the Star Trek games for home have been pretty bad though It's supposed to have been in development for at least three years Well, it was supposed to come out with the first movie, and it didn't So they held it back to make it better or whatever, so let's hope it worked Some of the Star Trek games have been real stinkers But I remember the Next Generation game on Super Nintendo was awesome
1333749	1341480	You know, I actually did like Star Trek Online until they went free-to-play and ruined the skill system.
1343523	1348310	I'd like to see, you know, a game that plays like that but on a single player, you know?
1348731	1348851	Mm-hmm.
1350875	1356861	I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Sile, I can never say that name.
1356901	1357641	I'm so sorry, guy.
1358342	1360564	Sile says, I can't MOBA to save my ass.
1362766	1363166	Let's see.
1363326	1366709	Queen Simia says, now I don't really get Dota 2.
1366809	1368311	How did they work that out legally?
1368931	1369832	Team Fortress Quake Mod
1388887	1414534	so they hired them to make Dota 2 obviously Blizzard was not a fan of that but they worked at they settled as these legal things usually go Blizzard is going to call their game Blizzard All-Stars now is is their MOBA game and League of Legends was never called anything in the same category but I believe someone else involved with the original Dota mod is with the League of Legends team and Riot Games but I mean Riot Games is doing very well with League of Legends so you know
1415881	1429949	There's plenty of room at the table for all of them, apparently PrinceBrightStar in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says If you want a free-to-play that isn't pay-to-win, PSO2 is a great game I'm dying to play PSO2, but you must be playing the Japanese version, right?
1429970	1431230	Because it's not out here yet, right?
1431310	1437574	No, I don't think they're remotely doing betas yet I signed up for the beta ages ago, but I don't think that we're even close to US beta
1437754	1440155	Yeah, I am thinking that's an E3 thing.
1440275	1441875	I'm thinking Sega's sitting on it until E3.
1441915	1442675	They have nothing.
1443056	1445156	There's literally nothing on the table for them coming out.
1445196	1451378	Well, I tell you what, there's nothing on the table for them coming out right now except for a couple of PC titles in June.
1451398	1453018	But there's nothing.
1453359	1455779	They have no announcements so far.
1455799	1456840	There's nothing pending.
1458720	1477414	uh i speaking of sega i did overlook an ios game i played a little bit this week sonic dash it's free on ios it is temple run sonic that is all it is with if you want your temple run with sonic rings there you go i actually find it to be i mean the pros of sonic dash is that oh sonic
1477814	1482096	Pretty, bright, vibrant compared to Temple Run, which is a little bit drab.
1482116	1485837	I mean, I love Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but it's kind of a drab palette in those games.
1486177	1488038	Sonic is very bright, vibrant.
1488078	1488919	Characters you know.
1489799	1492840	The ring sound is always refreshing to use that.
1493600	1499323	But then I do find it as a game and so forth to be underpolished compared to Temple Run.
1499683	1504345	Because Pitfall was really well done for a Temple Run ripoff.
1505285	1511647	It's very interesting to see all these established franchises kind of ripping on what's going on now that's popular.
1511927	1515248	It's really fascinating to me how that kind of comes full circle.
1515888	1518408	You actually indirectly reminded me of another game that I started.
1519409	1521109	Final Fantasy Dimensions for iOS.
1521489	1522709	Oh, that's a good one.
1522729	1524250	I only just started it, but it's cute.
1524350	1525070	It's very old school.
1526353	1527193	The control's interesting.
1527373	1528894	The good news about that one is that it's free.
1528974	1529134	Yes.
1529154	1531574	But if you like that one, that's very similar to what... I'll get five.
1531874	1532915	Yeah, what five looks like.
1532995	1533175	Yeah.
1533315	1535575	But five is... But I don't want to pay 17 bucks for it yet.
1535775	1535955	Yeah.
1536295	1536535	You know.
1537436	1544257	I didn't mention it in my week because I haven't gotten it yet, but my Ouya has shipped, apparently, via DHL.
1545057	1546018	So... I'm so sorry.
1546038	1547858	There is a chance that I may get it.
1547878	1548598	You should get it next year.
1548618	1549898	You'll get it eventually.
1550219	1551119	Maybe in time for Christmas.
1552419	1554541	Alright, anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.
1554581	1555121	I've said enough.
1555182	1556803	So, just quick housekeeping.
1557483	1557944	Not a lot.
1558004	1560886	We don't have any off shows coming up soon.
1561427	1563569	Maybe gone Memorial Day weekend, though.
1564129	1565190	I might be out of town.
1566651	1568353	But that's not until the end of May, so we'll keep you posted.
1568553	1569914	Well, if you go to Disneyland, take me.
1570214	1570694	No, I'm not going to.
1570714	1571634	I don't have a pass anymore.
1572215	1572455	So?
1572775	1577196	If I go to Disneyland, the next time I will probably go is in E3.
1577236	1580056	I still have to figure all that out, which, you know, I've been a bad boy.
1580076	1581577	We should do Discon.
1582057	1583317	There's two parts to registration.
1583337	1587818	I've done the first part, but not the second part, because I need to get off my ass and do it, but I keep getting distracted with all this other stuff.
1589139	1594560	But regardless of whether I go to E3 or not, Bobby's going to represent VOG, and...
1595180	1595881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1618539	1644169	Okay, so Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR Please follow us in our fan communities And next week on the show If all goes according to plan Which I don't see why it won't Two long time friends of mine Who I've been trying to get on the show for years Are finally going to be here next week And I'm really excited about it And one of them hosts another podcast That you all ought to be listening to And I'll tell you more about that next week We should all do lunch
1645590	1647412	We will try to work it out.
1647892	1648373	Twerk it.
1649294	1649594	Alright.
1651956	1653778	Let us get into the gaming news this week.
1653798	1656200	There was a lot of news out of Nintendo this week, right, Loki?
1656618	1658299	Yes, a lot of stuff.
1658319	1662861	They had their special Nintendo Direct thing that was all 3DS.
1663922	1665243	Mostly 3DS, I suppose.
1666743	1668144	3DS-centric, I guess.
1668825	1676048	And one of the big announcements there is, hey, we're doing a new 3DS game for the Legend of Zelda series on the 3DS.
1676449	1677049	And guess what?
1677809	1679370	It's a sequel to Link of the Past.
1679790	1682732	Yeah, we just took the best game we made and we made a sequel.
1684049	1686091	I was very, very happy.
1686211	1688853	And I'm most happy it's not another freaking remake.
1688974	1691236	That they're doing something different with it.
1692016	1695880	And I really would urge you guys, if you are a 3DS owner, check out the trailer.
1695900	1697741	Because the trailer, YouTube doesn't do it justice.
1698102	1699183	Like seeing it on 3DS is pretty rad.
1699503	1703346	Even better than the trailer, they actually have some leaked gameplay of it.
1703887	1704807	And check that out.
1704827	1708491	There's like, I think at least like five minutes of gameplay and it looks pretty awesome.
1709311	1729632	but it takes place in the same world as Link to the Past in fact actually they had there's some people on NeoGAF I think that actually took some of the screenshots from the video and lined it up with like some of the stuff that's in game and yes it does there are a few minor changes but yes it's the map is pretty much the same or at least it appears that's gonna be what happened
1731453	1732173	So that's pretty awesome.
1732413	1733874	And then a whole lot of other stuff.
1734674	1737715	So first off, you've got Pikmin 3.
1737875	1740476	We were wondering when the hell this was supposed to come out.
1740496	1744378	It was supposed to be a near launch window title for the...
1746198	1749960	I'm still not sure if it's launch window because it is now August 4th.
1751181	1754082	Game & Warrior now coming out June 23rd.
1756683	1765307	There's going to be a brand new system update for the Wii U, I guess, pretty soon this coming week.
1765727	1769729	And it's supposed to add some stuff that they were teasing about before on some of the other Nintendo Directs.
1770389	1799004	one of those being the ability to install updates while playing other games so you're going to be able to install software and updates and that kind of stuff it's also improved load times from starting new apps up to switching between stuff and returning back to the Wii U menu also if you hold the B button when you start the system up it'll go into Wii mode in case you want to play a Wii game you don't have to take all those extra steps I guess so you can play with your Wii easier
1799941	1805155	Yes, and you'll be able to transfer data between USB drives and some other stuff.
1805516	1806419	So, that's kind of neat.
1809045	1809766	Let's see.
1810106	1821319	Also, to kind of coincide with the whole Legend of Zelda announcement, they're going to be putting up Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on the 3DS eShop.
1821519	1822400	That's May 30th.
1825564	1828267	Wii U Virtual Console is coming out next week as well.
1828868	1829548	They're going to be...
1831169	1833210	Which game are they launching with here?
1835151	1848277	It doesn't say what the brand new game is, but basically the launch lineup, Excitebike, Super Mario World, Mario Bros., Punch-Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, F-Zero, and GBA games and Nintendo 64 games planned later on.
1850378	1850878	Let's see.
1853807	1855948	New Yoshi Island game coming to the 3DS.
1856669	1862712	I'm not sure if that's going to tie in with that new Yoshi Yarn type game that they have coming out later on.
1863352	1867034	But they showed a little bit of footage of it and it looks just like Yoshi Island.
1867915	1871317	Mario and Donkey Kong Minis on the move coming to the eShop on May 9th.
1873018	1876961	New Super Luigi U DLC coming to New Super Mario Bros.
1877602	1878963	U later in the summer.
1879823	1882425	New Mario Party is supposed to be coming out this fall.
1884147	1891292	Mario and Luigi Dream Team coming out in Europe July 12th and North America August 11th.
1892745	1893386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1911505	1914127	I'm changing between, you know, the different softwares.
1914307	1915848	Yeah, because it's super slow right now.
1915868	1917089	Yeah, it's not that great right now.
1917609	1919350	Some other little features you might not have known about.
1919370	1927475	I mean, that's the one everybody's waiting for, but also you're going to be able to transfer data between the USB drives, and you can install background downloaded software while playing other games.
1927555	1928896	I didn't realize you couldn't do that now.
1929416	1935160	I thought you could do, like, remember, because remember the system updates, you can kind of install those while you're playing...
1935760	1939362	Well, regardless, that whole thing is going to get better, so that's good.
1940202	1949287	And the Wii U will continue to download and install software while the system is powered down, which you don't have to go set yourself on that screen and wait for it to do it.
1949307	1953449	I mean, these are all things that seem very logical in this day and age, so thankfully they're catching up there.
1953889	1959692	You can also, this is pretty cool, hold the B button at the startup to go right into the Wii mode.
1960012	1967496	So if you just got Pandora's Tower or something and you're playing it on your Wii U, it's a great way for you to just bypass all the crap and go right into the Wii if you want.
1967516	1972438	It's stupid that you just put in a Wii game into your system and have it just boot up.
1972678	1974739	No, it has to go into the Wii shell.
1975240	1977060	That's so dumb.
1977120	1982323	No, I think the way the console's built is that you have a Wii in there to do all that.
1982443	1983845	But that's still really dumb.
1985106	1991653	It's weird, but if they're using different graphics processors and all that, then I get it.
1992073	1994936	It's weird, but it might just not be technically possible.
1995797	2000482	I think Loki touched on this a little bit, talking about some of those virtual console releases, but just to confirm...
2001022	2003425	Virtual Console happens on Wii U next week.
2004225	2011773	Launch lineup, Excitebike, Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch-Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, and F-Zero.
2011833	2014355	Some of those games have already come out through the 30 Cent program.
2014896	2018960	I know F-Zero is one of those, Balloon Fight, Punch-Out.
2019340	2020582	Some of these haven't happened yet, though.
2020642	2023625	Super Mario World isn't one of them, and I don't think it's in the lineup.
2024405	2026086	I think... Is the next game Super Metroid?
2026626	2028087	No, the next game is like a Yoshi game, I think.
2028107	2029267	I was going to say Super Mario World.
2029287	2030488	That's like 30 cents.
2030528	2031008	Hell yeah.
2031248	2035650	But GBA games are part of this, which is cool because that wasn't on Wii.
2035770	2036891	You didn't have GBA games on Wii.
2036911	2038452	You had them on DS, 3DS.
2039232	2039452	Yeah.
2039472	2039893	But not we.
2040474	2044159	And I think you only got advanced games through the Ambassador Program.
2044380	2045561	Have they done advanced games?
2045582	2046263	I don't even know.
2046323	2047004	I don't think they have.
2047424	2049587	So this could be interesting, what'll happen there.
2049808	2050829	Don't know why they wouldn't.
2051350	2052452	Yeah.
2052892	2055216	Nintendo 64 games coming out in the future as well.
2055953	2064324	Which were on the Wii, so, you know, for most people it'll be an upgrade, I suppose And then, DarkSakura, I think you have a Whopper bin of news for us too, right?
2064504	2073475	Yes, I do, if Bobby will stop spoiling Seriously, stop telling about the future You know what happens, you watch Doctor Who, don't you?
2073736	2073956	Anyway
2075359	2081424	Earthbound is going to be coming out in North America and Europe as in Mother 2, as it was in Japan.
2082145	2086988	It will be on the Wii U Virtual Console towards the end of the year.
2087989	2097077	And I don't see that there is an actual release date on it yet, but I'm expecting them to have a date out before E3.
2097937	2101680	I mean, unless they're saving that date for E3 or whatever the hell they're doing.
2101760	2103822	It'll probably be a bullet point, E3, that's about it.
2103922	2107388	Well, that could be one of those things where it's like, oh yeah, remember how we said EarthBound was coming out?
2107468	2108770	Go get it, it's up now, right now.
2108810	2109932	No, why don't we get Mother 3?
2111154	2117926	Well, you know the fan translators offered to give it to Nintendo for free, but legally I don't think that can happen.
2120043	2120604	Why not?
2120624	2121644	Why if they agree to it?
2121664	2133395	I don't see what... I think it's just weird territory because they had to do things that Nintendo doesn't endorse per the terms of license in order to mod the game.
2133835	2138599	Like dumping a cartridge to your computer is not something you're supposed to do to begin with.
2138659	2142142	It's not in your user agreement that is that fine print in the manual.
2142222	2146486	So I think if Nintendo were to legally acknowledge that, it puts them in a really weird place.
2147349	2151093	Yeah, but people do a lot of stuff they're not supposed to do all the time.
2151353	2154256	I know, right?
2155898	2159882	I think that they would find a way around it if they wanted to find a way around it.
2160283	2161163	It's their property.
2161404	2162305	They can give the permission.
2162805	2164387	But, leaving it there.
2165448	2168091	But I'm excited even though I already have it.
2171449	2183529	Yeah, I'm excited about Earthbound 2 just because it's a much, you know, for those of us that don't have a cartridge lying around, which I don't anymore, now I'm kicking myself for selling this shit years ago, but it's a nice way to pick it up again.
2184584	2186145	And the Wii U Virtual Console is pretty good.
2188547	2189627	They pulled it off very well.
2189688	2193650	The sound sounds great out of the four speakers between your TV and the gamepad.
2193670	2196732	I need to come over and actually just sit and play the Wii U for a while.
2197532	2204677	But we're probably holding out for the PS4 ourselves.
2206178	2207379	So far, that's where we're landing at home.
2208980	2209080	Okay.
2209100	2209220	Okay.
2211474	2213935	All right, well, so we're curious.
2213975	2215596	There was a lot of Nintendo news.
2216136	2221559	I'm curious in here in the room, what were you guys most jazzed about from the Nintendo Direct?
2221579	2228762	Well, first off, I should take a big step back because, Loki, you're the biggest critic of Nintendo on this show.
2228842	2231583	Were you moved at all by this Nintendo Direct?
2231603	2232384	Or are you like, meh?
2233024	2234725	I'm the biggest critic of everybody.
2235305	2236045	Okay, fair enough.
2236105	2237246	Yeah.
2239083	2242427	None of the news... I mean, once again, I'm not going to go buy a system.
2242587	2246612	I'm not going to go get a 3DS again just for Legend of Zelda.
2247032	2249215	I think it's cool that they're doing that game.
2249595	2252899	A lot of the other announcements I couldn't really care about.
2253019	2254200	I mean, like Yoshi's Island.
2254441	2255182	Eh, whatever.
2255742	2256223	It was cool.
2257124	2258085	Do a sequel, I guess.
2258985	2266807	I'm just... I mean, at the same time, I like that they're doing sequels to their old titles, but I kind of wish there was something new.
2267147	2270808	Like, just something new from Nintendo.
2270928	2274268	Because a lot of it seems to be going back to, like, rehashes of old things.
2274808	2278569	And I know everybody loves nostalgia, but I just want something new.
2278629	2283890	Like a brand new property from Nintendo that doesn't resemble Wii Sports.
2283970	2285511	It doesn't resemble Nintendo Land.
2285551	2285951	It's not a...
2286691	2289633	2D Mario remake or something like that.
2289653	2291675	Mario Galaxy was a good example of something.
2292015	2292816	It's sort of like Mario 64.
2293036	2296078	Yeah, but it was so different.
2296178	2297499	Exactly.
2297719	2299060	It's Mario, but it's really not.
2299300	2303783	Yeah, I want something like that.
2304244	2307666	Even if they put Mario or Link's face on it, you're okay.
2307706	2308787	You just want some new ideas.
2308927	2311248	Yes, I just want something new.
2311449	2312189	I mean, because a lot of...
2313730	2325247	and don't don't get me wrong I think that the whole you know new Zelda game is pretty awesome but I mean I guess it is a little bit different it's a different approach to it in the same world and stuff and it's all 3D now but
2327208	2327528	I don't know.
2327548	2329350	I just kind of want something new from them, I guess.
2329690	2330611	Something innovative.
2331812	2334575	Ross Steel UT in our chatroom says, I wasn't really jazzed about anything.
2334735	2335976	The 3DS is doing fine.
2336496	2338939	We need Wii U news and not fucking Earthbound.
2341060	2344263	I think there's a reason this is happening now and not at E3.
2344303	2347886	Because a lot of people are saying, shouldn't they have announced the link to the past sequel at E3?
2348747	2354072	That seems very weird that they would just on a random day of the week for no reason announce a Zelda sequel.
2354152	2355193	You know, it's a pretty big deal.
2356054	2358536	I'm hoping that means they are clearing space.
2358556	2360158	Well, that's what they did last time.
2360178	2363121	Remember, they had three Nintendo Directs and their stupid press conference.
2363161	2363381	Yeah.
2363741	2367362	Well, also keep in mind, Nintendo can only really speak to a lot of Nintendo stuff.
2367382	2369582	They don't always get into third-party stuff.
2369622	2370562	They do, obviously.
2370602	2381004	They do sometimes, but sometimes a lot more third-party information comes out at E3, which, considering the Wii U could really use a boost from third parties, that would be a great thing.
2381545	2386225	Do you think maybe Bayonetta 2, this E3, do you think they've been able to push it out this fast, or maybe not?
2386345	2386385	No.
2386425	2387346	You don't think so?
2387366	2388806	It needs to be on stuff other than the Wii U.
2389706	2390026	It won't.
2390406	2391607	I know, but it needs to be.
2391687	2392027	It won't.
2393808	2394428	Never say never.
2394768	2395688	Yeah, never say never.
2395748	2396289	Never say never.
2396309	2396849	And here's why.
2397329	2397709	Here's why.
2397829	2399410	Because... Don't stop believing.
2400270	2406652	Tecmo Koei developed Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge for the Wii U. It was published by Nintendo.
2407252	2409973	Came out in other systems later on, published by Tecmo Koei.
2410314	2413475	They could easily, if it flops, and I'm sure...
2415256	2419479	I'd hope that they have something in there that says, okay, this game flops so we can put it on other systems.
2420239	2421160	I think it'll come out later.
2421180	2423181	I think it's going to be like a time delay.
2423221	2426043	Like they're going to have a window or something and then it'll come out later on.
2426364	2428205	All five of you who bought a Wii U, here.
2428425	2428885	A month later.
2428905	2429666	Here, everybody else.
2429986	2431988	I kind of think they're going to price drop at E3.
2432408	2434429	I think that's just the inevitable thing that's going to happen.
2434449	2438212	I think they might sneak out the Wii backwards compatibility if my hunch is correct.
2438252	2439913	I don't think a price drop is going to help.
2440113	2441975	I mean, it'll help, but it's not going to be enough.
2441995	2442235	Yeah.
2442475	2446418	because the excuses right now, I think there's nothing I can say on it.
2446798	2449440	All they have to do is exactly what they did with the 3DS.
2449600	2456445	If they do exactly what they did with the 3DS at this E3, if Reggie comes out on stage and says, you want some fucking games?
2456726	2457786	Here's some fucking games.
2458087	2459508	And then bam, bam, bam.
2460128	2461189	It's going to fix everything.
2461969	2470336	It's easy to sit here now and say no, but when he comes out and says... If he goes F-Zero is fucking happening on the Wii U, like...
2471403	2471743	Done.
2472284	2473205	Nintendo is saved.
2473265	2473625	Hurrah.
2473705	2475827	I don't think they're going to have time because, okay.
2476648	2478730	But they pulled Mario Kart 7 out of thin air.
2478750	2480591	They pulled the, what was the other game that came out?
2480611	2482933	Well, let's just say it was being worked on behind the scenes.
2482953	2483434	Exactly.
2483474	2485536	They could still be working on stuff that we don't know about.
2485556	2488018	There's such things as NDAs and people who don't break them.
2488418	2495284	I just think, though, that, but right now we know that there's no EA, for example, there's no EA Sports titles for the Wii U at all.
2495685	2495965	Nothing.
2496525	2498147	No Madden, no FIFA, nothing.
2498967	2499367	That's it.
2499727	2502308	And so far, no NBA 2K either.
2502948	2507289	So, I mean, I understand if you're thinking about purchasing a new system.
2507469	2512430	And let's say a lot of mainstream people that buy games do play Madden or do play a sports title.
2512850	2513890	You know, not everybody.
2514170	2514871	No, I don't.
2514991	2516291	But a lot of people do.
2516751	2518011	And that's kind of disappointing.
2519272	2525313	It kind of makes you think, do I really want to get a Wii U or do I want to pick up another system that's going to actually have the games I want on it?
2526153	2532839	and it's also a photo of lack of confidence from these publishers and EA being a big publisher, I don't know.
2533419	2544248	Activision's supporting them with garbage right now but they're supporting the Wii U. They have their Walking Dead game which is absolute shit and then followed by the...
2546410	2551331	The Fast and the Furious Showdown, which I'm sure is going to be awesome and not total shit.
2553312	2555833	Call of Duty will be coming out, I'm sure.
2556773	2557213	Let's see.
2557934	2560255	Some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2560295	2562816	Strudels89 says, Rob's such the optimist.
2563356	2564596	Well, maybe a little bit.
2564696	2569938	I just don't think they're going to roll over and let all their critics get the best of them.
2570078	2571359	They didn't do it with the 3DS.
2571399	2571799	Again, I'm just...
2572700	2576884	I understand that, but what is... Let me say this too, because this is an important follow-up comment.
2576924	2580929	Flaco Jones says, another third place finish like the GameCube, but they'll be fine.
2581369	2591981	And I could see that happening, that maybe the Wii U is not going to shatter whatever this next Xbox, although if some of these rumors about the next Xbox come to play, I don't know if Nintendo would necessarily be third.
2592521	2595243	But Sony's looking pretty good right now out of them all.
2595683	2603407	So, you know, even if they did finish third, and another comment, WhatUpG says Nintendo will be fine because their handheld is doing well.
2603447	2603767	Correct.
2604248	2610951	And it does put Nintendo in an interesting position where if they do decide to just, you know, okay, Wii U went all Virtual Boy, we're going to write it off.
2611472	2615674	They might be in an interesting position where they could do another console and
2615934	2624179	After whatever Microsoft and Sony does, it's going to put them in a very interesting position if they fix their mistakes.
2624560	2627722	The history has shown they are not going to fix their mistakes.
2628102	2632305	How long has it taken them to understand how to do online?
2632665	2635587	Something that's been around for a decade now.
2635907	2637007	I'm not going to disagree with you there.
2637288	2640270	If they can't get online right, they're doomed.
2641210	2642471	I'm not going to disagree with you there.
2643177	2646440	I still think that no matter what, Nintendo's going to be fine.
2646961	2648402	They're making plenty of money with their handhelds.
2649143	2655008	I mean, basically, they could just put out a console for shits and say, hey, look, we have a console.
2655068	2658732	It's called the LOL U. LOL at you for buying it.
2658752	2659993	LOL at you for buying it.
2660073	2660613	I know, right?
2660834	2661034	Yeah.
2661434	2681719	but either way I mean it's and I've seen people draw comparisons between them and Sega with the Dreamcast which I actually think that that's completely not even close to the same part because what Sega was dealing with they were coming off the fallout of the Saturn and the very very awful marketing in the US they also didn't have oodles of money in the bank like Nintendo does exactly
2682700	2684441	Don't forget all that Wii money.
2684701	2686443	They made a lot of money on the Wii.
2686523	2690907	The Wii turned a nice little profit because it wasn't the most powerful piece of hardware in the world.
2691107	2692168	That money's in the bank.
2692508	2694811	Yeah.
2695691	2704379	I'll admit, I was standing in line for my Wii at Target, but we also bribed our way into the line with Donuts and Coffee, me and Kristen.
2705180	2707962	But at the same time, it's...
2708803	2736327	Nintendo is coming off a series of successes of near failures that they've turned around they don't have that problem with the marketing that Sega came out of I don't really see where the comparison really is except that okay so yeah white systems don't really do very well in the US but look at the Wii I don't know what that was because in Japan it was the Saturn was a silver box and over here it was a black box and it's just marketing is weird stuff
2737188	2751840	Alright, well, before we move on to our next story, since this Nintendo Direct was one of the biggest news stories in gaming this week, we do want to take this opportunity to use our new feature on the website and go to a live listener poll.
2753462	2755363	Let's go to the live listener poll at VOGnetwork.com.
2757299	2762862	If you are at live.vognetwork.com right now, you can participate in our live poll.
2763382	2767024	What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?
2767525	2768225	Here are the answers.
2768365	2774729	OMG Earthbound, OMG Zelda Link to the Past sequel, OMG Yoshi's Island,
2775929	2803911	OMG Super Luigi U or meh Nintendo vote now live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate in the poll live.vognetwork.com you'll see it right underneath the chat box I agree with Bob Coffee Sega, he said Sega was dealing with ship management and no Sega Tatsunoshiro we would have been okay I don't know if anyone other than like three of us knows about Sega Tatsunoshiro was the mascot of the Saturn in Japan
2804651	2809972	This guy with floofy hair wearing a gi going around punching the hell out of everything.
2810393	2814154	And they did a commercial for him for the Dreamcast.
2815034	2818095	And there was even a Segata Sanshiro game that came out on Saturn.
2819435	2822656	If we had Segata Sanshiro, still, the Dreamcast would have lived.
2824887	2827368	Interesting watching the live results of our poll coming in right now.
2827528	2830109	Mad Nintendo is winning with half the vote right now.
2830790	2831370	Interesting.
2832210	2833231	Watch this as it develops.
2833291	2842655	Live.vognetwork.com You do have to be registered at VOG Network in order to be able to vote in the poll because, you know, there might be some little incentives on the site tied to participating.
2842775	2843595	So you should check that out.
2845036	2845276	Okay.
2845756	2849818	Meanwhile, why don't we move on with more news besides just what's going on with Nintendo, right, Loki?
2849838	2850538	Yeah.
2850678	2861648	Yes, so there was a series that was on TV that I was really hopeful for and then the writer's strike happened and the writing went downhill.
2862368	2863449	And that was Heroes.
2863569	2868293	Well, the rumor is that Microsoft wants to bring back Heroes, reboot the whole series.
2868734	2872177	Obviously with new people because a lot of the cast has moved on to other things.
2872857	2875139	They kind of did this with heroes on the web.
2875179	2884184	They had their webisodes or something like that with some different hero characters that the fans designed, which were crap.
2887926	2892709	I think it'd be kind of cool to see a new series kick off.
2893169	2898332	Hopefully it just didn't fall into what I like to call the Matrix problem, where you give...
2899032	2908460	A character like Neo, way too much power, too fast, and you're like, fuck, how do I deal with this the next movie or next season?
2910382	2910642	Crap.
2910942	2913885	You just need to ramp it up slowly.
2914065	2922232	But apparently they're saying that this is going to be part of the whole TV focus and might be some of their original Xbox programming.
2922252	2934223	And I can see this happening, especially since you have Netflix and Amazon doing reboots and brand new exclusive series for those content streamers.
2934283	2937126	So it makes sense that they could do that.
2937446	2943594	This certainly leads to the other interesting discussion that goes with this of what other series could be revived?
2943774	2946738	Because I'm sure a lot of us go, Firefly?
2946778	2947840	Can we have Firefly?
2947960	2948861	Can we have more Firefly?
2948941	2951565	You know that's not going to happen because then Joss is just going to kill everybody else.
2951725	2952826	Yeah, and Fox would never...
2953527	2956628	So Fox will just not let it happen just to spite.
2957328	2958808	Hey, I think I saw that horse twitch.
2958928	2961189	I'm going to kick it in its face again.
2961829	2963870	But it's very interesting.
2964130	2967510	And we'll get into this a little more with our Fugo question of the week later on.
2967530	2971011	But it's very interesting with all these content delivery services coming up with their own programming.
2971271	2973592	You see Netflix doing it too with Arrested Development.
2973932	2974852	They brought Back from the Dead.
2976893	2978233	We've got Whose Line coming back.
2978635	2980136	Yeah, but that's a CW show, isn't it?
2980156	2984120	Yeah, but still, I'm saying, you know, there are these series of revivals going on.
2984240	2992126	Technically, Whose Line is a game show, so it follows, I mean, I know it's kind of not, but I think it actually follows the rules of a game show when it comes to TV.
2992567	2996390	So it's a weird, you know, game shows come and go all the time.
2996490	3001835	I am very disappointed that they didn't try to go all meta with, you know, Whose Line and have Bob Barker host it.
3002615	3003436	That would have been hilarious.
3003656	3005599	Oh, did she just have him guest host one episode?
3005659	3006280	You know what, though?
3006440	3007622	Aisha Tyler's a great choice.
3007822	3008523	And she is.
3008543	3009324	And she's one of us.
3009644	3011046	She's a total gamer, you know.
3011447	3012208	And she's funny.
3012308	3012909	She's really funny.
3012989	3014371	So I'm looking forward to seeing...
3014821	3017723	As long as I get my Greg Proops on there from time to time, I'll be happy.
3017843	3020164	Drew Carey was a great host, but he's got another gig.
3020825	3023847	Which is weird, because Aisha Tyler does that talk show.
3024087	3028369	They tape a whole three months worth of shows in a day.
3030711	3033413	They figure it out.
3033673	3034653	What else do I want to say with this?
3037321	3040862	Do we talk about what kind of potential extra cost could be?
3040962	3044224	If they're going to save a show like Heroes, that's not going to come for free, right?
3044604	3047245	Would that be Xbox Gold?
3047625	3049846	Would maybe I get that as an Xbox Gold member?
3050026	3053067	Or maybe this is part of a new Xbox Platinum or something?
3053948	3055168	Or what happens?
3055188	3056169	I don't think they'll charge any...
3057589	3058310	I forgot.
3058330	3060513	Xbox Platinum was that crappy little card that did nothing.
3061575	3064919	Let's say they ignored it like I did and did it again.
3065460	3068224	I don't think that they would do that per se.
3068304	3074252	I think that they could do more advertising, but who's to say that they're not going to be fucking greedy and still want more money on top of it?
3075493	3090264	Although, it's going to be a hard sell if, like, say, the PlayStation 4 still has the same type of scheme where it's, you know, regular PlayStation, you get online multiplayer, and plus you get, you know, extra stuff.
3091205	3095107	Because, I gotta be honest, I mean, I do a lot of gaming on the 360, but...
3097569	3102132	I am jealous of the deal that you get with PlayStation Plus.
3102192	3105614	I mean, it's pretty nice with that instant game collection stuff.
3106495	3111598	But unfortunately, a lot of my friends are on Xbox Live.
3113560	3113920	All right.
3114200	3119063	Well, before we get into the next story, I want to go to the results of the live poll that we took earlier.
3119243	3121825	What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?
3121845	3126108	I got to say, I'm a little surprised with these answers, but this is why we do this, because sometimes we learn things.
3126528	3129871	The winner of the poll, Meh Nintendo, 50% of the vote.
3131412	3132113	50% don't care.
3132734	3133214	Interesting.
3133534	3143083	And I was kind of looking in the chat room, and just so you know, among the non-Meh crowd, 25% of the vote for the Zelda Link to the Past sequel, 18.75% for Earthbound, and 6.25% for Super Luigi U.
3148167	3149728	So, interesting.
3150668	3151949	Is that 6% Ranma?
3152929	3153450	It could be.
3153530	3153950	It could be.
3154030	3154430	I don't know.
3154470	3157472	I could look at the results, but I'm not going to look at who voted for what.
3158232	3166256	I was looking at chat to try to figure out why people are voting the way they are, and it seems like a lot of people are just like, you know...
3167256	3173738	I haven't been convinced that I need to pick up these Nintendo consoles, so this news doesn't really get me excited.
3173818	3174779	Here's my thing.
3174859	3182121	I understand that they have certain strategy with announcing titles because they don't know development cycles and how far... They don't want to announce a title...
3182821	3184583	Thanks for watching!
3199173	3204116	Sure, you can wait until E3 and do it and make a little bit of a splash and stuff like that.
3204196	3208639	But I would think it would be in your best interest to help your console now instead of later.
3208799	3212741	Because the more time you wait, the worse it's going to get for you.
3213122	3217724	Because say you have someone that's waiting for a Wii U. I really want a good title to come out.
3217744	3218965	And then it's just like nothing.
3219225	3220766	You don't hear about anything for a long time.
3220786	3221447	You're like, you know what?
3221487	3223448	I'm just going to get an Xbox.
3223668	3224528	Money's already spent.
3224789	3225709	And oh, crap.
3225749	3227030	They announced a good title already.
3228650	3240655	What also surprised me about some of the reaction I'm seeing in the chat room as to why people voted that way is that a big reason why they do these Nintendo Directs is to get out there on the internet why you should own a 3DS because you don't already.
3241175	3244256	And a Zelda Link to the Past sequel didn't sell that for people yet?
3244736	3252842	I mean, granted, to be fair, I totally know that people are like, I'm not going to buy a freaking system based off a two-minute trailer.
3253523	3255624	Show me the game, and then we'll see.
3255945	3256625	I can respect that.
3256645	3261329	The 3DS, I don't think it has any problems whatsoever saying reasons you need to buy a 3DS.
3261369	3263370	I think that there's plenty of games out there.
3263390	3267073	They've got a lot of really good games, and I think there's plenty of reasons to own it.
3267273	3271355	I'm talking about the Wii U. That isn't there.
3271375	3280639	But this Nintendo Direct wasn't about Wii U. I don't care if it's about the Wii U. The Wii U is hurting and they haven't had a Nintendo Direct about the Wii U. Except for the stupid what?
3281139	3282920	Oh, 30 years of Luigi.
3283000	3284601	Let's announce all these Luigi things.
3284681	3288342	And the biggest thing they had to announce was DLC for a game that they already put out.
3288402	3289083	I mean, you need...
3290263	3297867	Yeah, but I put this Super Luigi U DLC next to some of the DLC that other companies put out.
3298767	3300708	Let's say the Saints Row DLC, Loki.
3301068	3302489	Okay, yes, I'll give you that.
3302729	3303809	But let's put it this way.
3304390	3305690	Has it sold any systems?
3305950	3308872	Did we see a big jump in numbers after they made that announcement?
3309012	3309112	No.
3309212	3316176	No, because DLC will keep it afloat and keep people having their Wii U's plugged in, but it's not going to move the system.
3316196	3321159	All that's going to happen is when it gets dropped in price, they'll bundle it with New Super Mario Bros.
3321299	3323360	U Game of the Year Edition or some garbage like that.
3323380	3327323	They'll have the new Luigi U DLC bundled in there.
3327343	3328323	That's all that's going to happen.
3330049	3333453	Well, we'll see E3, hopefully a game changer.
3333914	3336678	If not, going to be very interesting next year for Nintendo.
3336718	3337919	I think Falco just made a good point.
3338700	3344187	If the best thing about your next-gen system is the release of a nearly 20-year-old game, your next-gen console sucks.
3346450	3348173	But that's relying on...
3348635	3355078	Nintendo needs to get more people excited about the Wii U, they need to pull the curtain back a little bit on what they're working on, and E3 is the deadline for that to happen.
3355098	3358240	But is it just me, or is there a lot of developers now just sort of banking in on that nostalgia?
3373205	3374465	Well, why not?
3374565	3377366	We run up to the trough and hit the feeder bar.
3378246	3381427	How much did we all squee about Earthbound Link to the Past?
3381987	3383528	Well, apparently not the listenership.
3383868	3384888	But I know I did.
3385568	3387408	To be honest, I'm not super excited either.
3387729	3390869	Because, I mean, I really don't play... I don't have a 3DS.
3390889	3392510	I didn't get one because it gives me a headache.
3393430	3393890	So, I mean...
3395776	3398401	It's really hard for me to put this into words.
3399022	3405435	I want to see something new and exciting and that's why my attention has been on the indie developers because they're doing the new and exciting.
3406407	3410389	Ross Steel UT in the chat room saying why isn't the Link to the Past sequel on the Wii U?
3410729	3412570	That'd help if they didn't ass it up with gimmicks.
3413531	3414091	Good point.
3414331	3416932	Why not this game that gets people really excited on the Wii U?
3417272	3421214	My assumption is because we're going to get a Zelda trailer this year.
3421274	3427577	You won't get the new Zelda this year but you're going to get that trailer that gets you just enough fan wank to get people excited.
3427597	3429138	It's the Wind Waker thing.
3430499	3431299	Oh yeah, the Wind Waker.
3431659	3432880	I meant like you know
3433277	3434459	Just wake me when the wank is over.
3435019	3449177	I'm telling you, it makes perfect sense, and the setup is so perfect that I would be shocked if, maybe not this year, because they are a little slow to adopt, I mean, fuck, virtual consoles now just coming out.
3450758	3451819	How many months later?
3452179	3452919	Six months later?
3453460	3470392	I mean, so they're a little slow to adopt things, but I would be shocked that we do not see a way to play 3DS games on the Wii U. Or, let's just say that they're not going to do that, seeing some HD remakes of 3DS games coming to the Wii U. It only makes sense that they're going to do that.
3473426	3487183	DarkSakura brought up indie developers, and this could be a place where Nintendo could, and it seems like something could be happening there, who knows, but this would be the group you would want to get in bed with if you were a game developer.
3487203	3488905	It looks like they're in bed with Microsoft, though.
3489005	3489906	So is it sexy times?
3490086	3501099	Yeah, but Mojang, Marcus Pearson, of course Notch, and Jens Bergensten, they have made Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2013.
3501179	3503361	For pixel blocks!
3503382	3507646	Now, Time's 100 list kind of gets some, you know...
3509088	3515889	I think Lady Gaga won or came in second place in an online poll of who's... So, you know, take some of this stuff with a grain of salt.
3515909	3519250	But it is nice to see gaming represented and indie gaming at that.
3519510	3535653	And the cool thing is is that Will Wright, you know, SimCity before it was, you know, this last one, actually wrote the introduction talking that Minecraft was, quote, a wonderful combination of accessibility and depth allowing for complex output with simple input.
3537274	3538394	And, you know, Minecraft...
3539534	3542015	Minecraft was an amazing thing for gaming.
3542196	3545757	So I'm glad this is getting acknowledged.
3546778	3553782	I went from hater to tolerator to digging holes in the ground prairie dogger.
3555162	3558404	I'm going to make it a point this week because I've been really bad at not going to the server.
3558624	3560765	I'm going to play every single day this week.
3563287	3564327	I live streamed it last week.
3564347	3566088	I'm going to play every single day.
3566429	3567189	My prairie dog house.
3568777	3576420	I guess apparently Time did that poll online and this is saying that Notch ranked second in the poll.
3577100	3580021	So it was Notch or it was Lady Gaga.
3580141	3582742	I mean, you know, what's the difference, right?
3584463	3584843	Lady Notch.
3584863	3586444	They're essentially the same person.
3589625	3591107	All right, so congrats to them.
3591447	3591868	I'm curious.
3592168	3593890	Now the question is, what's next?
3594951	3598795	I know they had that, what, the Universe game was their next big project, right?
3598976	3600177	I can't remember the name of it.
3600217	3602199	Well, they have Scrolls that they're doing right now.
3602219	3602560	Oh, yeah, Scrolls.
3602700	3606424	They've got the, I don't even know what the fuck the game's called.
3606444	3607445	It's like 0x00.
3608406	3609788	That's the one I'm thinking of, yeah.
3612048	3628802	yeah so although that one he's claiming that he's running into kind of like a writer's block almost with it so he's working on other things right now until he figures out what to do with it gotcha all right let's move on um we're still a little ways from the classic game of the week some more news for you first
3629494	3638201	Well, now this is something I'm excited about, even though, yeah, it's kind of me biting myself because of the nostalgia thing, but I was super happy.
3638802	3644506	Castle of Illusion is getting remade for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and PC.
3645067	3650191	It is being developed by Sega Studios Australia, and it will be, I guess, a 2.5D kind of game.
3652312	3678216	um well it says a 2D 3D hybrid and it is basically based off of the uh Genesis slash Mega Drive game with the original director working with the developer now so um there's a trailer out for it I totally recommend everybody watch it because it looks super good but I do not see a date on it yeah I don't think they have a date for it yet yeah
3678675	3681777	However, I mean, I played the shit out of this game.
3681958	3694087	I even, when I graduated high school, I traded my Super Nintendo for my friend's Genesis and sat playing this game for just the whole night.
3694567	3699791	And then I found his Master System converter and then was playing Alex Kidd and Shinobi World and that was pretty awesome too.
3700251	3704973	But yeah, Castle of Illusion is one of my top Disney games.
3705713	3708374	Yeah, that was a great game, so it's exciting to hear about this.
3708494	3711115	The pictures are absolutely gorgeous, but seriously, watch the trailer.
3711975	3718177	It is maybe not as orgasm-inducing as DuckTales, but, you know, there's lots of wank.
3719217	3721678	It'll still get you going down there a little bit?
3722498	3723418	It'll make one moist.
3723699	3723739	Ew.
3726425	3727726	That's just a fun word.
3728347	3728727	Moist?
3728767	3729247	Moist.
3729668	3734772	I was going to bring it up here in studio real quick just to be able to see some of this here in action.
3734892	3739616	Let me get to the actual gameplay part of the trailer.
3741057	3742298	It does look really good.
3744279	3744920	The graphics.
3745220	3747762	Yeah, this is more, there's not much of the gameplay.
3747782	3748543	Yay, Maleficent!
3751261	3752201	Was that Maleficent?
3752522	3754962	Her face looks a little weird, though.
3755102	3758964	They don't have any gameplay in that, but they actually have some screenshots that look pretty sweet.
3762645	3763865	Oh, Codeman, I'm sorry.
3764185	3764426	What?
3765386	3765986	This is you.
3766246	3768307	We actually have a friend, our friend Beanie.
3769027	3771008	You say the word moist around her.
3771068	3772508	She full body shudders.
3772588	3773268	It's hilarious.
3773288	3774909	Wasn't that the mom in Dead Like Me?
3775489	3776370	I never watched that.
3776510	3777630	Dead Like Me was a great show.
3777890	3778931	Legocity Undercover The Chase Begins

4009654	4010034	and Star Trek.
4010054	4010294	That's it.
4042074	4068751	uh it did the feed did drop on our end just you know yeah i don't know what's going on well well we always do we always do a um you know before before well now it's showing it's connected before we ever we before we start olr every night we always reset the router reset the modems and everything in the house you know so just think if we were an always connected game console we would not be working right now keep that in mind for your future game console needs
4069071	4078074	Dear Microsoft, listen to our podcast every week 6 o'clock Central Time I mean Central Pacific Time Alan, is my computer on?
4079034	4079194	No?
4079274	4094078	Okay I just want to make sure I didn't have Dropbox running or something Yeah, Rob did mention Detective Conan I did Which is a very popular anime series from the 90s Yes, which is getting a game release in Japan that I already closed the window for
4096724	4099126	Alright, do we do UK release dates?
4099647	4100027	Yes.
4100568	4101749	A bunch of crap.
4101989	4104632	A few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4105292	4109396	Alright, so we've already talked about how the Wii U isn't selling very well.
4110417	4120266	And technically we don't have the MPD numbers out for hardware because Nintendo's not going to come out bragging that, hey, we only sold like 67,000 units.
4120306	4120547	Yeah.
4122188	4134617	Yeah, but apparently, according to a leak on NeoGAF, they have the console numbers, which is possible because I get email updates occasionally of MPD numbers.
4136178	4140161	So, yes, the Wii U apparently only sold 67,000 units in the U.S.
4140201	4142863	during the five weeks from March 3rd to April 6th.
4143604	4146326	And then also, I guess, roughly...
4148087	4153612	Um, the Vita didn't do much better.
4153852	4155174	Actually, let's see here.
4155294	4160178	They did only 33,000 units during March.
4162020	4163801	Were there any Vita games during March?
4165732	4168674	Quick, name me games on the Vita to get excited about right now.
4169154	4173056	I'm thinking the Persona 4 release, but that already happened.
4173136	4176078	So I'm like... Tear away if you're into... Project D.Va.
4176098	4177618	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4177678	4179419	Tear away if you're into Media Molecule.
4181300	4183902	There is Killzone, if you like Killzone.
4184782	4186783	So, here's a question for you all.
4186863	4194166	We sit here and we've razzed Nintendo about, you know, well, you know, they're just not getting those titles out there, but look at the frickin' Vita.
4194766	4195866	Here's the thing, I think, with the Vita.
4196467	4201129	It's like, Nintendo, we recognize the potentials there that they could be doing much better.
4201149	4208411	The Vita, I don't think we have much expectations for them other than, hey, it's a nice piece of hardware, but for some reason all the games that come out on it aren't very good.
4208812	4211293	Like, dude, they had Call of Duty...
4212413	4225558	Black Ops come out on the Vita that should have been System Accelerate there but no instead they just had a quick rush of a game come out by someone that did Resistance and it sucked ass it's
4227658	4233462	Thankfully they're taking all that stuff first party now and they're going to be developing instead of having third parties develop their games for them.
4234423	4238506	So Killzone hopefully will be much better but I don't know.
4239307	4242109	I don't know if Tearaway is not going to save that system.
4242189	4247594	What's going to save that system I think a little bit is the fact that the PlayStation Network is a really good place right now for indies.
4247694	4251337	There's a lot of indie games coming out in there so I think we'll see some interesting stuff from there.
4251357	4253819	Maybe what develops with the PlayStation 4 because
4254159	4258361	Before I get accused of being a Nintendo fanboy and always defending them here on this show.
4258401	4261122	Although I like to think of myself as devil's advocate against gamers hate everything.
4261882	4266544	But I think the PlayStation 4 is in a good place.
4266644	4268145	I think it has a lot of good buzz around it.
4268725	4273307	And, you know, PlayStation 4 is going to be a real contender for the Wii U, which doesn't...
4273887	4299630	you know unless they really knock our socks off at E3 you definitely are going to have PlayStation 4 on another level come out with something absolutely amazing and it could be interesting with how the Vita could tie into that I mean we've already seen a little bit of that early press conference you know so I'm I'm really curious to see how that enriches as we as time goes on here so Akuma JP mentioned a game called Obura Muramasa I guess does that have to do with the sword?
4301027	4302749	Well, he linked us to the game there in our chat room.
4302769	4303450	Well, let's take a look.
4304071	4305493	Muramasa Rebirth, yes.
4305553	4308276	If I can bring it up without destroying our feed again.
4308416	4310259	It's Muramasa Rebirth.
4310359	4315125	It's the HD, well, not really HD, but like a remake of Muramasa the Demon Blade.
4315145	4315325	Oh, neat.
4315385	4316947	Oh, yeah, it's just Muramasa the Demon Blade.
4317608	4318009	That's cool.
4318029	4319871	Oh, that looks pretty fun.
4320958	4321998	Screenshots are taking forever to load.
4322018	4322438	There we go.
4323239	4325799	The Vita does have such a pretty screen.
4326539	4327560	It is a great piece of tech.
4328520	4330240	They do have some good Japanese games coming out.
4330280	4332181	They've got the Persona stuff.
4332241	4336362	They've got Muramasa Rebirth.
4336562	4338762	There's also Odin's... Well, not Odin's Sphere.
4338782	4341223	There's Dragonblade.
4341403	4342583	Is that chick naked?
4343203	4343644	Look at her.
4343704	4345284	They're skinny dipping or something.
4346624	4346964	Rob.
4347044	4348365	This is a perverse game.
4348785	4349345	You know what?
4351536	4353417	You need to stop being so white boy about it.
4355558	4356498	Oh my god, boobs.
4357238	4357799	Oh my god.
4359039	4368103	It's only here that people have a big stick up their ass, a big rough sandpapery stick up their ass about boobs.
4368343	4368803	Exactly.
4368923	4370984	I believe that we should have more boobs on TV.
4371204	4372365	I fully support this.
4372405	4374326	DarkSakura, are you saying I have a stick up my ass?
4378783	4391637	I like boobs too boobs are great but I mean people in general it's we're fine with violence and blood and gore and you know saw and everything I like boobs covered in blood but show a tit and everyone loses their shit hey that rhymed
4393488	4395250	That's going to be my new motto about America.
4395350	4397332	Show a tit, lose your shit.
4397412	4407283	We haven't come to that part of the show yet, but we do have a story later on about the evil within, which did have a four-armed demon chick with boobs and blood on her boobs.
4407343	4408284	So there you go.
4408564	4409345	Yay!
4409445	4410726	The violence boob quota.
4410746	4411988	Blood orgy, yay!
4412949	4413649	Organ orgy.
4413709	4415531	It's just like organs launched at the screen.
4415551	4416052	It was great.
4417742	4437383	Alright Let's see, did you do the other sales story about Yeah, NPD I don't want to repeat what you just said again No problem The March NPD stuff, Bioshock Infinite obviously the top selling game The utter disappointment of a game, sequel Tomb Raider, only placed 2nd
4438644	4439605	heads will roll.
4439906	4442088	Oh, what a disappointment.
4443210	4449878	Ironically, Gears of War Judgment on 360 and then God of War Ascension on PS3 were 3 and 4.
4449958	4450519	I'm sorry.
4450920	4451340	I'm sorry.
4451420	4452161	I have to say this.
4452181	4455145	This is going to be so wrong and I apologize in advance, but
4457014	4462336	Only an Asian company like Square Enix would be like, why can you only be the second best-selling game?
4465237	4465817	Am I right?
4466097	4466637	Am I right?
4468338	4473020	Only the parent company in Asia would be like, why weren't you the number one game?
4475621	4476701	Why you get an A-?
4477161	4478562	You came out in the beginning of the month.
4478602	4479402	You should study harder.
4481054	4504582	Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon actually on their number 6, MLB 13 The Show on number 7, NBA 2K13 8, Walking Dead Survival Instinct just again proving that Walking Dead the franchise will actually sell anything whether it be a good game or absolute shit so that was number 9, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
4506423	4506863	Number 10.
4507203	4508605	What's not on this list?
4508665	4512849	The two big titles for the Wii U. Lego City Undercover and Monster Hunter 3.
4513950	4514931	Not even the top 10.
4516312	4517413	It's gotta hurt.
4518834	4520155	Maybe Laura should have been a doctor.
4522392	4529554	Alright, moving on to fighting game news, or maybe a little change going on or another perspective.
4530274	4540097	Vice President Christian Svensson over at Capcom has made a remark about a fan-submitted question on the Ask Capcom forums.
4540777	4543138	This was about stories in fighting games.
4543178	4548660	You know, I don't know how many people really play fighting games for the story, although some of them do have good stories, I guess.
4548920	4549800	Were you raising your hand over there?
4550100	4554844	Yes, why, okay, if I don't play fighting games for the stories, I would have never touched any of the Tekken games.
4555544	4556165	I guess that's true.
4556185	4561409	I assume the people that play the fighting games for the stories are the same people that read Playboy for their articles.
4562930	4565892	Well, anyhow, here's the interesting comment about story mode and fighting games.
4565952	4578102	Quote, the strategic marketing group here has for quite a while been pushing for our fighting franchises to have more and more better single player content of which full-fledged story modes are one component.
4578522	4578942	I don't know, I...
4598035	4617459	but then again you know you look at a franchise like Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat's done really well with their story modes in their recent releases especially this last one so Tiger Claw mentions that the story in Injustice is really good and is getting Capcom thinking about making better stories in their fighting games
4618849	4623193	Well, Injustice is just NetherRealm Studios that just did the Mortal Kombat game, right?
4623313	4624554	So, same, same.
4625775	4628338	Anyhow, one other thing to mention about Capcom.
4630793	4636575	Apparently, more DLC in Capcom's future, which isn't really unexpected.
4637336	4638636	But just not on disc.
4638736	4642077	This is talking about Capcom's recent strategy.
4643178	4651161	There was a lot of very interesting revelations here in Capcom's forecast about where the company's going, saying that...
4652541	4656424	Apparently, they don't want to outsource games to Western developers as much anymore.
4656684	4659565	That it has caused a drop in quality.
4660346	4663248	They're going to promote DLC in the consumer business.
4664308	4669772	Aim for growth, surpassing the market by reinforcing the online and mobile contents business.
4670012	4672033	iPhone games, Android games.
4673254	4677897	And strengthen earnings base by expanding the title lineup in the P&S business.
4679298	4679378	Um...
4680719	4683020	More DLC, just hopefully not included on the disc.
4686102	4688604	Or just announce the Mega Man rebirth already.
4689825	4690725	We all know it's coming.
4691706	4692767	A Mega Man reboot.
4695054	4695374	Alright.
4697517	4704244	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase Banned.
4705465	4715937	That just about brings us to the end of the first half of our show, but we have to take a trip down memory lane first off with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4720463	4722384	We didn't have reboots back in the day.
4722704	4724885	You didn't reboot a gaming franchise.
4725405	4729526	No, you just put out some crappy sequels and then tried to make people forgive you with the third one.
4729726	4730226	That's right.
4730286	4733467	Well, let's see if that is the case with tonight's Classic Game of the Week.
4733627	4734027	Not really.
4734247	4736748	Alright, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week tonight?
4736928	4738268	Sonic the Hedgehog 3!
4738528	4744050	Because I couldn't find anything else and I've been haunted by the Ice Cap music.
4744910	4746550	Oddly enough, for some reason.
4747751	4748731	Which is what's in the background.
4750165	4750585	Thanks for watching!
4768749	4770830	So, yeah, I mean, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog.
4770930	4773090	I mean, I really liked the first one.
4773290	4774651	I really liked the second one.
4775231	4778352	But three for me just, like, lit everything up.
4778452	4780593	It was the last real... Actually, no, I take that back.
4780633	4784694	Sonic CD was the last really good Sonic game, as far as platforming goes.
4785554	4789459	I actually even put Sonic 3 above Sonic CD.
4790320	4792162	And Bobby, the Japanese music was better.
4793183	4794364	For Sonic CD, just saying.
4795345	4799610	So Sonic 3 also had some interesting things going on with it too.
4800711	4804034	You basically could pick between Sonic or Tails as you could in Sonic 2.
4805335	4831850	and it was basically the same type of gameplay you had all the same usual stuff you had your six levels with two parts you had a boss at the end of the very full thing you could keep going back to the level you have new abilities like you could hold the jump button while in mid-air and do like a quick shield for protection you tails could fly or swim underwater for a short time before getting tired and going back down and
4832870	4835211	So Tails could actually go to places that Sonic could not.
4836211	4839051	And his tail could actually be used to attack enemies.
4839611	4844132	And if you have a second player controlling Tails, then he can carry Sonic while flying.
4844172	4846773	So basically it opened up to all kinds of exploration.
4848473	4850153	And then there were the different shields in the game.
4850173	4851234	Like there was the fire shield.
4851774	4856595	And my favorite was the lightning shield that attracted coins.
4856875	4858215	Not coins, rings.
4858855	4859595	That was my favorite.
4859736	4864478	And if you hit a checkpoint while holding 50 or more rings, you got a bonus stage, which was the bumper stage.
4865058	4869120	Which, I'm sorry, the bumper stage pissed me off.
4869240	4877524	Of any bonus stage ever in any game, for some reason it was that sort of semi-isometric point of view.
4877544	4880126	It would just give me a headache and I couldn't do it at all.
4880246	4881466	So now I make Dan do it.
4882267	4884828	But that's how you earn your Chaos Emeralds.
4886129	4891254	And, like, someone even took the time to chart out how the various bonus stages were.
4891735	4900263	There was also a thing you could do with Sonic & Knuckles where if you attached an older cartridge to it, like, you could play Sonic 2 with Sonic & Knuckles.
4900884	4905228	But if you did another one, if you hold, like, a certain button press, then you could go on.
4905829	4908011	Now, I want to talk about music for a minute.
4908691	4908892	Okay?
4908912	4909212	Okay.
4910553	4919938	There was a big thing going around with the music saying that Michael Jackson had done a lot of the music and then he removed himself from the Padres or something.
4920939	4931345	There's a series of clips on YouTube where people have compared music in Sonic 3 to Michael Jackson songs.
4931405	4933046	So, I mean, it's pretty obvious.
4933106	4935447	I mean, the Ice Cap Zone sounds like Smooth Criminal.
4936368	4938269	This is actually my second favorite music in the game.
4943027	4944408	This is the Lava Reef Zone.
4944868	4945448	Really good music.
4946349	4961896	So yeah, so basically, you know, you can, if you got all of the Chaos Emeralds, you can turn into Supersonic and then Knuckles punches the crap out of him and takes the Chaos Emeralds and you have to go to the Death Egg.
4962396	4962817	Rawr.
4963977	4971689	You know, which I always like... Yeah, they called him Robotnik, but it really did make a lot more sense to call him Eggman because dude looked like a freaking egg.
4972269	4974272	And, hey, he was in Wreck-It Ralph.
4975975	4976756	So, yeah, um...
4978627	4981129	So basically there have been a bajillion different releases of this game.
4981169	4987053	We had Sonic and Jam in 1997 for the Saturn, Sonic and Knuckles Collection and the Sonic and Garfield Pack.
4987113	4987733	What the fuck?
4987753	4988754	Sonic and Garfield Pack?
4989074	4989615	For PC.
4990775	4996539	Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PS2, Xbox, and PC.
4996639	4998000	Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP.
4999381	5014539	Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3 and Sonic Classic Collection for Nintendo DS plus you can get like these various packs on Steam I'll be honest the only one of those I've ever bought was Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because hello it's P.O.P.O.
5016080	5043335	there have been like I said the digital releases for Steam there's been the Wii Virtual Console one in 2007 Xbox Live Arcade in 2009 and it even has a split screen multiplayer on Xbox Live so it was given when it was released EGM gave it a 9.5 out of 10 and honestly I think it was well deserved it's one of the best games to ever come out so
5045236	5050620	We will be back after a quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio Don't go anywhere guys, we'll be right back
5077662	5078022	Blame me!
5093069	5093529	DarkSakura.com

5140365	5140925	Get that sausage.
5159421	5162484	So when they're ripping out organs of this patient, what?
5162504	5164185	You can even go earlier than that.
5164265	5165966	This is the funny Swedish guy.
5167347	5170810	Perform a double kidney transplant.
5171250	5171871	In an ambulance.
5171891	5172912	So the ambulance is moving.
5172932	5175554	Oh great, the ambulance is moving.
5175734	5175934	Hey, guts.
5175954	5178696	The kidney's just floating around in the back.
5178716	5179837	I love that.
5189626	5190527	Oh lordy.
5191248	5193269	I am buying this when I get home.
5194470	5197032	You need to wait and don't play it until you can live stream it.
5197112	5197772	Here we go, Bob.
5199013	5202676	I'll do it tonight.
5202696	5203677	I'll put that in our chat.
5204057	5208040	Sorry to the podcast folks, but just look it up on YouTube.
5208060	5208941	There's a ton of them.
5209281	5210222	It was great about the game.
5210382	5211623	Surgeon Simulator 2013.
5211823	5212824	They have records.
5212924	5218648	They have people doing record surgery, the times, how quickly you can do surgery, and murder times.
5219028	5221369	So how quickly you can kill your patient.
5222429	5229212	SJ100Matt says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Hey, I remember playing the original surgery game, Life and Death 2.
5229532	5230853	Oh, yeah, I remember that.
5231193	5232734	Those games were scary shit.
5233674	5235735	Sorry, for me it was Trauma Center.
5236195	5239036	You know, we got Trauma Center on Wii when it came out.
5239136	5239536	Oh, yeah, me too.
5239616	5240577	And I remember...
5241557	5262262	I think I was drunk on something no no no it was the Vicodin when I'm sitting here leaning back in my chair I was on Vicodin it was right after um I think I was playing it right after my surgery so I'm sitting here with my hand in a cast trying to hold the Wiimote going can't hold it and then like I ended up like using my left hand and so I was slicing people to bits it was hilarious
5263022	5268184	S2100 Matt though, I was playing the original surgery game Operation by Milton Bradley.
5269825	5285831	The only thing about Life and Death 1 that kind of sucked was that from what I remember at least we can only get to the first surgery which was it was removing an appendix and unfortunately they do not allow you to play tic-tac-toe using the scalpel.
5286331	5287792	That will kill the patient apparently.
5289893	5290213	Nice.
5291575	5291935	All right.
5292496	5293076	Let's move on.
5293136	5294698	Do some rapid fire news.
5294858	5298041	Quickly covering some of the other things going on in the gaming world this week.
5298061	5299402	And then we'll get to the FUGO question of the week.
5299442	5301284	But first, rapid fire news.
5301324	5301564	Loki.
5301985	5302906	So, Deadpool.
5303146	5305048	Supposed to be coming out June 25th.
5306129	5307150	And that's all you need to know.
5307330	5308631	Because Deadpool's awesome.
5309292	5311014	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
5311234	5311474	June 25th.
5312775	5319780	The OUYA has got a firmware update that's allowing people to change their credit card information.
5320821	5322422	And apparently you can change this at any time.
5322702	5329287	And also they're going to be adding some different payment options as well later on.
5329967	5332769	But right now you can change your credit card information.
5332949	5333430	Fantastic.
5333570	5340835	And they've signed up 10,000 registered developers because technically everybody within OUYA could be a registered developer at some point.
5341375	5341876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5361322	5375394	and last but not least Bethesda was teasing all week long and finally released the trailer for The Evil Within which is the brand new game from Shinji Mikami known for the Resident Evil series
5375994	5383078	And I gotta say, after watching the trailer, other than the fact that there is a lot of organs and stuff, it looks very Silent Hill-ish.
5383438	5384919	Like, good Silent Hill-ish.
5385940	5386880	I was a little bit scared.
5387601	5387921	What?
5387941	5389602	I was a little bit scared just watching the trailer.
5390642	5391483	Ooh.
5391503	5392603	Let me bring this up here in studio.
5392643	5392923	I like brains.
5397199	5398339	Oh, I thought there was a YouTube here.
5399240	5400120	I'll look it up when I get home.
5401180	5403260	I like anything that's Silent Hill in a good way.
5403921	5405861	But I have to get Shane's review of it.
5406581	5411222	Because I trust Shane in all things remotely Silent Hill looking.
5411562	5413623	Oh, don't inflate his ego like that.
5415883	5416243	Okay, here.
5416283	5417984	This is like a two-minute trailer, though.
5418684	5419664	And there's ads on it.
5419704	5420264	Hooray.
5421265	5422485	Well, let's come back to this in a minute.
5422605	5423065	That's what we'll do.
5423615	5424455	That's fine.
5424635	5426576	In the meantime, I will read a few stories here.
5426796	5429737	The bonus games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet revealed.
5430498	5436420	If you bought all the games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, all the download stuff, you will get two free games.
5436740	5438240	And the bonus games were 1943 Kai.
5438320	5439541	That is the laser 1943.
5444303	5450187	and Volgus, which was the very first Capcom game in arcades.
5450447	5456270	By the way, just so you know, the other pack of games came out for Capcom that rounds out this pack.
5456631	5460973	That's Sun Sun 1942 and Pirate Ship Higemaru, which I love that game.
5460993	5462314	Higemaru is a pretty neat game.
5462754	5466557	But I mean, if you want just classic shooter, you can't get any better than 1942.
5466917	5469479	Well, for vertical shooters.
5469839	5470059	Right.
5472222	5473343	Mad Dog McCree 2 The Lost Gold Move Control
5489435	5496158	HD Scrubdown New Difficulty Modes and Online Leaderboards Also, a rating has shown up on a Korean rating site for Metal Gear Solid The Legacy Collection
5509364	5509664	DarkSakura
5540523	5543485	I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.
5543525	5548548	All the good stuff's towards the end anyway.
5550789	5553391	That's really realistic right there.
5553471	5553811	Yeah.
5553831	5559295	Let's go a little further.
5559555	5560196	Ooh, blood!
5560236	5561477	Okay, I wanna play this.
5574932	5575512	Yay!
5575632	5576412	I like organs.
5577172	5578113	Ew!
5578433	5578953	Rob!
5579493	5580633	Why are you showing me that, Rob?
5581393	5583474	That's one of those games to get my mom to watch me play.
5586794	5589695	We need to get your mom watching you play one of those games and we need to stream it.
5590115	5596276	Well, I was thinking a great one to have my mom react to would be Bioshock Infinite, so I'll work on that.
5596456	5599157	We should do, like, Rob's mom, the series.
5599591	5601072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5627277	5632200	Did a ROM hack that basically installs it in place of the original game chips on the motherboard.
5632960	5637583	So there is a YouTube video going around of the arcade version.
5638304	5644347	And a site called This Old Game is doing the artwork for the Pauline edition.
5644827	5652752	So it will be like $100 and has a marquee, monitor glass, control panel, side art, and instruction stickers.
5653860	5657827	I even have Mario being held by Donkey Kong and stuff.
5657927	5662195	Oh, that's awesome, because that's like... I mean, it's even in the right style, too.
5662235	5662556	I love it.
5664943	5670248	Next up, the 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is finally in North America.
5670468	5671088	Yay.
5671408	5671849	And it costs $20.
5672169	5673530	Boo.
5674791	5678234	But you can order it on Nintendo's official online store.
5678334	5680035	That is the only place that you can find it.
5680495	5681896	But not too many games use it.
5682157	5687741	Mostly Monster Hunter 3 and Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.
5689144	5689505	Godmode
5706307	5708209	Party Hats Party Hats Party Hats
5728630	5733612	and then basically it's just lots of fun.
5733853	5734613	Lots of crazy fun.
5735413	5744117	And it costs 10 bucks on Steam or 800 Microsoft points or 6 pounds 99 pence for our friends in the UK.
5744818	5745338	Very nice.
5746338	5751981	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Prince Brightstar asking a question about one of the stories you just did, DarkSakura.
5752481	5756023	Can arcades legally earn money from the Donkey Kong Pauline game?
5759316	5760977	That's a good question.
5761577	5762277	Probably not.
5762718	5764038	In all honesty, probably not.
5764198	5773622	I would think this is more of a novelty that shows up at trade shows and private owners, not something you put down at a miniature golf place or at a bowling alley to actually make money.
5773762	5775343	That would probably get you in some hot water.
5775463	5776043	Well, I don't know.
5776083	5779745	It's a ROM hack, so it's not necessarily that they're selling pirated stuff.
5779825	5781906	It's basically modifying your system.
5781966	5785167	It also wouldn't be the first pirated game to ever show up in an arcade.
5785458	5788620	Well, at Classic Gaming Expo, someone had done a Donkey Kong 2.
5789801	5796566	It was basically just a rehack of Donkey Kong where you found unused sprites and basically redid levels.
5796586	5801750	I mean, it plays exactly Donkey Kong style, but he put up his dump and everything.
5802150	5802931	That sounded awful.
5802951	5803371	I'm sorry.
5804752	5806713	He put the ROM dump up.
5807374	5808355	Shut up, Rob!
5811237	5812017	You're five.
5812037	5812918	You just served it up.
5813388	5815331	Five years old, Rab.
5816392	5816712	Anyway.
5816732	5817773	Here's my dump, y'all.
5818655	5822699	Well, it wasn't my dump, it was his dump, and I just happened to be there for it.
5823901	5824822	It was number two.
5827273	5827713	I quit.
5827773	5828093	Bye.
5828133	5828793	I'm going home.
5830654	5831554	I'm done with y'all.
5831594	5834334	This is... Three words.
5834494	5835855	Fuck this shit.
5836055	5836355	Later.
5837575	5838455	Thanks for the pinkberry.
5838495	5838815	Bye.
5840375	5840575	No.
5841916	5846056	But I remembered that he had distributed it to some arcades.
5847617	5848717	You're still red in the face.
5848837	5850017	Because it's funny.
5850517	5852758	His little comment about what it was, number two.
5852778	5853598	That was funny.
5858983	5861704	Isn't Prince Brightstar so happy that his question led to that?
5861744	5864885	Like a serious, a really good serious question led to, yeah, poop.
5869587	5872307	Yeah, and we supposedly have a mature rating because we're not.
5873888	5875548	Let's get to the Fugu question of the week.
5875608	5878889	Let's class it up a little bit here with some listener feedback.
5878989	5879770	Good fucking luck.
5885697	5887417	Facebook, and Google+.
5887497	5888918	Throw them together, you get Foogle.
5889618	5890238	Foogle+.
5890598	5893759	And we ask a question of the week every week on Foogle.
5894899	5898420	And this week has to do with the Heroes show reboot rumors.
5898820	5905142	Rumor is that Heroes, a TV show that used to be on NBC, could get a second chance as a television show on the next Xbox.
5905542	5907623	Would you watch something like this via Xbox?
5907663	5913144	Do you think this type of content delivery poses a threat to cable television as we know it now?
5913684	5914605	What are your thoughts?
5914625	5916928	We'll start on Facebook tonight with Critical Myth.
5917248	5918310	Love this answer by the way.
5919153	5928658	Setting aside the fan perception that the show quickly went downhill after the first season and thus bringing it back doesn't make a lot of sense, I don't think this alone is a threat to network or cable television.
5929019	5935002	It would only be the combined success of these alternative outlets like Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV, and so on.
5935602	5943647	What it does say, along with some of the other outlets, is that a cancelled show may have many other options than might have been the case just a few short years ago.
5944327	5952313	Add to that the crowdsourcing possibilities, Veronica Mars, and the initial end of a show might not be the final end after all.
5952814	5964923	You know, there's a show on ABC that I really like, I think it's really funny, called Happy Endings, but it's supposedly kind of done because the ratings haven't been very good, but everybody's already talking about, like, can it be on cable or something like that?
5965264	5966405	So, I don't know.
5966425	5966545	Shit.
5968126	5972608	Alright, I'm going to Red the Haze.
5973969	5975950	Would you support Heroes or what have you?
5976310	5981813	Nope, I haven't paid for a live subscription in ages and I'm satisfied everywhere else with my gaming and entertainment needs.
5982293	5985536	My internet connection isn't fast enough, and a large percentage of the U.S.
5985576	5986456	has the same issue.
5986857	5997024	This won't threaten cable TV, but other reliable services that are catching on, like Netflix and Hulu, are more of a threat because of the low barrier of entry with Rokus and smart TVs.
5997565	6002368	Rebooting a canceled TV show that nobody remembers fondly isn't a good gamble.
6002709	6006171	Now, somebody else jumped in there and said, hey, wait a minute, nobody remembers fondly.
6007212	6009534	So, remember fondly?
6009614	6010294	What was the dude's name?
6010314	6010755	Was it Hiro?
6011135	6011615	Yeah, you know.
6012176	6013417	I liked him and I liked his buddy.
6014237	6019801	Unfortunately, he's not probably... I would say that most of the cast would not be back because you have them all doing their own things.
6019941	6021122	They're all in other shows now.
6021142	6025305	He's on Hawaii Five-0 right now and the one chick's on Dallas.
6025325	6025705	Nashville.
6026366	6027247	Or Nashville, yeah.
6028107	6031592	I mean, but there's always the possibility that they could do cameos or what have you.
6031732	6037139	But Heroes wasn't necessarily... The idea was the Heroes were going to get all killed off in the first season anyway.
6037179	6038381	It was supposed to always be new people.
6038941	6040223	And it just didn't work out that way.
6042226	6044689	And I am with... I thought Heroes was...
6045089	6046351	I watched it if there's George Takei
6061525	6061926	There you go.
6062026	6063346	Because, you know, he's my gay daddy.
6063566	6070090	But I'm of the mindset that then, you know, when they started introducing all these other characters in season two, it really went downhill.
6071391	6072931	I stopped watching season three.
6072991	6073932	I couldn't take it anymore.
6073952	6079095	But I heard the show started to get back to its roots and got a lot better season four and maybe ended a little bit.
6079155	6080015	I never saw.
6080075	6080335	I never.
6080435	6081856	Yeah, I never gave it that second chance.
6082236	6084477	But I would be down with a reboot.
6084617	6087039	But if you're going to ask me to pay a lot of extra money for it.
6088139	6093161	But if it's part of a service that's something else with it, I might be open to it.
6093581	6099504	I tried actually watching the first season, but all I would do is just watch the Hiro and Nando scenes.
6100304	6102925	And I wanted to like Cheerleader Wolverine.
6103765	6105946	Could not get into it.
6106606	6107747	But one of my friends was on that show.
6108103	6111446	This is supposed to be about the listeners, so let me read the rest of the answers here.
6111986	6114808	DarkCharger says, if the writing and acting is good, I will watch it.
6115428	6119912	I already pay for Xbox Live, as do millions of subscribers, and this just adds much needed value.
6120272	6123955	There isn't a single show or channel that will usurp cable.
6124295	6126597	However, I believe consumers are willing to dump on an...
6127417	6133220	to stomp on an antiquated business model if an IPTV model is perceived as an equivalent or superior.
6134700	6135541	Remember this whole thing?
6135841	6144784	The theory was that cable providers could then offer their cable channels over the internet to other people that would be out of the area.
6144864	6150047	If you don't have Comcast in your area, thank God, and you wanted to get Comcast channels, although...
6151087	6157510	They all kind of have the same channels anyways, but that was supposed to be a way to do it, was with this box.
6158210	6163252	But remember HBO's talking about doing just internet only.
6164353	6168275	So that would be kind of neat, although I just don't want to pay like $8 for each channel.
6172076	6177141	Burr replies and says, never cared for Heroes, but I would gladly watch a show on my Xbox if it was good.
6177581	6185408	I don't know if it's a threat to the whole system, but it's yet another step towards the a la carte delivery consumers have been clamoring for, much to the cable company's chagrin.
6186730	6190153	Picaruno says, if it ain't one versus a hundred, dot, dot, dot.
6190693	6192134	High five, sir.
6192695	6193135	Amen.
6193215	6193656	Preach.
6195990	6202252	If they say the next Xbox is bringing back 1 vs. 100, I would have to give it serious consideration on that merit alone.
6203372	6205813	But they need to guarantee me it'll be up for at least a couple years.
6207073	6208813	Let's see, Nikki E replied and said,
6219096	6243030	I pay for Netflix to be able to watch what I want when I want if some other service has an exclusive thing I would either not care buy it on DVD later or maybe end up downloading it I think too much competition via exclusive deals and making content only for your own streaming service would just lead to more piracy just when the streaming services were beginning to compete with the convenience of the internet thanks for a great show thank you that's a good point I don't want to have to give every
6243490	6245891	Content Publisher $10 a month to watch their show.
6245971	6250033	I think that dilution is going to lead to a lose-lose situation.
6250053	6250894	Piracy, yeah.
6250934	6251594	Yeah, piracy.
6252114	6253715	People get what they want to see.
6254916	6257197	Yes, people do get what they want to see.
6258213	6284533	Degenerate Johnny says I don't particularly think this service will pose a threat yes interactive entertainment has played a role in the steep decline of ratings within cable television through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other various services which is why you see cable news upholding the interest of those networks by focusing on the negative pertaining to interactive entertainment ooh interesting do you think maybe it's a whole little that's why cable news has it out for games is that it's competition that's awfully little no
6284913	6295735	I think it's just the same reason why certain people on cable news that have very racist comments, I just think they're very short-minded.
6297115	6301296	Let's see, Andy R says, depends what kind of pricing is involved, but I would like something like this.
6301436	6308177	I don't pay for cable because I don't watch much TV, which makes it difficult on the few occasions when there is a show I want to watch, like Game of Thrones.
6308537	6312338	If I can watch it in a manner where I'm not paying for a ton of services I don't want, I'm all for it.
6313038	6315760	Mike B says cables should be trying to keep up with the times.
6316061	6317782	The future is a la carte programming.
6318123	6319223	He's not the first one to use that term.
6319864	6321946	Commercial free shows and movies via the internet.
6322006	6322887	I already do this now.
6322947	6324588	It's a little pricey but no commercials.
6326009	6328351	Let me go over to Google Plus and Redertainment.
6329352	6329752	who said,
6360353	6362174	Again, that comment from Red Entertainment on Google+.
6362914	6365016	I think the comparison to Web TV is very interesting.
6365896	6367437	If at first you don't succeed, try again.
6369018	6369678	Very interesting.
6370319	6377283	So, I apologize I didn't get to all the comments, but do check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google+.
6377343	6381565	Just search for Orange Lounge Radio to read all of the great comments in their entirety.
6382808	6384449	In the meantime... Yeah, because there's some wink going on.
6385129	6385309	What?
6385389	6386249	Oh, the chatter's mad at you.
6386269	6387190	You didn't read mine, Rob.
6387390	6394272	Well, maybe because I read a lot of your other stuff, and you guys call in pretty regularly, so I wanted to read people that don't get to participate as much with the show.
6394432	6396073	So just throw that out there.
6396633	6400935	I know, but you know, I have to give... You have to fan the flames.
6401415	6402375	I have to fan them.
6403556	6403816	All right.
6404744	6408266	I'm like Karl Lagerfeld and his fan.
6408286	6410347	Without being an asshole.
6410527	6416610	I appreciate all of the comments and encourage everybody to go read them in their entirety on Facebook and Google+.
6417270	6418231	Meanwhile, more news.
6418491	6418811	Loki.
6419571	6424394	So the second round of THQ auctions are happening.
6424774	6430957	And apparently the news will be out Monday afternoon on to who has what.
6431577	6442168	This included back catalog rights and also kind of different lots, including the Darksiders franchise, Red Faction and Homeworld franchise.
6443069	6447974	Of course, you know, the original auctions, you know, sold off the other stuff like Saints Row and that kind of thing.
6450035	6455360	They're saying they're going to make six to seven million dollars from those sales.
6456420	6465948	One thing, though, that we do know that's going to happen, the whole crowdfunded movement to buy the rights to Homeworld failed.
6466828	6469671	They didn't have enough money to win the bid there, so...
6470491	6473053	Thankfully, they are refunding everyone's money.
6473293	6474093	So that's nice.
6474614	6475935	So they have that going on.
6475975	6478236	That means somebody put up a lot of money for it.
6478296	6479837	So somebody recognized the value in it.
6479917	6481678	Then somebody outbid those guys.
6482018	6487662	So they had, I guess, it looks like they had around 80 million dollars.
6490863	6491984	80 million?
6492184	6494164	No, not 80 million.
6494184	6494164	80,000.
6494204	6495585	I'm sorry.
6495605	6496765	75 to $80,000.
6498145	6498425	$80 million.
6498505	6501246	It's the most successful Kickstarter ever.
6501266	6503007	I don't think Saints Row went for that much.
6503467	6505988	No, no, no.
6506008	6510269	So $80,000 is what they had between their Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.
6511509	6513690	Unfortunately, they were not able to get it for that.
6515090	6517451	It's sold for the price is right rules.
6517671	6534633	80,001!
6534733	6538776	and this belonged to Tim Langdell who is the founder of Edge Games.
6539236	6543058	Well, a court order has stripped him of that trademark.
6543459	6547881	That's because of a petition by Dice and EA who made Mirrors Edge.
6547921	6548262	The U.S.
6548302	6553105	Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of the canceled registration on April 17th.
6553385	6555106	This whole thing has been going on since 2010.
6555146	6555426	Let's see.
6558849	6565594	Moby Game made a game called Edge and they've discounted all versions of the game by 50% in celebration.
6566054	6570518	The game had been taken down from the App Store previously due to issues with this trademark.
6570918	6574521	So, you know, anything that had the word Edge in it, this guy was coming for you.
6575321	6576743	Hide your wife, hide your edge.
6576983	6579365	Hmm, that sort of sounds like Ville.
6580145	6584769	Yeah, so maybe this will set a very interesting precedent and send a message.
6585459	6588282	I'm going to create a game called Ville.
6588402	6589483	Just Ville.
6590143	6592645	I mean, this guy is welcome to call his company Edge Games.
6592705	6596929	I don't have a problem with that, but Edge Games and Mirror's Edge?
6597469	6597709	No.
6598190	6599351	There's no similarity there.
6599371	6601212	It's just like Monster Cable.
6601312	6602133	I'm all for this.
6602173	6604135	They should kill off more stupid trademarks.
6604155	6607057	I can think of a few we've come across in gaming that need to be cancelled as well.
6607878	6609399	So, anyhow.
6611141	6612442	Let's move on to some more news.
6613479	6619683	In other news, now the original link, by the way, didn't work, so I had to hunt it down.
6620804	6621044	Oops.
6621524	6622285	Oh well, it's okay.
6622905	6628849	So there is a prototype of a Sega machine that was called the Pluto, I believe.
6629770	6635213	And a guy's posting on Assembler Games forums with pictures of one of the second prototypes.
6635233	6636054	There were only two of them.
6636954	6638635	and basically says it's super heavy.
6638815	6646717	It had two controller ports, a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a power button and the reset button.
6646797	6656020	It still says Saturn on it, but this was apparently they were going to brand whatever this Pluto system was with the Saturn name.
6656040	6658520	When you plug it in, it actually has the Saturn logo
6661501	6663582	Loading screen, the drive empty screen.
6663782	6669403	So yeah, just looking this over, it apparently works.
6669683	6676705	It was, I'm sorry if I'm having to go through this because unfortunately the original thing didn't work for me.
6677085	6681066	It is region locked, but it is a USA NTSC Saturn.
6681367	6682247	So that's pretty cool.
6682287	6685108	I think it had the networking capability.
6686488	6690369	They bought this for a dollar at a Stockton flea market.
6692736	6699860	$1.
6693457	6699860	By the way, turning around and selling it on eBay right now, already up to like $6,700.
6701280	6702000	For real?
6702081	6703281	That was at a flea market?
6703321	6704121	That's crazy.
6704262	6705642	The other one was at a garage sale.
6706983	6707303	Wow.
6707503	6709184	And I think the Stockton area as well.
6709324	6711725	Yeah, okay, it's a Saturn with a netlink built in.
6713568	6715349	This needs to be in my collection, damn it.
6716250	6717831	You have a few thousand dollars to pony up?
6718091	6720233	No, I have a desire to buy a house.
6720593	6721914	If only you'd been at that flea market.
6721954	6724155	I can't live in a Sega Pluto.
6725777	6726337	You can try.
6726857	6727738	It is pretty big.
6728999	6731721	I have to say, looking at it, it is pretty burly, but you know what?
6732241	6733842	I have a Saturn and I'm happy with it.
6736144	6736264	Okay.
6737318	6738959	Damn, that is a monster, though.
6739800	6746306	I just want to read a quick comment on the Edge thing, because people in chat are still talking about the Edge story, and I think this insight from Dungeon Buster is pretty good in chat.
6747067	6752011	Langdell picked a fight with EA, and EA decided to litigate his trademark into oblivion and won.
6752371	6753232	The guy was nuts.
6753532	6756315	He'd sue over anything that he thought infringed on his trademark.
6756575	6759858	He made up proof that others were using it, which the courts didn't appreciate.
6759938	6760598	It was hilarious.
6760618	6763501	Again, that's from Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6763621	6767024	I also do want to repost the forum link just because people need to see photos of this.
6767064	6768165	It's pretty interesting.
6768525	6769165	Oh, of the Pluto?
6769325	6769766	Of the Pluto.
6769886	6774349	And I mean, I've seen the Neptune one because they have it at Classic Gaming Expo every year.
6774950	6780734	This thing is huge and it looks like a Saturn and a Sega CD had an ugly baby.
6781095	6782916	Poor Pluto keeps getting shit on.
6782956	6784217	It's not a real planet.
6784297	6785518	It's not a real system.
6786699	6788060	Okay.
6788649	6802774	Good thing we didn't name this show Pluto Lounge Radio or we might have been in trouble Good thing we weren't Pluto Edge Radio You see what I did there Loki, were you going to get into something?
6802814	6803694	Sorry, I think I cut you off
6804082	6807044	Yeah, I was going to talk about how successful Microsoft is.
6807664	6813287	They turned a profit in their third quarter, which just ended March 31st.
6814128	6822553	And apparently, I guess, $2.53 billion, a 56% increase over last year.
6823433	6825855	And of course, citing that, you know,
6827483	6831124	Obviously, Halo 4 is a big part of that.
6832985	6847389	They were saying that, I guess, overall, though, they said the operating income of $342 million was up from a $242 million loss last year.
6848189	6852351	Overall, they're up, but some of their costs went up as well.
6852771	6853391	They're saying right now,
6853991	6881498	specifically Xbox Live memberships grew 18% now 46 million members and they're saying that the console I guess it shipped 8.9 million units in the first 9 months of fiscal 2013 down 3 million units from the same time last year but it's to be expected it's been out for 8 years now you expect there's going to be a little decline no price drop or anything recently to motivate it yeah
6883038	6883358	DarkSakura.com
6908733	6935004	the games that supports right now Animal Crossing New Leaf and Tomodachi Collection New Life which isn't something we have here but those are the games that are going to work with the service and you can even see in a little screenshot here you see the games and I guess you take the screenshot and you just put them right up on Twitter and Tumblr which I find interesting that those are the two that are picked not like Facebook or something but again it's Japan Facebook might not be in Japan what it is here and honestly do you want more of that shit on your Facebook?
6936464	6937045	click block
6940086	6941908	You're right, I don't want more of that shit on Facebook.
6941928	6944350	Facebook is actually on my shit list for a big reason.
6944450	6947172	Well, I've been talking bad about it for a long time.
6947212	6947933	Welcome to the party.
6948433	6948713	All right.
6949234	6954979	Anyhow, no word, however, if this is something that's coming to our side of the pond, we'll see.
6955039	6958462	I imagine it's one of those things that might surprise us in a future Nintendo Direct.
6958942	6963045	I would imagine maybe they are trying to incorporate some other services that are big here.
6963145	6965447	I can't imagine they wouldn't try to do Facebook.
6966188	6966989	I'm trying to think what other...
6967748	6971050	Look, I just hit Tom Nook with a bug catching net.
6971851	6972211	Right?
6974753	6975313	I think it's great.
6975333	6977095	I just made somebody fall into a hole.
6977215	6978656	I hope they incorporate more of this stuff.
6979036	6982479	They should do this type of instant screenshotting for virtual console games.
6982499	6988643	See, I would have loved something like this when I was playing the first, well, technically the second Animal Crossing on GameCube and had my town lesbian.
6990172	7014361	or like look what crazy shit I got this guy to say I know like well we had what one character because I think we brought over your card to have our our town people meet and now like half of my town members started saying pussy and then we brought it over to Adam's house and with his and on his wife's game and then half of her town started saying it too
7015615	7017776	Yeah, I caused an outbreak.
7017956	7018737	You're a virus.
7019117	7019597	I was.
7019838	7020698	Rob caused an outbreak.
7020818	7031304	I got one that said a really, really nasty word, and there was a certain friend at the time that really did not like that word, and it ended up moving to her village.
7031324	7038869	She worked for months, from what I hear, to get rid of it, so...
7039529	7040070	Oh, man.
7040150	7041230	In retrospect, I feel bad.
7041290	7042211	Memories.
7042451	7043132	But, yeah.
7043412	7043732	Memory.
7043992	7045973	Animal Crossing ruining lives left and right.
7046574	7046874	All right.
7048275	7050736	This is the part of the show where we would do the mailbag.
7051477	7054199	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7054359	7055119	Lol, nope.
7056800	7058321	But no emails tonight?
7058782	7059822	Freeze Pop emailed us.
7061083	7063585	They're selling merchandise to benefit the folks in Boston.
7064116	7064736	Oh, well, that's cool.
7064756	7065356	They are from VOD.
7065376	7065796	That's great.
7065957	7068057	Yeah, so go check out Freeze Pop's merchandise.
7068097	7068837	We love Freeze Pop.
7069417	7073279	I almost sang Sprode last night, and then I was too drunk.
7073379	7078860	And the reason why I kind of snickered in the beginning is because we get a lot of stuff from them all the time about what's going on.
7078880	7081201	But that is definitely a cause worth plugging.
7081221	7084082	Well, I'm going to give it one more refresh just to see.
7084142	7084742	Just in case?
7085002	7088603	And if anybody sent me an asshole email in the interim, then you're banned.
7090244	7090504	Nope!
7090884	7091905	Send us one for next week.
7091985	7094567	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Send me something funny.
7114404	7115225	But you know what?
7115305	7118346	It's okay because if I'd played it tonight, I wouldn't have had anything for next week.
7118426	7123109	So don't forget to send in bumpers and more details are available at thevognetwork.com forums.
7123909	7125790	Use your gaming voices to tell people stuff.
7126831	7128912	Alright, what are you... Something coming up.
7129212	7130033	Mewing out over there.
7130093	7130413	Alright.
7130653	7131453	Something looks hideous.
7131734	7133414	Alright, well let's do the FUs of the week.
7133494	7137917	Speaking of hideous and wrong... And horrible.
7153752	7155973	to the girl who is at Panda Express.
7157334	7158314	Not one working there.
7158714	7163517	She walks up, this girl walks up to my car and says, Hi, can you please buy us dinner?
7163577	7165157	My mom just lost her job.
7165978	7167959	Which, she was totally lying.
7168459	7174422	I mean, it was, she was there with her friends hanging out and drinking cups of water from inside the... Not an Oscar winner.
7174782	7175002	No.
7175482	7177863	And I was like, and so I just looked at her and said, No.
7179324	7181565	And she's like, but we need food.
7181585	7184126	I was like, there's assistance programs.
7184466	7186046	I'm not even going in Panda Express.
7186266	7194629	And I went into the Rite Aid because it's like right next door because I wanted to buy cheap crappy sunglasses to wear over my regular glasses.
7195433	7202902	and then, um, so I walked back, um, in, um, to go find my food and I'm sorry I didn't get you any hot and sour.
7203303	7203703	It's fine.
7203763	7206387	I actually ended up having Panda earlier today by coincidence.
7206507	7207468	So it works out.
7207988	7214536	Well, um, so anyway, um, by the way, the guy who talked about my hair a couple of weeks ago was there and he said, you did your hair that way again.
7215237	7222323	Um, but, um, the girls were sitting out there just being completely stupid and harassing customers, but they didn't have, like, any kind of security going on.
7222844	7224605	They had no way to ask them to leave.
7225546	7228949	So, I was like, oh, I am so sorry, your customers are being harassed right now.
7229690	7234334	And then, um, to the Audi, the person driving the Audi who kept trying to pass me, no.
7235855	7236396	Well, no.
7236416	7236456	No.
7237159	7237460	Loki.
7238881	7245430	I don't want to go all Seinfeld, but seriously, what's up with bicycles built for two?
7246791	7250656	Seriously, I saw on the way here, there's a lot of bikers out right now.
7250676	7251217	Like a tandem?
7252972	7257313	Yeah, like, it's a bike with two seats and people both pedal.
7257873	7258113	Okay.
7258373	7258873	I don't understand.
7259113	7264395	I think you meant like the one in back, like the classic tandem bicycle or if it had a buggy or something.
7264675	7268696	No, no, no, the classic, like you see it in cartoons where it's a bicycle built for two.
7269136	7270516	Riding through the park together.
7270676	7271536	Like the Muppet movie.
7271576	7274377	Yeah, like, I understand, you know, if you're on vacation or something like that.
7274437	7276098	Well, let's get a bicycle built for two.
7276158	7280959	But these were people that were, you know, the bikers that you see out on the road that dress up.
7281639	7283600	The ones that, like, have their team sponsored.
7284040	7286401	You're not sponsored by any fucking person, okay?
7286501	7288021	You just have this stupid biker thing.
7288521	7289902	It looks ridiculous.
7290482	7293883	You look ridiculous in a bicycle built for two.
7294183	7300065	Like, I'm supposed to be, you know, convinced that you're training for your bicycle built for two marathon race that you're gonna be in?
7300125	7302866	I mean, come on, it's just... Now that song is stuck in my head.
7303797	7304357	It's just weird.
7305338	7305718	I don't know.
7306859	7307860	It just annoys me extra.
7310201	7310922	My FU of the week.
7310942	7312143	I'll keep it short and sweet.
7313684	7317246	F you to those bastards that set the bombs off in Boston.
7318066	7321369	That was some straight up fucked up crap.
7321809	7322709	Or the MIT shooter.
7323630	7324851	That was all the same guys.
7326872	7327212	Oh, really?
7327232	7328233	Yeah, the same people?
7328253	7330414	Did you not see the fuckery that blew up everywhere?
7330754	7331874	I just saw that it was somebody.
7331894	7333235	I didn't see that it was the same people.
7333895	7337297	It was fucked up, but you know what?
7337337	7344520	Props to the city for banding together to stay safe and find the guy.
7345100	7351103	Well, they killed one and arrested the other guy who's like half alive right now, so maybe they'll be able to get some answers.
7351923	7352923	Don't be the hardy boys.
7380563	7385068	Bobby had an interview with a very nice developer who's making crime games.
7385128	7387291	And if you want to go solve crimes, go play her games.
7388552	7392557	But I do have to agree, though, that major kudos to the Boston Police.
7394799	7395080	All right.
7397202	7398743	But also F you to CNN.
7398843	7400325	God, they fucked up this week.
7400866	7401166	Anyway.
7402207	7405571	CNN earns fuck up of the year already for me.
7406251	7408594	Just because of how shitty their coverage is.
7408994	7410756	I go to BBC for my news.
7412498	7415341	I just wait for the official press conferences.
7415861	7417263	The thing I cannot stand.
7417663	7437416	I cannot stand about situations like this is when there's a lull in actual news it's let's talk about the why let's theorize on all this crap we don't know about why did they do it or make up these theories that's the stuff that drives me bonkers when it comes to news I think you played video games
7437836	7440077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7458407	7461209	I'm really, oh god, I got into it with my mother today too.
7461229	7468214	I was super disgusted over that sort of closed-minded mentality that, oh, they ain't white, they must be in trouble.
7468994	7469434	Fuck that.
7469694	7470095	Fuck that.
7470535	7476439	When you literally cannot get, literally cannot get more Caucasian than these guys.
7476459	7478880	They were from the Caucasus Mountains.
7479120	7479561	Hi!
7479621	7480902	That is, like,
7483553	7484634	Uber Caucasian.
7485014	7486495	That is literal Caucasian.
7486695	7487636	I am with Misty.
7487796	7490658	See, shit like this is why I stick to the Bloody Weather channel.
7491639	7492119	Amen.
7492899	7493580	It's gonna rain.
7493900	7494340	You know what?
7494801	7497002	I'm about ready to sign up for that group going to Mars.
7498023	7498643	Fuck this planet.
7498683	7499084	I'm gone.
7500905	7501705	Not the show.
7502246	7503767	I will find a way to Skype from Mars.
7504187	7504627	Just saying.
7504788	7507910	Can we move on to more gaming news?
7509082	7512125	Let's talk about green people instead of white people, Loki.
7512986	7513486	Ah, yes.
7513967	7521314	So they have a mod for Skyrim that turns the Argonians into ninja turtles.
7522475	7523296	That looked frightening.
7523636	7534106	And then if you don't want to be Argonian, you can put the shell on yourself and you can be like some strange cat turtle or some chick turtle.
7536257	7540641	The dude that they have in the picture here looks kind of like The Rock wearing Turtle Shell.
7540681	7541763	He's like, what?
7541803	7542684	I'm totally serious about this.
7543845	7544986	But yeah, you can check that out.
7545246	7556478	I don't know if it's on ModDB or if it's actually one of the... It's probably on ModDB or Skyrim Nexus.
7556558	7558520	Yeah, Skyrim Nexus is where it's at.
7559361	7562706	and yeah, check it out if that's your thing.
7563467	7568214	And maybe this gives you an idea what the new Michael Bay movie is going to look like because it's terrible.
7570276	7570576	All right.
7570876	7577561	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7578202	7578922	This is pretty cool.
7578982	7582145	A new album being produced for record label Game Chops.
7582205	7583546	It's called World 1-2.
7583886	7586548	It's not just about Mario.
7586668	7593113	It's about kind of like what's new and what's going on in bit rock and all that stuff right now.
7593773	7608697	including people like super hexagon composer Chip Zell, Manami Matsume who did Mega Man and we talked about also doing some tracks for Shovel Knight, Austin Wintory contributing to this, Akira Yamaoka apparently going to be on this too.
7608957	7609857	I would marry that man.
7610478	7612098	The album comes out May 2nd for $10.
7613418	7615659	You can check out some of the tracks on
7616619	7644507	on the website music.gamechops.com the full URL is slash album slash world dash one dash two but I'm sure if you get yourself to music.gamechops.com you'll get to see some of this now sadly we can't preview the Akira Yamaoka track for you because it's not there but I could try to play a little bit of this this is the Manami Matsume song one shot one kill Matsumae excuse me can I play this
7647975	7650557	I want to play a little bit of it, but it's not working.
7650898	7651798	LOL Live Radio.
7651838	7652179	Crap.
7653880	7654781	LOL Live Radio.
7654821	7656382	Let me see if one of these others will work here.
7656662	7658604	Let's try this Chip Zell track real quick.
7662207	7663248	Live Radio.
7663748	7665670	Yeah, it won't work for some reason.
7667597	7668538	You gave them the website.
7668558	7669838	They can listen to it if they want to.
7669858	7670698	You can check it out for yourself.
7670758	7673079	After they've listened to us.
7673859	7676360	Or you can try to run both at the same time, but it might give you a headache.
7676380	7680762	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7680782	7682422	If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome.
7682622	7683102	We'll talk.
7683262	7684623	We can talk about whatever tonight.
7684723	7688844	I know we're getting to the last part of the show a little sooner than usual, but let's be real.
7688864	7691145	The last few shows have all been like three and a half hours, so...
7691345	7693627	Well, now I can go get my grocery shopping time.
7693667	7693907	Right?
7694527	7695007	Well, we'll see.
7695047	7697729	We still might have some calls coming in that could be a good time.
7697749	7701872	So again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7702973	7703933	Last minute stories, Loki?
7703953	7705094	I don't know if you have anything tonight.
7705595	7707696	I just am shopping on Steam.
7707736	7709817	I picked up Surgeon Simulator 2013.
7709937	7710778	Of course you did.
7711298	7716442	And they also have a double pack of Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World for 99 cents.
7716962	7717202	Hmm.
7717803	7718663	So that's not bad.
7718843	7719364	Not bad at all.
7719824	7721745	I think the Portal games were on super sale this weekend, right?
7721765	7722726	Yeah, but I already have Portal.
7722746	7723747	Who doesn't have Portal?
7723767	7730511	I would think most of our listeners picked that up by now, but if you didn't, for whatever reason... I mean, I'm surprised it's not $0.99 yet.
7731552	7732593	They'll probably give it away.
7732613	7740338	They gave Portal away, literally, at one point, and I'm sure Portal 2... Portal 2, right, I think was at a 50% off sale just a few days ago.
7740358	7741199	Oh.
7742160	7743801	Yeah, I think that's the whole one this weekend anyway.
7744281	7744461	Yeah.
7744721	7746823	All right, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to the phones.
7746863	7747804	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7747824	7748144	Who's this?
7751127	7752828	Hola, bienvenidos a... Hey, this is X-Link.
7752888	7754169	Hey, X-Link, how you doing?
7755370	7756390	Hey, doing good.
7756991	7757531	Long time no talk.
7757551	7757811	How are you?
7757831	7759172	It's been a long time since I've called in here.
7759232	7761974	Happy... Last week, happy 500 episodes.
7762014	7762574	Thank you very much.
7762594	7763395	That's been awesome.
7763415	7767778	500, that's very... A lot of episodes, so... We're so old.
7771016	7786996	I was calling in because I was excited by Earthbound but I was a little disappointed because during the announcements for it they were saying that it was coming for the Wii U and I was hoping that it was also going to come for the 3DS because I do own a 3DS for that and that is one of my favorite games playing while growing up.
7788088	7800960	Don't count out the 3DS, but I have a feeling they know a lot of people want Earthbound, and so they'll probably keep it exclusive to Wii U, because if you can even sell a handful of consoles to people that really want to play it again, they'll do it.
7801500	7804543	Again, I don't know why you just wouldn't get a Super Nintendo and get the cart, but the cart...
7805684	7810067	is not exactly... I mean, it still goes on eBay for like $150, right?
7810248	7811729	I just like the portability of it.
7811749	7819894	I like the fact that usually when I go to work, sometimes I take the bus and stuff, so it's kind of nice to have it so when I do the bus trips, it usually takes about 30-40 minutes.
7819935	7823617	I can just sit there and just, you know, level up my character or do whatever it takes.
7823957	7825258	Just play and have fun with it.
7825779	7829521	Why won't Nintendo just open it up so you buy one, get them on all consoles?
7829622	7834165	That would be the... You know, they're still making money not doing it that way, so...
7834588	7838810	You know, they should take that, but then again, that's a playbook out of Sony too.
7838850	7845832	Sony kind of does that with some of their games with the PSP to the PS3 or, you know, vice versa kind of deal to that.
7845912	7848493	So, I mean, I don't know about the Vita, but...
7850014	7862462	I was referring more to the fact that you buy some of their quote-unquote arcade games, their lower-end games, like the pinball and stuff, that you can actually play on both systems without worrying about rebuying it like six times.
7862482	7862822	Not like that's
7871728	7880230	nothing against it because believe it or not here in the household here between me and my girlfriend we had bought Planes vs. Zombies like six different times for six different, almost six different forms of platforms.
7880390	7881630	I think a lot of people did.
7884270	7886731	So, you know, I do look forward to that.
7886811	7889771	Also, really quickly, Rob, you really love League of Legends.
7889811	7891312	I would love to sit there and play with you.
7891392	7893612	I think you would have a lot of fun with that over Doa.
7893672	7897033	Doa is just, the game is a lot of fun.
7897113	7897853	There is a lot of
7899062	7920388	I swear I'm gonna give League of Legends the good old once over, but I gotta finish up a game, I gotta write a review for it first, and then I can get into League of Legends over the next week, while there's still not a lot going on for me in WoW right now.
7920448	7921928	Well, it's one of those games...
7922388	7948176	where it's nice enough where I can go in there and play a game for an hour or two and not worry about anything like right now I'm level 19 out of 30 so I'm working my way up to 30 right now but it's nice enough where I can sit there and play a game or two and not worrying about that you know I have to worry about subscription fee or anything like that unlike some other games like WoW or something what worries me most about League of Legends though is the other people I hear the community is really awful in League of Legends like no offense to the fans out there but I have heard your community is really awful
7949099	7954266	There is a lot of people that are really awful in the game, but there's also a lot of good people in the game.
7954326	7954967	It's good and bad.
7955047	7957009	But WoW is not that much worse.
7957210	7959893	I mean, look at the people on there from Kel and stuff.
7959953	7962216	I mean, it's just the horror stories.
7962256	7964279	I can tell you just sitting here just, you know...
7964839	7965520	Talk about that.
7965600	7967281	But, you know, that's with any game in general.
7967301	7968742	You're going to have the good along with the bad.
7968822	7972764	But, you know, that's the fun of it, like playing with friends and stuff.
7972784	7975466	That way you don't have to worry about that so much, you know.
7975526	7981310	And it's like one of those things where if you do something wrong or something, people will point it out saying, hey, by the way, you're not doing this right.
7981590	7985433	You should do this instead or just follow this or go here and look at this.
7985453	7986374	Kind of like they do in WoW.
7986414	7994219	And it's kind of nice to know that there is a lot of people that's willing to work and, you know, as long as they're a lot good as there is bad with a lot of games.
7994879	7998082	All right, well, I will give League of Legends a serious try.
7998442	8002005	I've fired it up a couple times, but I haven't done anything serious with it.
8002045	8007389	But I will take my friend's offer to help school me a little bit on it, and I'll let you guys all know how it turns out.
8007449	8008289	But give me a couple weeks.
8008610	8009130	Give me a couple weeks.
8009150	8014314	Like I said before, if you need any pointers or anything, I'll be more than happy to... How about I kick your ass at it?
8015155	8016856	Yeah, okay, you want to do that, that's fine.
8016876	8019238	I'd be more than happy to do that, play a one-on-one game with you.
8020640	8022802	I can stream it on Twitch like everybody else.
8022862	8023342	It'll be fun.
8023442	8024303	All right.
8024443	8024743	Excellent.
8024823	8026325	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8027265	8029207	That's pretty much about it for right now.
8029407	8029788	All right.
8030008	8030568	Well, have a good one.
8030608	8032370	I just wanted to get my input out of Earthbound and stuff.
8032430	8037814	I'm also kind of worried, too, wondering what they're going to do because now they're announcing this after so many years.
8037834	8045680	I'm kind of wondering if they're going to sugarcoat it or take stuff out or what they're going to do to replace it because I know a lot of the issues they were having with that was with the music.
8045720	8047322	So I'm kind of curious to know...
8047903	8053472	I am very curious as well to see if it comes out unedited or if they make any changes.
8053652	8057178	It will be very interesting because they're not going to announce it until it's already out.
8057239	8057759	So we'll see.
8058789	8059569	Yeah, of course.
8060110	8061750	That's probably an E3 thing too.
8062171	8064151	As long as the happy, happy cultists are still there.
8064171	8064792	They're my favorite.
8065012	8065292	Alright.
8066052	8066853	I'm sure it will be.
8067613	8069854	They remind me of Shane because everything has to be blue.
8069974	8071034	Blue, blue, blue, blue.
8071375	8071655	Alright.
8072555	8073095	Take care, buddy.
8074336	8075116	You have a good night, man.
8075156	8075877	I'll talk to you later.
8075897	8076317	You too.
8076477	8078338	Bye.
8078358	8078718	Bye.
8078738	8082619	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8082800	8083460	All one word.
8084280	8088262	I am still, by the way, singing the praises of Drunken Robot Pornography.
8088621	8090582	Oh yeah, you've been raving about that game on Steam and all that.
8090642	8091962	Everyone needs to play it.
8092143	8093643	It's hard as hell, but fun.
8093663	8095464	It has a catchy theme song.
8095664	8096164	Have you played it?
8097245	8097545	Um, no.
8097965	8098365	You need it.
8098605	8099086	How much is it?
8099126	8099466	Five bucks?
8099486	8099846	Ten bucks.
8100166	8100626	That's not bad.
8101527	8102907	Let's go to the next call.
8102927	8103848	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8103868	8104208	Who's this?
8104968	8106169	It's the one and only Ranma.
8106229	8107469	Hey buddy, how you doing?
8107909	8108890	Hey, I'm doing good.
8108930	8109690	I'm doing good.
8110090	8112971	I saw that DarkSakura made some new album art for Anime Jam Session.
8112991	8113372	Looks good.
8114072	8115212	Yeah, I mean...
8117707	8126349	she took my idea and just took it to the next level because that was not what I was expecting I'm just like the entire staff pretty much loves the new logo great
8127301	8128902	Well, I'm glad that you like it.
8128942	8131563	Now tell people to hire me.
8131683	8137825	If you go to the official Facebook page, there is a link to your fan page where people can contact you for commissions.
8138665	8140806	Well, I would appreciate that, trust me.
8140926	8144328	I did not mean to derail your call with singing the praises of DarkSakura.
8144348	8145168	What's on your mind tonight?
8145268	8145748	I did, though.
8148009	8149090	It's a couple of things.
8149170	8150990	It's a little bit different from what you were talking about.
8151050	8154312	It's something I've been meaning to bring up in conversation prior.
8154592	8154772	Okay.
8155592	8159377	I remember Loki bitching about Smartglass.
8159718	8162141	And truth be told, I understand where he's coming from.
8162822	8168570	But my thing is, with Smartglass and the new upcoming PS... Excuse me.
8169291	8170392	Upcoming Xbox...
8170993	8175194	I'd like to see Microsoft use more smart glass integration when playing games.
8175534	8183676	And I'd also like to see Sony get on the bandwagon with the PS4 because truth be told, not everybody's going to have a Vita.
8184036	8195618	And you know, if you're going to be beaming stuff to the Vita, which its operating system is slightly similar to Android, maybe we can get a little app on our tablet so we can kind of have a little fun with that too.
8196358	8206025	I'm not sure it can work as fast as, say, a Wii U because a Wii U, you know, uses that whole dedicated broadcasting channel to transmit to the pad.
8206125	8216652	It's a lot different than the technology in something like smart glass where your little iDevice beams to your wireless and the Xbox or whatever is on that same device.
8216672	8218113	Everything's kind of running through your router.
8218453	8220094	It actually slows things down a lot.
8220134	8224037	So it's not like your device can be a controller suddenly or anything like that.
8224077	8225358	Like, it's not going to work like that.
8225865	8229748	Well, I wouldn't want it as a controller, but like a secondary screen or something like that.
8229928	8235672	The weird thing about it is that that's what I always thought smart glass was supposed to be, and smart glass was really implemented poorly.
8236113	8239455	Like, it's another example of something that Microsoft really half-assed.
8239575	8243438	Like, they put on a great show at E3, and then they half-assed their way through it.
8243998	8246660	Connect Labs is another great example, Game Room.
8247961	8249483	They half-assed a lot of this shit.
8249503	8250043	They didn't see it.
8250643	8256628	XNA, sorry about it, but they didn't really give it the due that it deserved.
8256648	8257749	The vision camera.
8258246	8258986	Yeah, the vision camera.
8259006	8260287	I mean, the list goes on and on.
8260867	8262268	Just add smart glass to the list.
8262308	8267890	It's really unfortunate because you kind of see the potential there, especially with it being such a media device.
8268291	8275714	And watch, at E3 this year, when they're selling their little dedicated channel, they're going to push the second screen technology again.
8275734	8277235	They're going to push smart glass again.
8277575	8280036	But I really hope to hell someone calls them out on it like...
8280416	8282617	Well, wasn't this supposed to be there already?
8283177	8283977	And like what?
8284358	8285998	A handful of movies have it?
8286398	8288499	And then Dance Central and Halo.
8289079	8293161	And all Halo does is launch what is a separate app anyway.
8293961	8295402	You can download it as a separate app.
8295462	8296322	And I still can't.
8296582	8297922	You know, Forza or whatever.
8298603	8299143	That's another one.
8299163	8300203	Forza Horizon uses it.
8301023	8305545	I still can't, on my Android device, actually pull up the map.
8305685	8308185	It doesn't have any of that actual smart glass function.
8308245	8310186	It's just, hey, look, Xbox app.
8310206	8311266	We renamed it smart glass.
8311346	8314587	Smart glass ought to be a hell of a lot better than it is.
8314707	8315948	And it's really disappointing.
8315988	8316888	I mean, they could be doing these...
8317708	8325209	It might not be fast enough to be a controller, so you can't even do little sub-menus and things like that, but why not maps of levels that you're playing?
8325569	8327630	Like static images that change.
8328910	8331391	It blows my mind how ridiculous it is.
8331991	8332891	And you're right.
8333551	8334971	I don't mean to cut you off, but you're right.
8335511	8345333	But because, I mean, the Wi-Fi frequency, I mean, it is not as fast, but it gets up there because smart glass is pretty much like an over-glorified controller that...
8345433	8346814	That's pretty much what it is.
8347194	8355598	Hell, I use my tablet to tell it to play videos on YouTube on my TV through the 360 or the PS3.
8355638	8356919	That is awesome.
8357059	8357839	It's pretty cool.
8357939	8358879	It's pretty fast.
8358939	8359680	Here's the thing, though.
8359720	8363702	The new system is supposed to be running on Bluetooth versus this Wi-Fi thing.
8363782	8373606	Now they can have an app that directly communicates with it via Bluetooth instead of over Wi-Fi, so you're going to have less latency and you can do more amazing things with it.
8374287	8374547	Yes.
8377014	8386158	Well, E3 is going to be Microsoft touting all these features again, but we'll see how many of them actually excuse me, actually get implemented to its fullest.
8386619	8386759	Yep.
8387839	8389660	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
8390260	8392601	I have a funny Paxi story.
8392701	8393382	Okay, go for it.
8394242	8403226	So, we're all in one of the rooms, we're all sitting there, you know, we have our 3DSs out, we're, you know, we're swap noting and cross-friending and all that cool stuff.
8403727	8404067	And then
8405091	8408514	Bobby happens to, you know, walk out of the room because he had to go take care of something.
8409094	8417241	One of my friends in the room, he's going through his friends list and he's like, oh, Bobby Blackwolf.
8418202	8419803	I guess I'm friended with him now.
8420464	8422405	He just said it very nonchalantly.
8423715	8427459	The entire room just gets quiet and looks at him.
8428119	8429261	And he's like, what?
8430061	8432704	I say, um, that was Bobby Blackwell.
8432844	8434927	He just walked out the room.
8436963	8440944	So is this somebody that was like a fan of the show that had no idea that Bobby was right in front of them?
8441024	8449106	My friend Paul, who goes by the name of Oshie, he used to be, I think he used to be like a mod on the G4 forums and the chat room and stuff like that.
8449126	8450367	So they go way back.
8450387	8453528	So it's like he didn't realize that was Bobby in the room.
8453608	8454268	That's funny.
8456011	8459354	and we kind of gave them hell for that the whole weekend.
8459655	8460275	That's funny.
8460476	8466281	Well, you know, especially through this radio thing, I've met some people and they're like, you know, you don't look anything like you sound.
8466341	8467302	And I'm just like, all right.
8468523	8469544	How do you respond to that?
8469584	8470766	I think Bobby looks like a Bobby.
8472928	8473929	I don't know how to respond to that.
8474029	8475851	Is that an insult or a compliment?
8476031	8477212	It could go either way.
8477953	8478293	Rob.
8478633	8478853	Huh.
8479594	8481055	I still remember that cat to come.
8481075	8482735	We're walking around in the dealer's room.
8483616	8487578	Not even five minutes and the guy goes, You're Rob Roberts from Orange Sounds Radio.
8488498	8488838	Yeah.
8490059	8490419	Blush.
8490559	8491359	Yeah, it happened.
8491599	8494461	You remember when we were at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
8494681	8495261	Mm-hmm.
8495341	8496322	And one of our listeners was there?
8496882	8497402	Hi, listener.
8498563	8506406	It's a very nice, like, it's an uber compliment, but one thing to remember, guys, like, I'm not Tom Cruise, okay?
8506446	8507226	Thank God.
8507287	8508067	Thank God I'm not.
8508707	8510509	Like more Tom Cruise.
8510589	8513272	I'm a fan of video games just like the rest of you guys.
8513592	8516115	So when people are like, oh my god, you're Rob.
8516155	8518117	I'm just like, yeah, I'm Rob.
8518277	8519098	Hey, how you doing?
8519118	8519979	Tell me about yourself.
8520860	8522282	You've been listening to me for all this time.
8522322	8522922	Tell me about you.
8523903	8528308	So yeah, it's very humbling, but very flattering.
8529810	8530090	Indeed.
8531647	8531927	Alright.
8532808	8534971	Well, I'm gonna let you go, Ranma, to see if anybody else comes through, okay?
8535571	8536092	You got it, bro.
8536132	8536793	Alright, take care, buddy.
8537293	8537934	You too.
8538534	8539335	Later.
8540196	8540536	Alright.
8540556	8545361	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange... Y'all right over there in the kitchen?
8547145	8548085	Alan's making a mess.
8548706	8550446	Alright, let's go to some tweets.
8550486	8552107	Twitter.com slash OLR.
8552667	8553848	TigerClaw sending us a tweet.
8553868	8555168	You guys might have read about this in the news.
8555568	8559130	LulzSec member sentenced for Sony Pictures website hacking.
8559450	8566973	Yeah, they went after some of those guys that were involved in that and it looks like they've sentenced a few of them and one of them for the hacking of Sony Pictures website.
8567873	8571175	Not related to the Sony PlayStation Network hack though, right?
8571855	8572055	No.
8572075	8572695	Different, right?
8573456	8573796	Interesting.
8574216	8575957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8603826	8606289	And I'll never forgive Comcast for what they did.
8607049	8607490	I know.
8607830	8611394	Isn't it weird now that that's all really, really over, huh?
8612055	8612435	I know.
8613056	8614117	But you know what?
8614257	8616559	Props to Attack of the Show for the ending.
8616599	8621464	That was a very nice way to end the show with a nod to Leo Laport and Alex and so forth.
8622270	8627931	Yeah, and I know Leo Laporte is still doing his podcast and such.
8628171	8630252	And I think Chris Perillo is doing live streaming.
8630352	8634432	Yeah, they have a studio in the North Bay out in Petaluma, I think it's located.
8634952	8636553	Somebody I know went over there for something.
8637373	8640233	So it's cool that they still kind of have all that in the Bay Area.
8640253	8644234	It might not be in the city, but they're producing great content outside the city.
8645074	8645354	Right.
8645674	8648015	Anyhow, I didn't mean to derail you, but what's on your mind tonight?
8649176	8653681	So, once again, I did want to wish you congrats on the 500th episode.
8653801	8654321	Thank you.
8654462	8655883	Can you believe we're still here?
8656904	8657265	I know.
8657825	8662571	I feel old and I need to see if I can find the old episode where I was there.
8663812	8664993	Do you remember what episode number it was?
8665974	8666674	I do not.
8666754	8669635	I know it was summer of 2003, but that's all I remember.
8670236	8671256	Two tips for you.
8671356	8680860	There is the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wikia.com and Dark Tetsuya has put together an awesome little summary of every single episode.
8681160	8686922	So if you look at the summer of 2003, you might find the topics and you might go like, oh, I was there when that happened.
8687382	8692664	And then there's another website, and Dark Tetsuya will correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I think it's olarchive.com
8693024	8712226	I think it's O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot T-K I think he had to change the forwarder so he'll give me the new address here in chat in a minute but there is look for it on the VOG Network forums look for Dark Tetsuya he has the OL Archive and there's a lot of old episodes they have up on like a SkyDrive somewhere so there's a lot a lot of old shit
8713496	8713896	Gotcha.
8714156	8716257	All right, I'll have to check them out.
8716317	8717638	Thank you for the hookup, by the way.
8717678	8717978	Thank you.
8718018	8718938	There it is from Dark to Sea.
8719098	8723900	Bit.ly, so Bit.ly slash O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E.
8724220	8730823	So if you want to, and this goes out to the general listenership as well, if you want to hear what Orange Lounge Radio sounded like back in 2003, you can check that out.
8730863	8734804	But I do want to, I always kind of put this out there, it was a very different show back then.
8735365	8736705	I was busy reading Harry Potter.
8738026	8738346	Anyway.
8740855	8754978	So part of the reason why I'm calling here tonight as well, DarkSakura, I just sent over the details for Phantasy Star Online 2 for you, but there's something on my mind aside from that that I kind of want to get out there, and it's got me a little bit worried here.
8756639	8768702	Regarding that game, it was announced that it was supposed to come out here in the West, and then we rolled past the release date, and all Sega had to say was it's delayed and nothing else.
8769822	8772903	and that's not the first time that this has happened.
8774183	8789327	Colonial Marines, that just happened as well for the Wii U. Obviously that's under a different company but it's got me wondering what's up with the management because there have been other incidences with Sega recently such as the recent Shining Force debacle back in November.
8790087	8793408	It's kind of got me wondering what's going on there and
8794368	8798592	Are we potentially seeing Sega of America closing soon?
8798712	8800754	When has Sega had good management in the US?
8801815	8807019	I am hoping you are just out here yelling the sky is falling, which is perfectly valid.
8807059	8808500	You have good reason for thinking that.
8809661	8814886	But I would say E3 is kind of Sega's chance to be like, all right, put it out on the table.
8814946	8815446	What's coming?
8815506	8817408	Is Phantasy Star 2 on that list or not?
8818128	8821291	and if it's not, then I would start to get worried.
8821671	8824634	But I kind of think that's the type of thing they keep in their pants until E3.
8824874	8827075	I seriously think that Sega is still going to have a U.S.
8827156	8830078	presence regardless, even if they have to cut back operations here.
8830218	8830638	Well, sure.
8830678	8833881	A lot of Japanese companies still have an American presence in the games industry.
8835682	8841387	They may have the translations done in-house at Sega of Japan, but I was just at PAX East recently.
8841567	8847012	They did not have a booth there, so that's part of what's got me thinking this.
8847612	8849033	PAX is kind of hit and miss.
8849073	8850795	It depends if they have something to show or not.
8852256	8855139	There are some companies that don't really do PAX.
8855199	8856461	Take Blizzard, for example.
8856821	8862127	They were there at PAX East because they had something to show with this whole new Hearthstone game, but they don't usually do these cons.
8862287	8864530	Well, Blizzard's like, LOL, we'll do our own con.
8864550	8866452	Yeah, that's actually just it.
8866492	8871057	They don't usually do these things, so they kind of do it when it's convenient for them, which I don't blame them for.
8871465	8879589	For the record, I would go to SegaCon Just saying Agreed Well, what are we missing?
8879869	8883150	You're playing Phantasy Star Online 2, obviously What are the rest of us missing?
8883410	8888313	I really want to check it out at some point You mean in the game or other games?
8888373	8890914	Yeah, in the game In Phantasy Star Online 2, how is it?
8891852	8892433	Oh, wow.
8892453	8893193	Wow.
8908405	8922590	The level design is superb in that even though it's randomized, it's still got a lot of familiar elements and you can just randomly encounter a boss outside of the boss nets.
8922710	8923590	It's just crazy.
8923690	8927232	Does this mean that you can make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Phantasy Star Online 2?
8928212	8928732	I doubt it.
8929552	8933194	But can I still headshot a Wrappy?
8933454	8937215	You can definitely spend at least an hour per character just building it.
8937386	8938987	How many Rappies can I expect to kill?
8940048	8940508	Tons.
8940909	8941169	Yes!
8941329	8942030	I hate those things.
8944151	8948074	And they still play dead and then get back up and you can shoot them again or whatever.
8948194	8949055	Awesome.
8949075	8951577	My friend actually spent $100 to buy a Rappie plushie.
8951777	8952417	Oh my gosh.
8952437	8953498	It was Julie.
8953658	8954039	Of course.
8954659	8958062	Is there a big English-speaking presence on the game?
8958242	8962005	Are there a lot of people like you who are playing it even though it's not out in this country?
8962765	8963545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8980232	8986176	Basically, people got fed up with how long it was taken, and so they just ran with it, basically.
8986697	8987877	Fan communities do amazing things.
8987917	8991940	I honestly don't see Sega really having too big of a problem with it, to be honest.
8992320	8996663	Because, I mean, remember the support that they gave when they closed down the original Phantasy Star Online servers?
8998344	8998925	True, true.
8999145	9001586	They did open up the Japanese form.
9002347	9004989	Exactly, but they also provided U.S.
9005069	9009692	players with the data for their character to transfer to private servers.
9012321	9013501	I didn't think that happened.
9013541	9015602	I thought that was something that fans were hoping for.
9015942	9022046	No, because I was going to do it, but I ended up just sort of not caring because I hadn't been playing Phantasy Star Online for a little while.
9022766	9028169	But they were allowing full character transfers into private servers.
9029509	9032831	It was a limited window that they did it, but they had it available.
9035252	9036213	I'll have to look that up again.
9036690	9039201	Alright, well, Prince Brightstar, thanks so much for the call.
9039241	9040647	It's good to hear from you for so long.
9040687	9041490	So, welcome back.
9042714	9046015	Yep, I'm probably going to be here every week for a good bit here.
9046295	9046715	Awesome.
9046755	9047695	Appreciate the support.
9047815	9048836	Well, you have a good one, okay, buddy?
9049436	9049776	You too.
9049876	9050116	All right.
9050156	9050456	Bye-bye.
9051056	9051296	Bye.
9051717	9052657	Nice to hear from an old friend.
9052977	9057598	I think that's really awesome for somebody that's like, you know, I fell out of the habit or whatever.
9057638	9060439	Real life gets in the way and you don't end up listening to the show anymore.
9060499	9060919	It's cool.
9061279	9067001	But then it's like after all this time, it's like, wow, I came back and y'all are still here and it hasn't really changed that much.
9067161	9068961	You know, it's a really awesome thing to hear.
9069061	9070302	So thank you very much.
9071442	9094451	We outlived Tech TV G4 Womp womp Alright, let's see if we get a few more tweets out here I don't know if there's any other last minute stories But quickly, some more tweets from Tigerclaw Centipede creator sees lack of diversity in the game industry Hmm, is that just because it's sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel Milking out the IPs?
9094491	9098253	That's my assumption here Hold on, I'm bringing up the article here Why would anyone be surprised by that?
9098613	9100395	I haven't seen these because they're tweeted to me.
9103277	9104658	It's also depending on where you're looking.
9104678	9107140	I mean, if you're looking at mainstream gaming, then yeah.
9107380	9110003	Okay, here's the headline they're pulling that quote from.
9110443	9112084	I mean, here's the quote they're pulling that headline from.
9112865	9116508	So much progress has been made in the development cycle and the way games are developed.
9116648	9119450	This is according to industry betting Dona Bailey.
9121352	9127297	It seems there hasn't been enough progress in the diversity of game designers and gender equality for game designers.
9130799	9131039	Hmm.
9131460	9133361	Yeah, that does make sense.
9134082	9135563	And I probably totally butchered the name.
9135603	9139666	It's probably Donna Bailey, but I said it wrong because it's spelled a little differently than what I'm used to.
9139826	9140907	So, hmm.
9143163	9153706	Well, sadly it's something, you know, it's not like we haven't heard it before, but I think the best way to help combat that a little bit is prove some of these analysts wrong.
9153726	9160028	The people that say that, you know, the masses won't support a game with a strong female lead and so forth.
9160088	9171672	It's important that, and I'm not saying you have to support a game just because it has a female lead, but find the one that you like and really rally behind it and, you know, gather support for it and so forth and show these guys they're wrong.
9171993	9174924	I honestly think that we need to see more games that give you a choice
9176520	9180463	Well, I made this comment during Bobby's show, and I think it's worth exploring a little bit.
9180483	9181463	I'll bring this up with you, Jamie.
9181864	9190470	It's obviously part of a larger problem with society, and my whole thing is that let's take the dude bros who buy Xbox, and I'm totally stereotyping here, guys.
9190490	9190930	Bear with me.
9191431	9198776	Let's take the dude bros that buy their Xboxes because they're only interested in Madden games and the basketball games and all the sports games that come out every year.
9199216	9202519	Well, you can't play as a woman in Madden, but that's not video games' fault.
9203717	9204357	That's football.
9221883	9224727	It would, but I don't see it happening just because of that.
9225287	9227550	I mean, we're in a total patriarchal society right now.
9227971	9229613	Not just right now, we've always been.
9230534	9232256	And it's completely disgusting.
9234159	9236362	And I'm going to say one thing, that there are...
9237823	9244545	There are degrees of this physical expectation that's put out for sports.
9245345	9250667	But I've seen some women's NBA players who could totally school guys.
9251407	9253168	I mean, I don't see why we don't have an integrated team.
9253448	9257169	I hate to refer to the movie, but you remember A League of Their Own?
9257309	9257649	Yeah, sure.
9257689	9258249	That shit happened.
9259189	9262350	Where all the men were in war, they had female baseball teams fully on.
9262370	9264791	Well, the WNBA is a thing.
9265031	9265631	Well, yeah, it is.
9265711	9273135	But I mean, I'm saying that it's not like we haven't had a precedent for having women in sports or even having integrated sports teams like that.
9273835	9280918	It's just that people have this notion that it shouldn't be done, that it can't be done, that there's a big physical difference.
9281394	9282775	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9302243	9321390	I think that if a person is physically capable of being a part of whatever that sport is, whatever that event is, they should be allowed to be in it without having to deal with judgment because of their gender or because of any other factor.
9322677	9324318	By the way, I did close the Skype line for now.
9324358	9326240	I didn't mean to get on this discussion, but it's a good one.
9326280	9330985	So sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype, but feel free to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
9331726	9337532	Comment from ShadowNextGen, has DarkSakura seen how the UFC has started highlighting women's MMA?
9337872	9342317	The next season of The Ultimate Fighter has two female coaches that will coach both men and women.
9342357	9343398	Just curious about your thoughts.
9344016	9370545	I actually don't watch much UFC I tried watching when oh god what was his name that was in WWF he god I can't because he was just like the most boring dude ever but he was amazing to watch but he came from UFC and then I think went back to UFC and I also watched when Brock Lesnar went to UFC for a little while dude he was vicious but I didn't really I haven't kept up with it
9370953	9371934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9392273	9393453	and DarkSakura.com.
9413171	9417377	Does this do the image of the woman in sports favors?
9417798	9423025	Or does it hurt because, well, Danica Patrick's in a game, but it's cutesy la-la land.
9423225	9424648	Well, it's definitely not hurting her wallet.
9426690	9428153	Okay, props for that, right?
9429907	9436774	I don't look at it so much as a hindrance, although it is, I think, going back to a little bit more on the stereotype.
9437715	9444101	I think it's definitely getting her some getting her exposure apart from just being pretty awesome on her own.
9444742	9450588	I mean, aren't we now seeing like more women in NASCAR to like more female drivers?
9451188	9453129	She's certainly not the last.
9476124	9479366	Yeah, and Bobby points out too, Danica wasn't the first female driver either.
9479446	9480467	Yeah, she wasn't the first.
9480627	9481668	I just said she wasn't the last.
9482328	9482869	She wouldn't be last.
9482889	9491134	But my problem with Danica Patrick is that she is having to rely on stereotypes to keep her popularity up.
9491915	9496518	You know, that whole, well, you gotta show a little boob or you gotta, you know, be this...
9497859	9500700	You can't be just a talented driver.
9500920	9502120	You have to be a sex symbol too.
9503000	9503640	That I hate.
9504201	9505301	I hate, I hate, I hate.
9505361	9510662	And some people really, like you've got Ross DLUT in chat who says Danica Patrick didn't break through because of her racing.
9510682	9513443	She broke through because she sexualizes herself in GoDaddy commercials.
9513943	9518264	So you've got people that kind of resent the whole TNA, if you will.
9519500	9529105	I'm even going to go into another, because one of my heroes, because I've been trying to work out a lot more, is a weightlifter named Samantha Wright.
9529565	9531426	And she is adorable.
9531866	9539530	She's probably my height, and I think that if I kept working out like she clearly does, I would probably be about the same build.
9540990	9544952	I've looked at her because we do have a lot of physical traits in common.
9544992	9550933	I think that her body type would be a good ideal for me as far as working out and health.
9553214	9556735	But she's getting all this extra attention because she is so absolutely adorable.
9556795	9557715	She is pretty.
9558475	9559616	She's pretty hot.
9560056	9561036	I mean, I will say that.
9561356	9566678	But there have been other female weightlifters who have been just as, if not more talented, if not stronger than her.
9567478	9594779	and if you look at people who are actually physically strong and I'm not talking about the people who you know are those muscle competitions because they starve themselves to nothing they are at their least healthy when they're at a show you look at the actual strong people the people who do the strongman contest who are pulling semis with their body weight they're built like trunks and the women who participate in these they're built like you know complete
9596180	9608609	It's funny you bring up the bodybuilding because it brings to mind one of, I think, a great example of where there were very memorable men and women in this, and I'm using this term very loosely with my quotey fingers, sport, American gladiators.
9609090	9609390	Yeah.
9609470	9612012	Because there were memorable men and women on that show.
9612212	9614394	I mean, it was really like an equal...
9615995	9618857	I can tell you one thing about that, and just because I learned how to recognize it.
9619017	9623600	Oddly enough, when I worked at GNC, because we would have so many roided guys come in.
9623960	9627923	Teenagers take in that andro because of, what was that stupid baseball player?
9629024	9629865	Fuck whatever his name was.
9630465	9634728	So anyway, there's a way to tell when a woman is roided.
9634748	9635949	Yeah.
9637003	9640784	There were some women on that show who were very naturally strong.
9641264	9643784	They looked like a strong woman.
9643824	9648665	You want to see what a woman looks like without steroids, who has worked out, who has a small frame?
9648945	9650045	Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2.
9651066	9651786	I mean, I'm serious.
9652206	9655206	And that, honestly, to me, people are like, oh, she looks so bulky.
9655266	9656787	Man, I thought that was really attractive.
9657107	9659207	I thought that looking strong was a very good thing.
9660227	9661168	Yeah, Mark McGuire, thank you.
9662088	9662808	Not Barry Bonds.
9663588	9668029	Um, but then you had the other ones like, and I'm going to go back to using China.
9669549	9674970	A woman cannot carry that type of muscle structure naturally without having a genetic predisposition towards it.
9675511	9691954	And you can tell how many people are augmented who have, uh, uh, breast enhancement surgery on top of having taken steroids because it will very much give more masculine traits to a woman because your beard basically taking steroids.
9694335	9700097	I'm just giggling because some of our chatters are like, you know, Actdeft's all sports lounge radio.
9700217	9701758	I didn't mean to get this on this big tangent.
9701818	9713664	My whole point with this before we just kind of went on and on and on with it, my whole point was the whole female leads in video games and we don't have enough of them.
9714884	9722609	It's not right that that's happening, but my point I'm making with it is that I think it's a reflection of a much larger problem with society.
9722689	9724911	It's not specific to video games.
9724951	9728553	I didn't mean to go off on the other, but I think we agree.
9728753	9733196	Yeah, the whole point is that, and this I think is going really towards anything, is that
9735763	9749872	Unless you have... Even the really brilliant women out there, like just even in academia, are not drawing the biggest attention, are not being taken seriously if they don't also have a certain type of aesthetic, you know, appearance to them.
9750452	9757717	And it's really a very sad thing because you can have... Pardon me for saying this, the dumpiest looking guy ever.
9757877	9760579	You can have neck bearded, you know...
9762279	9762960	Thanks for watching!
9778122	9804046	even if she had three times the degree this guy did and had done all this fantastic biomedical research on appearances alone she wouldn't be taken seriously by the majority of people and that's where I think that we're getting into the really sad part and it doesn't and like I said it's not just affecting our gaming world it's affecting culture across the board and I get absolutely so sick of living in this society sometimes just because of it
9804730	9806251	I did think of another positive, though.
9806331	9815698	I did think of another place where I think it's done well, where we get male and female sports heroes that we failed to mention, because this is one of the few sporting events I really, truly enjoy watching.
9815798	9816258	The Olympics.
9816578	9816799	Yeah.
9817259	9826626	I think the Olympics are great, because you get a lot of strong athletes, no matter what, from all these different types of sports, and great stories and things.
9826986	9828307	That's a great thing, so...
9829027	9832890	But, you know, even then, I hear, what was it on NBC?
9832950	9837973	Well, you know, the coverage of the Olympics this past one was dreadful, to say the least.
9838073	9839734	Yeah, but that's another issue.
9840194	9844237	But what I'm saying is that you get side commentary from people.
9844277	9849521	Like I would go and look at YouTube videos of some of the events because I wasn't keeping up with it all the time.
9850001	9855425	And I would see comments, oh, well, she looks like a dude or she looks this or she looks that.
9855445	9858007	I don't know why I go into a southern accent when I imitate a stupid person.
9860048	9865512	But you still get that trying to ascribe aesthetics to what should have nothing to do with it.
9865672	9866192	Yeah, yeah.
9866893	9870155	Anyhow, Tangent Train, Tangent Lounge Radio.
9870415	9871316	That was a good discussion, though.
9871336	9871816	Sorry.
9871916	9874038	Oh, and some chatters talking about tennis.
9874118	9875358	That is a really good example, too.
9875458	9875819	Yeah.
9875959	9876879	Tennis has a lot of good people.
9876899	9878160	Mixed doubles is pretty fun, actually.
9878220	9879201	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9879501	9880662	So, good job, chatters.
9882043	9905116	Rob turned on my ranty switch Maybe some emails next week Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But for now, we have got to wrap up the show And say goodnight Oh, I may not have got all the Twitter topics I'm sorry, let me quickly try to grab some of these SJ100Matt tweeting One of the most popular card games Is being made into a game for 360 Steve Jackson's Munchkin
9906136	9906597	I don't know.
9906757	9907638	No way.
9907718	9908278	Apparently.
9909079	9911401	A link on Ain't It Cool News of all places.
9911461	9913143	That site's been going on forever too.
9914084	9914324	So.
9914965	9915185	Huh.
9915986	9916887	Very interesting.
9917988	9919549	Yeah, Munchkin, the video game.
9921191	9921591	That's cool.
9921611	9922312	That'd be very cool.
9923942	9924182	All right.
9924522	9927725	That is... I'm going to put the phone down and no more Twitter topics for tonight.
9927745	9930187	Twitter.com slash OLR, though, if you want to send us stuff for the future.
9931207	9933289	I'll get off my feminist pedestal for right now.
9933329	9934329	There's nothing wrong with it.
9934370	9937772	It was a discussion that needed to be had.
9938252	9939073	All right.
9939773	9940494	Let's wrap up, though.
9940574	9941194	We're about done.
9941555	9942956	We're closing up shop for the night.
9943116	9945998	Loki, you've been quiet over there while DarkSakura and I have been yapping.
9947679	9948179	Thank you for watching!
9965572	9967915	We should set up some time to livestream Minecraft.
9967935	9969016	That's where everything's going.
9969196	9971479	All of a sudden, all the VOG people have just gotten really into it.
9971519	9973441	Bobby's doing it, Jamie's doing it, I'm doing it.
9973601	9974402	Yeah, see, that's the thing.
9974482	9979848	I don't really know when to be on when no one else is on.
9980028	9985334	Well, I think it's inevitable that some of us are... I think I was trying to broadcast when Jamie was on.
9985394	9986174	It's just I didn't know she was...
9986875	9994561	Like, it's inevitable some of us are going to step on toes, but I think as a general rule of thumb, we just try not to be live when a live, when, excuse me, a premiere VOG show is on.
9995102	9996843	So, like, Monday nights are usually really bad.
9997163	10000246	But, you know, as long as we're not stepping on the toes of... Do you do commentary?
10000306	10001106	Do you do not?
10001387	10002628	Do you not do commentary?
10002648	10003749	What are you guys doing?
10003809	10004269	I mean, like...
10004429	10005369	I do commentary.
10005489	10006470	She does commentary.
10007530	10011011	When I was watching Bobby, he had very little commentary, but they have had some.
10011031	10016232	I do commentary, but the problem is, though, is once again, it's the whole talking in the same room with my wife.
10016352	10017632	She gets annoyed.
10018452	10021933	Even if I'm in the back bedroom or something like that, I could try it.
10021993	10022893	I'm sure it'd be fine.
10023874	10025794	So yeah, I'll hopefully start doing some of that.
10026074	10027715	And I'm going to be selling more games this week.
10028135	10029915	One of those being Injustice on 360.
10029955	10030035	Wow.
10030095	10030395	I want it.
10033716	10035398	Oh wait, all my friends have it on PS3.
10035478	10035998	Son of a bitch.
10036218	10039221	Yeah, because I got a copy for free and I don't want it.
10040582	10043204	Because I'm not in the fighting game.
10043924	10045506	It'll start at one penny tomorrow.
10046546	10048508	Actdeft says, we were doing commentary yesterday.
10048608	10050730	I missed your stream yesterday because I was out drinking.
10050830	10052591	Grandpa was in town from San Francisco.
10053292	10054133	Buy me doubles.
10054973	10057815	I got a little more drunk last night than I did on the 500th episode.
10058656	10060558	Sorry it wasn't broadcast, but it's for the best.
10062059	10068464	My final thought tonight is thank you all for continuing to listen to Orange Lounge Radio and showing up for an episode like 501 right after 500.
10069925	10072727	Whether it be live, whether it be podcast, I appreciate your support.
10073088	10076590	And I think I forgot to say this last week, which was really stupid.
10076650	10079833	But I want to say, as always, thank you for checking out the show.
