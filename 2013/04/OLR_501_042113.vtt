00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, April 21st, 2013, Nintendo announces a sequel to one of their classics. Could a cancelled TV show be brought back for the new Xbox? And an old, unreleased Sega console is unearthed.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 501 for this, April the 21st of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
It's our Blue Jeans episode, I guess you could say, coming off a high from last week in our 500th episode.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
That's so 80s, they don't really use that marketing anymore, do they?

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Well, hi there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I don't know if they use that marketing anymore. I don't know if that's a thing.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I remember those commercials where they would sing the blues, but then it was the 501 blues.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I just remember the Saturday Night Live commercials that were bad idea jeans. That was...

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Do they have those classic clips on YouTube, or did NBC pull them all? Because if they have it on YouTube, look it up.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I have no idea. Well, they had a bunch of them on Hulu, like you could watch a lot of the goth talks and...

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, okay.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
...cluffy talk.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
The funny people were on Saturday Night Live, like Chris Farley.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
The funny people were on Saturday Night Live my senior year of high school.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Or, I mean, to be fair, before somebody snaps at us, if you're not talking about the originals from 75...

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
The, what, not ready for primetime players?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, nodding my head at that, because clearly they...

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Because, hello Belushi.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
But I wasn't born yet, so...

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
But I have come to appreciate, after all this time, Gilda Radner, comic genius. Love that woman.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Ah, yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And they were all great, really.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But, 1994. Best year of SNL.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Without a doubt.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Good stuff. Good stuff.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I'll say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hi.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Did you ever watch Saturday Night Live back in the day?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Uh...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I've watched it off and on.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
There was, you know, a time where there was a lot of people in there that, you know, I thought were funny,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
and then I stopped watching them after a while, because I'm like, ah, they're not funny anymore,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
and then I came back, and they're like, oh, okay, you're funny again.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Now we're kind of at that, oh, they're not funny anymore.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Well, I don't really watch it anymore. Like, if really funny things happen, the internet blows up about it,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and there's clips on Hulu, but I remember back in the day, like when I was in junior high school,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
that was the thing, was staying up late on Saturday night to watch Saturday Night Live,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
and like, could you get all the way, could you stay up late enough to make it to the end of the show,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
or do you fall asleep after Weekend Update?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Really? You had that much problem?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
For me, my Friday night, going into Saturday morning, was, um...

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
In junior high, yes, I had that problem.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, well, this was high school, okay.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Okay.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
It was a pot of coffee, probably two, and it was Saturday Night Live, followed by Headbangers Ball,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
followed by 120 Minutes.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
So I would, like, listen to, like, Pantera and all that all night, and then go into The Cure.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Ah.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
And I love my prog rock.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Nice.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, we're going to have a Kate Bush revival tonight.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Good times.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes, welcome to my senior year.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I remember there were some video games based off Saturday Night Live.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It was the Wayne's World game, which was awful.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, the Wayne's World game was awful.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It was awful.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Bringing it back to video games, which the show is about,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
with you guys live in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
live.vognetwork.com in our chat room, if you want to join us here,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So tying it back to games, Saturday Night Live games,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
there was a Blues Brothers game, I'm pretty sure, too.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yes.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
When they had that movie, when they had the Blues Brothers 2000 or whatever,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
there was that.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Were there other Saturday Night Live movies?

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Now I'm just imagining what if there was an It's Pat game.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Did you ever see the movie, though?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It was weird.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I watched part of it, and I was like, the hell is this crap?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
You know, the Wayne's World movies were great, but not a good game.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
in our chat, says, Keir Cross Pokemon.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, lord.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Padov's Song, Why Can't I Be Mew?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
The Love Me Offs.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Mime Eyes.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Amakism.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Where the hell did you get this from?

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Only the, was that on Tumblr or some shit?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
You need to post that somewhere where I can find it on Tumblr

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
and repost that, because...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
That sounds like the type of thing that came off Tumblr.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm sorry, but...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Fifth Dream said it best, though, later on.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I want a John Belushi Samurai game.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
The Samurai Tailor.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
That was it, right?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Well, there was also the Samurai Butcher.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, that's right.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
The Deli.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
It was a thing.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
It was always him in different things, yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, but I also liked the one of Dana Carvey as...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
God, no, who was it?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
He was being...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Brian Adams, was it?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
The Church Lady?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
No, no, no.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Was it?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Satan?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, isn't that special?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
No, no, no, no, no.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Listen, it was Dana Carvey.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I think it was being Brian Adams or somebody singing the broccoli song.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Chopping broccoli.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Whatever happened to Dana Carvey?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't know.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Like, I see him on billboards.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
He performs in, like, Tahoe now, and I'm like, oh, it's so unfortunate.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I don't know.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Poor guy.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
All right, anyhow.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
From old school SNL people to video games.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Real quick before we get into our gaming week, so I'll make this quick.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
We had a big show last week, so this week might be a little easier.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Taking it easy.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
They had an Austin Powers game.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
That's sort of...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh, they did.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
That's sort of Saturday Night Live.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Sort of.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Sort of.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Thank you for looking that up.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I wanted to throw this out there real quick.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Technically, this was the other show that I do under the OLR Studios banner, which is

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Horde House, but I just want to give this a shout out because I thought this was great.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
This morning was that multiple sclerosis walk, and I've talked about it on this show a couple

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
of times.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
That finally happened this morning, and a great turnout and great participation from

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
some folks here locally and the internet and the WoW community and the gaming community

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
in general raised over $1600, if you can believe it, for multiple sclerosis research.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
That is great.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It's awesome.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It is awesome.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So now the goal next year is to outdo that.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
We're going to push 2K next year, so watch yourselves.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I'll do it next year.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
But now I'm thinking, you know, I had so much fun doing that, that we need to think of something

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
OLR charity related, like six months from now.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So it's like, you know, Horde House, OLR, Horde House.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But we're going to have to think of something to get involved with.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
I want to do one of the autism charities that is not autism speaks because they're assholes.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Controversy!

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
But whatever, whatever, we'll find a charity that's near and dear to our causes here.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
We need to have a car wash.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
You want to have a car wash?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
The OLR car wash.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We need something the whole internet can get involved with, though.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
We'll put it on live cam.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Alright, whatever.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
What else is I going to say about all that?

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, I want to give a shout out to one of our listeners, Evan, who I met today who drove

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
up from Bakersfield to come walk with us and was a huge donor and a huge part of that effort.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So I know he participates more with Horde House.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't see him in his OLR chat as much, but I want to say give a shout out to Evan.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It was great to meet you today.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I like meeting OLR fans and sometimes I meet them in very random places.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Is that the Evan that just friended me on Facebook yesterday?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Probably.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Did he have a Liara pic?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, no, he has a MS pic now.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, he had a Liara pic and now it's a...

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't know, but whoever that is, you're nice.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah, he's nice.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I met him.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You should have come out today.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
You could have met him.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Now he's going to have to come back.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I was busy sleeping.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Honestly, my goal was to get up this morning, but I think I still have like how much booze

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
did I drink on my birthday?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
A lot.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
All of it.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Most of it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So thank you for the beer, by the way.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
It was delicious.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
You're welcome.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
How was your birthday?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Happy late birthday to Dark Soccer, by the way.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Thank you.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
My birthday was gamey, as in you did not sing any Alanis at my party, Rob.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I know.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
We only made a cameo and I didn't get around to singing Alanis.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm sorry.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
But Becky sang alone for me and I ended up singing in the background, I think, because

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I was drunk.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I played keyboards for that.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
You played keyboards.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
It was good.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
I downloaded the song just so that Becky would sing it, our resident, very good soprano.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I think I sang Band on the Run once.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
OK, this was the funniest part.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
This happened after you left.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Julian, Becky's son, who is going to be six in like a week or so, he wanted me to sing.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Cute kid.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Him and the other, is that Dan's little cousin?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Cousin's daughter.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That was Hannah's daughter, Sophia.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
They were cute, being cute kids.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
They were adorable.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
But Julian was like, sing the pink robot song, which is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
So about a third through the song, Julian has the chorus memorized.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
So he's singing along to the song with me.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And it's like my second favorite song ever in the universe.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And we're sitting here swaying back and forth.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I've got a good three beers and a shot of vodka in me.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So we won't be able to get an encore now?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
No.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And Julian is singing along with me.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And it is seriously the cutest thing that has ever happened in my entire life.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
And then Midna decided to come out and be Little Miss Social, which I thought she was

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
going to go hide in the back room.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
But no, she's like, oh, my God, people pet me.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
She hates Gary.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Just saying.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
She loves everybody else hated Gary, but he was being addicted.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Gary smell like dog.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Gary was like hissing at her.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh, that's not nice.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I was like, you be nice to my cat.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
She's a good girl.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
He's calling her demon.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I'm like, don't you dare call her that in front of me.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I will slap a bitch.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
So, yeah, there's a lot of alcohol, a lot of alcohol because.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, my God, Amanda, I love you forever.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
She brought mocha vodka, like the good, expensive mocha vodka.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Wasn't she supposed to be here tonight?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Amanda?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No, she said she couldn't do it this night.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
She had to do it later night because she has something Depeche Mode going on.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
You know, she does a lot of blogging for Depeche Mode.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
That's awesome.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And she's going to like seven of their shows.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Wow.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
OK, well, she wants like like a series of twelve shows in Germany last year.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I wish I could do that.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Get your fangirl on.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, she saved up forever for it.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
But anyway, so she brought this mocha and I had like four double shots.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
And then I had two shots of this amazing, super expensive, like we're talking $100 plus bottle of tequila.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
What?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
That purple bottle that George had.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh, my God.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, my God.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's tequila that I don't hate.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It still kicked my ass.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I almost got you, Patron.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
You know what?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
You know what, Rob?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I will tell I'm going to tell you this for future reference.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
No tequila.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
But I thought you liked Patron.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I like Patron OK.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But do you know how long it took me to drink the last bottle you got me?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That's true.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's true.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I finished it for my birthday last year and you got it for me when I turned 30.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Well, then I must have had a psychic moment because I was going to get it.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And then I was like, you know what, maybe I should just bring beer.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Rob brought me Guinness and Guinness is the best gift ever.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And I'm going to cook steak with it.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
There you go.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
So.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
So, yeah, apparently the theme of my birthday was booze, which is pretty much the theme of every birthday every year.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
If I'm not at Disneyland.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And they busted out.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
George brought his Wii U and that Injustice game, whatever that DC game is.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You know how I feel about DC.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
But it was actually kind of neat, except I thought that the character models were supremely bizarre.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I've heard a lot of good things about Injustice, but not on the Wii U.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
It's interesting to me that that was the platform you got exposed to it on because I've heard the Wii U one is a little weak compared to the others.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Well, I had no basis of comparison and I'm sitting here like.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
And I'm I'm just I'm just copy pasting Internet hearsay.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
So I'm catching the end of the game when like three of my friends are passed out from booze and I'm sitting there sobering because you know how quickly that happens for me.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
So I'm like watching this game and going, what the hell is up with Wonder Woman's hair?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
That's the only thing I could focus on was Wonder Woman's hair.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And that there were two Batmans.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
When I was playing Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, I was a little fixated on how weird Wonder Woman was, too.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And then like Joker looked bizarre, but it was the right Batman. It was Kevin Conroy.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Oh, nice.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
So it was the right Batman. So. So, yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And then let me go to some quick comments from our chat room here.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
Actdeft in chat says Midna technically is a demon, though. I mean, she's the Twilight Princess.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
No, she's an imp.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
She's my baby.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Other comments in our chat room at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Fifth Dream says The Cure and Depeche Mode in one podcast. It's like Goth Lounge radio.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
No way. We're progressive. We're progressive.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm going to attack the darkness.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Let's see. Tiger Claw in our chat saying Injustice is pretty awesome. I beat the story mode.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, you see, it was Gary was playing it, but I didn't care because I was watching it.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
And so. The big thing I remember is Amanda waking up in time to go,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
that's where Depeche Mode is in this game and going to sleep.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
So now I remember that the end song was done by Depeche Mode and it was actually a really neat song.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
So. So, yeah, I mean, it was mostly, you know, a lot of us hanging out in the in the kitchen,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
in the dining room, staring at the evil bell pepper pizza.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Oh, my God, it was so good. So gross. I had to pick all the peppers off because I'm allergic.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
And then just drinking and then children running all over the place.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
But cute children who don't piss me off. So it was good.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
So that was my birthday. Well, I was going to ask about your gaming week, but I did a lot of it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
All right. Well, then why not? We'll just do our gaming weeks.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, Catastrophic Moggy gave me that Sam and Max game on steam and resonance.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
And one other game I downloaded everything.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
And I played some of the game. I'm not supposed to talk about trademark.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh, my God, I'm in love. I'm quitting. Well, so I.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Well, I play. Oh, yeah, I live streamed Mass Effect two.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
And so what I'm going to do, since we don't have anybody on Thursday, we don't have any shows on Thursday,

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
is that I'm just going to play through Mass Effect two on the stream so that people can hear me talk shit about the characters,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
which is basically all shame was there for that. And basically is all I do now when I play.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
When I play any of the Mass Effect games is that I talk back to the characters and I'm pretty rude to most of them.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
It's sort of like, what is my shepherd's inner monologue?

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
So if people want to see a play through where they're not talking back, don't look at your channel because you're a talker.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, no, it's like I'll play it mostly quiet, but sometimes somebody will say something.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
And it's like because you know how I feel about a good portion of the writing and I will just go what or good.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
No one cares what you have to say, Jacob. You know, move on. And it's that type of commentary.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
OK, I'm sort of MST three king it as I play. Fair enough. Yeah, I'm done.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
It's the dark soccer experience. I've had pinkberry and coffee and I'm very hyper.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
Excuse me. Couldn't tell. All right. Say hello as well to Loki.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
And how was your gaming week? Let's see my game week. I played Defiance.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
I played lots of Defiance, actually. And I'm up to three hundred and forty now.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
They don't really have like levels. It's just like size level. I should maybe get this game.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
It's pretty fun. Yeah. Yeah. They don't have, like I said, levels.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
It's just like your power level, I guess. Dragon Ball Z ish. But because you can do stuff.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
I mean, you do level up and your power goes up by so much.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
But you can do other things that level or raise your power level as well.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Like they have side stuff like very much like borderlands.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
I mean, the whole game is very similar to the borderlands as far as the whole style of the game.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
And so you can do like these time challenge, you know.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
OK, this is a rampage and you have to kill this many people in this amount of time.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
And it's kind of its own instance thing. And then there's also like races and stuff, which sucks because

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
when I first attempted some of these races, I was actually doing pretty well on them.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
But there was like some sort of lag in it, like I'd finished the race in the correct amount of time.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
But it would add two seconds to the clock every time. It wasn't like I was missing a pylon or something like that.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
It would just lag out, I guess. I don't know. It was weird.

16:22.000 --> 16:32.000
Thankfully, I did manage to hit silver on this, which is what you have to do to get your extra experience and levels and stuff.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But it's pretty fun.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
The only thing I don't really like about it because I have some guns that I find that are really fun to use and stuff.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
But once you've maxed up the level on those guns, you stop gaining experience on that weapon class.

16:45.000 --> 16:55.000
So I have to switch to a different saw now or a different light machine gun, I guess, to keep leveling that skill up.

16:55.000 --> 17:04.000
But it's fun. Last night I stayed up until midnight playing, basically going from one arc fall to the next.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
It's okay. They're kind of getting a little boring because it's the same boss enemy that you're fighting each time.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
Although I did find one that was a different boss bug thing that you fought. Actually, it was three of them. Three different types now.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
But they're always this boss bug thing that you have to fight.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
It's alright, but I wish they had a little bit more variety to it. Maybe that will come out later on.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
I did notice though, one of the things that they are doing is they have specific challenges for the entire season and then specific challenges for each episode.

17:38.000 --> 17:46.000
So as the episodes play on TV, you get different stuff that ties in with the episodes on TV.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
They have certain challenges that you have to do and stuff. So I thought that was kind of cool.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
So yeah, I've really been just playing a lot of that.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
It's kind of fun because it's one of those games where you may not necessarily want to play with anybody and you can do that.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
I'm pretty much soloing the whole game myself, but it's just the way they have the partying. It's not even really partying.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
It's just you kind of go to the same area as other people and you just kind of help out and you get experience for it.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
And you get your own loot and you don't have to fight over it because everybody gets loot that drops exclusively for them.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
And that's it. Whatever you see on the ground is yours.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
That's kind of like Diablo. I'm starting to see that in other MMOs. I want to say Guild Wars did that too. I can't remember.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Or Guild Wars 2, excuse me.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
It's kind of fun. So I have gotten some clan invites and stuff, but I just don't feel like joining the clan or something.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You're a loner.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, it's not that. I would be fine joining clans and talking with them and stuff.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
But my wife reads or plays on the computer and she hates it when I talk over the headset while I'm playing games.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
Because I have my noise canceling headphones on and so I tend to be loud because I think I'm talking on normal volume.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
But I can't hear myself because I have a headset on or headphones on.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So yeah, it's been pretty fun. So I've been playing that.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
I played a little bit of more Modern Warfare 3 just because I've been having trouble fighting.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, I want to play Defiance during work, like on lunch.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
But our internet sucks where we're located right now.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
One of the wireless hubs is over there that is not working so I can't get internet on my Xbox 360 over there.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
So I've been doing kind of like the survival modes in Modern Warfare 3 and that's been kind of fun.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
And multiplayer deathmatch when we can't get enough people over there.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
And really, I think that was it this week. It's been pretty much just Defiance, just playing that.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Alright, well, those MMO type of games will take up a bit of time.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah, I'm having fun even though it is very bland looking and it's not a whole lot of variety to it,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
but it's entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Well, my gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff. I revisited a few old things.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
I played World of Warcraft, of course, because I do that a lot. Still doing PvP and having fun with it.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
I did cancel Final Fantasy XI, which I talked a little more about on Hoard House, but Shane was very upset.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
But he's coping and I'm waiting for Civ 5 to go on sale so he can do his half of the bargain. That'll be fun.

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
Other old games I revisited, I random, super random started playing Dota 2 because I hadn't really ever played it.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Like I've had the game viewer for a while, but hadn't played it myself.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
And the nice thing is in Dota 2, you can set up a bot game because I'm like too afraid to play with real people

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
because I have no idea what I'm doing and playing with the bots just reinforce that.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But I was telling another friend of mine about this today and he's like, why are you playing Dota 2?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
You need to play League of Legends with me. I will teach you how to play League of Legends.

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
So Rob will be testing the waters of a few different MOBAs over the next couple weeks and I'll let you know which one I settle on.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
But I'm kind of curious what you guys out there in the O.L. Army, if you guys are League of Legends, are you Dota 2?

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
There's a couple others, right? I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. I know there's the Blizzard All-Stars. That's not out yet.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
There's a couple other MOBAs.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
There's one that's not very good. It's the Guardians of Middle Earth.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
That's not very good, but it's not really a genre I play.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Otherwise, I played some more Harmonite this week.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
There is another new game I played this week, but you'll have to wait for my review at vognetwork.com on Tuesday.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So look for that on the site on Tuesday.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
And I think that's really about it.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
Since there's the Tuesday game and then, wow, it took up most of my time, honestly.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
I was busy with out-of-town guests and so forth.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Are you at all interested in the Star Trek game coming out next week?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes, I would like to actually check that out.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Star Trek game?

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah, it's based in the movie universe. It kind of bridges the first two games together.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, I've read some stuff about it. I'm interested in it.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Some of the Star Trek games for home have been pretty bad, though.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
They were supposed to have been in development for at least three years.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Well, it was supposed to come out with the first movie, and it didn't.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
So they held it back to make it better or whatever, so let's hope it worked.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Some of the Star Trek games have been real stinkers, but I remember the Next Generation game on Super Nintendo was awesome.

22:13.000 --> 22:22.000
I actually did Star Trek Online until they went free-to-play and ruined the skill system.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
I'd like to see a game that plays like that, but on the single player.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I can never say that name. I'm so sorry, guy.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Syle says, I can't MOBA to save my ass.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
Let's see. Queen Cymia says, now, I don't really get Dota 2. How did they work that out legally?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
How did they work that out legally?

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
The creators of the Warcraft 3 mod, Valve did their Valve thing and saw this innovation in the modding community, so they hired them.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
That's where Portal came from, right? Valve does this.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
That's where Team Fortress came from. Team Fortress was a Quake mod, right?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So they do this.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
So they hired them to make Dota 2.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Obviously, Blizzard was not a fan of that, but they settled, as these legal things usually go.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Blizzard is going to call their game Blizzard All-Stars now, is their MOBA game.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
And League of Legends was never called anything in the same category,

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
but I believe someone else involved with the original Dota mod is with the League of Legends team and Riot Games.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I mean, Riot Games is doing very well with League of Legends, so, you know.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
There's plenty of room at the table for all of them, apparently.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Prince Brightstar in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
If you want a free-to-play that isn't pay-to-win, PSO2 is a great game.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm dying to play PSO2, but you must be playing the Japanese version, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Because it's not out here yet, right?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
No, I don't think they're remotely doing betas yet.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
I signed up for the beta ages ago, but I don't think that we're even close to US beta.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah, I am thinking that's an E3 thing. I'm thinking Sega's sitting on it till E3.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
They have nothing. There's literally nothing on the table for them coming out.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Well, I tell you what, there's nothing on the table for them coming out right now except for a couple PC titles.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
But there's nothing. They have no announcements so far. There's nothing pending.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
Speaking of Sega, I did overlook an iOS game I played a little bit this week, Sonic Dash.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
It's free on iOS. It is Temple Run Sonic. That is all it is.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
If you want your Temple Run with Sonic rings, there you go.

24:32.000 --> 24:42.000
I actually find it to be, I mean, the pros of Sonic Dash is that, oh, Sonic, pretty, bright, vibrant compared to Temple Run, which is a little bit drab.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
I mean, I love Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but it's kind of a drab palette in those games.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Sonic is very bright, vibrant. Characters you know. The ring sound is always refreshing to use that.

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000
But then I do find it as a game and so forth to be under polished compared to Temple Run, which isn't.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Because, like, Pitfall was really well done for a Temple Run ripoff.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
It's very interesting to see all these, like, established franchises kind of ripping on what's going on now that's popular.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
It's really fascinating to me how that kind of comes full circle.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
You actually indirectly reminded me of another game that I started.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Final Fantasy Dimensions for iOS.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Oh, that's a good one.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I only just started it, but it's cute. It's very old school.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
The control's interesting.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
The good news about that one is that it's free.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
But if you like that one, that's very similar to what Final Fantasy.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I'll get five.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, what five looks like.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah. But I don't want to pay seventeen bucks for it yet.

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
I didn't mention it in my week because I haven't gotten it yet, but my Ouya has shipped, apparently, via DHL.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So there is a chance that I may get it.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
So you'll get it next year.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
You'll get it eventually. Maybe in time for Christmas.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week. I've said enough.

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
So just quick housekeeping. Not a lot. We don't have any off shows coming up soon.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Maybe gone Memorial Day weekend, though. I might be out of town.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
But that's not until the end of May, so we'll keep you posted.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, if you go to Disneyland, take me.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
No, I'm not going to. I don't have a pass anymore.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
So?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
If I go to Disneyland, the next time I will probably go is in E3.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I still have to figure all that out, which, you know, I've been a bad boy.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
We should do DisCon.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
There's two parts to registration. I've done the first part, but not the second part because I need to get off my ass and do it.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
But I keep getting distracted with all this other stuff.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
But regardless of whether I go to E3 or not, Bobby's going to represent VOG.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
And there's a very good chance I'll go down there and go to Disneyland with him like we did last year, right?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
We went to Tronica and all that.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah. I'm actually kind of sort of interested in the Mad Tea Party now.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
Just because I've seen... I have friends that ship the Mad Tea Party.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah. No. Sorry, guys. No. Mad Flop Party. Always and forever.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Electronica for life. All right.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Okay. So Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Please follow us in our fan communities.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
And next week on the show, if all goes according to plan, which I don't see why it won't,

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
two longtime friends of mine who I've been trying to get on the show for years are finally going to be here next week.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yay!

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And I'm really excited about it.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
One of them hosts another podcast that you all ought to be listening to.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
And I'll tell you more about that next week.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Tease, tease.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
We should all do lunch.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
We will try to work it out.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Twerk it.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
All right.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Let us get into the gaming news this week.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
There was a lot of news out of Nintendo this week, right, Logie?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yes. A lot of stuff.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
They have their special Nintendo Direct thing that was all 3DS.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Mostly 3DS, I suppose.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
3DS-centric, I guess.

27:48.000 --> 27:56.000
And one of the big announcements there is, hey, we're doing a new 3DS game for the Legend of Zelda series on the 3DS.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
And guess what?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's a sequel to Link of the Past.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah, we just took the best game we made, and we made a sequel.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
I was very, very happy.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
And I'm most happy it's not another frickin' remake, that they're doing something different with it.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
And I really would urge you guys, if you are a 3DS owner, check out the trailer.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
YouTube doesn't do it justice.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Like, seeing it on 3DS is pretty rad.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Even better than the trailer, they actually have some leaked gameplay of it.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And check that out.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
There's, I think, at least five minutes of gameplay, and it looks pretty awesome.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
But it takes place in the same world as Link of the Past.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
In fact, actually, there were some people on NeoGaf, I think, that actually took some of the screenshots from the video

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
and lined it up with some of the stuff that's in-game.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
And yes, there are a few minor changes, but yes, the map is pretty much the same.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
Or at least it appears that's going to be what happened.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
So that's pretty awesome.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And then a whole lot of other stuff.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
So first off, you've got Pikmin 3.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
We were wondering when the hell this was supposed to come out.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
It was supposed to be a near-launch launch window title for the Wii U.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
I'm still not sure if it's launch window, because it is now August 4th.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Game and Wario now coming out June 23rd.

29:16.000 --> 29:25.000
There's going to be a brand new system update for the Wii U, I guess, pretty soon this coming week.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
And it's supposed to add some stuff that they were teasing about before on some of the other Nintendo Directs.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
One of those being the ability to install updates while playing other games.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
So you're going to be able to install software and updates and that kind of stuff.

29:38.000 --> 29:48.000
And also improve load times from starting new apps up to switching between stuff and returning back to the Wii U menu.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
Also, if you hold the B button, when you start the system up, it will go into Wii mode.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
In case you want to play a Wii game, you don't have to take all those extra steps, I guess.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So you can play with your Wii easier?

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
Yes. And you'll be able to transfer data between USB drives and some other stuff.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
So that's kind of neat.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Let's see...

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
Also, to kind of coincide with the whole Legend of Zelda announcement,

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
they're going to be putting up Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on the 3DS eShop.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
That's May 30th.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Wii U virtual consoles coming out next week as well.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They're going to be...

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Which game are they launching with here?

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Doesn't say what the brand new game is, but basically the launch line up.

30:37.000 --> 30:48.000
Excitebike, Super Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch-Out!, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, F-Zero, and GBA games and Nintendo 64 games planned later on.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
New Yoshi Island game coming to the 3DS.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
I'm not sure if that's going to tie in with that new Yoshi yarn type game that they have coming out later on.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
But they showed a little bit of footage of it and it looks just like Yoshi Island.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Mario and Donkey Kong minis on the move coming to the eShop on May 9th.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
New Super Luigi U DLC coming to New Super Mario Brothers U later in the summer.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
New Mario Party is supposed to be coming out this fall.

31:22.000 --> 31:32.000
Mario and Luigi Dream Team coming out in Europe July 12th in North America August 11th.

31:32.000 --> 31:38.000
I think Jamie and I want to piggyback on this with a few other announcements and then we'll kind of break this down a little bit because it was a very busy conference.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
But one of the other things announced here is that the Wii U is going to get the spring system update next week is happening.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
So that's nice. That's happening very soon.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
This is going to be the one that helps improve the loading times dramatically apparently.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Changing between the different software is supposed to get better.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah because it's super slow right now.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Yeah it's not that great right now.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Some other little features you might not have known about.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
I mean that's the one everybody's waiting for but also you're going to be able to transfer data between the USB drives.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
And you can install background downloaded software while playing other games.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I didn't realize you couldn't do that now.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
I thought you could do like remember because remember the system updates you can kind of install those while you're playing.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Well regardless that whole thing is going to get better so that's good.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
And the Wii U will continue to download and install software while the system is powered down.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Which you don't have to go set yourself on that screen and wait for it to do it.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
I mean these are all things that seem very logical in this day and age so thankfully they're catching up there.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
You can also, this is pretty cool, hold the B button at the start up to go right into the Wii mode.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
So like if you just got Pandora's Tower or something and you're playing it on your Wii U.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
It's a great way for you to just bypass all the crap and go right into the Wii if you want.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
It's stupid that you can't just, can you just put in like a Wii game into your system and have it just boot up?

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
No it has to go into the Wii shell because I think the way the console-

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That's so dumb.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
No I think the way the console's built is that they have the, I think you have a Wii in there to do all that.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
But that's still really dumb.

33:04.000 --> 33:11.000
It's weird but I mean if they're using different graphics processors and all that then I get it.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
I mean it's weird but it might just not be technically possible.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
I think Loki touched on this a little bit talking about some of those Virtual Console releases.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
But just to confirm, Virtual Console happens on Wii U next week.

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
Launch Lineup, Excitebike, Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight and F-Zero.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Some of those games have already come out through the 30 Cent program.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Like I know F-Zero is one of those, Balloon Fight, Punch Out.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
Some of these haven't happened yet though. Super Mario World isn't one of them and I don't think it's in the lineup.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
No.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
I think, is the next game Super Metroid? No the next game's like a Yoshi game I think.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
I was gonna say Super Mario World, that's like 30 cents, hell yeah.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
But GBA Games, a part of this, which is cool because that wasn't on Wii.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
You didn't have GBA Games on Wii, you had them on DS, 3DS, but not Wii.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
And I think you only got Advance games through the Ambassador program.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Have they done Advance games? I don't even know. I don't think they have.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
So this could be interesting, what'll happen there. Don't know why they wouldn't.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, Nintendo 64 games coming out in the future as well.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
Which were on the Wii, so you know, for most people it'll be an upgrade I suppose.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
And then Dark Soccer, I think you have a Whopper bit of news for us too right?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Yes I do, if Bobby will stop spoiling.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
Seriously, stop telling about the future. You know what happens, you watch Doctor Who don't you?

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
Anyway, Earthbound is going to be coming out in North America and Europe as in Mother 2, as it was in Japan.

34:41.000 --> 34:47.000
It will be on the Wii U Virtual Console towards the end of the year.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
And there's not a, I don't see that there is an actual release date on it yet.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
But I'm expecting them to have a date out before E3.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
I mean, unless they're saving that date for E3 or whatever the hell they're doing.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
That'd be a pretty good bullet point in E3 Ants about it.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Well that could be one of those things where it's like, oh yeah remember how we said Earthbound was coming out?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Go get it, it's up now, right now.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
No, why don't we get Mother 3?

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
Well you know the fan translators offered to give it to Nintendo for free, but legally I don't think that can happen.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Why if they agree to it? I don't see what...

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
I think it's just weird territory.

35:26.000 --> 35:33.000
Because they had to do things that Nintendo doesn't endorse per the terms of license in order to mod the game.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Like dumping a cartridge to your computer is not something you're supposed to do to begin with.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
It's not in your user agreement that is that fine print in the manual.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
So I think if Nintendo were to legally acknowledge that, it puts them in a really weird place.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah but people do a lot of stuff they're not supposed to do all the time.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
I know right.

35:51.000 --> 36:00.000
I think that they would find a way around it if they wanted to find a way around it.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
It's their property, they can give the permission. But, leaving it there.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
But I'm excited even though I already have it.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah I'm excited about Earthbound 2 just because it's a much...

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
For those of us that don't have a cartridge lying around, which I don't anymore.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Now I'm kicking myself for selling this shit years ago.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
But it's a nice way to pick it up again.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And the Wii U Virtual Console is pretty good.

36:26.000 --> 36:33.000
They pulled it off very well, the sound sounds great out of the four speakers between your TV and the gamepad.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
Well I need to come over and actually just sit and play the Wii U for a while.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
But we're probably holding out for the PS4 ourselves.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
We're pretty... So far that's where we're landing at home.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Okay.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Alright well, so we're curious. There was a lot of Nintendo news.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm curious in here in the room, what were you guys most jazzed about from the Nintendo...

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Well first off, I should take a big step back.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
Because Loki, you're the biggest critic of Nintendo on this show.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Were you moved at all by this Nintendo Direct? Or were you like, meh?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I'm the biggest critic of everybody.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Okay fair enough.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
None of the news... I mean once again I'm not gonna go buy a system.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
I'm not gonna go get a 3DS again just for Legend of Zelda.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
I think it's cool that they're doing that game.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
A lot of the other announcements I couldn't really care about.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I mean like Yoshi's Island. Eh, whatever. It was cool.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
You know, do a sequel I guess.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
I'm just... I mean at the same time I like that they're doing sequels to their old titles.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
But I kinda wish there was something new.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
Like, just something new from Nintendo.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Because a lot of it seems to be going back to rehashes of old things.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
And I know everybody loves nostalgia, but I just want something new.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
Like a brand new property from Nintendo that doesn't resemble Wii Sports.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That doesn't resemble Nintendo Land.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
It's not a 2D Mario remake or something like that.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I want something... like Mario Galaxy was a good example of something.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It's sort of like Mario 64, but...

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah, but it was so different.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Exactly.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, I mean it's Mario, but it's really not. You know?

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah, I want something like that.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
You know? That would be...

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
Even if they put Mario or Link's face on it, you're okay. You just want some new ideas.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Yes, I just want something new.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I mean, because a lot of... and...

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
Don't get me wrong. I think that the whole, you know, new Zelda game is pretty awesome, but...

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
I mean, I guess it is a little bit different.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It's a different approach to it in the same world and stuff.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
It's all 3D now, but...

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
I don't know. I just kinda want something new from them.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I guess. Something innovative.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Ross Steele, UT, in our chatroom says,

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
I wasn't really jazzed about anything. The 3DS is doing fine.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
We need Wii U news and not fucking Earthbound.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
I think there's a reason this is happening now and not at E3.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Because a lot of people are saying, like, shouldn't they have announced the Link to the Past sequel at E3?

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
That seems very weird that they would just on a random day of the week for no reason announce a Zelda sequel.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
You know, it's a pretty big deal.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
I'm hoping that means they are clearing space for...

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Well, that's what they did last summer. They have three Nintendo Directs and their stupid press conference.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah. Well, also, keep in mind, Nintendo can only really speak to a lot of Nintendo stuff.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
They don't always get into third-party stuff.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
They do, obviously. They do sometimes.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
But, you know, sometimes a lot more third-party information comes out at E3.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
Which, considering the Wii U could really use a boost from third parties, that would be a great thing.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
Do you think maybe Bayonetta 2, this E3, do you think they've been able to push it out this fast or maybe not?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
No.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It needs to be on stuff other than the Wii U.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
It won't. It won't.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I know, but it needs to be.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
It won't.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Never say never.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, never say never.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Never say never. And here's why. Here's why.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Because...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Don't stop believing.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Tecmakoe developed Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge for the Wii U.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
It was published by Nintendo.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Came out in other systems later on. Published by Tecmakoe.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
They could easily, if it flops, and I'm sure...

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
I'd hope that they have something in there that says, okay, this game flops, so we can put it out on other systems.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
I think it'll come out later on. I think it's gonna be like a time delay.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Like, they're gonna have a window or something and then it'll come out later on.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
All five of you who bought a Wii U here a month later. Here, everybody else.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I kinda think they're gonna price drop at E3.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I think that's just what the inevitable thing is gonna happen.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
I think they might sneak out the Wii backwards compatibility.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I don't think a price drop's gonna help.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I mean, it'll help, but it's not gonna be enough.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Because the excuse is, right now, I think there's nothing I can play on it.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
All they have to do is exactly what they did with the 3DS.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
If they do exactly what they did with the 3DS at this E3.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
If Reggie comes out on stage and says, you want some fucking games? Here's some fucking games.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And then bam, bam, bam. It's gonna fix everything.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
It's easy to sit here now and say no.

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
But when he comes out on stage, if he goes F-Zero is fucking happening on the Wii U.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Like, done. Nintendo is saved. Hurry up.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I don't think they're gonna have time because, okay.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
But they pulled Mario Kart 7 out of thin air. They pulled the, what was the other game that came out?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Well, let's just say it was being worked on behind the scenes.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Exactly. They could still be working on stuff that we don't know about.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
There's such things as NDAs and people who don't break them.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
I just think though that, but right now we know that there's no EA.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
For example, there's no EA Sports titles for the Wii U at all. Nothing.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
No Madden. No FIFA. That's it.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
And so far, no NBA 2K either.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
So, I mean, I understand if you're thinking about purchasing a new system.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
And let's say a lot of mainstream people that buy games do play Madden or do play a sports title.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
You know, not everybody. No, I don't.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
But a lot of people do. And that's kind of disappointing.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
That not, you know, it kind of makes you think, hmm, do I really want to get, you know, a Wii U?

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
Or do I want to pick up another system that's gonna actually have the games I want on it?

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
And it's also a photo of lack of confidence from these publishers.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
And EA being a big publisher, you know, I don't know.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Activision supporting them with garbage right now.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But they're supporting the Wii U.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
They have the, you know, their Walking Dead game, which is absolute shit.

42:22.000 --> 42:29.000
And then followed by the Fast and the Furious showdown, which I'm sure is gonna be awesome.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
And not total shit.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
Call of Duty will be coming out, I'm sure.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
Let's see. Some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Strudels89 says, Rob such the optimist.

42:43.000 --> 42:50.000
Well, maybe a little bit. I just don't think they're gonna roll over and let all their critics get the best of them.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
They didn't do it with the 3DS. Again, I'm just, you know...

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I understand that, but what is...

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Let me say this too, because this is important. This is an important follow-up comment.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Flaco Jones says, another third place finish like the GameCube, but they'll be fine.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
And I could see that happening, that, you know, maybe the Wii U is not gonna shatter whatever this next Xbox.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
Although, if some of these rumors about the next Xbox come to play, I don't know if Nintendo would necessarily be third.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
But Sony's looking pretty good right now out of them all.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
So, you know, even if they did finish third.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
And another comment, WhatUpG says Nintendo will be fine because their handheld is doing well. Correct.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
And it does put Nintendo in an interesting position where if they do decide to just, you know...

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Okay, Wii U went all Virtual Boy, we're gonna write it off.

43:30.000 --> 43:39.000
They might be in an interesting position where they could do another console after whatever Microsoft and PlayStation does, and Sony does, excuse me.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
And it's gonna put them in a very interesting position if they fix their mistakes.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
They're not. History has shown they are not gonna fix their mistakes.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
I mean, how long has it taken them to understand how to do online?

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
Something that's been around for a decade now.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
I'm not gonna disagree with you there. If they can't get online right, they're doomed.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm not gonna disagree with you there.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
I still think that no matter what, Nintendo's gonna be fine.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
They're gonna, they're making plenty of money with their handhelds.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
I mean, basically, they could just put out a console for shits.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
And say, Hey, look, we have a console. It's called the Lol U.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Lol at U for buying it. I know, right?

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
But either way, I mean, it's, and I've seen people draw comparisons between them and Sega with the Dreamcast.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
Which I actually think that that's completely not even close to the same part.

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
Because what Sega was dealing with, they were coming off the fallout of the Saturn and the very, very awful marketing in the US.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
They also didn't have oodles of money in the bank like Nintendo does.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Exactly.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
Don't forget all that Wii money. They made a lot of money on the Wii.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
The Wii turned a nice little profit because it wasn't the most powerful piece of hardware in the world.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
That money's in the bank.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah.

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
I mean, even, I'll admit, I was standing in line for my Wii at Target.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
But we also bribed our way into the line with donuts and coffee, me and Kristen.

45:04.000 --> 45:13.000
But at the same time, Nintendo is coming off a series of successes, of near failures that they've turned around.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
They don't have that problem with the marketing that Sega came out of.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't really see where the comparison really is.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Except that, okay, so yeah, white systems don't really do very well in the US.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
But look at the Wii.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know what that was because in Japan it was, the Saturn was a silver box.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Over here it was a black box.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Just marketing is weird stuff.

45:36.000 --> 45:44.000
All right, well, before we move on to our next story, since this Nintendo Direct was one of the biggest news stories in gaming this week,

45:44.000 --> 45:52.000
we do want to take this opportunity to use our new feature on the website and go to a live listener poll.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
Let's go to the live listener poll at vognetwork.com.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
If you are at live.vognetwork.com right now, you can participate in our live poll.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Here are the answers.

46:08.000 --> 46:20.000
OMG Earthbound, OMG Zelda Link to the Past sequel, OMG Yoshi's Island, OMG Super Luigi U, or meh, Nintendo.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
Vote now, live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate in the poll, live.vognetwork.com.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
We'll see it right underneath the chat box.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I agree with Bob Coffee.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
Sega, he said Sega was dealing with shit management and no Segata Sanchiro.

46:34.000 --> 46:41.000
We would have been, okay, I don't know if anyone other than like three of us knows about Segata Sanchiro.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
Segata Sanchiro was the mascot of the Saturn in Japan.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
This guy with floofy hair, wearing a gi, going around punching the hell out of everything.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
And they did a commercial for him for the Dreamcast.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
And there was even a Segata Sanchiro game that came out on Saturn.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
If we had Segata Sanchiro, still the Dreamcast would have lived.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Interesting watching the live results of our poll coming in right now.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Mad Nintendo is winning with half the vote right now.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
Interesting, watch this as it develops, live.vognetwork.com.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
You do have to be registered at Vognetwork in order to be able to vote in the poll.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
Because, you know, there might be some little incentives on the site tied to participating.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So you should check that out.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
Okay, meanwhile, why don't we move on with more news besides just what's going on with Nintendo, right, Loki?

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
Yes, so there was a series that was on TV that I was really hopeful for.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
And then the writer strike happened and the writing went downhill.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
And that was Heroes.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
Well, the rumor is that Microsoft wants to bring back Heroes, reboot the whole series.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Obviously with new people because a lot of the cast has moved on to other things.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
But they kind of did this with Heroes on the web.

47:55.000 --> 48:03.000
They had like their webisodes or something like that with some different hero characters that the fans designed which were crap.

48:04.000 --> 48:13.000
And yeah, so I think it would be kind of cool to see a new series kick off.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
Hopefully it just didn't fall into what I like to call the matrix problem.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
Where you give a character like Neo way too much power too fast.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
And you're like, fuck, how do I deal with this next, you know, the next movie or next season?

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
Crap. Yeah, so you just need to wrap it up slowly.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
But apparently they're saying that this is going to be part of the whole TV focus.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And it might be some of the original Xbox programming.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
And I can see this happening, especially since, you know, you have series now.

48:45.000 --> 48:54.000
Well, you have Netflix and Amazon doing like reboots and brand new, you know, exclusive series for those content streamers.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
So it makes sense that they could do that.

48:57.000 --> 49:03.000
This certainly leads to the other, you know, interesting discussion that goes with this of what other series could be revived.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
Because like, you know, I'm sure a lot of us go Firefly. Can we have Firefly? Can we have more Firefly?

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
You know, that's not going to happen because then Joss is just going to kill everybody else.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
Yeah. And Fox would never. So Fox will, Fox will just not let it happen just to spite.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I think I saw that horse twitch. I'm going to kick it in its face again.

49:21.000 --> 49:27.000
But, you know, it's very interesting kind of where and we'll get into this a little more with our Fugu question of the week later on.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
But it's very interesting with all these, you know, content delivery services coming up with their own programming.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
You see Netflix doing it too with the rest of development. You know, they brought back from the dead.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
And we got Whose Line coming back.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Yeah, that's a CW show.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah, but still I'm saying, you know, there are these series of revivals.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Technically Whose Line is a game show.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
So it follows, I mean, I know it's kind of not, but it's, I think it actually follows the rules of a game show when it comes to TV.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
So it's a weird, you know, game shows come and go all the time.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
I am very disappointed that they didn't try to go all meta with, you know, Whose Line and have Bob Barker host it.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
That would have been, did she just have him guest host one episode?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
You know what though? Ayesha Tyler's a great choice.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
And she is. She's a total gamer.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
And she's one of us.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
She's a total gamer, you know, and she's, she's funny. She's really funny. So I'm looking forward to seeing.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
As long as I get my Greg Proops on there from time to time, I'll be happy.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Drew Carey was a great host, but he's got another gig.

50:20.000 --> 50:28.000
So, which is weird because Ayesha Tyler does that talk show, but you know, they, they tape like a whole three months worth of shows in a day.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
So, you know, they figured out.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
All right. Uh, let me, what else do I want to say with this?

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
Oh, um, did we talk about what kind of potential extra cost could be if they're going to save a show like Heroes?

50:42.000 --> 50:49.000
That's not going to come for free, right? Would that be Xbox Gold? Would maybe I get that as an Xbox Gold member?

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
Or maybe this is part of a new Xbox Platinum or something? Or what happens?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't think that they should be charged. I don't think they'll charge any, well.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
Xbox Platinum was that crappy little card that did nothing.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
No, yeah, yeah.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Let's say they ignored it like I did and did it again.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
Okay. Well, I don't think, I don't think that they would do that per se.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
I think that they could do more advertising, but who's to say that they're not going to be fucking greedy and still want more money on top of it?

51:14.000 --> 51:24.000
Although, it's going to be a hard sell if, like say, the PlayStation 4 still has the same type of scheme where it's, you know, regular PlayStation.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
You get online multiplayer and plus you get, you know, extra stuff.

51:31.000 --> 51:42.000
Because I got to be honest, I mean, I do a lot of gaming on the 360, but I am jealous of, you know, the deal that you get with, you know, PlayStation Plus.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I mean, it's pretty nice with that instant game collection stuff.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
But I, unfortunately, a lot of my friends are on Xbox Live, so.

51:53.000 --> 51:59.000
Alright. Well, before we get into the next story, I want to go to the results of the live poll that we took earlier.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
I got to say, I'm a little surprised with these answers, but this is why we do this, because then as we learn things, the winner of the poll, meh Nintendo, 50% of the vote.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
50% don't care. Interesting.

52:13.000 --> 52:28.000
And I was kind of looking in the chat room and just so you know, among the non-meh crowd, 25% of the vote for the Zelda Link to the Past sequel, 18.75% for Earthbound and 6.25% for Super Luigi U.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So, interesting.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Is that 6% Ronma?

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
It could be. It could be. I don't know. I could look at the results, but I'm not going to look at who voted for what.

52:38.000 --> 52:44.000
But I was looking at chat to try to figure out, like, why people are voting the way they are.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
And it seems like a lot of people are just like, you know, I haven't been convinced that I need to pick up these Nintendo consoles.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
So, you know, this news doesn't really get me excited.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
Here's my thing. I understand that they have a certain strategy with announcing titles because they don't know development cycles and how far.

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
They don't want to announce a title, Smash Brothers, well before it's going to come out.

53:06.000 --> 53:13.000
But at the same time, I would think that, why would you waste time dicking around when your console's not selling very well?

53:14.000 --> 53:24.000
And, you know, if you have stuff to announce, like a price drop, sure, you can wait until E3 and do it and make a little bit of a splash and stuff like that.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
But I would think it would be in your best interest to help your console now instead of later.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
Because the more time you wait, the worse it's going to get for you.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
Because say you have someone that's waiting for Wii U, I really want a good title to come out.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
And then it's just like nothing. You don't hear about anything for a long time.

53:41.000 --> 53:48.000
You're like, you know what, I'm just going to go get an Xbox. Money's already spent, and aw crap, they announced a good title. Oh well.

53:48.000 --> 54:01.000
Well, what also surprised me about some of the reaction I'm seeing in the chatroom as to why people voted that way is that, you know, a big reason why they do these Nintendo Directs is to get out there on the internet, why you should own a 3DS, because you don't already.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
And a Zelda Link to the Past sequel didn't sell that for people yet?

54:06.000 --> 54:16.000
Granted, to be fair, I totally know that people are like, I'm not going to buy a freaking system based off a two minute trailer. Show me the game and then we'll see. I can respect that.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
The 3DS, I don't think it has any problems whatsoever saying reasons you need to buy a 3DS.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
I think that there's plenty of games out there, they've got a lot of really good games, and I think there's plenty of reasons on it.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
I'm talking about the Wii U. That isn't there. And if they're going to wait-

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
But the Nintendo Direct wasn't about Wii U.

54:33.000 --> 54:41.000
I don't care if it's about the Wii U. The Wii U is hurting and they haven't had an Nintendo Direct about the Wii U. Except for the stupid way.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
Oh dirty, you're just Luigi, let's announce all these Luigi things. And the biggest thing they haven't announced was DLC for a game that they already put out.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
I mean, you need something that's-

54:51.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah, but like, I put this Super Luigi U DLC next to some of the DLC that other companies put out. Let's say the Saints Row DLC Loki.

55:01.000 --> 55:09.000
Okay, yes, I'll give you that, but let's put it this way. Hasn't sold any systems. Did we see a big jump in numbers after they made that announcement? No.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
No, because DLC will keep it afloat and keep people having their Wii U's plugged in, but it's not going to move the system.

55:16.000 --> 55:23.000
All that's going to happen is when it gets dropped in price, they'll bundle it with New Super Mario Brothers U Game of the Year Edition or some garbage like that.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
They'll have the New Luigi U DLC bundled in there. That's all that's going to happen.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
Well, we'll see. E3, hopefully a game changer. If not, going to be very interesting next year for Nintendo.

55:36.000 --> 55:44.000
I think Falco just made a good point. If the best thing about your next gen system is the release of a nearly 20 year old game, your next gen console sucks.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
But that's relying on-

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
But that's only really considering what's coming out of this conference. But I get it, Nintendo needs to light a fire under the Wii U.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
I'm not going to sit here and defend Nintendo. No, Nintendo needs to get more people excited about the Wii U.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
They need to pull the curtain back a little bit on what they're working on, and E3 is the deadline for that to happen.

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
But is it just me, or is there a lot of developers now just sort of banking in on that nostalgia?

56:11.000 --> 56:21.000
Well, why not? We run up to the trough and hit the feeder bar. How much did we all squee about Earthbound linked to the past?

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
Well, apparently not the listenership, but I know I did.

56:25.000 --> 56:33.000
To be honest, I'm not super excited either. I don't have a 3DS, I didn't get one because it gives me a headache.

56:33.000 --> 56:43.000
It's really hard for me to put this into words. I want to see something new and exciting, and that's why my attention has been on the indie developers.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Because they're doing the new and exciting.

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
Ross Steel UT in the chat room saying, why isn't the Link to the Past sequel on the Wii U? That'd help if they didn't ass it up with gimmicks.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
Good point. Why not this game that gets people really excited on the Wii U?

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
My assumption is because we're going to get a Zelda trailer this year.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
You won't get the new Zelda this year, but you're going to get that trailer that gets you just enough fan wank to get people excited.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
I'm going to get the new Zelda. It's the Wind Waker thing. It's supposed to be a remake.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
Oh yeah, the Wind Waker. I meant like, you know...

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Just wake me when the wank is over.

57:15.000 --> 57:23.000
I'm telling you, it makes perfect sense, and the setup is so perfect that I would be shocked if...

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
Maybe not this year, because they are a little slow to adopt virtual consoles now just coming out.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
How many months later? Six months later?

57:33.000 --> 57:41.000
I mean, so they're a little slow to adopt things, but I would be shocked that we do not see a way to play 3DS games on the Wii U.

57:41.000 --> 57:48.000
Or, let's just say that they're not going to do that, seeing some HD remakes of 3DS games coming to the Wii U.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
It only makes sense that they're going to do that.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Alright, well let's move on.

57:53.000 --> 57:59.000
Dark Soccer brought up indie developers, and this could be a place where Nintendo could...

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And it seems like something could be happening there, who knows?

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
But this would be the group you would want to get in bed with if you were a game developer.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
It looks like they're in bed with Microsoft, though.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
So is it sexy times?

58:10.000 --> 58:22.000
Yeah, but Mojang, Marcus Pearson, of course Notch, and Jens Bergensten, they have made Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2013.

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
Now, Time's 100 list kind of gets some, you know...

58:28.000 --> 58:34.000
I think Lady Gaga won or came in second place in an online poll of who's...

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
Take some of this stuff with a grain of salt, but it is nice to see gaming represented and indie gaming at that.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
And the cool thing is that Will Wright, you know, SimCity before it was, you know, this last one,

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
actually wrote the introduction talking that Minecraft was, quote,

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
a wonderful combination of accessibility and depth allowing for complex output with simple input.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
And, you know, Minecraft was an amazing thing for gaming.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
So I'm glad this is getting acknowledged.

59:06.000 --> 59:15.000
I went from payter to tolerator to digging holes in the ground prairie dogger.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I'm going to make it a point this week because I've been really bad at not going to the server.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
I'm going to play every single day this week.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
I live streamed it last week.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
I'm going to play every single day.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
My prairie doghouse.

59:28.000 --> 59:37.000
I guess apparently Time did that poll online, and this is saying that Notch ranked second in the poll.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
So it was Notch or it was Lady Gaga.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
I mean, you know, what's the difference, right?

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Lady Notch, Notch.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
They're essentially the same person.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
All right, so congrats to them.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
I'm curious.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Now the question is, what's next?

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
You know, they had that unit with the universe game was their next big project, right?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The camera, the name of the scrolls that they're doing.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yes.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They've got the you know, the fuck the games call.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
It's like 0x00.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
That's that's the one I'm thinking of.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yeah.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yeah.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So although that one, he's claiming that he's running to kind of like a writer's block almost with it.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So he's working on other things right now until he figures out what to do with it.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Gotcha.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
All right.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Let's move on.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
We're still a little ways from the classic game of the week.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Some more news for you first.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Well, now, this is something I'm excited about, even though, yeah, it's kind of me biting myself because of the nostalgia thing.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But I was super happy.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Castle of Illusion is getting remade for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It is being developed by Sega Studios Australia and it will be a, I guess, a 2.5D kind of game.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:05.000
This is a 2D 3D hybrid and it is basically based off of the Genesis slash Mega Drive game with the original director working with the developer now.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So there's a trailer out for it.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I totally recommend everybody watch it because it looks super good.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But I do not see a date on it.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah, I don't think they have a date for it yet.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
However, I mean, I played the shit out of this game.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I even, when I graduated high school, I traded my Super Nintendo for my friend's Genesis and sat playing this game for just the whole night.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And then I found his Master System converter and then was playing Alex Kidd in Shinobi World and that was pretty awesome too.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But yeah, Castle of Illusion is one of my top Disney games.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah, that was a great game so it's exciting to hear about this.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The pictures are absolutely gorgeous but seriously, watch the trailer.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It is maybe not as orgasm inducing as DuckTales but, you know, there's lots of wank.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It'll still get you going down there a little bit?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It'll make one moist.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Ew.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That's just a fun word.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Moist?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Moist.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I was going to bring it up here in studio real quick just to be able to see some of this here in action.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Let me get to the actual gameplay part of the trailer.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It does look really good.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The graphics.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, this is more, there's not much of the gameplay.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Yeah, Maleficent.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Was that Maleficent?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Her face looks a little weird though.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Yeah, they don't have any gameplay in that but they actually have some screenshots that look pretty sweet.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Good times.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Oh, Codeman, I'm sorry.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
What?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
This isn't you. We actually have a friend, our friend Beanie.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
You say the word moist around her, she full body shudders. It's hilarious.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Wasn't that the mom in Dead Like Me?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I never watched that.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Dead Like Me was a great show.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Well, I know it was a great show but I never watched it.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Critical Myth, back me up. You like that show, right?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
You're the TV connoisseur around here.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Rob Moist.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I love that word.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I like cake.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Anyhow, Toilette.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Alright.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Moist Toilette.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming to a gaming store near you, Loki.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Today, Lego City Undercover The Chase Begins came out on the 3DS.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Tuesday, Dead Island Riptide coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, it's kind of like the game re-released with their expansion in there.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And then Star Trek on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And those would be your games for this week.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Because it is April and hardly anything comes out in April.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Well, I mean Star Trek and Dead Island Riptide are...

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah, it's a decent release.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It's not as dry as some of the weeks have been lately.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Next week, on the other hand, Deadly Premonition.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And that's it.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Eww.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what is coming out in the Japanese release dates this week.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We will start off with the PlayStation 3.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And on the 25th of April, Bioshock Infinite gets its Japanese release.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So now you guys over there can see what we've all been raving about for a couple of weeks here.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Atuteki Yugi Mugen Scrolls, that comes in...

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I think there's like a limited edition, a regular edition, and then some like selection edition.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Oh, you know what it is? The original Mugen Souls is getting a re-release price edition.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And there's Mugen Souls Z comes out this week. That's the deal there.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Dragon's Dogma from Capcom out this week on the 25th.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Shin Kamitachi no Yoro 11 Hitome no Suspect gets a price reduction this week.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Also in regular and limited editions, Steins Gate Senkei Kosuko no Phonogram comes out.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Tomb Raider gets its Japanese release this week. We talked a little bit about the...

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
DLC Japanese voice track.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
No, not in Japan. You already get it.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But to give you an idea, if you want to import this baby into the US, $84 to import that guy.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So that's why it's, you know, games cost a little more in Japan.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Let's see, let's travel over. That's all PlayStation 3. Let's look at the Xbox 360.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Tomb Raider over there as well, of course.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Dragon's Dogma as well and Bioshock Infinite, most of the same stuff.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Steins Gate 2.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Colladrius also in regular and limited edition this week on the Xbox 360.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Taking a look real quick at some of the handhelds.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
PlayStation Vita.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Kajiri Kamui Kagura Akebono no Hikari in regular and limited editions.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Katamari Damacy no Vita gets a price reduction this week.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That would be the Katamari Damacy game that was out at launch.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The music's still stuck in my head.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Make You Cross Blood Infinity out on the Vita this week as well.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Photokano Kiss and Ragnarok Odyssey and Ridge Racer getting price reductions this week in Japan.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Lots of price reductions on games this week.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Shinsengoku Musou next.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Tales of Innocence R.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So if you are a Japanese Vita owner, this is a great week to stock up on games you might have missed.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
On the Wii U this week, nothing.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Absolutely nothing on the Wii U this week. That really shouldn't be a surprise.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
On other systems, checking out the Nintendo 3DS.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I'm showing that we're still sending to the feed, so I'm going to move on for the podcast.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Nintendo 3DS says Detective Conan, Marionette no Kuyo Yoko Yoko.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Pocket Monster PC covers for the 3DS XL, you know, for those you Pocket Monster fans.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And Starry Sky in Spring 3D in regular and limited editions.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
We have some stuff in the UK.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
We have, and this is the wrong window, because I'm special.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Goddamn stupid iPad. Sorry.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Okay. We have, on the 24th, Draw Slasher for the Vita, and Thomas Was Alone for the Vita and PS3.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
On the 26th, Dead Island Riptide, Deadly Premonition, The Director's Cut, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arisen, and Star Trek.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That's it.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It did, the feed did drop on our end, just so you know.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Well, we always do a, you know, before, well now it's showing it's connected.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Before we start OLR every night, we always reset the router, reset the modems and everything in the house, you know.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Just think, if we were an always connected game console, we would not be working right now.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Keep that in mind for your future game console needs.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Dear Microsoft, listen to our podcast every week, 6 o'clock Central Time.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I mean, Central Public Time.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Is my computer, Alan, is my computer on?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yes.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
No? Okay. I just want to make sure, like, I didn't have, like, Dropbox running or something, so just, you know.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah, Rob did mention Detective Conan.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I did.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Which is a very popular anime series from the 90s.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Yes, which is getting a game release in Japan that I already closed the window for.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
All right, do we do UK release dates? Sorry.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yes.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
All right, then we got-

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
A bunch of crap.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
A few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
All right, so we've already talked about how the Wii U isn't selling very well.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Rob isn't selling very well.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And we don't have the, technically we don't have the NPD numbers out for hardware because Nintendo's not going to come out bragging that,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Hey, we only sold, like, 67,000 units. Yeah.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But, apparently, according to a leak on NeoGaf, they have the console numbers, which is possible because I get email updates occasionally of NPD numbers.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000
So, yes, the Wii U apparently only sold 67,000 units in the U.S. during the five weeks from March 3rd to April 6th.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And then, also, I guess, roughly, the Vita didn't do much better, actually. Let's see here.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They did only 33,000 units during March.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Were there any Vita games during March?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Quick, name me games on the Vita to get excited about right now.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm thinking the Persona 4 release, but that was, that already happened, so I'm like,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Tearaway if you're into

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Project D.Va

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Tearaway if you're into Media Molecule.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
There is Killzone, if you like Killzone.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So, here's a question for you all. We sit here and we razz Nintendo about, you know, well, you know, they're just not getting those titles out there, but look at the frickin' Vita.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Here's the thing, I think, with the Vita, and it's like, Nintendo, we recognize the potential is there that they could be doing much better.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
The Vita, I don't think we have much expectations for them, other than, hey, it's a nice piece of hardware, but for some reason, all the games that come out on it aren't very good.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Like, dude, they had Call of Duty, Black Ops, come out on the Vita. That should have been System Accelerate there.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But, no. Instead, they just had a quick rush of a game come out by someone that did Resistance, and it sucked ass.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Thankfully, they're taking all that stuff first party now, and they're gonna be developing, instead of having third parties develop their games for them.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
So, Killzone hopefully will be much better, but, I don't know.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I don't know if Tearaway's gonna, well, Tearaway's not gonna say that system.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
What's gonna save that system, I think, a little bit is the fact that PlayStation Network is a really good place right now for indies, and there's a lot of indie games coming out in there.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So, I think we'll see some interesting stuff from there.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And maybe what develops with the PlayStation 4, because before I get accused of being a Nintendo fanboy and always defending them here on this show, although I like to think of myself as devil's advocate against gamers hate everything.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
But, I think the PlayStation 4 is in a good place. I think it has a lot of good buzz around it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And, you know, PlayStation 4 is gonna be a real contender for the Wii U, which doesn't, you know, unless they really knock our socks off at E3, you definitely are gonna have PlayStation 4 on another level.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You're gonna have to come out with something absolutely amazing.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And it could be interesting how the Vita could tie into that. I mean, we've already seen a little bit of that early press conference.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You know, so I'm really curious to see how that enriches as time goes on here.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Kuma JP mentioned a game called Oboro Muramasa. I guess, does that have to do with the sword?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Well, he linked us to the game there in our chat room.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Well, let's take a look.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So, if I can bring it up without destroying our feed again.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
It's Muramasa Rebirth. It's the HD, well, not really HD, but remake of Muramasa.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Oh, neat.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's cool.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Oh, that looks pretty fun.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Screenshots are taking forever to load. There we go.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Yeah, it's at the end of...

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The Vita does have such a pretty screen.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It is a great piece of tech.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Well, they do have some good Japanese games coming out. They've got, you know, the Persona stuff. They've got Muramasa Rebirth.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
There's also Odin's, well, not Odin's Sphere. There's Dragonblade.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Is that chick naked?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Look at her. They're skinny dipping or something.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Rob.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
This is a perverse game.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You know what?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
You need to stop being so white boy about it.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Oh my god, boobs. Oh my god.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It's only here that people have a big stick up their ass, a big rough sandpapery stick up their ass about boobs.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Exactly. I believe that we should have more boobs on TV. I fully support this.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Darsakir, are you saying I have a stick up my ass?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I like boobs too.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Boobs are great, but I mean people in general. We're fine with violence and blood and gore and, you know, saw and everything.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I like boobs covered in blood.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
But show a tit and everyone loses their shit. Hey, that rhymed.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That's gonna be my new motto about America. Show a tit, lose your shit.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:27.000
We haven't come to that part of the show yet, but we do have a story later on about the evil within, which did have a four-armed demon chick with boobs and blood on her boobs.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
So there you go.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
The violence boob quota.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Blood orgy, yay.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Organ orgy. It's just like organs launched at the screen. It was great.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
More boobs.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Let's see, did you do the other sales story about-

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah, MPD.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
March MPD.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Repeat what you just said again.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
No, no problem. The March MPD stuff, Bioshock Infinite, obviously the top selling game.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
The utter disappointment of a game sequel, Tomb Raider, only placed second.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Heads will roll.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh, what a disappointment.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Ironically, Gears of War Judgment 360 and then God of War Ascension on PS3 were three and four.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I'm sorry. I have to say this. This is going to be so wrong and I apologize in advance, but only an Asian company like Square Enix would be like, why can you only be the second best selling game?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Am I right? Am I right?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Only the parent company in Asia would be like, why weren't you the number one game?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Why you get an A minus?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You came out in the beginning of the month.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Call of Duty harder.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon actually on there, number six. MLB 13, the show on number seven.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
NBA 2K13, eight.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Walking Dead Survival Instinct just began proving that Walking Dead, the franchise, will actually sell anything, whether it be a good game or absolute shit.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So that was number nine. Naruto, ship it in. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, number 10.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:18.000
What's not on this list? The two big titles for the Wii U, Lego City Undercover and Monster Hunter 3. Not even the top 10. So that's got to hurt.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Maybe Laura should have been a doctor.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Alright, moving on to fighting game news, or maybe a little change going on or another perspective.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Vice President Christian Svensson over at Capcom has made a remark about a fan-submitted question on the Ask Capcom forums.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
This was about stories in fighting games. You know, I don't know how many people really play fighting games for the story.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Although some of them do have good stories, I guess.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Will you raise your hand over there?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Yes. Okay, if I don't play fighting games for the stories, I would have never touched any of the Tekken games.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I guess that's true.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I assume the people that play the fighting games for their stories are the same people that read Playboy for their articles.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Well, anyhow, here's the interesting comment about story mode in fighting games.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Quote, the strategic marketing group here has for quite a while been pushing for our fighting franchises to have more and more better single-player content, of which full-fledged story modes are one component.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
How and when those requirements manifest in our future roadmap, I'm not prepared to speak about at this time.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Which a lot of people are reading in between the lines of that, that, you know, the single-player content or the story modes in fighting games are not good.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
In Capcom fighting games.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I don't know. But then again, you know, you look at a franchise like Mortal Kombat.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Mortal Kombat's done really well with their story modes in their recent releases, especially this last one.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Tigerclaw mentions that the story in Injustice is really good and is getting Capcom thinking about making better stories in their fighting games.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Well, Injustice is just NetherRealm Studios that just did the Mortal Kombat game, right? So, same, same.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Anyhow, one other thing to mention about Capcom.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Apparently, more DLC in Capcom's future, which, you know, isn't really unexpected.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But this is talking about Capcom's recent strategy.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
There was a lot of very interesting revelations here in Capcom's forecast about where the company's going.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Saying that apparently they don't want to outsource games to Western developers as much anymore.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
That it has caused a drop in quality.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
They're gonna promote DLC in the consumer business.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Aim for growth, surpassing the market by reinforcing the online and mobile contents business.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
iPhone games, Android games.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And strengthen earnings base by expanding the title lineup in the P&S business.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
More DLC, just hopefully not included on the disc.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Or just announce the Mega Man rebirth already.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
We all know it's coming.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
A Mega Man reboot.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Alright.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Alright.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, band.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
That just about brings us to the end of the first half of our show.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But we have to take a trip down memory lane first off with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You know, back in the time, we didn't have reboots back in the day.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
You didn't reboot a gaming franchise.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
No, you just put out some crappy sequels and then try to make people forgive you with the third one.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
That's right. Well, let's see if that is the case with tonight's Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Not really.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Alright, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week tonight?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Son of the Hedgehog 3.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Because I couldn't find anything else and I've been haunted by the Ice Cap music.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Oddly enough for some reason.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Which is what's in the background.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Which is the best music ever in any video game in the universe.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was the special one.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It was completely tied to its direct sequel, Sonic and Knuckles.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And they could latch on to each other and be awesome.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It was like the gestalt of game perfection.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So yeah, I mean, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I mean, I really liked the first one. I really liked the second one.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Sonic 3 for me just, like, lit everything up.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It was the last real- actually, no, I take that back.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Sonic CD was the last really good Sonic game as far as platforming goes.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
But this, I actually, I actually will even put Sonic 3 above Sonic CD.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And Bobby the Japanese music was better for Sonic CD, just saying.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So Sonic 3 also had some interesting things going on with it too.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
You basically could pick between Sonic or Tails, as you could in Sonic 2.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
And it was basically the same type of gameplay.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
You had all the same usual stuff. You had your six levels with two parts.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You had a boss at the end of the very full thing.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You could keep going back to the level.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
You have new abilities, like you could hold the jump button while in mid-air.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And do, like, a quick shield for protection.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Tails could fly or swim underwater for a short time before getting tired and going back down.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So Tails could actually go to places that Sonic could not.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And his tail could actually be used to attack enemies.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And if you have a second player controlling Tails, then he can carry Sonic while flying.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So basically it opened up to all kinds of exploration.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And then there were the different shields in the game, like there was the fire shield.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And my favorite was, was it the lightning shield that attracted coins? Not coins, rings.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That was my favorite.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And if you hit a checkpoint while holding 50 or more rings, you got a bonus stage, which was the bumper stage.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Which, I'm sorry, the bumper stage pissed me off.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Of any bonus stage ever in any game, for some reason it was that sort of, was it semi-isometric point of view?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Would just give me a headache and I couldn't do it at all. So now I make Dan do it.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But that's how you earn your Chaos Emeralds.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And, like, someone even took the time to chart out how the various bonus stages were.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
There was also a thing you could do with Sonic and Knuckles, where if you attached an older cartridge to it.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Like, you could play Sonic 2 with Sonic and Knuckles.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
But if you did another one, if you hold, like, a certain button press, then you could go on.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Now, I want to talk about the music for a minute, okay?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:00.000
There was a big thing going around with the music, saying that Michael Jackson had done a lot of the music and then he removed himself from the cartridge or something.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:11.000
There's a series of, what am I mentioning, clips on YouTube, where people have compared music in Sonic 3 to Michael Jackson songs.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
So, I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean, the Ice Cap Zone sounds like Smooth Criminal.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
This is actually my second favorite music in the game.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
It's the Lava Reef Zone. Really good music.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So, yeah, so basically, you know, you can, if you got all of the Chaos Emeralds, you can turn into Super Sonic and then Knuckles punches the crap out of him and takes the Chaos Emeralds.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And you have to go to the Death Egg. Rawr.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You know, which, I always like, yeah, they called him Robotnik, but it really did make a lot more sense to call him Eggman because the dude looked like a freaking egg.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And, hey, he was in Wreck-It Ralph.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So, yeah, so basically there have been a bajillion different releases of this game.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
We had Sonic Jam in 1997 for the Saturn, Sonic and Knuckles collection, and the Sonic and Garfield pack.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
What the fuck? Sonic and Garfield pack? For PC?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PS2, Xbox, and PC, Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3, and Sonic Classic Collection for Nintendo DS.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Plus, you can get, like, these various packs on Steam.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I'll be honest, the only one of those I've ever bought was Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because, hello, it's Puyo Puyo.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:49.000
There have been, like I said, the digital releases for Steam, there's been the Wii Virtual Console one in 2007, Xbox Live Arcade in 2009, and it even has a split-screen multiplayer on Xbox Live.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So it was given, when it was released, EGM gave it a 9.5 out of 10.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And, honestly, I think it was well-deserved. It's one of the best games to ever come out.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So...

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Alright. That's it?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That's it.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
There it is. A real classic. A real classic game of the week there. Sonic 3.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I think I'm saving the Sonic series for my... Damn, I can't think of a game this week.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So I've got Sonic 2 and the first one to go. We'll see what happens, right?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week. Sonic 3.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000
We will be back after a quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, guys. We'll be right back.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Welcome back to Part B of Orange Lounge Radio for this April the 21st, 2013, the 501st episode of our show.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Alright, so we had a little bit of a long break there live. Sorry about that. But, you know, just taking care of it.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Blame me!

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Alright, I will blame Dark Sakura. It's all her fault.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But, I don't get it. Loki was giggling like mad during the break.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
This is the funniest shit ever.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It's apparently some gay... I haven't seen this yet, so I'm about to check this out. What is this game, Loki?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It's Surgeon Simulator 2013.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Okay, and what's the deal with this game?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:21.000
It's basically a surgery simulator. Like, they have different surgeries you perform. There's like brain transplants, kidney transplants, and I think like a heart transplant or something.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And what makes the game unique is that you control it using the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard, you put your hand on the Q, W, E, F, and space.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Each one of the keys represents one of your fingers in the game. So you have to grip instruments and actually do stuff.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And so more times than not, you're just like flopping around all over the place.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
So it's kind of like Q-Op or something.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah, go earlier in the video there.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Go earlier in the video here? Alright.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So they're ripping out organs of this patient? What?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
You can even go earlier than that. This is the funny Swedish guy.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Perform a double kidney transplant.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
In an ambulance. The ambulance is moving, so stuff is bouncing around.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Oh great, the ambulance is moving.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Hey, guts.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Sausage in your stomach, Bob.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
The kidney is just floating around in the back there.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I love that.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Oh, lordy.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I am buying this when I get home.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
You need to wait and don't play it until you can livestream it.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Here we go, Bob.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I'll do it tonight.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I'll put that in our chat. Sorry to the podcast folks, but just look it up on YouTube.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
There's a ton of them. It was great about the game.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Surgeon Simulator 2013.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
They have records. They have people doing record surgery.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The times, how quickly you can do surgery, and murder times.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So like how quickly you can kill your patient.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Sj100matt says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Hey, I remember playing the original surgery game, Life and Death 2.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Oh yeah, I remember that.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Those games were scary shit.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Sorry, for me it was Trauma Center.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
You know, we got Trauma Center on Wii when it came out.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Oh yeah, me too.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And I remember, I think I was drunk on something.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
No, no, no, it was the Vicodin.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
When I'm sitting here, leaning back in my chair, I was on Vicodin.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It was right after, I think I was playing it right after my surgery.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So I'm sitting here with my hand in a cast, trying to hold the Wii-mote,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
going, can't hold it!

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And then I ended up using my left hand, and so I was slicing people to bits.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
It was hilarious.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Sj100matt though, I was playing the original surgery game, Operation, by Milton Bradley.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Yeah, the only thing about Life and Death 1 that kind of sucked was that,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
from what I remember, at least we can only get to the first surgery,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
which was removing an appendix.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Unfortunately, they do not allow you to play tic-tac-toe using the scalpel.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
That will kill the patient, apparently.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Nice.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Alright, let's move on, do some rapid-fire news,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
quickly covering some of the other things going on in the gaming world this week.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And then we'll get to the Fookle question of the week.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But first, rapid-fire news, Logie.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
So, Deadpool, supposed to be coming out June 25th.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And that's all you need to know, because Deadpool's awesome.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, June 25th.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:40.000
The Ouya's got a firmware update that's allowing people to change their credit card information.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And apparently you can change this at any time.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And also, they're going to be adding some different payment options as well later on.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But right now, you can change your credit card information, fantastic.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And they've signed up 10,000 registered developers,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000
because technically everybody with an Ouya could be a registered developer at some point,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
because you can develop stuff on your own system.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
But yeah, that sounds kind of cool.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And I think one of the announcements was that Papa and Yo, developers,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
was supposed to be making a game for Ouya.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And last but not least, Bethesda was teasing all week long.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And then finally released a trailer for The Evil Within,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
which is the brand new game from Shinji Mikami.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
They're known for the Resident Evil series.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And I got to say, after watching the trailer,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
other than the fact that there is a lot of organs and stuff,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
it looks very Silent Hill-ish. Like, good Silent Hill-ish.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I was a little bit scared just watching the trailer.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Let me bring this up here in studio.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I like brains.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Oh, I thought there was a YouTube here.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I'll look it up when I get home.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I like anything that's Silent Hill in a good way.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But I have to get Shane's review of it, because I trust Shane in all things remotely Silent Hill-looking.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Oh, don't inflate his ego like that.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Okay, here, this is like a two-minute trailer, though.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And there's ads on it. Hooray.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Well, let's come back to this in a minute. That's what we'll do.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That's fine.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
In the meantime, I will read a few stories here.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
The bonus games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet revealed.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
If you bought all the games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, all the download stuff,

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
you will get two free games.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And the bonus games were 1943 Kai. That is the laser 1943.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Awesome.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And Vulgus, which was the very first Capcom game in arcades.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000
By the way, just so you know, the other pack of games came out for Capcom that rounds out this pack.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000
That's Sun Sun 1942 and Pirate Ship Higemaru, which I love that game.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Higemaru is a pretty neat game.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
But if you want just classic shooter, you can't get any better than 1942.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Well, for vertical shooters.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Right.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Okay, is that guy doing surgery on a brain?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
No, Shane hadn't seen the trailer yet, so I was linking him.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Don't watch this yet. Don't watch this yet. Okay.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I have other news.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Mad Dog McCree 2, The Lost Gold.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
No incur.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Well, if you're a PSN owner, you might care.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
It has move control.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
HD scrub down.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Good, because this is the only way someone can play it anymore since light guns don't work.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
New difficulty modes.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And online leaderboards.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
You know, because everybody wants to compete on Mad Dog McCree.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Also, a rating has shown up on a Korean rating site for Metal Gear Solid The Legacy Collection.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
This would make sense, though, if there's a Metal Gear Solid 5 on the horizon.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Why wouldn't they want to bundle the first four games together?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
You can't really call four games a trilogy.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
So this would make sense.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
There was also a tweet from Hideo Kojima that kind of points to this as well.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Why wouldn't this be a thing on PlayStation 3?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Why wouldn't it?

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Makes a lot of sense.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Now, this trailer's like two minutes long, so I can't do the whole thing.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
But here's some parts of the trailer, Dark Sakura.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
All the good stuff's towards the end.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
All the good stuff's at the end.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
That's really realistic.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Yeah.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Let's go a little further.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Ooh, blood.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Okay, I want to play this.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Organs.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Yay, I like organs.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Ew.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Rob, why are you showing me that, Rob?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
That's one of those games to get my mom to watch me play.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
We need to get your mom watching you play one of those games, and we need to stream it.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Well, I was thinking a great one to have my mom react to would be Bioshock Infinite.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
So I'll work on that.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
We should do Rob's Mom, the series.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Yeah, maybe like a YouTube thing. We'll see.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura, you have some game news for us.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I do, and one of them has to do with a game that we have covered before.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's actually a game hack.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And now it's actually showing up in arcades.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
There's a guy named Clay Cowgill.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I almost said cowgirl, and I knew better, so I caught myself.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Bangadoo bang.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Geez, thanks.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Did a ROM hack that basically installs it in place of the original game chips on the motherboard.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000
So there is a YouTube video going around of the arcade version.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And a site called This Old Game is doing the artwork for the Pauline edition.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So it will be like $100 and has a marquee, monitor, glass, control panel, side art, and instruction stickers.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
They even have Mario being held by Donkey Kong and stuff.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Oh, that's awesome, because that's like...

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I mean, it's even in the right style, too. I love it.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000
So next up, the 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is finally in North America. Yay.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And it costs 20 bucks. Boo.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
But you can order it on Nintendo's official online store.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That is the only place that you can find it.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
But not too many games use it.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Mostly Monster Hunter 3 and Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It has the best theme song of any game ever.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And now there is a third-person shooter called God Mode that launches on Steam and Xbox Live Arcade this kind of Friday.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
This game looked kind of fun.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
It did.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It looked like a big orgy of death, like Quake Arena.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It really did.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000
It was done by Old School Games, which is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And it's basically, like you were saying, a health-themed arena shooter.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Go around, shoot things.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
You have modes called Test of Faith that alter the rulesets.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
You have party hats, Rob.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Party hats are great.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Oh, I love party hats.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And then basically it's just lots of fun.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Lots of crazy fun.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
And it costs 10 bucks on Steam or 800 Microsoft points.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Or £6.99 for our friends in the UK.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Very nice.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Prince Brightstar asking a question about one of the stories you just did, Dark Saga.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Can arcades legally earn money from the Donkey Kong Pauline game?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
That's a good question.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Probably not. In all honesty, probably not.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I would think this is more of a novelty that shows up at trade shows and private owners.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Not something you put down at a miniature golf place or at a bowling alley to actually make money.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
That would probably get you some hot water.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Well, I don't know. It's a ROM hack, so it's not necessarily that they're selling pirated stuff.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
It's basically modifying your system.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It also wouldn't be the first pirated game to ever show up in an arcade.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Well, at Classic Gaming Expo, someone had done a Donkey Kong 2.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It was basically just a re-hack of Donkey Kong where you found unused sprites and basically redid levels.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I mean, it plays exactly Donkey Kong style, but he put up his dump and everything.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That sounded awful. I'm sorry.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
He put the ROM dump up. Shut up, Rob.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
You're five. You served it up.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Five years old, Rab.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Here's my dump, y'all.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Well, it wasn't my dump. It was his dump, and I just happened to be there for it.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It was number two.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I quit. Bye. I'm going home.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I'm done with y'all. This is...

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
backwards. Fuck this shit. Later.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Thanks for the pinkberry bye.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
No, but I remembered that he had distributed it to some arcades.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
You're still red in the face.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Because it's funny, his little comment about what it was number two. That was funny.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Isn't Prince Brightstar so happy that his question led to that?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
A really good serious question led to, yeah, poop.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Yeah, and we supposedly have a mature rating because we're not.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Let's get to the Fugu question of the week. Let's class it up a little bit here with some listener feedback.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Good fucking luck.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Facebook and Google Plus. Throw them together, you get Fugu.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Fugu Plus. And we ask a question of the week every week on Fugu.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And this week has to do with the Heroes show reboot, Rumors.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Rumor is that Heroes, a TV show that used to be on NBC, could get a second chance as a television show on the next Xbox.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Would you watch something like this via Xbox?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Do you think this type of content delivery poses a threat to cable television as we know it now?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
What are your thoughts? We'll start on Facebook tonight with Critical Myth. Love this answer, by the way.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Setting aside the fan perception that the show quickly went downhill after the first season, and thus bringing it back doesn't make a lot of sense,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I don't think this alone is a threat to network or cable television.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It would only be the combined success of these alternative outlets like Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV, and so on.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:04.000
What it does say, along with some of the other outlets, is that a cancelled show may have many other options than might have been the case just a few short years ago.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Add to that the crowdsourcing possibilities, Veronica Mars, and the initial end of a show might not be the final end after all.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:20.000
You know, there's a show on ABC that I really like, I think it's really funny, called Happy Endings, but it's supposedly kind of done because the ratings haven't been very good,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
but everybody's already talking about, like, can it be on cable or something like that? So, I don't know.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Alright, going to Red the Haze. Would you support Heroes or what have you?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Nope, I haven't paid for a live subscription in ages, and I'm satisfied everywhere else with my gaming and entertainment needs.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
My internet connection isn't fast enough, and a large percentage of the US has the same issue.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:57.000
This won't threaten cable TV, but other reliable services that are catching on, like Netflix and Hulu, are more of a threat because of the low barrier of entry with Roku's and smart TVs.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Rebooting a cancelled TV show that nobody remembers fondly isn't a good gamble.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Now, somebody else jumped in there and said, hey, wait a minute, nobody remembers fondly.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I liked, what was the dude's name, was it Hero?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Yeah, Hero.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I liked him, and I liked his buddy.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Unfortunately, he's not probably, I would say that most of the cast would not be back because you have them all doing their own things.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
They're all in other shows now.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
He's on Hawaii Five-0 right now, and The One Chick's on Dallas.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Nashville.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Or Nashville, yeah.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I mean, but there's always the possibility that they could do cameos or what have you, and Heroes wasn't necessarily, the idea was the Heroes were going to get all killed off in the first season anyway.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
It was supposed to always be new people, and it just didn't work out that way.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I thought Heroes was awesome the first season. I was so into it. I'm sure I talked about it on this show because this show's been on long enough.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I remember downloading the preview on Xbox and all that stuff. There's things in the preview that was on Xbox that never was even in the real show.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I watched it. There's George Takei.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
There you go.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Because you know he's my gay daddy.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:10.000
But I'm of the mindset that when they started introducing all these other characters in season two, it really went downhill.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I stopped watching season three. I couldn't take it anymore, but I heard the show started to get back to its roots and got a lot better season four and maybe ended a little bit before.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I never saw season four.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Yeah, I never gave it that second chance, but I would be down with a reboot, but if you're going to ask me to pay a lot of extra money for it, eh.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But if it's part of a service that's something else with it, I might be open to it.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I still wanted to go. I tried actually watching the first season, but all I would do is just watch the Hero Anando scenes.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And I wanted to like Cheerleader Wolverine. Could not get into it.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
But one of my friends was on that show.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
This is supposed to be about the listeners. Let me read the rest of the answers here.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Dark Charger says if the writing and acting is good, I will watch it.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I already pay for Xbox Live, as do millions of subscribers, and this just adds much needed value.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
There isn't a single show or channel that will usurp cable.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:13.000
However, I believe consumers are willing to dump on an antiquated business model if an IPTV model is perceived as an equivalent or superior.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Remember this whole thing, the theory was that cable providers could then offer their cable channels over the internet to other people that would be out of the area.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Like if you don't have Comcast in your area, thank God.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And you wanted to get Comcast channels, although they all kind of have the same channels anyways.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
But that was supposed to be a way to do it, was with this box.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
But remember HBO is talking about doing internet only.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:51.000
So that would be kind of neat, although I just don't want to pay $8 for each channel.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Burr replies and says never cared for heroes, but I would gladly watch a show on my Xbox if it was good.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I don't know if it's a threat to the whole system, but it's yet another step towards the a la carte delivery consumers have been clamoring for, much to the cable company's chagrin.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Pete Garuno says if it ain't 1 versus 100, dot dot dot. High five, sir. Amen. Preach.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:23.000
If they say the next Xbox is bringing back 1 versus 100, I would have to give it serious consideration on that merit alone.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
But they need to guarantee me it'll be up for at least a couple years.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Let's see, Nicky E. replied and said I liked the first season, they blew it in the second.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I would probably check out a reboot.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000
As for the whole deal of getting services via Xbox or Netflix or any other streaming service, I don't like it one bit if it's an exclusive thing.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I pay for Netflix to be able to watch what I want, when I want.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000
If some other service has an exclusive thing, I would either not care, buy it on DVD later, or maybe end up downloading it.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I think too much competition via exclusive deals and making content only for your own streaming service would just lead to more piracy.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Just when the streaming services were beginning to compete with the conveniency of the internet.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Thanks for a great show. Thank you.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That's a good point. I don't want to have to give every content publisher 10 bucks a month to watch their show.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I think that dilution is going to lead to a lose-lose situation.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Piracy, yeah.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Yeah, piracy. People get what they want to see, you know.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Yes, people do get what they want to see.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Degenerate Johnny says, I don't particularly think this service will pose a threat.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Yes, interactive entertainment has played a role in the steep decline of ratings within cable television through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and other various services.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Which is why you see cable news upholding the interest of those networks by focusing on the negative pertaining to interactive entertainment.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Ooh, interesting. Do you think maybe it's a whole little, that's why cable news has it out for games, is that it's competition?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
That's an awfully little...

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
No, I think it's just, it's the same reason...

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
They are an easy target though.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's the same reason why there's certain people on cable news that have very racist comments or, you know, I just think they're very short-minded.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Let's see, Andy R. says, depends what kind of pricing is involved, but I would like something like this.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I don't pay for cable because I don't watch much TV, which makes it difficult on the few occasions when there is a show I want to watch, like Game of Thrones.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
If I can watch it in a manner where I'm not paying for a ton of services I don't want, I'm all for it.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Mike B. says, cable should be trying to keep up with the times. The future is a la carte programming.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
He's not the first one to use that term.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Commercial-free shows and movies via the internet. I already do this now. It's a little pricey, but no commercials.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Let me go over to Google Plus and Redertainment, who said, this is what Microsoft tried and failed to do with Web TV.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Microsoft wanted Web TV to be centralized hub for all your entertainment.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:48.000
The Xbox is succeeding where Web TV failed due to Xbox being a well-established brand and consumers generally being more web-savvy now than where Microsoft failed with Web TV.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
As far as Heroes goes, I take the same approach to it as I do Arrested Development of Netflix or Zombieland on Amazon.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
If I'm interested in the content, then I will seek it out. I'm not interested in Heroes, so I will not be seeking it out.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Again, that comment from Redertainment on Google Plus. I think the comparison of Web TV is very interesting.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
If at first you don't succeed, try again. Very interesting.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Apologize I didn't get to all the comments, but do check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Just search for orange lounge radio to read all of the great comments in their entirety.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
In the meantime...

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Yeah, cause there's some wank going on.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
What? Oh, the chatter's mad at you.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
You didn't read mine, Rob.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Well, maybe because I read a lot of your other stuff and you guys call in pretty regularly, so I wanted to read people that don't get to participate as much with the show.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
So just throw that out there.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I know, but you know, I have to give...

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
You have to fan the flames.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I have to fan them.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Alright.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I'm like, I'm like, um, Karl Lagerfeld and his fan.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
But I appreciate...

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Without being an asshole.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I appreciate all of the comments and encourage everybody to go read them in their entirety on Facebook and Google Plus.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Meanwhile, more news.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
So the second round of THQ auctions are, well, they're happening.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And apparently the news will be out Monday afternoon on to who has what.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:22.000
This included back catalog rights and also kind of different lots, including the Darksiders franchise, Red Faction, and Homeworld franchise.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Of course, you know, the original auctions, you know, sold off the other stuff like Saints Row and that kind of thing.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000
They're saying they're going to make six to seven million dollars from those sales.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:46.000
One thing, though, that we do know that's going to happen, the whole crowdfunded movement to buy the rights to Homeworld failed.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
They didn't have enough money to win the bid there.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So thankfully they are refunding everyone's money.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
So that's nice.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
So they have that going on.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
That means somebody put up a lot of money for it.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So somebody recognized the value in it.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Then somebody outbid those guys.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:10.000
So they had, I guess it looks like they had around 80 million dollars or set.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
No, like 70 million.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
No, no, no.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Eighty thousand.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I'm sorry.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Seventy five thousand dollars.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Eighty million dollars.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Well, it's the most successful.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Saints Row win for that much.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
No, no, no.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000
So eighty thousand dollars is what they had between their Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Unfortunately, they were not able to get it for that.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
It sold for the Price is Right rules.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Eighty thousand and one.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
All right.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Well, this, I think, is some good news for gaming, because this was just causing a lot of fuckery in court.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And I really can't think of a better word to describe it.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:59.000
But you might remember that there was a trademark on the term Edge, and this belonged to Tim Langdell, who was the founder of Edge Games.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Well, a court order has stripped him of that trademark.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
That's because of a petition by DICE and EA, who made it Mirror's Edge.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of the canceled registration on April 17th.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
This whole thing has been going on since 2010.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Let's see.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Moby Game made a game called Edge, and they've discounted all versions of the game by 50% in celebration.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
The game had been taken down from the App Store previously due to issues with this trademark.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
So, you know, anything that had the word Edge in it, this guy was coming for you.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Hide your wife, hide your edge.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Hmm, that sort of sounds like Ville.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Yeah, so maybe this will set a very interesting precedent and send a message.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I'm going to create a game called Ville. Just Ville.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I mean, this guy is welcome to call his company Edge Games, I don't have a problem with that.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000
But where did Edge Games and Mirror's Edge? No. There's no similarity there.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
It's just like monster cables.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I'm all for this. They should kill off more stupid trademarks.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I can think of a few we've come across in gaming that need to be canceled as well.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So, anyhow. Let's move on to some more news.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:19.000
In other news. Now, the original link, by the way, didn't work, so I had to hunt it down.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Oops.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Oh well. It's okay. So, there is a prototype of a Sega machine that was called the Pluto, I believe.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And a guy's posting on Assembler Games forums with pictures of one of the second prototypes.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
There were only two of them.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And basically says it's super heavy. It had two controller ports, a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a power button, and the reset button.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:56.000
It still says Saturn on it, but this was, apparently, they were going to brand whatever this Pluto system was with the Saturn name.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:03.000
When you plug it in, it actually has the Saturn loading screen. The drive empty screen.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:09.000
So, yeah. Just looking this over. It apparently works.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:16.000
It was, I'm sorry if I'm having to go through this because, unfortunately, the original thing didn't work for me.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It is region locked, but it is a USA NTSC Saturn. So, that's pretty cool. I think it had the networking capability.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:32.000
They bought this for a dollar at a Stockton flea market. One dollar.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:41.000
By the way, turning around and selling it on eBay right now, already up to like $67,000, or $7600.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
For real? That was at a flea market? That's crazy.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Yeah. The other one was at a garage sale.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Wow.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
And I think the Stockton area as well.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Yeah, okay. It's a Saturn with a Netlink built in.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
This needs to be in my collection, dammit.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
You have a few thousand dollars to pony up?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
No, I have a desire to buy a house.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
If only you'd been at that flea market.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I can't live in a Sega Pluto.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
You can try.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It is pretty big.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I have to say, looking at it, it is pretty burly, but you know what? I have a Saturn and I'm happy with it.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Damn, it is a monster though.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I just want to read a quick comment on the Edge thing, because people in chat are still talking about the Edge story, and I think this insight from Dungeon Buster is pretty good in chat.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Langdell picked a fight with EA, and EA decided to litigate his trademark into oblivion and won.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
The guy was nuts. He'd sue over anything that he thought infringed on his trademark.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
He made up proof that others were using it, which the courts didn't appreciate. It was hilarious.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Again, that's from Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I also do want to repost the forum link, just because people need to see photos of this. It's pretty interesting.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Oh, of the Pluto?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Of the Pluto. I mean, I've seen the Neptune one, because they have it at Classic Gaming Expo every year.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:00.000
This thing is huge, and it looks like a Saturn and a Sega CD had an ugly baby.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Poor Pluto keeps getting shit on. It's not a real planet. It's not a real system.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Good thing we didn't name this show Pluto Lounge Radio, or we might have been in trouble.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Her. No, good thing we weren't Pluto Edge Radio.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Alright.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
You see what I did there?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Loki, were you going to get into something? Sorry, I think I cut you off.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Yeah, I was going to talk about how successful Microsoft is.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:33.000
They turned a profit in their third quarter, which just ended March 31st.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:42.000
And apparently, I guess, $2.53 billion. 56% increase over last year.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:51.000
And, of course, citing that, you know, obviously, Halo 4 is a big part of that.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:07.000
They were saying that, I guess, overall, they said the operating income of $342 million was up from a $242 million loss last year.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So, overall, they're up, but some of their costs went up as well.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:18.000
And they're saying right now, specifically, Xbox Live memberships grew 18%, now 46 million members.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And they're saying that the console, I guess, it shipped 8.9 million units in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, down 3 million units from the same time last year.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
But it's a big spend. It's been out for eight years now.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Yeah, yeah. You expect there's going to be a little decline.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Almost eight years.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
No price drop or anything recently to motivate it, right?

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Yeah.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.000
All right. Well, we talked a lot in the first half of our show tonight about the Nintendo Direct conference that happened this week.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
But this was something that wasn't really a part of that, probably because this is only happening in Japan.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But I found this interesting. If for nothing else, then it name checks Tumblr, which I know Dark Sakura is into that.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
It's a web tool coming out for the 3DS internet browser.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And what you can do is you can share screenshots from certain compatible games right onto Twitter and Tumblr.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000
The games it supports right now, Animal Crossing New Leaf and Tomodachi Collection New Life, which isn't something we have here.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
But those are the games that are going to work with the service.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.000
And you can even see in a little screenshot here, you see the games and I guess you take the screenshot and you just put them right up on Twitter and Tumblr.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Which I find interesting that those are the two that are picked, not like Facebook or something.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
But again, it's Japan. Facebook might not be in Japan when it is here.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And honestly, do you want more of that shit on your Facebook?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Click block.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
You're right, I don't want more of that shit on my Facebook.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
God, Facebook is actually on my shit list for a big reason.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Well, I've been talking bad about it for a long time. Welcome to the party.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Alright, anyhow, no word, however, if this is something that's coming to our side of the pond, we'll see.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I imagine it's one of those things that might surprise us in the future, Nintendo Direct.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I would imagine maybe they are trying to incorporate some other services that are big here.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I can't imagine they wouldn't try to do Facebook. Try to think what other...

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Look, I just hit Tom Nook with a bug catching net.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Right?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I just made somebody fall into a hole.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I hope they incorporate more of this stuff. They should do this type of instant screenshotting for virtual console games.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000
See, I would have loved something like this when I was playing the first, well, technically the second Animal Crossing on GameCube and had my town lesbian.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Or like, look what crazy shit I got this guy to say.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I know, well we had one character because I think we brought over your card to have our town people meet.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
And now half of my town members started saying pussy.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And then we brought it over to Adam's house on his wife's game.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And then half of her town started saying it too.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Yeah, I caused an outbreak.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
You're a virus.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I was.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Rob caused an outbreak of pussy.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I got one that said a really, really nasty word and there was a certain friend at the time that really did not like that word.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Was it?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And it ended up moving to her villa, it ended up moving to her village.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
She worked for months to get, from what I hear, to get rid of it.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Oh man.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
In retrospect, I feel bad.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Memories.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
But yeah, memories. Animal Crossing ruining lives, left and right.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we would do the mailbag.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Lol, nope.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
But, no emails tonight?

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
FreezePop emailed us.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
They're selling merchandise to benefit the folks in Boston.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Oh, well that's cool. They are from Bob. That's great.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Yeah, so go check out FreezePop's merchandise. We love FreezePop.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
I almost sang Sprode last night and then I was too drunk.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And the reason why I kind of snickered in the beginning is because we get a lot of stuff from them all the time about what's going on.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
But that is definitely a cause worth plugging.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Well, I'm going to give it one more refresh just to see.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Just in case?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
And if anybody sent me an asshole email in the interim, then you're banned.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Nope.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Send us one for next week. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Send me something funny.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I will throw another plug out here for this. The bumpers.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Now, don't forget, we're looking for more bumpers for the show.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I didn't play one tonight. I have one in the queue. I still need to play.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And I forgot to get it prepped today with all the stuff that was going on today.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I had visitors from out of town and all that.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
So I didn't get around to doing that, so I apologize.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
But you know what? It's okay because if I had played it tonight, I wouldn't have had anything for next week.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So don't forget to send in bumpers.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And more details are available at the VOG Network.com forums.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Use your gaming voices to tell people stuff.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Alright, what are you...

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Something coming up.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Mewing out over there. Alright.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Something looks hideous.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Alright, well let's do the FUs of the week.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Speaking of hideous and wrong.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And horrible.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
To the girl who is at Panda Express.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Not while I'm working there.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
She walks up, this girl walks up to my car and says,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Hi, can you please buy us dinner? My mom just lost her job.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Which, she was totally lying.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I mean, it was, she was there with her friends hanging out and drinking cups of water from inside the...

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Not an Oscar winner.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
No.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
And I was like, and so I just said to her, I said, no.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
And she's like, but, but we need food.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I was like, there's assistance programs.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I'm not even going in Panda Express.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
And I went into the Rite Aid.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Cause it's like right next door.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Cause I wanted to buy cheap crappy sunglasses to wear over my regular glasses.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
And then, so I walked back in to go buy my food.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And I'm sorry to get you any kind of sour in the evening.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Can you get that?

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
It's fine. I actually ended up having Panda earlier today by coincidence.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So it works out.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Well, so anyway.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.000
By the way, the guy who talked about my hair a couple weeks ago was there and he said,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
You did your hair that way again?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Um, but, um, the girls were sitting out there just being completely stupid and harassing customers,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
but they didn't have like any kind of security going on.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
They could, they had no way to ask them to leave.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
So I was like, Oh, I am so sorry.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Your customers are being harassed right now.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000
And then, um, to the Audi, the person driving the Audi who kept trying to pass me.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
No.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
You all know.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Hello Key.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Um, I don't want to go all Seinfeld, but seriously,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
what's up with bicycles built for two?

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I mean, seriously, I saw like on the way here, you know, there's a lot of bikers out right now.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Like a tandem?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Yeah, like it's a bike with two seats and people both pedal.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Yeah. Okay.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I don't understand.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.000
You mean like the one in front, one in back, like the classic tandem bicycle or if it had a buggy or something?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
No, no, no.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000
The classic, like you see it in cartoons where they, it's a bicycle built for two.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Riding through the park together.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Like the method movie.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Yeah.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Like I understand, you know, if you're on vacation or something like, well, let's get a bicycle built for two.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000
But these were people that were, you know, the bikers that you see out on the road that dress up.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
The ones that like have their team sponsors.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
You're not sponsored by any fucking person.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Okay.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
You just have this stupid biker thing.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
It looks ridiculous.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
You look ridiculous.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And a bicycle built for two.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Like I'm supposed to be convinced that you're training for your bicycle built for two marathon race that you're going to be in.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I mean, come on.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
It's just.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
It's just weird.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I don't know.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
It just annoys me extra.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Uh, my a few of the week, I'll keep it short and sweet.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Um, F F you to those bastards that set the bombs off in Boston.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
That was, that was some straight up fucked up crap.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
So or the MIT shooter.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I am.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
That was all.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
That was all the same.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
That was the same guys.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Oh, yeah.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Did you not see the fuckery that blew up everywhere?

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I just saw that it was somebody I didn't see.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000
It was the same people.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
It was some, it was, it was fucked up, but, um, you know what?

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Props to the city for banding together to stay safe and, uh, find the guy and well, they killed one and arrested the other guy who's like half alive right now.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
So maybe they'll be able to get some answers.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Let's hope these crazies were acting alone, you know?

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Right.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Let's hope they weren't part of something bigger.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And that's, that would be even more fucked up.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
May I add something to that please?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Please.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Um, also the F you to the people who were going around and showing people on the internet that had absolutely nothing to do with it.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I'm pointing fingers at them because it got a few innocent people arrested.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Yeah.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Everybody wants to be a crime.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
So everybody's a little bit Nancy Drew.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Stick to the video games.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Don't be the Hardy boys.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Bobby Hammond interview with a very nice developer who's making crime games.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
And if you want to go solve crimes, go play her games.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I do have to agree though that major kudos to the Boston police.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
All right.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
But also F you to CNN.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
God, they fucked up this week.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Anyway, they've been CNN earns fuck up of the year already for me just because of how shitty their coverage is.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I go to BBC for my news.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I just, I just wait for the official press conferences because I, the thing I cannot stand, I cannot stand about situations like this is when there's a lull in actual news.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
It's let's talk about the why.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Let's theorize on all this crap we don't know about what, why did they do it or make up these theories?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That's the stuff that drives me bonkers when it comes to news.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I think you played video games.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Well, there was that story around about the Moroccan kid who they pulled in because he happened to be there and happened to have a black bag.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.000
He was a runner himself and not in the thing, but he was watching the marathon because it was his passion.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Inspiration.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
It's just, it's the whole profiling mentality.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Yeah.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I mean, I'm really, Oh God, I got into it with my mother today too.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I was super disgusted over that sort of closed minded mentality that, Oh, they, why?

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
They must be in trouble.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Fuck that.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Fuck that.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:36.000
When you literally cannot get, literally cannot get more Caucasian than these guys.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
They were from the caucus mountains.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Hi.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
That is like Uber Caucasian.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
That is literal Caucasian.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I am with Misty.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
See shit like this is why I stick to the bloody weather channel.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Amen.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
It's going to rain.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
You know what?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I'm about ready to sign up for that group going to Mars.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Fuck this planet.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I'm gone.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Not the show.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
I will find a way to Skype from Mars.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Just saying.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Can we move on to more gaming news?

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Let's talk about green people instead of white people.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Loki.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Uh, yes.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:22.000
So they have a mod for Skyrim that turns the Argonians into Ninja Turtles.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000
That looked frightening.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And then if you don't want to be Argonian, you can put the shell on yourself and you

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:35.000
could be like some strange cat turtle or some chick turtle.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.000
The dude that they have in the picture here looks kind of like the rock wearing turtle shell.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
He's like, what?

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I'm totally serious about this.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
But yeah, you can check that out.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It's, I don't know if it's on ModDB or if it's actually one of the, it's probably

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
on ModDB.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And then, or Skyrim Nexus.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Yeah, Skyrim Nexus is where it's at.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And yeah, check it out if that's your thing.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000
And maybe this gives you an idea of what the new Michael Bay movie is going to look

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
like.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Because it's terrible.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Alright.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
This is pretty cool.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
A new album being produced for record label Game Chops.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It's called World 1-2.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
It's not just about Mario.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000
It's about, it's about kind of like what's new and what's going on in, in, uh,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
bit rock and all that stuff right now.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Uh, including people like super hexagon composer, Chip Zell, um, Manami Matsumae who is, who

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
did Mega Man.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And we talked about also doing some tracks for Shovel Knight, uh, Austin Wintory contributing

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
to this.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Akira Yamaoka, apparently going to be on this too.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I would marry that man.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Uh, the album comes out May 2nd for $10.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:00.000
You can check out some of the tracks, uh, on the website music.gamechops.com.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Uh, the full URL is slash album slash world dash one dash two.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
But I'm sure if you get yourself to music.gamechops.com, you'll get to see some of this.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Now, sadly, we can't preview the Akira Yamaoka track for you because it's not there, but

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I could try to play a little bit of this.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000
This is the Manami, um, Matsumae song, one shot, one kill.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Matsumae.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Excuse me.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Can I play this?

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I won't let you.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I want to play a little bit of it, but it's not working.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
LOL Live Radio.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Crap.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
LOL Live Radio.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Let me see if one of these others will work here.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Let's try this Chip Zell track real quick.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Da da da da da da.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Live Radio.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Yeah, it won't work for some reason.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Go to the, you gave them the website.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
They can listen to it if they want to.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
You can check it out for yourself.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
After they've listened to us.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
So.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Or you can try to run both at the same time, but it might give you a headache.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
We'll talk.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
We can talk about whatever tonight.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
I know it's, we're ending.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
We're getting to the last part of the show a little sooner than usual, but let's be real.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Like the last few shows have all been like three and a half hours.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
So now I can go get my grocery shopping.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Right.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Well, we'll see.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
We still might have some calls coming in that, um, could be a good time.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
So again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Uh, last minute stories.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Loki.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I don't know if you have anything tonight.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I just, I'm shopping on steam.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I picked up a surgeon simulator.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Of course you did.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And they also have a double pack of breath of death seven and kazoo blue saves the world for 99 cents.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Hmm.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
So that's not bad.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Not bad at all.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
And the portal games were on super sale this weekend.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Yeah.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
But I already have portal.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Who does?

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I would think most of our listeners pick that up by now, but if you didn't, for whatever reason,

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I mean like I was surprised it's not 99 cents yet.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
It's they'll probably give it away.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
They gave portal away literally at one point and I'm sure portal to portal to right.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
And I think was at a 50% off sale.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Hmm.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Um, just a few days ago.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Oh yeah.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
I think that's the whole one this weekend anyway.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Yeah.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
All right.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
We do have a call coming in.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
So let's get to the phones.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Hi.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Who's this?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Hola.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Bienvenido.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Hey, this is excellent.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Hey, excellent.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
How you doing?

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Hey, doing good.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Oh, long time.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
You'll talk.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
How are you?

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I've called in here.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Happy a last week.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Thank you very much.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
That's been awesome.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
500.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
That's very, a lot of episodes.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
So.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000
We're so old.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I was calling in because I was decided by Earthbound, but I was a little disappointed

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.360
because during the announcements for it, they were saying that it was coming for the Wii

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.760
U and I was hoping that it was also going to come for that for the 3DS because I do

02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:48.360
own the 3DS for that and that is one of my favorite games playing well growing up.

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.440
I don't count out the 3DS, but I have a feeling they know a lot of people want Earthbound

02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.440
and so they'll probably keep it exclusive to Wii U because if you could even sell a

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:01.320
handful of consoles to people that really want to play it again, they'll do it.

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.840
Again, I don't know why you just wouldn't get a Super Nintendo and get the cart, but

02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:10.200
the cart is not exactly, I mean, it still goes on eBay for like 150 bucks.

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.760
I just like the portability of it.

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.640
I like the fact that usually when I go to work, sometimes I take the bus and stuff,

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.400
so it's kind of nice to have it so when I do the bus trips, it usually takes about 30,

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.400
40 minutes.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.200
I can just sit there and just level up my character or do whatever it takes, just play

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:25.840
and have fun with it.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.740
Why won't Nintendo just open it up so you buy one, get them on all consoles?

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:34.640
That would be the great, you know, they're still making money not doing it that way.

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.920
You know, they should take that, but then again, that's a playbook either Sony too.

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:44.600
Sony kind of does that with some of their games with the PSP to the PS3 or vice versa

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:45.960
kind of deal to that.

02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:48.480
So I mean, I don't know about the Vita.

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:50.080
They have done some cross play.

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.960
They have done some cross play that's pretty awesome.

02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:52.960
Like what?

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.980
Retro City Rampage had it and you know, the fighting game, the Super or the All Stars

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.160
PlayStation battle royale.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.680
I was referring more to the fact that like you buy some like their quote unquote arcade

02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.600
games or lower end games like the pinball and stuff that you can actually play on both

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.400
systems without worrying about rebinding it like six times.

02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:15.000
So I got nothing against it because believe it or not, here in the household here between

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.400
me and my girlfriend, we had bought Plants vs Zombies like six different times for six

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.600
different, almost six different forms of platforms.

02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.320
I think a lot of people did.

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.960
So you know, I do look forward to that.

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.760
Also really quickly, Rob, you really love League of Legends.

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.320
I would love to sit there and play with you.

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:33.720
I think you would have a lot of fun with that over DOA.

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.200
DOA is just, the game is a lot of fun.

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:43.460
There is a lot of different stuff they did with that through Steam and the Steam workshop

02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:48.280
but also to the player base on there is a horde compared to that of League of Legends.

02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.560
I swear I'm going to give League of Legends the good old once over but I got to finish

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.560
up a game.

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:56.580
I got to write a review for it first and then I can get into League of Legends over the

02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:00.600
next week while there's still not a lot going on for me in WoW right now.

02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:04.360
Well, it's one of those games where it's nice enough where I can go in there and play

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.520
a game for an hour or two and not worry about anything.

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.080
Like right now I'm level 19 out of 30 so I'm working my way up to 30 right now but

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.980
it's nice enough where I can sit there and play a game or two and not worry about that.

02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:18.120
You know, I have to worry about subscription fee or anything like that on some other games

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.120
like WoW or something.

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.760
What worries me most about League of Legends though is the other people.

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:24.500
I hear the community is really awful in League of Legends.

02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:29.200
No offense to the fans out there but I have heard your community is really awful.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:33.580
There is a lot of people that are really awful in the game but there's also a lot of good

02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:34.580
people in the game.

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.660
But WoW is not that much worse.

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:39.900
Look at the people on there from Cal and stuff.

02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:45.780
I mean, it's just the horror stories I can tell you just sitting here talking about that.

02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:47.220
But that's with any game in general.

02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:50.820
You're going to have the good along with the bad.

02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:52.940
That's the fun of it like playing with friends and stuff.

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:55.940
That way you don't have to worry about that so much.

02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.620
It's like one of those things where if you do something wrong or something people will

02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:01.620
point it out saying, hey, by the way, you do not do this right.

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:03.220
You should do this instead.

02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:05.380
Just follow this or go here and look at this.

02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:08.620
It's kind of like they do in WoW and it's kind of nice to know that there is a lot of

02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:13.540
people that is willing to work as long as there is a lot of good as there is bad with

02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:15.540
a lot of games.

02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.340
I will give League of Legends a serious try.

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:22.580
I've fired it up a couple times but I haven't done anything serious with it but I will take

02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:26.620
my friend's offer to help school me a little bit on it and I'll let you guys all know

02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:27.620
how it turns out.

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:28.620
But give me a couple weeks.

02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:29.620
Give me a couple weeks.

02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:32.220
Like I said before, if you need any pointers or anything, I'll be more than happy to

02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.700
How about I kick your ass at it?

02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.700
Yeah, okay.

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.700
You want to do that, that's fine.

02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:38.180
Be more than happy to do that.

02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:40.500
Play a one-on-one game with you.

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.780
I can stream it on Twitch like everybody else.

02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:43.780
It'll be fun.

02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:44.780
All right.

02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:45.780
Excellent.

02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:47.340
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:48.980
That's pretty much about it for right now.

02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:49.980
All right.

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:50.980
We'll have a good one.

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:52.620
I was going to get my input out of Earthbound and stuff.

02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:56.340
I'm also kind of worried too, the wondering what they're going to do because now they're

02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:57.780
announcing this out for so many years.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:01.340
I'm kind of wondering if they're going to sugarcoat it or take stuff out or what they're

02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:04.180
going to do to replace it because I know a lot of the issues they were having with

02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:05.700
that was with the music.

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:08.940
So I'm kind of curious to know what they're going to do to get around that.

02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:13.340
I am very curious as well to see if it comes out unedited or if they make any changes.

02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:17.060
It will be very interesting because they're not going to announce it until it's already

02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:18.060
out.

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.060
So we'll see.

02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.060
Yeah, of course.

02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.140
So that's probably an E3 thing too.

02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:24.220
As long as the happy, happy cultists are still there.

02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:25.220
They're my favorite.

02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:26.220
All right.

02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:27.620
I'm sure it will be.

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:29.980
They remind me of Shane because everything has to be blue.

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:30.980
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:32.620
All right.

02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:33.620
Take care, buddy.

02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:34.620
You have a good night, man.

02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:35.620
I'll talk to you later.

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.620
You too.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.620
Bye.

02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:38.620
Bye.

02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:42.820
1877 game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:43.820
All one word.

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:48.140
I am still, by the way, singing the praises of Drunken Robot Pornography.

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:49.140
Oh, yeah.

02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.220
You've been raving about that game on Steam and all that.

02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:52.220
Everyone needs to play it.

02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:53.220
It's hard as hell, but fun.

02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:54.220
It has a catchy theme song.

02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:55.220
It has a very catchy theme song.

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.220
Have you played it?

02:14:57.220 --> 02:14:58.220
No.

02:14:58.220 --> 02:14:59.220
You need it.

02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:00.220
How much is it?

02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:01.460
That's not bad.

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:02.460
All right.

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:03.460
Let's go to the next call.

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:04.460
Hi.

02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:05.460
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:06.460
Who's this?

02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:07.460
That's the one and only Ranma.

02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:08.460
Hey, buddy.

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.460
How you doing?

02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:10.460
Hi, John.

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:11.460
Hey.

02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.460
I'm doing good.

02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:13.460
I'm doing good.

02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:14.460
I saw that Dark Sakura made some new album art for Anime Jam Session.

02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.460
It looks good.

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:16.460
Yeah.

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:17.460
I mean-

02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.460
She wants to fix the misspelling.

02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:19.460
No.

02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:22.220
She took my idea and just took it to the next level because that was not what I was expecting.

02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:26.220
I'm just like, the entire staff pretty much loves the new logo.

02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.220
Great.

02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.980
Well, I'm glad that you like it.

02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:30.380
Now tell people to hire me.

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:31.700
I did.

02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:36.700
If you go to the official Facebook page, there is a link to your fan page where people can

02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:37.700
contact you for commissions.

02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:38.700
There you go.

02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:40.460
Well, I would appreciate that.

02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.460
Trust me.

02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:44.460
I did not mean to derail your call with singing the praises of Dark Sakura.

02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:45.460
What's on your mind tonight?

02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.460
I did though.

02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:49.180
It's a couple of things.

02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:50.940
It's a little bit different from what you were talking about.

02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:54.420
It's something I've been meaning to bring up in conversation prior.

02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:55.500
Okay.

02:15:55.500 --> 02:16:01.420
I remember Loki bitching about Smart Glass and truth be told, I understand where he's

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:11.360
coming from, but my thing is with Smart Glass and the new upcoming Xbox, I'd like to see

02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.660
Microsoft use more Smart Glass integration when playing games.

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:22.580
I'd also like to see Sony get on the bandwagon with the PS4 because truth be told, not everybody's

02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:27.600
going to have a Vita and if you're going to be beaming stuff to the Vita, which its

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:33.980
operating system is slightly similar to Android, maybe we can get a little app on our tablet

02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:36.220
so we can have a little fun with that too.

02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:42.980
I'm not sure it can work as fast as say a Wii U because a Wii U uses that whole dedicated

02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.180
broadcasting channel to transmit to the pad.

02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:50.820
It's a lot different than the technology in something like Smart Glass where your little

02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:56.860
iDevice beams to your wireless and the Xbox or whatever is on that same device, everything's

02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:58.420
kind of running through your router.

02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:03.140
It actually slows things down a lot so it's not like your device can be a controller suddenly

02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:04.260
or anything like that.

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.980
It's not going to work like that.

02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:09.900
I wouldn't want it as a controller but like a secondary screen or something like that.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:13.060
The weird thing about it is that that's what I always thought Smart Glass was supposed

02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:16.500
to be and Smart Glass was really implemented poorly.

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:20.200
It's another example of something that Microsoft really half-assed.

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.080
They put on a great show at E3 and then they half-assed their way through it.

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:27.920
Connect Labs is another great example, Game Room.

02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:34.000
They half-assed a lot of this shit, they didn't see it, XNA, sorry about it, but they didn't

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.360
really give it the due that it deserved.

02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.360
The vision camera.

02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.960
The vision camera, I mean the list goes on and on.

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:45.160
Just add Smart Glass to the list, it's really unfortunate because you kind of see the potential

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.320
there, especially with it being such a media device.

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:53.880
Then watch, at E3 this year when they're selling their little dedicated channel, they're going

02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:57.680
to push the second screen technology again, they're going to push Smart Glass again.

02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:01.400
But I really hope to hell someone calls them out on it like, well wasn't this supposed

02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.240
to be there already and like what?

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:09.120
A handful of movies have it and then Dance Central and Halo.

02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:14.020
And all Halo does is launch what is a separate app anyway.

02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:15.520
You can download it as a separate app.

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:20.880
And I still can't, you know, Forza or whatever, that's another one, Forza Horizon uses it,

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.700
I still can't on my Android device actually pull up the map.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:30.240
It doesn't have any of that actual Smart Glass function, it's just, hey look, Xbox apps,

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.660
we renamed the Smart Glass.

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:35.960
Smart Glass ought to be a hell of a lot better than it is, and it's really disappointing.

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.920
I mean they could be doing these, like it might not be fast enough to be controllers,

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.400
he can't even do like little submenus and things like that, but why not maps of levels

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:45.640
that you're playing?

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:51.120
Like static images that change, you know, it just, it blows my mind how ridiculous it

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.120
is.

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:56.680
And you're right, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you're right, but because of

02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:01.920
the WiFi frequency, I mean, it is not as fast, but it gets up there because Smart Glass is

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.640
pretty much like an over-glorified controller.

02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:06.920
That's pretty much what it is.

02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:16.200
Hell, I use my tablet to tell it to play videos on YouTube on my TV through to 360 or to PS3.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:17.200
That is awesome.

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.200
You know, it's pretty cool.

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.200
You know, pretty fast.

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.560
Here's the thing though, the new system is supposed to be running on Bluetooth versus

02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:27.600
this WiFi thing, now they can have an app that directly communicates with it via Bluetooth

02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.000
instead of over WiFi, and so you're going to have less latency, and you can do more

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.760
amazing things with it.

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:41.280
Well, E3 is going to be Microsoft touting all these features again, but we'll see

02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.360
how many of them actually, excuse me, actually get implemented to its fullest.

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.360
Yep.

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.160
All right, anything else you want to share with us today?

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:52.560
I have a funny Paxi story.

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.280
Okay, go for it.

02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:58.840
So we're all in one of the rooms, we're all sitting there, you know, we have our 3DSs

02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:03.800
out, we're, you know, we're swapnoting and cross-friending and all that cool stuff.

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:07.760
And then Bobby happens to, you know, walk out of the room because he had to go take

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.760
care of something.

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:15.520
One of my friends in the room, he's going through his friends list, and he's like,

02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:20.040
oh, Bobby Blackwell, I'm friending with him now.

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:26.980
Now, he just said it very nonchalantly, now the entire room just gets quiet and looks

02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:27.980
at him.

02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:29.920
And he's like, what?

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:32.840
I say, um, that was Bobby Blackwell.

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.040
He just walked out the room.

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:40.200
So this is somebody that was like a fan of the show that had no idea that Bobby was the

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:41.200
right in front of him?

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:44.640
My friend Paul, who goes by the name of Oshie, he used to be, I think he used to be like

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:51.480
a mod on the G4 forums in the chat room, so they go way back, so it's like, he didn't

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:53.880
realize that was Bobby in the room.

02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:54.880
That's funny.

02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:59.860
And we kind of raised, we kind of gave him hell for that the whole weekend.

02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:00.860
That's funny.

02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:04.980
Especially through this radio thing, I've met some people and they're like, you know,

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:09.220
you don't look anything like you sound, and I'm just like, all right, how do you respond

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.220
to that?

02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:11.220
I think Bobby looks like a Bobby.

02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.420
I don't know how to respond to that.

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.900
Is that an insult or a compliment?

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.900
It could go either way.

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:24.200
Rob, I still remember that cat to come walking around in the dealer's room, not even five

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:28.460
minutes in, the guy goes, you're Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:29.460
Yeah.

02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:30.460
Blush.

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:32.060
Yeah, that happened.

02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:36.260
You remember when we were at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza and one of our listeners was

02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:37.260
there?

02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:38.260
Hi, listener!

02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:44.340
It's a very nice, like, it's an uber compliment, but one thing to remember, guys, like, I'm

02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:46.020
not Tom Cruise, okay?

02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:47.020
I'm really-

02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:48.020
Thank God!

02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:49.020
Thank God I'm not.

02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:50.020
But I'm really-

02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:51.020
You're like more Tom Cruise.

02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:54.740
I'm a fan of video games just like the rest of you guys, so like, you know, when people

02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:59.140
are like, oh my God, you're Rob, I'm just like, yeah, I'm Rob, hey, how you doing?

02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:00.140
Tell me about yourself.

02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.140
You know?

02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:03.940
You've been listening to me for all this time, tell me about you.

02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:08.980
So yeah, it's very humbling, but very flattering.

02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.980
Cindy.

02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:10.980
All right.

02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:15.620
Well, I'm going to let you go, Rama, to see if anybody else comes through, okay?

02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:16.620
You got it, bro.

02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:17.620
All right, take care, buddy.

02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:18.620
You too.

02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:19.620
All right, Trun Trun.

02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:20.620
Later.

02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:21.620
All right.

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:27.300
1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is Orange- You all right over there in the kitchen?

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:28.300
Allen's making a mess.

02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:33.900
All right, let's go to some tweets, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet.

02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.620
You guys might have read about this in the news.

02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:39.220
LulzSec member sentenced for Sony Pictures website hacking.

02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:42.780
Yeah, they went after some of those guys that were involved in that and it looks like they've

02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:48.060
sentenced a few of them and one of them for the hacking of Sony Pictures website.

02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.660
Not related to the Sony PlayStation network hack though, right?

02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:52.660
No.

02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:53.660
Different, right?

02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:54.660
Interesting.

02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:55.660
Let's go to the phones.

02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:57.140
We have one more call coming in we'll take.

02:22:57.140 --> 02:22:58.140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:22:58.180 --> 02:22:59.180
Who's this?

02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:00.700
Hey, this is Prince Brightstar.

02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:01.700
Hey, Prince Brightstar.

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:02.700
Hi.

02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:03.700
How are you?

02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:04.700
Doing good, yourself?

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:05.700
Good.

02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:08.620
Now, you are the listener that was listening last week and you're like, this is my first

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:14.300
show in a long time, but I remember when you came to visit a very long time ago, right?

02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:15.300
That's right.

02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:16.980
Summer of 2003, I think.

02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:21.660
To put it in perspective, you were out here at the tech TV buildings, right?

02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:22.660
Right, exactly.

02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:23.660
This show's-

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.820
And I'll never forgive Comcast for what they did.

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:27.820
I know.

02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:31.940
Isn't it weird now that that's all really, really over, huh?

02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:32.940
I know.

02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:34.340
But, you know what?

02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.260
Props to Attack of the Show for the ending.

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:41.900
That was a very nice way to end the show with the nod to a Leo Laporte and Alex and so forth.

02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:49.180
Yeah, and I know Leo Laporte is still doing his podcast and such, and I think Chris Parilla

02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:50.340
is doing live streaming.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:55.180
Yeah, they have a studio in the North Bay out in Petaluma, I think it's located.

02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:59.140
Everybody I know went over there for something, and yeah, so it's cool that they still kind

02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:00.140
of have all that in the Bay Area.

02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:03.860
It might not be in the city, but it's, you know, they're producing great content outside

02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:04.860
the city.

02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.860
Right.

02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:09.260
Anyhow, I didn't mean to derail you, but what's on your mind tonight?

02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:13.740
So once again, I did want to wish you congrats on the 500th episode.

02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:14.740
Thank you.

02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:16.700
Can you believe we're still here?

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:17.700
I know.

02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:23.260
I feel old, and I need to see if I can find the old episode where I was there.

02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:25.740
Do you remember what episode number it was?

02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:26.740
I do not.

02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:30.320
I know it was summer of 2003, but that's all I remember.

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:31.460
Two tips for you.

02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:37.580
There is the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, and Dark Tetsuya

02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:41.580
has put together an awesome little summary of like every single episode, so if you look

02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:46.100
at the summer of 2003, you might find the topics, and you might go like, oh, I was there

02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:47.440
when that happened.

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:51.220
And then there's another website, and Dark Tetsuya will correct me if I'm wrong on this,

02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:56.980
but I think it's OLRxiv, I think it's O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot T-K.

02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:00.740
I think he had to change the forwarder, so he'll give me the new address here in chat

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:05.540
in a minute, but look forward to the VOG Network forums, look for Dark Tetsuya.

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:10.820
He has the OLRxiv, and there's a lot of old episodes they have up on like a SkyDrive somewhere,

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:13.620
so there's a lot, a lot of old shit.

02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:14.620
Gotcha.

02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:15.620
You might find it.

02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:16.620
All right, I'll have to check them out.

02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:17.620
Thank you for the hookup, by the way.

02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:18.620
Thank you.

02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:19.620
There it is from Dark Tetsuya.

02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:24.300
O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot L-Y, so bit.ly slash O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E.

02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:27.220
So if you want to, and this goes out to the general listenership as well, if you want

02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:30.940
to hear what Orange Andrado sounded like back in 2003, you can check that out.

02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:33.100
But I do want to, I always kind of put this out there.

02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.260
It was a very different show back then.

02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:40.940
I was busy reading Harry Potter anyway.

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:45.380
So part of the reason why I'm calling here tonight as well, Dark Sakura, I just sent

02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:49.460
over the details for Phantasy Star Online 2 for you.

02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:53.300
But there's something on my mind aside from that that I kind of want to get out there.

02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:55.220
It's got me a little bit worried here.

02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:56.700
What did I do?

02:25:56.700 --> 02:26:01.500
Regarding that game, it was announced that it was supposed to come out here in the West.

02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:07.960
And then we rolled past the release date and all Sega had to say was, it's delayed and

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:09.980
nothing else.

02:26:09.980 --> 02:26:14.300
And that's not the first time that this has happened.

02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:17.380
Colonial Marines, that just happened as well for the Wii U.

02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:22.220
Obviously that's under a different company, but it's got me wondering what's up with the

02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:27.540
management because there have been other incidences with Sega recently, such as the recent Shining

02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:30.180
Force debacle back in November.

02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:36.460
It's kind of got me wondering what's going on there and are we potentially seeing Sega

02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:38.800
of America closing soon?

02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:42.140
When has Sega had good management in the US?

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:47.060
I am hoping you are just out here yelling the sky is falling, which is perfectly valid.

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.740
You have good reason for thinking that.

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:55.060
But I would say E3 is kind of Sega's chance to be like, alright, put it out on the table.

02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:56.060
What's coming?

02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:58.260
Is Phantasy Star 2 on that list or not?

02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:01.740
And if it's not, then I would start to get worried.

02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:04.780
But I kind of think that's the type of thing they keep in their pants till E3.

02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:08.460
I seriously think that Sega is still going to have a US presence regardless, even if

02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:10.260
they have to cut back operations here.

02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:14.020
Well sure, a lot of Japanese companies still have an American presence in the games industry.

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:15.020
True.

02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:20.940
They may have the translations done in-house at Sega of Japan, but I was just at PAX East

02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:22.940
recently, they did not have a booth there.

02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:25.860
So that's part of what's got me thinking this.

02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:29.060
That is, I mean, PAX is kind of hit and miss.

02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:33.000
It depends if they have something to show or not, but you know, there are some companies

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.700
that don't really do PAX.

02:27:34.700 --> 02:27:36.840
I mean like, take Blizzard for example.

02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:39.740
They were there at PAX East because they had something to show with this whole new like

02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:42.340
Hearthstone game, but they don't usually do these cons.

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.580
Well Blizzard is like, LOL, we'll do our own cons.

02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:46.540
But yeah, that's actually just it.

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:50.060
They don't usually do these things, so they kind of do it when it's convenient for them,

02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:51.560
which I don't blame them for.

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.500
For the record, I would go to SegaCon.

02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:55.300
Just saying.

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:56.300
Agreed.

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:59.980
Well, what are we missing?

02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:03.220
You're playing Phantasy Star Online 2 obviously, what are the rest of us missing?

02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:06.340
I really want to check it out at some point.

02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:08.340
You mean in the game or other games?

02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:09.340
Yeah, in the game.

02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:11.900
In Phantasy Star Online 2, how is it?

02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:18.660
It is what I would consider to be a very faithful upgrade from the original game that came out

02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:21.220
back in 2000.

02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:28.420
The character creator is, I'd say, even better than what you get out of Skyrim.

02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:35.660
The level design is superb in that even though it's randomized, it's still got a lot of

02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:42.740
familiar elements, and you can just randomly encounter a boss outside of the boss nets.

02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:43.740
It's just crazy.

02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:48.060
Does this mean that you can make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Phantasy Star Online 2?

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:53.460
I doubt it, but can I still headshot a Rappy?

02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:57.380
You can definitely spend at least an hour per character just building it.

02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:59.620
How many Rappys can I expect to kill?

02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:00.620
Tons.

02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:01.620
Yes!

02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:04.220
I hate those things.

02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:09.060
And they still play dead and then get back up and you can shoot them again or whatever.

02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:14.660
My friend actually spent $100 to buy a Rappy plushie.

02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:18.260
Is there a big English-speaking presence on the game?

02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:21.700
Are there a lot of people like you who are playing it even though it's not out in this

02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:22.860
country?

02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:27.820
Not only is there an English presence, there is a fan patch available for English so that

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:31.900
you can translate a good bunch of the game into English.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:34.940
That's pretty awesome.

02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:35.940
That's a fan thing.

02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:38.380
That's not something Sega sanctioned, right?

02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:39.380
Exactly.

02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:46.860
Basically, people got fed up with how long it was taken, so they just ran with it, basically.

02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:47.860
Fan communities do amazing things.

02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:51.900
I honestly don't see Sega really having too big of a problem with it, to be honest.

02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:55.340
Because, I mean, remember the support that they gave when they closed down the original

02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:57.060
Phantasy Star Online servers?

02:29:57.060 --> 02:29:58.220
That's true.

02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:02.060
They did open up the Japanese form.

02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:03.060
Exactly.

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:09.260
But they also provided US players with the data for their character to transfer to private

02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:12.100
servers.

02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:13.460
I didn't think that happened.

02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:15.900
I thought that was something that fans were hoping for.

02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:16.900
No.

02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:20.260
Because I was going to do it, but I ended up just sort of not caring because I hadn't

02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:22.880
been playing Phantasy Star Online for a little while.

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:29.840
But they were allowing full character transfers into private servers.

02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:35.160
It was a limited window that they did it, but they had it available.

02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:36.600
I'll have to look that up again.

02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:37.600
All right.

02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:39.260
Well, Prince Brightstar, thanks so much for the call.

02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:40.680
It's good to hear from you for so long.

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:41.680
So welcome back.

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:42.680
Yep.

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:46.320
I'm probably going to be here every week for a good bit here.

02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:47.320
Awesome.

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:48.320
Appreciate the support.

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.320
Well, you have a good one.

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:50.320
Okay, buddy?

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:51.320
You too.

02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:52.320
All right.

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:57.160
I think that's really awesome for somebody that's like, you know, I fell out of the habit

02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:58.160
or whatever.

02:30:58.160 --> 02:31:00.560
Real life gets in the way and you don't end up listening to the show anymore.

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:01.560
It's cool.

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:04.280
But then it's like, after all this time, it's like, wow, I came back and y'all are still

02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:05.280
here.

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:07.040
And it hasn't really changed that much.

02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:09.080
You know, it's a really awesome thing to hear.

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:11.480
So thank you very much.

02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:14.920
We outlived Tech TV G4.

02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:18.520
All right.

02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:20.080
Let's see if we get a few more tweets out here.

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:23.680
I don't know if there's any other last minute stories, but quickly, some more tweets from

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:24.680
Tiger Claw.

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:29.320
Centipede creator sees lack of diversity in the game industry.

02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:30.320
Hmm.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:34.600
Is that just because it's SQL SQL SQL SQL milking out the IPs?

02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:35.600
That's my assumption here.

02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:36.600
Hold on.

02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:37.600
I'm bringing up the article here.

02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:38.600
Why would anyone be surprised by that?

02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:43.320
I haven't seen these because they're tweeted to me.

02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:44.640
It's also depending on where you're looking.

02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:47.400
I mean, if you're looking at mainstream gaming, then yeah.

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:48.400
Okay.

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:51.400
Here's the headline they're pulling that quote from or I mean, here's the quote they're pulling

02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:52.880
the headline from.

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:56.700
So much progress has been made in the development cycle and the way games are developed.

02:31:56.700 --> 02:32:01.360
This is according to industry button Dona Bailey.

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:05.520
It seems there hasn't been enough progress in the diversity of game designers and gender

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:08.800
equality for game designers.

02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:10.760
Hmm.

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.760
Hmm.

02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:14.120
That does make sense.

02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:15.640
And I probably totally butchered the name.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.880
It's probably Donna Bailey, but I said it wrong because it's spelled a little differently

02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:19.880
than what I'm used to.

02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:21.880
So Hmm.

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:27.600
Well, sadly, it's something you know, it's not like we haven't heard it before.

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:33.320
But I think the best way to help combat that a little bit is prove some of these analysts

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.320
wrong.

02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.920
The people that say that, you know, the masses won't support a game with a strong female

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:40.140
lead and so forth.

02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:43.700
It's important that and I'm not saying you have to support a game just because it has

02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:45.040
a female lead.

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:49.840
Find the one that you like and really rally behind it and you know, gather support for

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:51.860
it and so forth and show these guys they're wrong.

02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:55.360
I honestly think that we need to see more games that give you a choice.

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:56.360
Hmm.

02:32:56.360 --> 02:33:00.120
Well, I made I made this comment during Bobby show and I think it's it's worth kind of exploring

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.120
a little bit.

02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:04.140
I'll bring this up with you, Jamie, is that it's obviously part of a larger problem with

02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:09.360
society and my whole thing is that let's take the dude bros who buy Xbox and I'm totally

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:11.520
stereotyping here guys bear with me.

02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:15.320
Let's take the dude bros that buy their Xboxes because they're only interested in Madden

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:19.040
games and the basketball games and all the sports games that come out every year.

02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:23.880
Well, you can't play as a woman in Madden, but that's not video games fault.

02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:24.880
That's football.

02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:25.880
Right.

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:31.300
So I mean, but what if the NFL were to have a woman come into the league someday?

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:35.720
You know, there's a woman that that is that that is a strong football player and you know,

02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:40.280
gets on a team and now you can play as a woman in Madden that that right there would break

02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:41.880
down a barrier.

02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:42.880
It would.

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:45.200
But I don't see it happening just because of that.

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:48.080
I mean, we're in a total patriarchal society right now.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.080
Not just right now.

02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:50.640
We've always been.

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:54.220
And it's completely disgusting.

02:33:54.220 --> 02:34:02.600
And I'm going to say one thing that there are there there are degrees of this physical

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:05.500
expectation that's put out for sports.

02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:11.320
But I've seen some women's NBA players who could totally school guys.

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:13.220
I mean, I don't see why we don't have an integrated team.

02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:16.800
You look in the four and you hate to go refer to the movie, but you remember a league of

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:17.800
their own.

02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:18.800
Yeah, sure.

02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:20.340
That should happen where all men were in war.

02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.860
They had female baseball teams fully on.

02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:24.820
And then the WNBA is a thing.

02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:25.820
Well, yeah, it is.

02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:30.500
But I mean, I'm saying that it's not like we haven't had a precedent for having women

02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:33.900
in sports or even having integrated sports teams like that.

02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:39.740
It's just that people have this notion that it shouldn't be done, that it can't be done,

02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:40.900
that there's a big physical difference.

02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:42.500
Say that you get China out.

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:47.420
OK, I hate to use it, you know, old wash up wrestler, but say you have China, who, yes,

02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.480
true, she did lots and lots of steroids, but she's got the bulk.

02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:51.660
She's got the strength for it.

02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:53.100
She wrestles dudes.

02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:54.100
Well, she did.

02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:56.180
Isn't she in TNA now, I think?

02:34:56.180 --> 02:35:00.660
Anyway, but I mean, you've got someone with that type of physical capability who can stand

02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.100
up with the guys.

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:09.940
I think that if a person is physically capable of being a part of whatever that sport is,

02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:18.740
whatever that event is, they should be allowed to be in it without having to deal with judgment

02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:22.700
because of their gender or because of any other factor.

02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:24.300
By the way, I did close the Skype line for now.

02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:26.300
I didn't mean to get on this discussion, but it's a good one.

02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:29.420
So I'm sorry to those who didn't get through on Skype, but feel free to email us.

02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:31.860
Mailbag at orangesontrated.com.

02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:33.580
Comment from ShadowNextGen.

02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:37.880
Has Dark Sakura seen how the UFC has started highlighting women's MMA?

02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.560
The next season of the Ultimate Fighter has two female coaches that will coach both men

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:42.560
and women.

02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:43.900
Just curious about your thoughts.

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:46.100
I actually don't watch much UFC.

02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:51.620
I tried watching when, oh God, what was his name that was in WWF?

02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:58.080
He, God, I can't, cause he was just like the most boring dude ever, but he was amazing

02:35:58.080 --> 02:35:59.080
to watch.

02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.080
I watched from UFC and then I think went back to UFC.

02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:08.080
And I also watched when Brock Lesnar went to UFC for a little while, dude, he was vicious.

02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:11.020
But I didn't really, I haven't kept up with it.

02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:14.140
Let me ask a real weird question that might be a little bit.

02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:16.760
And I'm not talking about Brock Lesnar, I'm talking about somebody else.

02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:19.600
Let me ask you a weird question that might be a little bit off the wall and it might

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.560
even be a little bit difficult, but it's honestly something I'm wondering and I want to ask

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:25.560
a girl.

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:26.560
Okay.

02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.560
Sorry.

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:28.560
I'm doing both.

02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:30.040
Pay attention to me.

02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:31.040
Okay.

02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:32.040
But yes, it was Ken Shamrock.

02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:36.920
So female sports people that have broken through, one of them I think of that I think a lot

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:40.000
of us think of is Danica Patrick in NASCAR, right?

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.240
Well, Danica Patrick is playable in a video game, but it's Sonic's All-Stars Racing, which

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.640
is a great game, but it's kind of cutesy lala.

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:52.520
You know, she's sitting there aside a lot of, you know, Sonic and a lot of cartoony

02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:53.520
people.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:37:00.160
Does this do the image of the woman in sports favors or does it hurt because, well, Danica

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.960
Patrick's in a game, but it's cutesy lala land.

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:05.640
Well, it's definitely not hurting her wallet.

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:07.040
Okay.

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:09.780
Props for that, right?

02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:15.480
I don't look at it so much as a hindrance, although it is, I think going back to a little

02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:17.600
bit more on the stereotype.

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.920
I think it's definitely getting her some, getting her exposure apart from just being

02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:24.640
pretty awesome on her own.

02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:31.280
I mean, aren't we now seeing like more women in NASCAR too, like more female drivers?

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:33.160
She's certainly not the last.

02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:34.160
I know.

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:37.000
Well, I think that we, there was one who, God, I don't remember.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.200
There's one who has, I think an F1 going into F1 circuit.

02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.160
Dan would know more about this than I do since he watches Top Gear.

02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:45.920
Yeah, I don't even really watch NASCAR, but I know about this one.

02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.120
There's also that lady who sometimes goes on Jeremy Clarkson's show.

02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.000
She's one of the hosts of British Top Gear and she's a driver.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.120
She's amazing too.

02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:57.120
Yeah.

02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:59.560
And Bobby points out too, Danica wasn't the first female driver either.

02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:00.560
She wasn't the first.

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.360
I just said she wasn't the last.

02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:03.360
She wouldn't be left.

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:09.560
But my problem with Danica Patrick is that she is having to rely on stereotypes to keep

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:11.360
her popularity up.

02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:16.420
You know, that whole, well, you got to show a little boob or you got to, you know, be

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:17.900
this.

02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:20.660
You can't be just a talented driver.

02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:23.180
You have to be a sex symbol too.

02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:24.180
That I hate.

02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:25.380
I hate, I hate, I hate.

02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:29.460
And some people really, like you've got Rasteel UT in chat who says Danica Patrick didn't

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:32.540
break through because of her racing, she broke through because she sexualizes herself in

02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:33.540
GoDaddy commercials.

02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:38.500
So you've got, you know, people that kind of resent the whole T and A, if you will.

02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:43.620
Well, I mean, and I'm even going to go into another, cause one of my heroes, cause you

02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:49.620
know I've been trying to work out a lot more, is a weightlifter named Samantha Wright.

02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.940
And she is adorable.

02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:53.720
She's probably my height.

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:58.260
And I think that if I kept working out like she, you know, clearly does, I would probably

02:38:58.260 --> 02:38:59.940
have, would be about the same build.

02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.940
So she's been, I've looked at her because we do have a lot of physical traits in common.

02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:11.860
I think that her body type would be a good ideal for me as far as working out and health.

02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:16.860
Now she's getting all this extra attention because she is so absolutely adorable.

02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:18.820
She is pretty.

02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:19.820
She's pretty hot.

02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:23.820
I mean, I will say that, but there've been other female weightlifters who have been just

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:27.620
as, if not more talented, if not stronger than her.

02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:32.020
And if you look at people who are actually physically strong, and I'm not talking about

02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:38.260
the people who, you know, are those muscle competitions, cause they starve themselves

02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:39.260
to nothing.

02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.780
They are at their least healthy when they're at a show.

02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:45.820
You look at the actual strong people, the people who do the strong man contest who are

02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:50.120
pulling semis with their body weight, they're built like trunks.

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:56.280
And the women who participate in these, they're built like, you know, complete.

02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:00.080
It's funny you bring up the bodybuilding because it brings to mind one of, I think a great

02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.680
example of where there were very memorable men and women in this, and I'm using this

02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.820
term very loosely with my quotey fingers, sport, American gladiators.

02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:09.820
Yeah.

02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:12.140
Cause there were memorable men and women on that show.

02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:15.900
I mean, it was really like an equal playing field of sorts.

02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:19.180
I can tell you one thing about that, and just because I learned how to recognize it, oddly

02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:24.380
enough when I worked at GNC, because we would have so many roided guys come in, teenagers

02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:29.140
take in that andro because of, what was that stupid baseball player?

02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:30.500
Fuck whatever his name was.

02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:37.060
So anyway, there's a way to tell when a woman is roided.

02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:41.300
There were some women on that show who were very naturally strong.

02:40:41.300 --> 02:40:43.860
They looked like a strong woman.

02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:48.500
You want to see what a woman looks like without steroids, who has worked out, who has a small

02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:50.500
frame, Linda Hamilton and Terminator 2.

02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:52.300
But I mean, I'm serious.

02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:55.460
And that honestly, to me, people are like, oh, she looks so bulky.

02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:57.020
I thought that was really attractive.

02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:59.620
I thought that looking strong was a very good thing.

02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:00.620
Yeah.

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:01.620
Martin McGuire.

02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:02.620
Thank you.

02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:04.300
Not Barry Bonds.

02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:09.460
But then you had the other ones like, and I'm going to go back to using China.

02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:14.500
A woman cannot carry that type of muscle structure naturally without having a genetic predisposition

02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:15.560
towards it.

02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:21.680
And you can tell how many people are augmented who have a breast enhancement surgery on top

02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:29.860
of having taken steroids because it will very much give more masculine traits to a woman

02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:34.580
because you're basically taking Jose Canseco.

02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:39.780
I'm just giggling because some of our chatters are like, you know, AgDef's all sports lounge

02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:40.780
radio.

02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:42.060
I didn't mean to get this on this big tangent.

02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:46.600
My whole point with this before we just kind of went on and on and on with it.

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:53.460
My whole point was the whole female leads in video games and we don't have enough of

02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:55.340
them.

02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:57.480
It's not right that that's happening.

02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:01.840
But my point I'm making with it is that I think it's a reflection of a much larger problem

02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:02.840
with society.

02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:04.880
It's not specific to video games.

02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:06.480
I didn't mean to go off on the other.

02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:07.480
But no, no, no.

02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:08.560
I mean, I think we agree.

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.560
Yeah.

02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:15.760
The whole point is that, and this I think is going really towards anything, is that

02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:21.520
unless you have, even the really brilliant women out there, like just even in academia,

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:25.640
are not drawing the biggest attention, are not being taken seriously if they don't also

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:30.500
have a certain type of aesthetic, you know, appearance to them.

02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:36.900
And it's really a very sad thing because you can have, pardon me for saying this, the dumpiest

02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:37.900
looking guy ever.

02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:45.520
You can have neck bearded, you know, guy shorter than me waddling in and be taken completely

02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:48.520
seriously just because he's a guy.

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:53.720
But if you had a woman who maybe was, you know, maybe a little overweight, maybe, you

02:42:53.720 --> 02:43:00.600
know, a little gray, a few wrinkles here and there, even if she had three times the degree

02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.640
this guy did and had done all this fantastic biomedical research, on appearances alone

02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:08.280
she wouldn't be taken seriously by the majority of people.

02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:12.000
And that's where I think that we're getting into the really sad part.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.640
And it doesn't, and like I said, it's not just affecting our gaming world.

02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:18.500
It's affecting culture across the board.

02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:24.640
And I get absolutely so sick of living in this society sometimes just because of it.

02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:26.260
I did think of another positive though.

02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:30.020
I did think of another place where I think it's done well, where we get male and female

02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:34.700
sports heroes that we failed to mention because this is one of the few sporting events I really

02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:35.820
truly enjoy watching.

02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:36.820
The Olympics.

02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:37.820
Yeah.

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:43.500
I think the Olympics are great because you get a lot of, you get a lot of strong athletes

02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:47.120
no matter what, you know, from all these different types of sports and great stories and things.

02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:48.120
That's a great thing.

02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:49.120
So.

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.880
But, you know, even then I hear, um, what was it on NBC?

02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:57.720
Well, you know, the coverage of the Olympics this past one was dreadful to save the values.

02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:00.320
Yeah, but that's, that's, that's, that's another issue.

02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:04.320
But what I'm saying is that you, you get side commentary from people.

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.440
Like I would go and look at, you know, YouTube videos of some of the events because I wasn't

02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:10.040
keeping up with it all the time.

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.900
And I would see comments, oh, well, she looks like, you know, a dude or she looks this or

02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:15.900
she looks that.

02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:21.020
I would go into a Southern accent when I imitate a stupid person, but, but you still

02:44:21.020 --> 02:44:25.900
get that as trying to ascribe aesthetics to what should have nothing to do with it.

02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:26.900
Yeah.

02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:27.900
Yeah.

02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:29.900
Anyhow, tangent train, tangent lounge radio.

02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:31.500
That was a good discussion though.

02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:32.500
Sorry.

02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:33.500
Oh.

02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:34.500
And, uh, some of the chatters talking about tennis.

02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:35.500
That is a really good example too.

02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:36.500
Tennis.

02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:37.500
Tennis has a lot of good people.

02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:38.500
Mixed doubles is pretty fun actually.

02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:39.500
Yeah.

02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:40.500
Yeah.

02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:41.500
Yeah.

02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:42.500
So good, good job chatters.

02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:43.500
All right.

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.500
Anyhow.

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:45.500
Rob turned on my ranty switch.

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:47.100
We'll be back with more details next week.

02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:50.680
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com, but for now we have got to wrap up the show and say

02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:51.680
good night.

02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:54.060
Um, Oh, I didn't get, I may not have got all the Twitter topics.

02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:55.060
I'm sorry.

02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:56.940
Let me quickly try to grab some of these.

02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:00.980
Uh, as Joan Hunter, Matt tweeting, one of the most popular card games is being made

02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:05.980
into a game for three 60 Steve Jackson's munchkin.

02:45:05.980 --> 02:45:06.980
I don't know.

02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:11.580
Apparently a link on ain't it cool news of all places.

02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:14.120
That site's been going on forever too.

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:16.200
So huh.

02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:17.200
Very interesting.

02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:18.200
Yeah.

02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:21.300
Munchkin, the video game.

02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:22.300
That's cool.

02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:23.300
That'd be very cool.

02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:24.640
All right.

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.380
That is, I'm going to put the, I'm going to put the phone down and no more Twitter topics

02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:28.380
for tonight.

02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:29.380
Twitter.com slash OLR though.

02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:32.940
If you want to send us stuff for the future, uh, I'll get off my feminist pedestal for

02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:33.940
right now.

02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:34.940
There's nothing wrong with it.

02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:38.240
It was, it was a, it was a discussion that needed to be had.

02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:39.240
All right.

02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:40.660
Let's uh, let's wrap up though.

02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:41.660
We're about done.

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:43.160
We're closing up shop for the night.

02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:46.880
Loki, you've been quiet over there while dark soccer and I've been, yep, yep, yep, and uh,

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:48.800
did you have a good time tonight?

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:49.800
Yeah.

02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:50.800
All right.

02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:51.800
Good.

02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:52.800
All right.

02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:53.800
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight as we're on our way out?

02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.000
Uh, I'm probably not going to play Minecraft every single day this week.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.080
I get boring since there's no one else on there.

02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:00.080
Play two days this week.

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:01.080
Two or three.

02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:02.080
Yeah.

02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:03.080
That sounds good.

02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:05.600
Um, so I guess I'll play some defiance then.

02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:08.080
We should set up some time to live stream Minecraft.

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:09.080
That's that's where everything's going.

02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:11.400
Like all of a sudden all the VOD people just got really into light.

02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:12.400
Like Bobby's doing it.

02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:13.400
Jamie's doing it.

02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:14.400
I'm doing it.

02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:15.400
Yeah.

02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:16.400
See, that's the things I didn't know.

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.000
Like, I don't really know like when to be on when no one else is on.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.400
Well, I think it's inevitable that some of us are like, I think I was trying to broadcast

02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.400
when Jamie was on.

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:27.980
It's just, I didn't know she was, you know, like it's inevitable.

02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:30.420
Some of us are going to step on toes, but I think it's a general rule of thumb.

02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:35.120
We just try not to be live when a live, when, excuse me, a premier vlog show is on.

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.360
So like Monday nights are usually really bad, but you know, as long as we're not stepping

02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:41.400
on the toes of, of you do commentary, do you do not?

02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:42.400
Do you not do commentary?

02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:43.720
What do you, what are you guys doing?

02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:45.540
I mean, like I do commentary.

02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:46.760
She does commentary.

02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:50.720
Uh, when I was watching Bobby, he had very little commentary, but they, they have had

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:51.720
some commentary.

02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:55.760
But the problem is though, is once again, it's the whole talking in the same room with

02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:56.760
my wife.

02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:00.760
She gets annoyed even if I'm in like in the back bedroom or something like that, it would

02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:01.760
just, I could try it.

02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:02.760
I'm sure it'd be fine.

02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:08.160
Um, so yeah, I'll hopefully start doing some of that and maybe sell more games this week.

02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.440
One of those being injustice on three 60.

02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:11.440
Wow.

02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:12.440
I was, I want it.

02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:13.440
Oh wait.

02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:15.440
All my friends have it on PS three.

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.440
Son of a bitch.

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:17.440
Yeah.

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.440
Cause I got a copy for free and I don't want it.

02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:24.560
Um, so cause I don't, I don't mind the fighting games, so it'll start at, it'll start at one

02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:26.600
penny tomorrow.

02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:28.480
Act F says we were doing commentary yesterday.

02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:30.880
I missed your stream yesterday cause I was out drinking.

02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:34.840
Grandpa was in town from San Francisco buying me doubles.

02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.800
I got a little more drunk last night and I did on the 500th episode.

02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:41.240
Sorry it wasn't broadcast, but it's for the best.

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.040
Um, my final thought tonight is thank you all for continuing to listen to orange lounge

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:50.480
radio and showing up for an episode like five Oh one right after 500, uh, whether it be

02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:53.140
live, whether it be podcast, appreciate your support.

02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:57.240
And I think I forgot to say this last week, which was really stupid, but I want to say

02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:00.280
as always, thank you for checking out the show.

02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:03.580
And if you like what you hear, remember we don't ask for a lot.

02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:05.400
Just tell a friend or two about the show.

02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:07.380
Help spread the word about orange laundry.

02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:10.860
Tell a person who stopped listening five years ago, Hey, did you know those schmoes

02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:15.120
are still on broadcasting and help bring people's back into the fold.

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.660
Help grow our family a little bit.

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:18.980
And last but not least, dark soccer.

02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:24.460
Your final thought, um, down with the patriarchy.

02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:25.460
There we go.

02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:26.460
All right.

02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:30.060
That does it for a this week here on orange lunch radio next week on the show.

02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:32.540
I'm hoping we'll have some special guests here in studio.

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:33.820
Sounds like that's going to happen.

02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:34.820
Very exciting.

02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:41.180
Could be a long show next week and a pretty cool interview with, with two, two people.

02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:42.880
I really enjoy next week.

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.640
