13966	19215	Tonight, April 14, 2013, could Capcom be ending HD fighting game remakes?
19555	25425	Level 5 is said to work on a PlayStation 4 game, and could one government be investigating in-app sales?
34171	40480	Live and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
40961	47569	It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight, episode number 500 for this April the 14th of 2013.
51755	53916	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
79443	79703	Nice.
80163	81364	What is pre-made mimosa?
81384	84145	It means that you don't have to buy orange juice and champagne separately.
84425	85386	How lazy are you?
85426	86466	They did that shit for you.
87227	93110	I did something called saving time, space, and money by just bringing it already done.
94430	95571	Because, fuck it.
96151	96611	It's booze.
96872	97652	It drinks the same way.
98354	101377	Speaking of fuck it, I decided to mark the occasion tonight.
101457	102838	I'm going to wear my pajama pants.
102858	103699	I'm going to take a picture, Rob.
103719	106261	With all these little lips all over them that say, kiss me.
106822	109084	Because I'm wearing my pajamas to OLR tonight.
109204	110004	Rob wants his pants kissed.
110024	110985	Because I give no fucks.
112106	113247	Happy 500th episode.
114028	116050	I think you gave the last fuck last episode.
116690	118051	So we're fresh out of fucks.
118131	118412	Sorry.
119352	119673	All right.
119773	120453	Say hello.
121274	122796	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
123216	123476	Hello.
123716	124257	How are you, Loki?
125749	126630	I wish these fries were better.
127110	128552	I'd throw them all away because they're crap.
128612	129933	You went to McDonald's, duh.
129953	131594	Hey, it's a crap shoot, I know.
132035	134417	I wasn't that hungry, so I expected them to suck.
134857	138480	I just wanted to be pleasantly surprised that they were good, but they were not.
138781	142524	Isn't that the tragedy that has followed you for 11 years here on this program?
144904	148165	The problem is I was very indecisive on what I wanted to eat.
148585	156168	So it was kind of like, you know, first I started driving towards Jack in the Box and I'm like, eh, I'm not that hungry.
156188	156748	Don't judge me.
156928	158809	I'm not hungry enough for Jack in the Box.
160430	161590	So then I went to McDonald's.
161630	164171	I'm like, oh, but I really want Subway, but it's across the street.
164251	168353	So I'm like, eh, I'll just eat McDonald's because I need to get gas.
168533	169974	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
188829	191793	Brad from PodCulture said they were the worst absolute things in the world.
192013	192614	They're amazing.
192654	193094	I love them.
193214	196118	I don't think they're the best potato chips I've ever had, but they're not bad.
196158	198120	The cheesy garlic bread ones, though, are pretty epic.
198340	198581	Are they?
198801	199802	They are quite epic.
199822	202525	Whoever came up with that little contest at Lay's, genius.
203427	205629	Here we are talking about food yet again.
205929	207491	Why break tradition, folks?
207671	208812	Why break tradition, folks?
209032	210174	I'd rather just have a waffle.
210794	212936	Dude, waffles would be awesome right now.
213156	216099	We do have a special guest here joining us tonight.
216740	218241	Say hello to Becky!
219162	219702	Greetings.
219862	220503	How are you, Becky?
220803	221904	I'm doing pretty well, thanks.
222044	222944	Welcome back.
223104	225646	Now, Becky, for those that don't know, is Jamie's BFF.
225906	227867	And so Jamie sometimes talks about her on the show.
228587	230568	And she's also quite the chef.
231168	233410	And so Becky was kind enough to actually cook.
234030	235911	Here we go with food again on a video game show.
236311	237992	Was kind enough to cook for us tonight.
238032	239613	What did you make for us tonight, Becky?
239893	243736	I made red velvet brownies, and they look like murder.
246138	249480	They are beautiful, glorious, dripping red.
249741	252383	I hope y'all don't see the food boner in my jammies right now.
254584	255485	I'm gonna go take pictures.
255505	256606	That sounds pretty epic.
257266	258087	Of the food boner?
258788	260709	No comment.
262250	262771	No comment.
264628	266809	Murder is Pretty Fucking Tasty
292458	297523	It would be awesome if you drew like Super Meat Boy on those because that would be... That's perfect.
297843	298664	That's it, Becky.
298684	299945	We have to do this again next weekend.
301046	302667	So what's going on, live listeners?
302707	307351	Is the stream not... I guess a lot of people are bitching that the stream is like stopping going tonight or something.
307431	308392	So I don't know what's up with that.
308472	309333	We're not doing anything different.
309353	309733	I can do it.
310194	311535	There's too many of you listening.
312035	312896	This is what's happening.
313336	314037	Bite your tongue.
314558	314838	All right.
315058	319162	We do tape live every... Every Wednesday when I'm not here.
321868	324370	What fucking show is having a birthday today, Rob?
325831	335396	We do tape live every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
336357	341139	And thanks to all you guys who do turn out live or who do listen to us in the podcast.
341900	345222	Speaking of VOG Network, are the brownies really good?
346002	346843	I'm about to eat one.
367581	372182	So we could go and actually ask the listeners questions and actually pull them instantly.
372483	377824	Well, Bobby Blackwolf, in celebration of our 500th episode, has made that a reality.
378384	384246	So for all you guys that are right there on live.vognetwork.com, because it's the only place you're going to see it.
384546	389508	So if you're tuned into IRC via MIRC or something, make sure you bring up live.vognetwork.com.
389788	392208	You don't need to refresh the page or anything like that.
392248	393889	This is going to happen automatically.
395770	403212	But it is time for the very first time we are going to go to our live audience poll.
406194	406494	Dork.
406634	407234	All right.
407754	411656	Tonight in the very first VOG Network live poll.
412799	417682	We are going to settle the great debate once and for all because we have to start with an epic question.
417762	418422	So here it is.
418883	419623	Tonight's question.
420223	422705	Let us settle the great debate once and for all.
423325	425386	Cake or pie?
428368	430850	Let us settle the great debate once and for all.
430950	432771	Cake or pie?
435936	438458	There it is up there at live.vognetwork.com.
438938	441299	You can participate right now and vote in the poll.
441419	441960	And look at this.
442260	442920	How cool is this?
442980	445562	We see the results live as they come in.
445622	446783	It's all tied up right now.
446923	448464	Oh, cake just pulled ahead a little bit.
450285	451906	This is the most amazing thing ever.
452286	454027	Bobby is a genius.
454707	455208	He's great.
455928	456628	Alright, so there it is.
456668	458209	Let us settle the great debate once and for all.
458269	459190	Cake or pie?
459230	464032	We will read the results here momentarily, but it does look like cake is quite a bit ahead here in the live poll.
464572	464872	Alright.
467093	467634	Moving on.
467694	468774	What else do I want to talk about tonight?
468814	471376	We had the new feature that I want to talk about.
472676	476838	Anything you guys want to say in acknowledgement of our 500th episode?
477959	478939	What the fuck are we doing?
480740	481380	Look at your life.
481420	482221	Look at your choices.
484980	485580	Well said.
486581	487541	I'm going to go drink now.
488701	489482	I want to drink too.
489722	491202	That poll is going to be too distracting.
491402	494183	I have to keep watching it change.
494223	496844	I know, right?
497084	499445	It's hypnotic.
499705	500885	It's hypnotic to watch.
501726	503406	That's awesome.
503426	504787	Do brownies count as cake?
504827	508268	We are going to be required now to use that sound clip every time we do an Insta poll.
508528	509928	That was the plan.
510469	511629	Do brownies count as cake?
513322	514023	That's a good question.
514063	515744	Maybe I should have added brownies to the list.
516184	516465	Oh well.
516685	518386	But what does ice cream cake count as?
518506	519107	I guess cake.
519367	520348	It's not real cake.
520408	522109	But what about pudding-filled cake?
522970	524291	Like Boston cream pie.
524671	526273	It's called a pie, but it really has cake bits.
526293	528254	Okay, you're making it too fucking complicated, lady.
528795	528975	So?
530336	531036	And of course, how thoughtful.
531057	531437	Oh, hi, Alan.
531477	531717	Hi.
531737	534179	What did you just set down in front of me here in studio?
534199	535459	Take a whiff of it.
535480	535720	Smell it.
548525	550927	Oh my god, it's that stuff I can't have.
550947	552789	I'm getting drunk just smelling it.
552889	554070	I have to smell how awful it is.
554090	554611	You want to smell it?
555271	559015	This is a present from Brad from Pod Culture, our pals.
559035	561137	Thank god, it smells more like whiskey than it does like cinnamon.
561157	562898	Do you want to smell it at all?
562958	563158	All right.
564059	565340	Alan, do you want to introduce the drink?
566341	567702	Yes, it's Fireball Whiskey.
568683	569924	The bottle art is amazing.
570345	573147	And we don't have anything for a chaser, really, so I got you a glass of water.
574629	577071	Apple juice I think would have been really good, but we don't have any.
577611	578732	I forgot to make apple pie.
579092	579553	Weep hole.
580654	582215	Chase it with a brownie.
582315	584037	You have to chase it with a brownie.
584057	585678	I'll chase it with a brownie, but here's the thing.
585918	587700	When was the last time we did drinking on OLR?
587720	588720	It was a very long time ago.
588740	591443	I don't know, but I remember one time I ate half a box of waffles.
592244	599513	If I didn't have to take my son to school every morning I would have totally crashed.
599553	601736	I forgot to take tomorrow off work.
601796	605041	I remember when you had the tequila binge.
605261	606362	That was kind of hilarious.
606443	607584	I don't drink tequila.
607985	608525	You did once.
608946	609487	No, I didn't.
610368	611108	Or was it vodka?
611469	612389	It's always vodka.
612990	614271	I could swear it was tequila.
614711	616313	Remember, he married a Russian chick.
616353	617354	It's always vodka, right?
618455	619316	She doesn't drink anything.
619336	619616	She likes rum.
619636	623920	When will you be ready to launch into your gaming week if Rob ends up in a coughing fit after he does this shot?
624240	626102	Get the first news story ready.
627883	630185	Don't we have a disclaimer we usually give during drinking shows?
630806	631587	Don't drink and drive.
631767	632868	I live here, so I can drink.
634069	635130	Don't be irresponsible.
636727	637707	and keep it in your pants.
637987	638388	Yeah.
639388	640168	Drink moderately.
640848	647351	Don't come up with, you know, next-gen game console ideas after, you know, consuming vast quantities of alcohol.
647591	650512	Okay, so here's my cheers to all you non-drinkers.
650812	651652	Can you toast me with something?
651692	652752	I'm gonna go make me a coffee.
652832	653112	Alright.
653353	653753	Yay!
653833	654253	Cheers!
654273	654253	500!
654293	654373	Yay!
654433	654853	One, two, three.
654873	655293	Five.
662093	662473	Hi, Rob.
666255	667836	I wish you guys could see the look on his face.
667896	669937	He's, like, gone immediately for the water.
671797	672298	Wow!
674739	675859	This is fantastic radio.
677440	677900	Poor Rob.
678000	679381	Your face is red.
679401	680581	500 episodes, I do what I want.
682262	684403	I'm gonna go make my mimosa after I do my week.
685824	686404	Oh my god.
689512	694228	Brad, thank you for the bottle of Fireball because this is so worth it right now.
697614	698655	The webcam's at my house.
698695	700516	I've been using it to stream drawing.
700737	704780	Loki, is there anything you wanted to say in celebration of our 500th episode?
707482	708122	No, not really.
708623	712266	I don't have anything I want to say.
712286	714647	Technically, Ron just had a double.
714808	720112	Just that I wish that the wife was capable of taking the son to school so then I could partake.
720172	720932	But, yeah.
720972	721733	I said I...
723254	723654	I cannot.
725055	725495	All right.
726536	732079	I just really want to thank everybody for supporting our show and being here.
733120	739364	It would have been great to do a giant convention for our 500th episode and just have you all in one room, but money.
740104	741225	Our apartment ain't that big.
742166	743266	Exactly, exactly.
743786	745668	We're happy to just have you all here and chat with us.
745828	749130	I do want to acknowledge this as well because this is the most awesome thing that ever awesomed.
749930	752712	This is something that one of our listeners, Codeman,
752972	754552	I need to take a picture of that too.
755133	755393	Would you?
755753	761654	Who has a YouTube channel, and I'm a horrible person because I can't remember the name of it right now, but hopefully somebody will dig it up and post it in chat.
762094	770716	But Codeman is a graphic artist like DarkSakura, but he designed this really amazing poster to commemorate our 500th episode.
770796	773517	And Jamie's going to put a picture of it right now at originalsradio.com.
773797	773997	Yeah.
774457	777198	I might start reposting stuff just to Tumblr because it'll take less time.
777238	779859	I believe his channel was at Ratchet1785.
779939	780539	Thank you.
780659	782439	You're very Tigerclaw tonight.
782479	782820	I love it.
782880	783140	All right.
784400	787161	So it's a poster to commemorate our 500th episode.
787181	792722	What's awesome about this is that he's drawn us as these little chibi characters, and DarkSakura is like an N7 trooper.
792822	793883	She's basically FemShep.
794743	797364	Loki is Grand Theft Auto, and he's got a bloody baseball bat.
797664	798904	And I'm World of Warcraft.
798944	799944	And look, guys, look.
800585	801285	I'm flaming.
803085	823736	and we have a ferret with dynamite strapped to him but you know what I really love about this is that if you look at the background he layered a bunch of listener names in the background I don't know where he got this list of names because I recognize old and new names in there like I look at this list and I go okay Jim Sally of course I know who he is but then I'm like Robo Boy 430 I haven't seen that name in years
824196	841581	so I think he did like a combination of people from like the wiki as well as people he's seen in our chat room and so forth so you guys are all a part of this poster as well which I think is just amazing he should sell prints of it I really wouldn't care and I think he'd make some good money so I bet a lot of you guys would like that alright
842961	844543	So, oh, Tigerclaw found it.
845283	847085	It's C. Taylor 1785.
847465	848226	Thank you, Codeman.
848526	849567	He also does, oh, you know what?
849607	851468	He co-hosts a show called Down for Maintenance.
851548	852169	I should plug that.
852929	854471	And it has very good artwork.
854571	855031	Go figure.
855892	856732	So thank you, Codeman, for that.
858094	859815	Should we go to the results of our poll?
860175	860375	Sure.
860776	862397	By the way, some of the photos are already up.
862537	863278	They're just being slow.
863558	863778	Okay.
863998	865840	At the very top of OrangeLandsRadio.com.
866451	868091	Alright, here it is, the results of our poll.
868132	870912	We're going to go ahead and end it now, so if you didn't get in, too bad.
871613	880255	The results of the poll was Cake won, and Cake was 62.86% to Pie, 37.14%.
881795	882696	You all pissed me off.
883396	885156	Alright.
885176	885677	Just kidding.
886837	888577	Alright, I'm finally going to eat one of these brownies.
888617	891838	I think it's about time to get into our gaming week.
891858	893719	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
894420	896001	My gaming week was semi-productive.
898001	902163	I really didn't play a whole lot of stuff, but I did play some more Drunken Robot Pornography.
903083	904684	That game is so fun, I swear.
905944	908465	Everybody in the world by now should know how much I love Jumping Flash.
909426	911546	It's Jumping Flash with guns and giant robots.
912147	913807	And really, really good music.
913827	914648	The game is crack.
914708	917069	I cannot wait for more of it to come out.
917829	920110	I also played something that I'm not allowed to talk about.
921250	943133	so I'm not gonna except I will totally leave one game for this one that's all I can say um I um oh yeah I played Minecraft I actually streamed me playing Minecraft so I could show off my house or I should say my underground bunker so that I can hide from everybody else no one can find my house you've been getting really into this streaming thing lately
944719	949202	I've more or less just wanted to get it to work because Dan and I have a plan.
950042	952263	I'll go ahead and do like a semi-announcement.
952844	956926	Dan and I have a plan to start doing classic gaming stuff on Twitch TV.
957806	960248	And I'm trying to decide if Twitch or livestream works better.
961388	970614	But we want to eventually get it to where we can run our capture card into... Well, we get a capture card to run the video game systems through the PC system.
971394	977517	and then have everything run off of the main monitor while we... Sorry, the liquor is starting to hit me.
977577	979838	So if I start smiling for no reason, just ignore it.
979898	982779	I was like, Rob, I'm feeling good.
984660	986521	By the way, I like never drink anymore.
986601	993765	So the fact that I have that is... I have no... I have the alcohol tolerance of a... Oh, J-Links, you are hilarious.
993805	994305	Of a child.
995485	1019229	um but yeah uh so I've just been practicing like with different things and like lately I've just been um streaming um playing Mass Effect 2 because there's a couple people who watched it who just completely skipped it and are playing 3 so like no no no no no fixing this and then um I was playing Drunken Robot Pornography and I've been doing some drawing you know I tested out the webcam with it but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing webcam stuff
1019542	1023305	Now, I don't know if you heard Syl on Horde House this week, which we all love Syl.
1023325	1023925	I love Syl.
1023965	1024465	She's the best.
1024545	1035353	But she was talking about some of her experiences in live streaming and how – because she has the webcam on her, and she's very resilient and able to do that because she gets all these trolls coming in there going, take your top off.
1035773	1038855	Will you do – will you make out with a German chick?
1038915	1040396	Will you do mouth to ass?
1040736	1042537	Will you do – so –
1044038	1045660	Have you put your mug out there?
1045840	1046020	No.
1046200	1049483	Okay, you probably don't want to.
1049723	1051985	I had it pointing at a piece of paper.
1052185	1053406	Don't take that the wrong way.
1053446	1061093	You're a very pretty lady, and I don't think you give yourself enough credit, but there's just too many people on the internet that are crazy.
1061593	1061934	Horny.
1062594	1064216	Yeah, they're crazy horny.
1066698	1068639	Well, fortunately, none of them are my problem.
1069260	1069340	Okay.
1070988	1099993	but thank you Jason I will look into the Black Magic capture card but no I was just practicing you know doing stuff and trying out different things because I think that what we're going to do is we're also going to maybe try to start bringing up you know stuff that's actually in our collection like lovely pajamas Rob like we have a whole lot of deluxe editions of games like for example the Cyberbots limited edition and
1100493	1103634	That stupid Cardcaptor Sakura game that I had to have and played once.
1104074	1105274	It came with a damn pillowcase.
1106574	1114977	But, um... We're just really wanting to... And part of it is, too, we might actually be selling off part of the collection.
1116757	1117377	LeGasp.
1117657	1118197	LeGasp.
1118937	1124659	I'm talking about, like, the stuff that we actually don't play, which, you know, would probably be the Neo Geo CD and the Intellivision.
1125199	1126619	That's probably about it.
1127460	1129280	Um... But, uh...
1131368	1137752	I still haven't decided what I'm going to use the rest of it for right now until we get this officially started.
1138092	1146356	But Dan and I have been in the works talking about doing something like that for Twitch just because we're inspired by Classic Game Room and the Angry Video Game Nerd.
1147257	1149018	I just think that guy is absolutely hilarious.
1149471	1152514	It didn't make our show roll tonight, but I heard something about he's getting his own game or something.
1153134	1154656	Or was it a movie or a game or what?
1154996	1155577	He did a movie already.
1155597	1159040	He did a movie already because they had a Kickstarter for the movie and it was so dumb.
1159160	1160661	Yeah, the movie looked ridiculous.
1160681	1164205	The movie was absolutely ridiculous, but it was hilarious too.
1164225	1169009	I just want to point out when Becky just took that brownie, she left these in the shape of a dick.
1169309	1170090	Did you notice that?
1170410	1176632	You were so perverted because I was thinking they were in the shape of a T. No, those are balls and that's the shaft.
1176932	1179073	I have never seen a dick that red before.
1179113	1183995	That is a letter T. You would have to do this to make it a cross.
1184015	1185775	Now it's a ball.
1186275	1189056	That is a cross because this show needs Jesus right now.
1190517	1191057	You know what?
1192403	1193684	You know who needs Jesus, Rob?
1195905	1197306	Sorry, did I offend the Jew?
1197326	1197606	My bad.
1198427	1199547	You didn't offend the Jew.
1202309	1203210	No, no, try harder.
1203230	1205231	The atheist is pissed.
1205251	1206091	Oh, the atheist is pissed.
1207352	1211655	Well, then let me just call Justin Bieber, because then maybe Justin Bieber can really offend you.
1214617	1217178	You know, Rob, I'm so disappointed.
1218739	1219780	You're such a heathen.
1221765	1223707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1251991	1257172	God, she got me into Mass Effect and it has sucked away my whole damn life.
1258112	1258512	True.
1258852	1259552	One of us.
1260073	1260813	One of us.
1261373	1261913	You're welcome.
1262493	1262833	All right.
1263513	1264733	Fem Shep or Male Shep?
1264994	1265454	Fem Shep.
1265714	1266934	I have done a Bro Shep.
1267194	1269814	I call him Bro Shep because Male Shep sounds weird.
1270275	1273375	But I did a playthrough just because it was the only way I could romance Jack.
1276116	1276696	Fair enough.
1276736	1277236	Fair enough.
1278931	1282333	I don't get why Jack wasn't a crazy lesbian hookup.
1282513	1283234	I don't get it either.
1283454	1284554	It doesn't make any sense.
1284574	1285575	I would have gone for it.
1286195	1287276	Who is your romance of choice?
1287296	1289757	Because I know and I think it's a good one.
1289817	1290678	Who's your romance of choice?
1290798	1291058	Thane.
1291378	1291699	Thane.
1292239	1298142	Now, Thane kind of, they really screwed with him in Mass Effect 3 by, you know, spoilers, killing him off.
1298222	1299183	The game's a year old now, right?
1299703	1299883	Yeah.
1299903	1303185	But they tried to make things right with the Citadel DLC.
1303205	1304266	Were you happy with what they did?
1306187	1310189	I was very happy with it because it never actually bothered me that he died.
1310289	1311830	I mean, he had a terminal illness.
1311910	1314031	If he hadn't died, I would have found it stupid.
1314151	1318133	I like that they let him die in a heroic kind of way.
1318833	1324496	What pissed me off was that nobody said they were sorry for your loss if you romanced him.
1324956	1326837	I mean, Garrus is there at the...
1327657	1338011	memorial wall standing right in front of his name and doesn't say a word about it and that that was the part that pissed me off so actually getting to have a memorial service made me very happy
1339560	1345763	Yeah, and I have to admit, I did watch the whole thing on YouTube and watching the videos because there's an extra video.
1345843	1349525	Because you find out that... This really isn't that bad of a spoiler, you guys.
1350105	1352506	You find out that Thane made all these videos to Shepard.
1352526	1353066	Well, he said he did.
1353426	1358128	Yeah, and no matter if you romanced him or not, you get to see most of the videos.
1358188	1360630	But if you romanced him, there's an extra video you get to see.
1360670	1363351	And I have to admit, I got a little choked up.
1363431	1365332	And what especially got me was...
1366172	1369578	The goodbye scene at the very end when they're all getting back on the ship.
1369658	1370079	I was like...
1371909	1373090	The feels, the feels.
1373210	1374531	I am overcome by the feels.
1374591	1375672	I cried like a little girl.
1376272	1380015	I copied off Becky's save files from her Xbox so that I could mod her Shepard.
1381716	1391123	And so I played through all of the memorial and everything with her Shepard, which it's always very weird playing somebody else's Shepard.
1391223	1396327	But yeah, I actually had to go get tissues and cuddle the cat for a little while because...
1399116	1404399	Technus in our chatroom says, I think Jack being either bi or a lesbian would have been kind of cliche IMO.
1405219	1408361	But Breakman corrects and says, it is part of Jack's backstory.
1408701	1410742	She was in a relationship with a man and a woman.
1411223	1413744	And that's, again, live.vognetwork.com.
1414064	1417006	And Extover says, there goes any interest I had in playing the game too.
1417506	1418306	Oh, shush.
1419807	1420908	Shush, you haters.
1422969	1423329	All right.
1424109	1427391	Any other games that you've been into besides, you know, space operas?
1429676	1431337	I've been... Adventure Time?
1433077	1434558	They do have Adventure Time DS games.
1435018	1444481	Watching my son play a lot of Adventure Time and scream at the computer was kind of adorable to watch an almost six-year-old going, Stupid computer!
1444781	1445301	Stop that!
1445361	1447261	You're not supposed to do that!
1447441	1449082	Like, so cute.
1449222	1457485	It's so interesting watching kids now when, like, you know, back in my day when I was six, we had Commodore 64 and that was cutting edge.
1457765	1458505	But now, you know...
1459133	1460755	Oh, you had Commodore 64 when you were six?
1460775	1461355	You're such a baby!
1461456	1461896	Oh, whatever.
1461936	1463097	Becky had to play with sticks.
1475106	1475887	Heart, love.
1476407	1476808	All right.
1477448	1480691	Assuming there's nothing else for Becky's gaming week, let me go over to Loki.
1480751	1481852	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1482612	1485895	I played, let's see, lots of Saints Row III, actually.
1485935	1488597	We've been trying to go through 100% everything.
1488617	1490079	Well, 100% almost everything.
1490119	1492961	I guess it would be 98% because I don't want to play all the co-op stuff.
1493962	1496384	I don't really want to play through the game for like a fourth time.
1496464	1497525	It would just be so annoying.
1497545	1498246	You're so annoying.
1499206	1501608	I finished up the DLC stuff.
1501828	1509392	I'm actually finishing up right now the Gangsters in Space DLC, which is alright.
1509592	1514154	It's like the first DLC really sucked, and the other two were okay.
1514174	1520277	They weren't necessarily like... I mean, they were still kind of side missions, but they at least dressed them up a little bit more.
1521218	1521318	Um...
1522927	1523969	And they're just so short.
1523989	1526051	They're like three missions long, and that's it.
1526152	1530197	It's like 10-minute missions and 30 minutes for like seven bucks initially.
1531118	1532060	Kind of a ripoff.
1532621	1535144	So whatever, you know.
1536706	1538008	So I'm playing the room, and...
1540683	1541203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1565280	1570463	A franchise you love and then you think, oh hey look, there's a sci-fi rip-off of that franchise.
1571043	1572784	That's what Defiance is for Borderlands.
1572964	1575645	It's basically a sci-fi rip-off of Borderlands.
1576486	1579727	And they've got all these different weapons that you can use and stuff.
1580087	1587351	And it's not necessarily that you specialize in anything, but the more you use a weapon, the better... Well, eventually it gets better.
1587531	1587931	And then...
1590113	1596501	They have the different elemental stuff and it's kind of hard to get good weapons in the game I've found so far unless I'm not doing something right.
1597042	1608096	But they have these lock boxes that you basically scavenge parts from killing people or taking weapons that you find and loot and breaking them down into parts.
1608576	1622747	and then you use those parts to buy keys and then using those keys you buy these random loot chests I guess that have two random weapons which for my, you know, so far doing tier 2 and tier 3 chests, they've all sucked.
1623408	1623668	So...
1625429	1626550	That's kind of lame.
1627311	1631495	You were telling me about the TV show beforehand, and Tiger Claw is saying some stuff in our chatroom about that.
1632436	1633397	Did you watch the TV show?
1633417	1634278	I haven't watched the TV show.
1634298	1635599	I don't even know if it's on yet.
1636480	1641704	But one thing I did know, or it just seemed like... Strudels89 in our chatroom says, I think it airs in a week or so.
1641965	1643126	I think it's Monday.
1643226	1647350	I think it's this week, either Monday or Tuesday, I think it's airing.
1647870	1653554	But here's the thing, they are trying so hard to almost be like a Battlestar Galactica or something like that.
1653634	1657816	Like I was mentioning, they have their own lingo, or their own slang, I guess.
1657956	1660418	To be fair, it's by the creators of Battlestar Galactica.
1660498	1662719	Okay, so that is quite fair.
1662739	1664020	So at least they're ripping themselves off.
1664060	1666942	Yes, they're ripping themselves off, but they're kind of forcing it a little bit.
1667062	1673126	Because you know, Battlestar Galactica, one of the most recognizable things is the use of the word frack instead of fuck.
1673866	1675047	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1693228	1696449	But anyways, the game itself, it's kind of fun.
1696969	1700429	I like the fact that you can kind of just run around and do whatever.
1700589	1715572	I've been playing solo through the whole thing, but the way it kind of works is if you happen to go into an area, say you're doing a mission or something like that, and you're going into an area and someone else is also there doing a mission as well, you kind of get credit for it if you go and help them and stuff.
1715772	1717813	So it's almost like partying, but not.
1718073	1719893	But you can actually party in the game, I just don't.
1720773	1726777	Um, and then these Arkfall things that happen, which are a little repetitive, but they're pretty hard.
1727537	1734101	And you have, like, you know, 30 or 40 people just trying to take down, like, a massive alien or something.
1734641	1735982	And, um, that's kind of fun.
1736002	1737583	You get a lot of experience doing that.
1738063	1742806	But, basically, I mean, the whole, like, look of the game is very bland, I guess.
1743046	1748309	Like, I don't recognize... It's not like... This is supposed to be San Francisco, and driving around, I couldn't tell you, like...
1750090	1750771	Thanks for watching!
1766400	1773849	Yeah, and I have not paid any money for, because you can pay money to get a lot of things in the game, not necessarily anything that's going to help.
1773869	1784141	I mean, you could buy, I guess, tokens that give you more experience, like up your experience by 10% or something like that, or money drops or weapon drops and that kind of thing.
1785062	1810202	or they will have like you know customizable things to make your character look because right now my character looks like a 50 year old trying to look like a like teenager and it looks stupid but I don't care because I don't really look at my avatar that much he's facing the other way but I swear to god there's like no customization as far as how they look they all look like some weird fucked up person but that's fine because you can get a suit that covers their face up and you'll never see them again
1810842	1811343	I guess I'm just crazy.
1830624	1832846	Um, but yeah, it's fun, I just wish more people played.
1832866	1843393	The only person I know that plays the game other than me on 360 is, I have a friend I met a long time ago, Matt, who works at, um, Zappos, actually, so... Oh, Rad, the shoe place?
1843574	1847476	Yeah, he was one of the line directors there, so, um...
1848337	1848677	and many more.
1872427	1872947	Thanks for watching!
1894992	1914896	and I think the whole game is going to change for season 2 so whatever happens on the show is going to reflect in the game and vice versa I don't really know if there's any competing factions or anything right now but if they have something like that it may reflect in the show so it's interesting so far I think so I've been playing a little bit more of that
1915376	1936006	and then the other thing I played that I really probably shouldn't be playing because it's technically piracy I mean we shouldn't really talk about it but it shame on you whatever I'm buying the game when it comes out anyways but I want to play it early so that's as long as you're gonna buy it I'm gonna buy it so the gameplay was Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon it's fucking awesome it's just
1937146	1940728	XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam
1957633	1985588	and it's just it's so awesome it's just like this is basically a developer making a game they're like okay you guys make a game that's fun that you guys want to play and it's just so fucking why aren't all video games it's just so cheesy though shouldn't that be the mindset that goes into any game yeah I agree make it fun but it's just so cheesy it's basically this cliche you know B science fiction type plot that takes place in you know
1985968	1988972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2002069	2010195	You know, partner, he, you know, kind of trolls you by enabling this tutorial mode in your, your suit.
2010535	2022624	And so through the entire tutorial, which is giving you stupid commands, it's just like breaking it down, like, you know, jumping allows you to, you know, change your orientation along the Z axis, weird stuff like that.
2024065	2026247	So he's just like, I hate these tutorials.
2026267	2026947	This is stupid.
2026987	2028368	I just want to kill somebody.
2028688	2029329	It's kind of funny.
2030029	2036554	And then there was also a part where that guy is hacking this missile guidance system thing.
2036955	2038796	All the jargon that he's throwing out.
2038916	2040638	I'm hacking the motherboard.
2042059	2043600	I'm doing this to this.
2044440	2047903	It's just all completely obviously made up jargon.
2047923	2049384	It's just hilarious though.
2049424	2052727	And then they reference stuff that no one has any idea what they're talking about.
2053487	2056408	It's just like that time in South America, yeah!
2056588	2057588	And then they go in there.
2059289	2065310	And then also I like how his partner uses the phrase motherfucker a lot.
2066651	2070412	He's the cliche black action hero guy.
2070892	2072512	We're gonna get those motherfuckers!
2074493	2075093	It's just awesome.
2075113	2077093	Did Samuel L. Jackson voice him?
2077133	2077534	No, he didn't.
2077554	2082555	I'm imagining those words coming out like if it was a comic panel in the same font as I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka.
2083581	2084021	Thanks for watching!
2104355	2109879	They have Blood Dragons, which are cybernetic dinosaur things that shoot lasers out of their eyes.
2110019	2111400	And there's Cyber Panthers.
2111861	2112661	Cyber Panthers.
2112781	2114383	I love a Cyber Panther.
2114823	2116845	It's awesome, but yes.
2117005	2121928	I don't normally condone piracy, but this is a game that I was going to pick up anyway.
2122028	2123489	You just couldn't wait.
2125151	2126832	I couldn't wait.
2126912	2132076	I was already planning on picking it up on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam because I'm multi-platform for some reason.
2132276	2133277	You just gotta have achievements.
2133757	2133957	I do.
2134697	2135678	Anything else for your gaming week?
2137799	2138079	That's it.
2138359	2138620	Alright.
2139580	2140781	My gaming week, pretty quick.
2140901	2142081	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
2142121	2143062	Most of the same stuff.
2143322	2146964	I've still been playing that freaking addicting Jetpack Joyride.
2147464	2149946	Extifer, if you're still listening, you suck for getting me addicted to that.
2150806	2153808	Also, World of Warcraft, been working on PvP.
2153928	2156009	My character's level 65 now.
2156870	2159771	I did try some new iOS games this week I wanted to plug real quick.
2160091	2160872	Talk about a couple of them.
2161432	2162472	Puzzle & Dragons Puzzle & Dragons
2187884	2195466	Yeah, I was about to say, isn't that like a rehash of the old... Yeah, it's partially a puzzle game mixed with Pokemon.
2196666	2200947	It's an interesting little puzzler and it has like Pokemon elements in it where you can kind of combine.
2201247	2210809	Which is funny because the combining elements was very similar to what I saw in that card game Guardian Cross from Square Enix that I got into a couple weeks ago.
2211532	2214073	Overall, Puzzle & Dragons, I didn't really care for it.
2214593	2218574	I gotta say, the puzzle mechanic part of it, I didn't think was very good.
2219234	2226475	Because it's, you know, you touch to move things and line them up in threes, and that doesn't attack, but you can literally move them anywhere.
2226875	2234677	So I think it's about setting up combos and things like that to ultimately be able to take out enemies, but the challenge really wasn't there, and it felt like a bit of a grind.
2236678	2241743	I would have to see it because I remember something about it being related to the puzzle industry.
2242123	2244325	That's where I heard about it because somebody was comparing the two.
2253482	2256685	It could be, but I didn't play the other one, so I couldn't tell you.
2256705	2257545	Puzzle and Destiny was hard.
2258586	2262590	Overall, Puzzle and Dragons entertained me for a couple evenings, but I'm kind of already over it.
2264132	2268016	The puzzle mechanic isn't enough to keep me interested in it, and I am sorry to say.
2269297	2276220	I also checked out Nimble Quest, which if you guys know Nimble Bit, they made Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes, which, you know, hello, crack.
2276760	2279662	But this new game is actually nothing like those games.
2280142	2287186	It still has the whole 8-bit feel, but they basically created a new version of Snake, and they even say in the tutorial...
2287466	2288526	Remember this game?
2288566	2290707	And they showed the little cell phone picture of Snake.
2291247	2293147	And that's basically what they've created.
2293227	2299369	But what you do is that instead of picking up squares that make your Snake longer, you pick up more heroes.
2299989	2305490	And some will throw fireballs, some use swords, some have bombs, you know, and that's kind of the gist to it.
2305730	2309531	And the other guys running around might try to attack you.
2309651	2312052	So it's all about maneuvering and not
2312592	2313013	and DarkSakura.com.
2337655	2339597	But overall, I liked Nimble Quest quite a bit.
2340897	2346201	The only thing I didn't like about it is that you go through the same levels over and over again.
2346681	2348002	You start at level one.
2348482	2351124	It's like you're going through the same levels over and over again, which is fine.
2351164	2352405	That's how a video game works.
2352525	2362632	But in a game like this, you would sort of think at some point I can either branch and go to different stages or I can resume where I died or something a little different.
2363072	2366815	I was a little disappointed that that basic mechanic wasn't somehow improved on.
2367835	2392869	um the last game that i checked out this week which actually is probably my favorite of the three is not free to play it's a 99 cent game it's called slaying and this game's really cute it's very 8-bit style and it's retrotasticness but um basically it's just got left arrow right arrow and button and you move left move right and jump and your character's a little 8-bit knight that constantly has a sword out in front of it and you can either move left or right and you're
2393049	2393489	and DarkSakura.com
2417108	2417749	16-bit retro To the moon
2439225	2444566	I would say maybe even Slayer looks a little more 16-bit than 8-bit.
2445146	2446026	It's somewhere in between.
2446286	2447287	It's like a 12-bit.
2448887	2450647	Like a TurboGrafx game or something.
2450727	2451927	It's kind of a little bit in between.
2452547	2454148	It's two 8-bit processors together.
2455528	2455968	There you go.
2456008	2456968	That was really my gaming week.
2456988	2460769	Just a bunch of iOS games, but that's one of the places people play games on now.
2462209	2465550	To be honest, that's where I'm doing a lot of my handheld gaming.
2465610	2466790	I haven't touched my DS in
2468010	2468971	Except when I cleaned it.
2469811	2471852	Actually, the last handheld system I played was a Windows 1.
2472353	2475474	Well, I still have been playing Harmonite, but I talked about that last week already.
2475714	2478396	And, of course, Swapnote, but I'll talk about that later in the show.
2478916	2480037	And, you know, there's still other three.
2480137	2484899	I even booted up Kid Icarus 3D Classics the other day just because I love Kid Icarus.
2485019	2493263	And the 3D remakes, surprisingly good because they didn't change much besides the backgrounds and giving it some 3D effects.
2493604	2494364	So it's really good.
2495985	2496205	Anyhow.
2497153	2498695	Let's get into tonight's news.
2499595	2501837	Yes, we're going to do news tonight just like we always do.
2502598	2504259	So let's have Loki start us off.
2505019	2509203	Alright, so EA has let some people go.
2509503	2519270	And of course they're not going to say who or why or where, but they basically have layoffs and they're not saying which teams are coming from.
2519430	2520111	And that kind of sucks.
2520151	2521992	But isn't some of that leaking out to the internet anyway?
2522273	2522613	Who it is?
2523633	2526034	Yeah, I believe it was EA Montreal, if I remember correctly.
2526054	2531097	It was supposed to be, I think, some of the people that are affected by it.
2531937	2536119	Yeah, EA Mobile Montreal.
2536899	2539300	So, I don't know.
2540001	2544483	And they were saying that, I guess, 60 to 70 permanent employees were let go.
2544923	2549345	And I guess another 100 people working under contract were let go as well.
2549765	2551586	And mostly QA testers.
2553171	2555452	So, I don't know.
2555612	2557252	It's just kind of the normal cycle.
2557272	2561053	Because, after all, EA did have a bunch of games just come out recently.
2561173	2566454	Like, you know, three or four games.
2566654	2567334	Yeah, four games.
2567734	2575216	I want to say that they just had Tiger Woods, Armia 2, Dead Space 3, and Crysis 3.
2575616	2578357	So, it might just be that they're...
2580202	2581103	Fuse, and then NCAA.
2599200	2600320	Is another game coming out?
2600540	2601000	Yeah, no.
2601080	2604821	And it's mobile Montreal.
2604901	2608982	I mean, I don't know what exactly EA Mobile Montreal was doing.
2609202	2611203	Facebook games?
2611663	2623045	BioWare is working on at least the Don't Call It Mass Effect 4 game, the Dragon Age 3, and the unknown game that the old Mass Effect team is doing.
2623065	2624485	Because they are not doing Mass Effect 4.
2624545	2625786	The multiplayer team is doing it.
2626286	2626506	So...
2627921	2628462	We'll see.
2628662	2630704	Probably at E3, get some more information about that.
2630885	2641917	Yeah, because EA Montreal, well, Montreal is Army of Two, but that would be just EA Montreal and not necessarily Mobile Montreal.
2644100	2645221	What else have they worked on?
2646323	2651068	As long as our friends here locally at Bioware Sacramento are okay, but I think they're doing a lot of the... What were they before?
2651088	2652389	They were... ClickNation.
2652529	2653130	Yeah, ClickNation.
2653410	2654532	They do a lot of Facebook.
2655232	2656694	They had a really popular Facebook game.
2656714	2658957	That's why they got grabbed up.
2658997	2663381	So I'm sure any Dragon Age, Mass Effect, kind of like Facebook tie-ins or something they were probably working on.
2663401	2663722	I don't know.
2663762	2664843	I've applied for them three times.
2664883	2665504	They haven't hired me.
2665764	2666645	Aw, poor thing.
2667726	2668006	All right.
2668166	2668447	Sorry.
2668887	2669307	Sorry, Loki.
2669327	2670428	Anything else?
2670488	2670688	Yes.
2670808	2684317	And unsurprisingly, the second year in a row, they have been voted the worst company in America by consumerists, which is a poll that they have on a website that people vote that are consumers that visit the website.
2684938	2693023	It is completely... Well, all the nominations are done by people that read the website, and then they take the top 16 or so nominations.
2693103	2694384	I think it's more than 16.
2694664	2694384	32.
2695064	2697386	And then they narrow it down from there.
2698046	2724265	and this really seems to carry a lot more weight than it ought to like a lot of people are I see a lot of people that are pissed like why did EA win this when Bank of America is a far more evil company when Comcast is more evil it's an anti-popularity contest Bank of America was one of the I think even they went up against Bank of America and it's just people voted maybe Bank of America is just not that much in the forefront for some of these people
2725046	2726628	It's a fucking internet poll.
2726708	2730213	Do we give this much weight to something that's on Yahoo.com?
2730413	2732295	I sure hope not.
2733257	2734018	That's my thing.
2734158	2736901	It's like, whose line is it anyway?
2736941	2737823	The score doesn't matter.
2740618	2745461	My vote for internet's worst poll goes to Consumerist, Worst Company in America.
2746122	2746782	Oh, you should be.
2746802	2747863	Remember, we're analysts.
2747943	2748603	We can say this.
2748904	2749904	You should be, too.
2750725	2752386	I could run a poll right now on the site.
2752426	2756349	Who runs the worst poll about the worst poll in America, Consumerist or somebody else?
2757990	2761072	I have to save that for special.
2761692	2764154	SSJ100 calls it an ass-hattery contest.
2764494	2766216	Whatever, it's just a contest.
2766636	2780265	It's just ha-ha lulz that they won again because ha-ha, you screwed up all the SimCity stuff and we hate you because of your DRM and your policies regarding cashing in and microtransactions and all that stuff.
2780305	2783688	Ha-ha, see, we showed you.
2784348	2785249	That's kind of what it is.
2785629	2790212	I couldn't log on to Mass Effect for a month, so I voted them the worst.
2791373	2799279	Shadow NextGen says in our chatroom, Anyone who voted EA as the worst company should have their gaming rights rescinded and be banned from the industry.
2799799	2804883	Look, people are welcome to their opinion as far as I'm concerned, but I'm just kind of like, you know...
2807253	2808054	Managements
2836536	2838617	So what management got laid off as a part of this?
2838817	2840778	That's what we really should be.
2840878	2842399	Well, they did lose the CEO.
2842419	2842779	That's true.
2842799	2843199	That's true.
2843859	2844320	You got me.
2844380	2850622	They did lose the CEO, and that, sadly, or fortunately, depending on which side you're on, is the person that needed to take the fall.
2851963	2855104	So we'll see if things get better, but if, you know.
2855364	2860627	If last year was any sort of, you know, barometer of whether things are getting better.
2860867	2861007	Nope.
2863683	2868128	Besides, how many years is it going to take before SimCity stops working when they shut up those servers?
2870188	2877010	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, I do give EA credit for their pro-LGBT stance and I do love Need for Speed.
2877070	2879270	They blame that as one of the reasons they got voted.
2879451	2880971	You know... What?
2881271	2892174	It's a tricky... I appreciate the fact that Peter Moore did come out and say, if that's the reason you're going to name us the worst company in America, then by golly, we're the worst company in America.
2892654	2894014	I appreciate that he said that.
2894034	2895735	But at the same time, I'm kind of like...
2896615	2923353	but like why can't you focus on the real reasons you're getting voted for this like a lot of that is feeling like smoke and mirrors and whether you deserve it or not it's falling on deaf ears it seems to me and that doesn't make it very promising that you're gonna change anything I honestly would have put more of the crappy video if I was going just on video game companies I would have put more crap on Activision I think or maybe Capcom
2924453	2926014	I don't know.
2926234	2932197	EA is the company that designed the whole online pass phenomenon that we see nowadays.
2932537	2934238	EA was also one of the first companies to...
2935014	2940257	You know those games that you had cheats in before in, you know, PlayStation 2 where you just enter a little button press and you get those cheats?
2940558	2941398	Ah, you can buy those now.
2942699	2952305	And even, in fact, I remember it was the first Godfather game they had on PlayStation 2 and Xbox where they didn't have such a way to purchase those bits of DLC.
2952645	2954286	They actually had button presses to do those cheats.
2954446	2957708	Oh, but on the 360, that's going to cost some money.
2958809	2960190	So, yes, they can go fuck themselves.
2961650	2963414	Origin's just the thing that pisses me off.
2963494	2964837	Yeah, Origin's the worst part of it.
2965058	2968906	Hey, but Rob, there's 45 million people on Origin.
2968966	2970649	How many satisfied customers?
2971977	2975759	And how many people are on Origin because the game they wanted to play was only through Origin?
2977039	2978340	If I could disable that shit, I would.
2978840	2988825	To be fair, and I have to say this, I have to acknowledge it, nobody liked Steam when it first came out, and it's great now, but to me there's a difference.
2988925	2995247	I'm kind of like Valve fixing it, yeah, I kind of see that out of them, but EA fixing it, I'm like, I don't know if they're ever going to.
2997037	3005090	I think that Steam, though, had it right from the get-go that, you know, let's put out games and put them out at affordable prices, get people interested in franchises, do big sales.
3005571	3007394	And EA's like, oh, that's not any way to make money.
3007635	3009077	And look where they are.
3009097	3009137	Hi.
3010908	3016352	All right, well, let's move on to one of those companies that DarkSakura said, you know, they're not doing much better, and that's Capcom.
3016972	3034124	And Capcom had something interesting to say this week, where Capcom Senior Vice President Christian Svensson said on the AskCapcom forums, quote, Sadly, I think we've probably run the course of feasible titles here, given the drop-off we've seen in sales with each new introduction.
3034664	3038266	That's in regards to HD ports and remakes of fighting games.
3038286	3040328	I think they've run out of games, to be honest.
3041749	3043169	Well, no.
3043630	3045551	They could really dig back in the archive.
3045571	3047432	Do you like the Mega Man fighting games?
3049293	3055157	Capcom vs. SNK, although I guess that's coming out on the PlayStation 2 or whatever.
3055217	3057258	It's going to be an old hit or whatever.
3058039	3058980	Just how bad is it?
3060180	3064983	They've come out and said that the Darkstalkers Resurrection sales are not good.
3066604	3071207	Darkstalkers Resurrection didn't even place on the list of best-selling PlayStation Network games.
3072308	3077372	In further comments, Christian Svensson saying it's partially due to lack of a promotion.
3077932	3084957	Quote, we've not given up, but I'm disappointed in the opening sales response relative to any other fighting title we've put out on the same platforms.
3085417	3095444	Given the frequency and urgency of requests we've had here over the last several years and the quality of the execution, it's the most fully featured and probably best project of this type we've done.
3096284	3100107	Here's a question that comes to my mind when I'm reading about these stories.
3100147	3105992	And that is, is possibly Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network just too oversaturated?
3106392	3107953	And that's what's causing the drop-off.
3108274	3111236	Is that there's just too much stuff on there now and it's hard to stand out?
3111256	3112097	Because I'll tell you what.
3112737	3116438	When Xbox Live Arcade first came out, shit, I was buying everything.
3116898	3119659	I bought almost, like every other week there was a new release, I would buy it.
3119719	3122220	Like just because like, hey, new game for five bucks, right?
3122980	3124341	I bought like everything.
3124961	3128642	Now, I honestly couldn't tell you the last game I bought on Xbox Live Arcade.
3128782	3129482	I don't remember.
3129823	3130583	It was a while ago.
3131923	3133064	Or even PlayStation Network.
3133264	3135264	I don't remember the last game I got.
3137585	3139746	Last game I got was Retro City Rampage.
3140166	3140346	Mm-hmm.
3141542	3159163	so is it possible that maybe part of the sales drop off is it's hard for this game to stick out because maybe you know it's not there's too much to pick from now maybe just DarkSakura is just not as popular as Street Fighter but isn't that the game that everybody was asking for
3159722	3160583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3179860	3204646	Actdeft in chat says the last Xbox Live Arcade game I bought was Darkstalkers Resurrection YYR in chat says I'll say this much the moment Sony announced that Playstation 4 would not be backwards compatible I lost almost all desire to buy anything for Playstation 3 on the Playstation store that's a really good point that's a very good point I have to admit that crosses my mind too
3206024	3207766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3226044	3227324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3245609	3247090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3264289	3266530	Interesting.
3266871	3269092	But there's other HD remakes on the horizon.
3269112	3274435	They might not be fighting games, but we do have the Dungeons & Dragons arcade game and DuckTales Remastered coming out.
3275396	3282740	Judging on the reaction that everybody gave, at least the DuckTales game at Penny Arcade Expo, I'm thinking they don't have anything to worry about there.
3283260	3285402	That's an HD reboot that's not in trouble.
3285442	3286783	But the Dungeons & Dragons games...
3287623	3288964	Now look, I'm a fan.
3289265	3290045	I'll be getting them.
3290506	3292628	But I worry they're a little niche.
3293048	3293488	I don't know.
3293548	3294209	I'm hoping I'm wrong.
3294509	3295410	I hope I am wrong.
3295590	3300234	I will be more than happy to say I was so wrong on that and that game sold shit tons.
3300695	3303637	But I have a feeling it's very niche and it might not sell well.
3304178	3305299	I keep my fingers crossed on it.
3305319	3308121	But I mean, they're not really giving it the best promotion either.
3308662	3308902	Are they?
3309460	3313383	Well, they unveiled it at the same expo they unveiled the DuckTales thing.
3313403	3321409	Well, yeah, DuckTales, but I mean, since then, I think they'd have to promote the hell out of it for them to really get the type of sales they're looking for out of it.
3323051	3325733	Again, I probably won't buy it because I've already got it.
3326118	3328559	Lots of people in our chat room saying some positive things about it.
3328599	3331200	Dungeon Buster says, yay, the D&D beat-em-ups.
3332300	3336022	Marinko, I hope I said that right, said, I would love to see more Dungeons & Dragons.
3336322	3337342	Well, y'all better go buy it.
3338943	3342024	Shiggers wants Mr. Do.
3342044	3344445	I thought they did a new Mr. Do not that long ago.
3345405	3346146	I thought they did.
3346166	3346766	I could be wrong.
3346966	3348366	I think it was out on a compilation.
3349107	3352408	Or some type of new Mr. Do, but it was really nothing like the old ones.
3353154	3354316	The sequel, Mr. Pooh.
3355517	3356558	Mr. Does.
3357219	3357820	Mr. Did.
3357860	3359742	No, they had a Mr. Do game.
3359822	3363868	I don't remember what it was called, but yeah, they actually had an arcade game where it was really weird.
3364228	3365430	Like, I don't remember where.
3365450	3366591	Yeah, it was just different.
3366611	3367833	It was like a platformer or something.
3367853	3369535	I remember thinking bubble, I don't know.
3369875	3376919	And honestly though, back to comparing the D&D to DuckTales, people underestimate the love for the old DuckTales game.
3376939	3379440	The DuckTales game was freaking sweet.
3380321	3386904	I mean, that was one of the first things that Dan and I ever talked about when we first met online ages and ages and ages ago.
3387304	3392267	He's like, we were talking about video game music and he says, oh yeah, my favorite is that DuckTales moon level.
3392867	3394949	And I'm like, oh yeah, me too!
3395009	3397292	And then we started reading, sharing bad fanfictions.
3397352	3398533	And it was love.
3398553	3400034	It was love.
3402337	3404159	Actually, you know what we met over, right?
3407001	3407462	Ranma 1.5.
3408143	3410245	Oh, I thought it was your sound rips you did.
3410925	3414549	No, I started doing the sound rips after I moved out here.
3415010	3415230	Ah, fuck.
3416775	3417035	All right.
3417276	3419238	Well, let's move on, DarkSakura, if you have some news for us.
3419379	3420380	Hey, Code Man's in chat.
3420440	3421642	Hi, thank you for our poster.
3421682	3422943	It's awesome, and I need to talk to you later.
3422963	3426308	It has to do with album art.
3426448	3429212	Secret messages to listeners.
3430474	3431655	Yeah, not so secret message.
3431695	3431976	How's that?
3432276	3440863	Well there was a survey that went out that showed the income disparity between game developers based on gender.
3441663	3455334	And it was actually a 2012 salary survey that was put out in the March issue of Game Developer Magazine where they were saying that even though the number of women in the industry is growing, there is still a huge salary gap.
3456074	3465697	is something like the average female game producer makes about maybe 79,000 and the average male makes about 86,000.
3467017	3477260	So we're talking about a huge disparity for the same work for people who are just as capable, if not overlooking people who are more capable simply because of gender.
3477880	3479521	Well, does the story get into why?
3481126	3489490	There's a big... Is that just because unfortunately... I can't get into the area that has the full thing on it because I don't want to pay for a subscription for it.
3490091	3497035	I was going to say, is that just an unfortunate echo of what can happen in the greater world, unfortunately?
3498163	3505188	Well, they're also talking a little bit more about where the bulk of women are working within the industry.
3506128	3510511	And it says that that's in art and animation at about 16% and game designers around 11%.
3515454	3516635	I wish I had more information.
3516655	3519557	I tried to get into the thing, but I don't have a subscription, so sorry.
3519577	3519657	Okay.
3522315	3528459	Marinko in our chatroom says, you would think we would be past all this gender inequality at this point in human society.
3528620	3529540	You would, wouldn't you?
3530961	3537026	And it's unfortunately that this industry has to really exacerbate that issue, it sounds like, from these statistics.
3540068	3543991	It's just a really... It's just pretty sad, I think.
3544692	3546213	Sort of sad commentary that...
3546633	3551336	I am glad to see more women getting into the industry because we definitely need it.
3551676	3560101	Especially after what we talked last week about the preference towards male leads in video games versus female leads.
3560141	3566025	When we've had awesome games with female leads like Mirror's Edge and the new Tomb Raider.
3567766	3571649	I really think that it's just something in the public perception that's going to have to change.
3571669	3572369	Yeah.
3573502	3575584	Well, we have the power to change it.
3576865	3578107	If people would listen to us.
3578127	3581210	I don't mean we, I mean we as a generation.
3581310	3582011	I know, I know, I know.
3583572	3584253	How about this way?
3584273	3589018	If people would be a little bit less distracted by things and actually get off their ass and do something.
3589699	3590079	Just saying.
3590845	3591706	Alright, Loki.
3592226	3593467	Speaking about the Wii changing.
3595628	3606914	Yeah, a lot of the features that are on the Wii, online features, maybe stuff that you don't use, I'm sure it's a lot of stuff that you don't use, are being deactivated starting June 28th.
3608315	3617661	This includes the Nintendo Channel, the News Channel, the Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, the Mii Contest Channel, and some of the data exchange with friends.
3617761	3630588	In other words, data exchange includes the ability to send messages to friends, and also all of the Mii data exchange in some games will end as well.
3631308	3636151	I'm wondering if that also means the Mii Plaza swapping of characters and stuff like that.
3636171	3637132	I wonder if that's going to go away.
3637693	3638936	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3645256	3649800	Well, like Nintendo's ever had any real concept of embracing online technology.
3650700	3663091	It's kind of dumb that they had all these curated channels and they couldn't have just pulled weather information from Yahoo or news from anything.
3663271	3663711	I don't know.
3664592	3666473	RSS feeds, I mean, that's all they really are.
3666533	3669876	Why couldn't they have just updated, hey, we're not going to do these on our server anymore.
3670236	3673019	Let's just update this to RSS feeds for different things.
3676701	3701815	I haven't touched my Wii it was fun to spin the globe in the news channel and in the weather channel but yeah I mean that kind of loses its luster after some time but you know they're still actively selling the Wii granted the most recent model they came out with in Canada had the internet parts just stripped out of it maybe that should have told us something
3702635	3708697	But, you know, it's not like they aren't still... I mean, a Wii game is coming out this week, or just came out.
3708737	3710838	The whole Pandora's Tower.
3710898	3711458	Yeah, this week.
3711958	3714459	So, it's not like the Wii itself is dead.
3715219	3715639	It's dead.
3715780	3721882	But they're sure pulling the plug on Wii... Basically, Wii Connect 24 is getting its plug pulled.
3722202	3723662	Anything that runs off the internet on the Wii is done.
3723682	3730705	Yeah, because after Pandora's Tower, the next game you have coming out is... Smurfs 2...
3732466	3733547	and then after that, Planes.
3735369	3735950	Disney Planes.
3737412	3740977	And Disney Infinity.
3741197	3747645	So it's all kids stuff, but you're not going to get Madden, you're not going to get NCAA, you're not going to get anything else...
3749750	3764458	I think after this year, and maybe if there are some indie developers out there or smaller developers that really want to still focus on the Wii, I think you're going to be out of titles probably by second quarter next year.
3765511	3769093	YYR in chat says, darn, I can't check the weather at the North Pole anymore.
3769493	3770914	Everyone, you know you've done this.
3771234	3772675	Guilty as charged.
3773195	3774096	I have to say not guilty.
3774336	3775116	Totally fun though.
3775136	3776557	I've actually never played with the Weather Channel.
3776757	3777238	You check it out.
3777438	3778498	You want to know where my Wii is?
3779819	3780499	In a dumpster?
3780719	3781120	No.
3781620	3783361	It's in a box at Dan's mom's house.
3784101	3785302	I haven't touched that thing in months.
3785362	3786823	I can't believe I waited in line for that thing.
3787743	3790604	Although that was pretty fun giving donuts and bribing for our spot online.
3790784	3791105	It was.
3791165	3791825	It was a lot of fun.
3792605	3795666	RavensDolphin in chat says, I don't think people were using that stuff on Wii.
3795746	3798628	How many people sent messages on their Wii and watch it glow blue?
3799068	3799688	Not in years.
3799768	3800588	Mine is on the floor.
3800969	3801949	And yeah, you know what?
3802029	3802629	Let's be real.
3802849	3804630	I haven't used that stuff in a long time either.
3804690	3808912	So I can't sit here and go, oh, how dare they take away the stuff I used to love.
3810000	3810960	It's over.
3811000	3811460	That's fine.
3811580	3818602	I think the thing that's annoying people the most is it's basically just saying that Nintendo's just giving up support on this console.
3818862	3820122	They're just like, eh, we're done.
3820142	3820902	We have the Wii U now.
3822363	3832945	Which they kind of need to do to help motivate people to get the Wii U. Yeah, but what's going to happen when the new Wii U U comes out?
3833205	3833925	The Wii U U?
3834705	3835545	Is it the Wii W?
3835825	3838686	The Wii W. That's funny.
3839566	3841887	Her, her, I'm clever, her.
3842027	3850388	Alright, hopefully also funny and light-hearted like some of their previous games, and Fun will be the next game from Level 5.
3851489	3864511	Level 5 is probably most well-known for Ni No Kuni as of late, but they also did Dragon Quest VIII, which was so good, and White Knight Chronicles 1 and 2, which were kind of a little more controversial.
3864531	3866952	In fact, I heard the servers for those games are getting shut down, which is
3867532	3868513	Nino Kuni 2 Dragon Quest 8 2
3894990	3898852	or, okay, to be fair, maybe we don't necessarily need a sequel.
3898912	3899772	They can do something new.
3900573	3902794	That would be nice, right?
3904395	3908016	So, we will see what is next from level five.
3908657	3910338	Okay, Raven's Dolphin was hilarious.
3910438	3910898	Oh, what did he say?
3910918	3915360	There's been a bunch of jokes going on in chat about Wii U 2 featuring Bono and I said, you know, featuring The Edge.
3916040	3919122	And Raven's Dolphin says, is the Wii U 2 slogan with or without you?
3920720	3922841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3935868	3962451	they cracked Ubisoft's Uplay security so they can download games for free and Ubisoft actually sent out a statement that they said that they are aware of the issue and are trying to resolve it the rest of the quote goes no personal information was compromised Uplay's PC download service will be unavailable until the problem is fixed however all other Uplay services remain available so basically it was actually a group of Russian hackers that broke into it and downloaded games for free so
3964913	3965373	Wow.
3965453	3966433	Hacker's gonna hack.
3966553	3970274	Yeah, but that's quite something to get in there and download games for free.
3970354	3970595	Yeah.
3970975	3971375	Loki.
3972155	3976036	Including, that's how Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon leaked.
3976256	3977276	Give us some more details.
3977676	3979017	How did this exactly happen?
3979097	3982798	It's basically a trick with a client that they, I think it's, they said it's easy.
3982898	3987379	It's even maybe like a console command or something like that, like that you would enter in, but
3987899	3994065	basically tricked Uplay into thinking that you own the game and allowed you to re-download it.
3994505	4002312	So they did that with Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon and some other stuff to prove that it worked.
4002712	4004354	And so now they're going to try to patch that out.
4006004	4007345	But, yeah.
4007746	4010869	I mean, that sucks that your DRM is able to be defeated that quickly.
4012450	4014372	Especially to have a game like that leak out early.
4015053	4017795	But, it is awesome, so I do recommend everyone go buy it.
4017855	4024402	Yeah, but still, I mean, you know... Well, they've taken down... Well, it's not going to stop people from, you know, the re-up.
4024502	4028266	Like, probably how you got yours, but... Once it's on the internet, it's...
4029190	4053975	On the internet for a second, on there for an eternity But yeah, they did their best to get that shut down as soon as possible But still, it was Gameranx G-A-M-E-R-A-N-X put an image of the game being downloaded That was for Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon And basically said, here is us sending it to the torrent sites
4057326	4059032	You know, bite our ass.
4061560	4062243	Hackers gonna hack.
4063664	4065665	Alright, so don't put your full games online.
4066425	4066985	Seriously?
4067045	4069226	Or like a month before they're supposed to come out.
4069807	4072828	I don't know, do they happen to do a brag about being unhackable?
4072848	4075289	Because usually that follows immediately being hacked.
4075489	4078650	No, but Ubisoft had that whole DRM thing which nobody liked.
4079350	4081351	Not that that makes it okay, I'm just saying.
4081391	4083452	That's probably the justification.
4083472	4089074	I got the Ubisoft little service myself and I said, you know what, I don't really need to play Assassin's Creed that much.
4091556	4093217	I registered some of my games with it.
4093277	4094358	It's, you know, whatever.
4096480	4100264	Alright, let us travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4101265	4103588	And Loki, we'll start with you in the US.
4104188	4110394	Pandora's Tower this week on the Wii, on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii U, and Justice Gods Among Us.
4111375	4124782	Shimogami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers on the 3DS And last but not least, one week from today, LEGO City Undercover The Chase Begins on the 3DS Oh, that didn't come out in tandem with the DS?
4124942	4127363	Nope Or the Wii U version?
4127463	4129984	No, it did not Weird Was it delayed?
4131505	4135087	I don't know I don't think it was ever supposed to come out at the same time Okay
4136724	4138986	NARUTO ULTIMATE NINJA STORM 3 NAMCO BANDAI
4157603	4158584	Going to the Xbox 360.
4159145	4161247	Yes, they do release Xbox 360 games in Japan.
4161808	4164671	Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is also out this week.
4164991	4168595	I should mention that Monster Hunter Frontier G1 Premium Package.
4169016	4172159	I think that's just kind of like, again, like a Best Hits repackaging type of thing.
4172940	4175903	Next week in Japan, though, on the 360, Bioshock Infinite.
4177645	4179426	How about on the PlayStation Vita this week?

4183810	4187673	Zetai Shokugeki 2 comes out this week.
4187693	4188673	That's like Becky's brownies.

4285498	4287799	Sorry, I had to look behind me to see if I could find the joke.
4288760	4291361	Hold your hand up over your head.
4291421	4292982	You might catch it when it sails past.
4294383	4294883	You know what?
4294923	4298365	You guys don't deserve any more Japanese release dates.
4298665	4299145	That's it.
4300486	4300966	DarkSakura.
4301857	4324371	there's some stuff coming out in Europe on the 18th of April we have Papo and Yo on PC which looks kind of interesting and then stuff on April 19th Fire Emblem Awakening and Injustice Gods Among Us and that's it no more you guys don't get any more games aww it's kind of a slow time of year yeah
4325106	4329488	Alright, let's go for a few more stories and then the classic game of the week.
4329528	4331229	I bet y'all can't wait to see what she picked for this episode.
4331249	4332530	You guys are going to be so surprised.
4332910	4334110	Actually, I legitimately was.
4334771	4336491	Loki, what did you pick tonight for news?
4337572	4338092	For news?
4338432	4339093	Let's see.
4339673	4350218	I picked the UK government investigating in-app purchases because they believe that it's putting too much pressure on children to accidentally or maybe...
4352097	4355140	Misslead them into purchasing Smurf objects.
4356041	4357001	Or stuff that they don't need.
4358282	4359003	Basically saying,
4370332	4379718	The OFT is not seeking to ban in-game purchases, but the games industry must ensure that it's complying with relevant regulations so that children are protected.
4379798	4380439	Think of the children.
4380479	4381999	They're coming for you, Smurf Village.
4382340	4383821	La la la la la la.
4383861	4384921	Spend my mom's credit card.
4384961	4388864	Are we going to get Smurf Village 2 with the Smurfs 2 movie coming out?
4389104	4390645	Smurfs Village 2, Electric Boogaloo?
4391045	4391525	I hope not.
4391886	4395788	Okay, if it was really combining those two movies, I might have to watch it.
4397549	4401270	The Smurfs movie is so bad.
4402071	4403491	Katy Perry is one of the voices.
4403511	4409674	I kind of wanted to watch it just because Neil Patrick Harris is in it, but I unfortunately did not want to see that movie.
4411014	4412975	I think Katy Perry was Smurfette, right?
4414035	4423099	Now, if Neil Patrick Harris, the character from all of the wonderful Harold and Kumar movies, was in that movie, that might be something.
4424881	4428043	Okay, my husband, I have to go on a little tangent here.
4428123	4431224	Dan and I had a very interesting discussion about the Smurfs.
4431785	4435907	Okay, yes, my husband and I discussed the Smurfs while walking through Fry's Electronics.
4436487	4438848	He picked up a plushie Smurf and said, that's a big Smurf.
4438888	4441249	He said, actually, this would be about how big a Smurf really is.
4441750	4446832	And then he started stacking what the size of apples would have been because they're three apples high.
4447112	4452555	And he's like, how did nobody ever find the damn Smurf village if they came up to your shins?
4453636	4453776	So...
4455700	4456080	End of story.
4457562	4458042	Alrighty.
4459003	4463648	That means there would be no plot ever because everyone would be, oh, what are these little blue fuckers running around for?
4464108	4467632	Well, maybe they just lived in like remote Canada where nobody thought to look.
4469253	4470214	People live in Canada.
4470234	4472376	I know, but not that far north.
4473097	4473737	Yes, they do.
4473818	4474698	They lived in Nunavut.
4480160	4480481	Alright.
4481743	4482444	Nobody lives there.
4482464	4483645	Brakeman voted for Gargamel.
4483706	4485909	I voted for Azrael because Gargamel was pretty stupid.
4488126	4494952	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, pancake.
4495272	4496473	Well, would you vote for this?
4496593	4501737	You know, I know a lot of people are very, they're purist when it comes to their Japanese voiceovers.
4502297	4503558	But here's an interesting one.
4503619	4506201	How much would you pay for Japanese voiceovers?
4507061	4513206	Square Enix is going to be selling a Japanese voiceover pack for the Steam version of Tomb Raider.
4513647	4517209	It's already available in Japan through the Western store.
4518070	4518850	Here's the thing, though.
4518870	4522732	If you want to get the Japanese localization pack, it will cost $30.
4523032	4526193	That's $30 DLC.
4526593	4529474	That's on top of what the game costs already.
4530194	4535836	Now, it should be noted, Japanese games do tend to be a little bit higher in price anyway.
4537237	4541058	The Japanese version of the game actually comes out on April 25th.
4541698	4544379	That is the same day as the voiceover pack.
4544719	4545940	and it will retail for $80.
4546321	4548583	This is typical for Japan.
4549043	4558171	So in a way, it's kind of like, well, the $50 you paid for it on Steam plus the $30 for the voiceover pack equals the $80 it would have cost you anyway, but there went your deal.
4559072	4566298	The only reason I could remotely think of it being that high would be simply the cost of paying voice actors, especially with...
4568197	4570038	I mean, that's really the only thing I can think of.
4570058	4570778	Well, it ain't cheap.
4571578	4579821	They'd have to basically decide what they've had to pay the voice actors for and then see what their overhead is for the recording and then adjust the price.
4580802	4582482	They're still, I think, pulling a big profit off of it.
4583183	4584203	And I know people will buy it.
4584683	4586444	Yeah, there's a lot of people in chat going, what?
4586684	4587404	Why?
4587564	4594587	But then you have Zombie Princess that gives us a little perspective here at live.vognetwork.com says, I would pay that much for Japanese voices in Mass Effect.
4595760	4598501	I would not because it was not ever dubbed in Japanese.
4599641	4600501	But neither was Tomb Raider.
4601121	4601301	No.
4602621	4602841	Well.
4603361	4603802	However.
4604162	4605122	I guess it is now.
4605202	4605562	Sorry.
4605582	4609163	Actually, I do have to say that Mass Effect in French sounds pretty fucking cool.
4610163	4612303	I want to know what her voice sounds like.
4612743	4618124	Did they go the route where she's super chibi or did they pick like a deep male Japanese voice for her?
4618704	4619905	It's Japanese voice acting.
4619945	4621785	She probably sounds super kawaii.
4623401	4629347	YYR in chat says, when was the last time a Japanese game was released here with subtitles and the English dub cost an extra $20?
4630088	4637255	Well, to be fair, you know, to import a game from Japan, remember when we used to import DDR and Beatmania and all that stuff?
4637794	4640557	Well, um, shoot, what was it?
4641598	4644261	There was, there was another, oh yeah, Sonic Adventure.
4645002	4646603	You remember when it came out on Dreamcast?
4647124	4651348	It had the Japanese, um, you could choose the Japanese voice track with the English subtitles.
4652169	4656814	Which, because I played through it the first time in Japanese on my, um, import.
4657575	4660438	So I played through it again in Japanese because I was used to the voices.
4660738	4663260	I think of a lot of fighting games nowadays.
4663280	4664761	I want to say Soul Calibur and Street Fighter.
4664781	4666582	The Street Fighter series, you can choose language.
4666682	4671285	You can choose between the two, but the amount of dialogue in Street Fighter versus Tomb Raider.
4672125	4681631	But it also changed the in-game voice acting to the Japanese voice actors, which honestly, if I'm going to listen to Ryu, I don't want him to sound like he's a white boy.
4682672	4682892	You know?
4684129	4695354	Breakman, going back in time a little bit in our chat room, or excuse me, not going back in time, but Breakman going back to an earlier comment saying, I would pay that much for a Mass Effect nude code, but I'm a perv.
4695834	4696214	You know what?
4696234	4697155	You can do that for free.
4697175	4697975	It's called TextMod.
4698075	4699616	Let me introduce you to the internet.
4699856	4701756	It is your friend, and there's lots of nudity on it.
4702016	4710580	Actually, I have, when I was putting in all those outfits to, you know, for my shepherd and everything, one of them is completely naked, except there is absolutely no features on it.
4711317	4714541	I'm sure that there's already a mod out there for Tomb Raider for this.
4715261	4716763	Again, it's the internet.
4717124	4717704	It's been done.
4718325	4723070	Actdeft in our chatroom says, just a friendly reminder, guys, it's optional.
4724355	4727857	Reminding us that if you don't want to buy the $30 pack, you don't have to.
4728157	4731579	But Black Wolf goes, it's required, it exists, therefore I must have it.
4732640	4734061	There are consumer whores out there.
4734481	4738783	And, honestly, it's the same reason why people buy dubbed anime here.
4739884	4744206	Even though I paid a little bit extra for the subtitled versions when they were on VHS.
4744967	4745867	It's people...
4747388	4748769	Video games couldn't talk.
4775749	4776389	DarkSakura.com
4793431	4797136	You guys have pushed me and pushed me and pushed me for Mass Effect.
4798017	4801623	So I finally decided to go with something a lot older than that.
4802083	4804907	I see what you did there.
4805288	4807731	Yeah, I picked a video game that was made in the 1940s.
4810411	4811992	Thank you for watching!
4825345	4832331	I wrote for my Geeks in History, I wrote about Thomas Goldsmith Jr., who basically is the guy that invented this.
4833432	4849706	He was from Greenville, South Carolina, born in 1910, and he actually filed a patent for a game with Estelle Ray Mann in 1948 that is a cathode ray tube game that uses radar displays used from World War II.
4850607	4852168	and basically, it's table tennis.
4852689	4854410	You had adjusting difficulties.
4854530	4858934	You would basically have your little paddles on either side, very Pong-like.
4859114	4861996	I mean, if you want to have something that's a frame of reference.
4862437	4868702	But it would knock the little ball from one side to the other using the same type of light moves on a radar screen.
4869422	4874166	So, like I said, it had adjustable difficulties.
4874206	4878570	He also had a missile game that using screen overlays, you could shoot
4879310	4880011	at targets.
4880612	4883475	I mean, it was sort of like... Screen overlays, so it was like the Vectrex.
4883775	4885737	Yeah, Vectrex-y, yeah.
4885917	4889962	But I mean, it used basically the CRT's electron gun kind of like an etch sketch.
4890883	4894086	The same type of theory behind it.
4894146	4899592	So we're talking about... Now, how long before somebody drew a penis using the technology?
4901214	4901575	45 seconds?
4902415	4904217	Rob, this was in the 40s.
4904257	4905378	People were so repressed.
4906379	4906940	I have no idea.
4906980	4907800	Like I said.
4908641	4910643	They made a cock overlay for it.
4910663	4913025	They didn't talk about it in public back then.
4913726	4916969	Becky said, they didn't talk about it in public back then.
4917509	4918890	They were polite company, Rob.
4919371	4919811	Rob!
4919871	4920852	You're so dirty, Rob.
4921292	4924675	Sorry, I'm trying to... I can't do your... I will call her later if you push me.
4924695	4925315	I love your mom.
4925615	4926516	Your mom's awesome.
4927016	4934742	Okay, but no, it was... I don't know, I'm imagining that they put like a little, you know, penis-shaped overlay on it and then had the little white ball shoot out of the top.
4934802	4935103	I don't know.
4936144	4944412	Anyway, but yeah, basically it detected the targets mechanically and then you used, I'm just going to read this here.
4944552	4957846	By connecting a cathodary tube to an oscilloscope and devising knobs that controlled the angle and trajectory of the light traces displayed on the oscilloscope, they were able to invent a missile game that when using the overlays created the effect of firing missiles at various targets.
4959124	4959404	Lady Byron?
4981497	4981897	No.
4983319	4994288	But, um, but I mean, with her, you know, she invented the first programming language, so we could just go back to her, but still, um... Are you looking at... I'm trying to look it up.
4995369	4995989	Ada Lovelace.
4996029	4996470	Thank you.
4996810	4997351	Ada Lovelace.
4999172	4999853	Um, so yeah.
5000093	5009201	But I mean, this guy here pretty much, without him screwing around with radar screens, would we have...
5011044	5011764	Earth Defense Force.
5012665	5013165	Just asking.
5015726	5016066	All right.
5016186	5017987	Thank you, World War II, for making video games.
5018267	5021429	There it is, your classic game of the week, Radar Games.
5022249	5024570	Radar Games.
5024590	5025130	Radar Love.
5026611	5027832	Is that what you're going to name it?
5027892	5028452	Radar Love?
5028492	5030073	I'm going to name it Radar Love.
5030093	5030693	Radar Love.
5031093	5033434	We should have played the song in the background.
5035875	5036656	Oh, that's great.
5037476	5037817	Let's see.
5037917	5044161	So AkumaJP linked this to me, and this was definitely worth playing with the prior story.
5044481	5050245	This is Tomb Raider Japanese voice acting, but I want to point out this is the older Tomb Raider.
5050265	5051446	This is not from the new game.
5051806	5054968	This is the Sega Saturn Sony PlayStation game.
5055028	5056169	She's watching a computer there.
5056189	5057350	That's not very exciting.
5057370	5059331	Let me fast forward.
5065100	5066160	to a loading screen.
5066200	5066580	Good lord.
5069441	5078523	That's the tutorial telling her how to play the damn game.
5080043	5080983	This is not a great video.
5081003	5083624	This represented the voice acting here.
5083784	5084384	Let me go back.
5086585	5086905	You know what?
5086925	5087265	Forget it.
5087305	5087865	It's lost its...
5089144	5091685	I wanted the British accent, but Japanese.
5091705	5094447	It was the cathode ray tube amusement device.
5094887	5096027	I'm still calling it Radar Love.
5096287	5097108	I like Radar Love.
5097128	5098008	It's easier to remember.
5098828	5099149	All right.
5100589	5101289	Let's take a break, guys.
5101309	5104511	We're going to take a break, but when we come back, there is plenty more to come.
5105231	5106732	We have some rapid fire news for you guys.
5106752	5107752	The Fugo Question of the Week.
5107792	5109273	More stories and...
5110461	5110921	Why not?
5111302	5112983	We're going to play match game tonight.
5113104	5114245	So stay tuned, guys.
5114405	5119089	Match game and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 500.
5129144	5134806	Hi there, this is Flaco Jones, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5135567	5138068	And I want to use my voice to tell you, you should all play Ni No Kuni.
5138368	5138768	It's great.
5139288	5140709	Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.
5140869	5144631	And now that I said it in a bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni, or you have to play this bumper forever.
5145863	5146423	Never.
5147064	5147384	Never.
5147404	5148264	I'll never beat it.
5148324	5148804	You know why?
5148824	5150005	Because I have gamer ADD.
5150165	5150905	I never beat games.
5151165	5151826	Welcome back, everybody.
5151866	5153226	You're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.
5153646	5156628	Episode number 500 in progress here.
5157568	5166472	And if you want to send in a bumper like Flaco Jones did, and we have one other bumper that was sent in, and I'll let you know who that was next week when we play it.
5167412	5169033	That's quite an empty space there.
5169053	5170094	We're looking for more bumpers.
5170394	5180500	More information at the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com if you want to send in a bumper for future use on the show because we do say it is the show where every gamer has a voice and we mean it.
5180801	5185384	We want to hear from more of you guys and what you want to use your voice to tell people here on the show.
5186144	5186444	All right.
5188065	5188626	Moving on.
5190787	5192488	I think it might be time for me to have one more shot.
5192588	5193028	What do you think?
5193269	5194009	Should I do one more shot?
5194569	5194910	Do it!
5195070	5195350	All right.
5195410	5196491	I'm going to go get one more shot.
5197527	5200190	Like I'm never going to discourage you from getting shit-faced.
5200230	5201711	What would you use your voice to tell people?
5201891	5203373	What would I use my voice to tell people?
5204934	5208798	I would use my voice to tell people to give me money because I'm broke and hire me.
5209238	5213062	That's what I'm going to use my voice for.
5213102	5216305	Jamie, that hasn't worked for 500 episodes and it's not going to work now.
5217066	5220469	And I think you forgot the whole thing where we're not trying to profit off this show, remember?
5220489	5221650	No, I'm not trying to profit off this show.
5221690	5222331	I just want a job.
5224713	5225813	Listen to my voice.
5225893	5227614	You want me to market your stuff.
5228674	5229554	I can sell you anything.
5230554	5232955	Rob, would you sell anything that I offered you to buy?
5233375	5234535	I mean... Yes.
5236115	5236876	Rob says yes.
5236916	5237836	He's off the mic.
5237876	5238436	He says yes.
5238496	5241217	Yes, I would go directly to eBay and sell all that crap.
5241437	5241737	Hey.
5242817	5243177	All right.
5243657	5244297	Hey.
5244397	5245658	Okay, shot time.
5246518	5247378	What's this cheers to?
5251280	5252822	By the way, these are double shots.
5253603	5255245	To the air we breathe.
5255846	5257107	The air from my lungs.
5264097	5265719	Rob just shivered and made stink face.
5265739	5266540	It was awesome.
5267521	5268403	It's fiery.
5270242	5270903	It's flaming.
5271563	5271843	All right.
5271863	5276086	I got your email, and I am so sorry I didn't get a chance to reply to it, Zombie Princess.
5276166	5277047	I will reply to it when I get home.
5277127	5278728	Is this personal chat time here on OR?
5278768	5279609	Hey, it's money.
5279709	5280069	Shut up.
5280970	5283472	All right.
5283552	5284172	Moving on.
5284252	5288355	Let's get to rapid-fire news and talk about what else is going on in the video game industry.
5288656	5291998	Coming up, the Fugle Question of the Week, match game in this segment as well.
5292058	5294080	We're going to get players for that soon.
5294780	5295701	But first, Loki.
5297026	5302230	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Ridge Racer.
5302650	5307133	That's right, Ridge Racer Driftopia is a new game that they announced that they're going to be putting out.
5307473	5309234	No, it's not like your classic Ridge Racer.
5309334	5315799	It's actually kind of an extension of Ridge Racer Unbounded, which is done by Bugbear, and they're doing a new one.
5316119	5323384	It's going to be a free-to-play game, so you're going to have, I guess, the ability to buy cars, repair kits, and XP packs.
5323424	5326206	Hopefully, it's just not going to be crippled by the free-to-play stuff.
5327466	5328946	It's coming to PS3 and PC.
5329927	5331747	Hooray.
5331807	5333768	This is something I actually backed on Kickstarter.
5334148	5334948	Road Redemption.
5335228	5337789	It is a spiritual successor to Road Rash.
5337829	5338569	It's in 3D.
5338929	5342590	And they're looking for $160,000 over the next 30 days.
5344210	5347551	And as of right now, I believe they're not quite there.
5348891	5351572	They are... Let's see...
5353513	5355135	34,000!
5353974	5355135	Not bad.
5355636	5356598	So I think they'll make it.
5357218	5358060	And it looks kind of neat.
5358360	5361825	It is not, though, done by anybody that did the original Road Rash game.
5361845	5363207	It's merely people that are fans of it.
5363348	5364389	So, sorry.
5365431	5367654	And last but not least, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
5367955	5368776	It's fantastic.
5368996	5369997	VHS Tracking VHS Tracking VHS Tracking
5399204	5400585	So what does that mean?
5400645	5404347	Like it does like the little fuzzy wuzzies like a tape that's been demagnetized or something?
5404407	5407610	It's like all fuzzy and then there's the tracking thing going back and forth on the bottom.
5408070	5408750	Can you adjust it?
5410151	5410271	No.
5410732	5413593	And what's great is they have tool tips on there.
5413633	5418617	Like for example, fast travel is like traveling except fast.
5421359	5428183	Or guns or was it shooting enemies within range will cause them damage or something like that.
5428482	5429370	I need this in my life.
5431371	5435052	Alright, let's get to some other stories here.
5435172	5436013	This is interesting.
5436253	5442495	Armature Studio was working on an unreleased Mega Man first-person shooter called Maverick Hunter.
5442555	5444496	This is in a report from Polygon.
5445356	5449897	Armature Studio is the Austin-based developer that was formed from Retro Studios originally.
5450458	5452378	Yeah, it was a Mega Man X first-person shooter.
5452458	5460141	I don't know if that necessarily means Mega Man Legends or all that, but I think this was supposed to be a little more hardcore or something like that.
5460541	5467347	Capcom did cancel the project because Mega Man Universe and Mega Man Legends 3, all those went to hell, so why not this one as well?
5467928	5473173	Arbiter did have a prototype in 2010, and it looks like there was a little screenshot that leaked to the web as well.
5473353	5474714	They had video that leaked to the web.
5474874	5475815	I watched it already.
5475855	5476936	How'd it look?
5477016	5477697	I didn't see the video.
5477717	5477757	It
5478457	5480178	It gave me a lot of vibe.
5481099	5487382	I don't know if it would have been this bad, but it gave me a lot of the Bomberman Act Zero vibe.
5488763	5490124	It didn't really look like Mega Man.
5490164	5493186	He was firing machine guns and stuff like that.
5493986	5499089	And just kind of fighting some generic looking robots and doing all sorts of weird takedowns and stuff.
5499549	5501651	It just didn't seem very much like Mega Man.
5501811	5504592	It looked neat, but I don't know if it was necessarily Mega Man.
5504692	5504752	It...
5506173	5510415	Ubisoft has picked up German developer Related Designs.
5510435	5515337	They made the Anno strategy series, including Anno 1404, which is Dawn's discovery over here.
5529844	5533847	Ubisoft previously held a 30% share in the company, but they have purchased the other 70%.
5534908	5540231	It is undisclosed for how much that went for, but you can expect more strategy-style games from Ubisoft in the near future.
5541152	5543814	Unfortunately, Atari closed a studio this week.
5544394	5551779	They closed Eden Games, which was the mind behind Test Drive Unlimited and Alone in the Dark a long time ago.
5552480	5554441	This is according to a report from Eurogamer.
5554581	5558964	I can't believe they closed that studio after such a wonderful game like Alone in the Dark.
5560444	5583411	well I like the test drive games alright the problem was it wasn't Forza it just wasn't that same level to get away from the police you drove in the grass and they're like I can't get you you left a road how am I going to get you now damn you grass and also Lamborghinis make really awesome off road vehicles
5584721	5588903	TwitchGameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Atari still exists?
5589303	5589843	Exactly.
5589883	5591744	What have they put out lately?
5591964	5594285	Actually, they were supposed to be liquidating soon, weren't they?
5594305	5597126	Because I remember all their properties are supposed to be up for sale.
5597566	5601027	I don't know what happened to that, but it's supposed to happen.
5601307	5602448	Marble Madness is up for sale.
5605069	5606590	I know somebody needs to pick up Marble Madness.
5606950	5610871	That's an Xbox Live Arcade PlayStation Network thing worth picking up for sure.
5610891	5612832	They would have to do a lot to Marble Madness, though.
5614187	5615607	Like more stages than six.
5615807	5616307	Yeah, I know.
5616527	5618628	And like longer levels and more challenges.
5618748	5621088	All right, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
5621608	5623309	I have some stuff and things.
5623789	5626429	It'd help if I was actually on the right window on my stupid iPad.
5626609	5626849	Okay.
5627769	5630550	So we have a new mobile game coming out soon.
5630590	5640232	The Prince of Persia, The Shadow and the Flame is going to mobile on that really fun date that we like to refer to as soon.
5641172	5642812	Don't know when, but soon.
5644352	5649998	and it's being developed by Ubisoft Pune or is it Pune?
5651360	5652421	Ubisoft Pune?
5653142	5653482	What?
5654223	5655064	P-U-N-E.
5655084	5658047	You say it.
5658248	5659189	Who likes the Pune?
5661826	5665349	Come over to Ubisoft and get yourself... You gave me this story so you could give me shit.
5665449	5666810	Get yourself the poonay.
5666970	5667691	You gave me this story.
5667731	5673556	Or you could have just said it's being developed by Ubisoft and saved yourself from trying to... It's Rob's fault.
5673576	5675458	Do not get in the way of me blaming Rob for shit.
5676498	5677039	I will judge you.
5679947	5704889	Dark Souls, because I know that there are a lot of people out there who like this game it sold 2.3 million copies worldwide and that was from software that put this out they actually had an event to announce this out for the Japanese press it sold 375,000 copies for PS3 in Japan and 1.3 million internationally for PS3 and Xbox 360 so yay for Dark Souls fans
5705049	5706850	You know what I think they should do with that series?
5706870	5713854	They should get the guy that made I Want to Be the Guy and have him help with level design for that game because that would be awesome.
5714415	5717076	Just to fuck with the fans and make it so hard.
5717457	5722620	That would make people jump off buildings or into bullet trains and that type of thing.
5723600	5725982	It'd be like a rehash of the beginning of Suicide Club.
5727182	5731045	And then, last but not least, remember that guy Adam Orth?
5731465	5732966	We were kind of giving him shit last week.
5733953	5734493	Kinda.
5734873	5735353	Kinda.
5735834	5736474	Well, guess what?
5736514	5736834	He quit.
5737694	5744716	Either he quit or was fired, but he's the one that said, sorry, I don't get the drama about having an always-on console.
5744756	5746637	Every device is always-on.
5746657	5747497	That's the world we live in.
5747857	5748898	Hashtag deal with it.
5749978	5752319	He decided to retire so he could get all the Pune.
5754399	5757120	Well, Rob.
5757761	5758441	I've been drinking.
5758481	5759061	Leave me alone.
5763081	5766262	Someone actually went back and asked him, did you learn nothing from Diablo 3 or SimCity?
5766302	5767843	You know some people's internet goes out, right?
5767883	5770264	Deal with it is a shitty reason.
5770384	5771884	And he replied, electricity goes out too.
5772404	5774565	That's somebody who worked for Bioware, if I remember right.
5777286	5779527	Could that have just been friends giving each other shit?
5779547	5782368	Because I'm way meaner to people on Twitter than that guy was.
5783610	5785351	Well, I mean, the person made another good point.
5785371	5789333	He says, you lived in Seattle, San Francisco, L.A., very connected places.
5789373	5792194	Try living in Janesville, Wisconsin, or Blacksburg, Virginia.
5792794	5794695	And then he said, why on earth would I live there?
5798038	5813189	it's a fair question I mean I'm sorry but come on like you haven't said way worse shit on the internet like you haven't said way worse shit on the internet I'm completely innocent yeah but I've said shit about places I've actually lived look
5813809	5840125	I get it though this is just the day and age that we live in is that you know whether or not you want to represent your company when you are the creative director for Microsoft there are people that are going to read way too much into your stuff like you know create a second account that's anonymous or something like that that you but like because I mean if you're like working at Microsoft you don't go I don't understand what the big deal is if you have it on your thing you're the creative director for Microsoft you don't go posting shit on the internet
5840385	5842126	Unless you hate your job.
5842226	5848972	Do you think that he ever imagined that the entirety of gaming online would read so much into his tweets?
5848992	5852314	Because people on the internet don't think about consequence, usually.
5853255	5853995	Ain't that the truth.
5854236	5854856	I know, right?
5854996	5857158	No one put a gun to his head to tell him to be stupid.
5857805	5859185	Yeah, but some people are just stupid.
5859626	5864567	Okay, but by your guys' definition of stupid, I act stupid all the time on Twitter.
5864607	5866168	Yeah, but you don't work for Microsoft.
5866688	5874150	I don't, but I like my job and I wouldn't want to lose it due to my opinion, but I'm also smart enough to not talk about my industry on Twitter.
5874170	5877991	Exactly, and no matter how drunk you might be right now, Rob, I've seen you far drunker.
5878011	5881092	You've seen me at my most drunkest.
5881172	5888595	And even in the depths of inebriation, I have never seen you said, I'm going to go post about my work on Tumblr, Twitter, me.
5888675	5889316	Yeah, no.
5889616	5890256	I've never done that.
5890656	5892917	I have seen you kiss a girl, which was very weird.
5893297	5894418	Why are we bringing this up?
5895759	5896439	Because you were drunk.
5898480	5901421	What does me kissing a girl have to do with an always online Xbox?
5901701	5903102	It's less offensive than this guy.
5907682	5908864	I love watching Rob turn red.
5909085	5910046	It's hilarious.
5910487	5911489	He is literally glowing.
5911509	5913693	I almost want to put that in as a poll question.
5913773	5916778	What's more offensive, Rob kissing a girl or that guy?
5920299	5930723	So anyway, the guy actually, apart from somehow or another losing his means of employment, which, by the way, I'm open for employment, Microsoft.
5930743	5931344	You can hire me.
5931844	5933264	I don't go saying stupid shit on the internet.
5933304	5933685	Just saying.
5933805	5934465	Are you sure?
5934485	5936146	Grab!
5936406	5937446	500 episodes, DarkSakura.
5937466	5939307	I don't say stupid shit about my job.
5939707	5941708	Honey, you've said a lot of stupid shit on this show.
5941728	5942989	I have said a lot of stupid shit on this show.
5943229	5944649	A real friend will tell you that.
5944729	5947050	I've said a lot of stupid shit off this show, too.
5949171	5949632	I admit it.
5950112	5955016	Anyway, the dude actually locked his Twitter and deleted his LinkedIn account.
5956097	5958539	So yeah, he's like, I'm going to hide now.
5959380	5960101	Can you blame him?
5960623	5962785	I don't blame him, but he's kind of stupid anyway.
5962805	5971192	If freaking LolTaku's going to be posting everything that you tweet about, then yeah, it's suddenly going to become a new headline, then yeah, I'd go into hiding too.
5971673	5972093	Seriously?
5972133	5974735	And y'all want to know why I don't use my real name on this show?
5974755	5977478	Because, you know, I like my job.
5977858	5978779	I just don't care.
5979720	5980961	What, about all this mess, or what?
5982162	5982582	Everything.
5984730	5985710	You don't care about everything.
5985891	5986751	You just don't care.
5987091	6000357	I still didn't get... I mean, other than the fact that his comments are a little insensitive to the fact that, you know, hey, there are a lot of people that are trying to figure out what this new Xbox is going to be like and the rumors that it's going to be online only.
6000497	6002778	And then you come out and say, well, I don't see the problem with that.
6002858	6005579	I mean, after all, it sounds like a fucking wonderful thing.
6005999	6007840	And then you start being insensitive to everybody.
6008160	6008641	Thanks for watching!
6020279	6022781	Obviously, they're not asking you to move to this fucking city.
6022801	6024663	They're talking about, hey, be empathetic.
6025464	6028286	And by the way, Rob, just for the record, I'm not offended.
6028406	6030028	I was just like, that's bizarre.
6030448	6031009	Oh, whatever.
6031049	6037995	Well, it's a Queen Simeon chat says, well, hey, if some people become bi-curious when inebriated, look, I just like to make out, okay?
6038015	6038355	I cook.
6039416	6040257	What's wrong with that?
6041078	6041858	It's actually a true story.
6041898	6042559	I cook when I'm drunk.
6043447	6046289	Who doesn't, like, enjoy a little kissy-kissy every now and then?
6046349	6046670	Come on.
6046690	6050353	You guys were playing Spin the Bottle, and I was the only one sober because I had to drive.
6050673	6052214	Well... Which was boring.
6052374	6056077	And I wasn't... This was, like, ten years ago, too.
6056117	6057759	This was at the you and Loki apartment.
6058279	6059380	Oh, that was a long time ago.
6059400	6060001	That was about eight years ago.
6060021	6060721	I don't remember that.
6061242	6063163	I mean, I remember you... I think you were there.
6063263	6063724	I remember...
6064244	6067826	I remember you like some of the things that happened when you weren't there, Loki.
6068847	6073190	I remember you like Matrix walking up or trying to Matrix walk up the wall.
6073570	6074111	That was fun.
6074171	6075291	That was during OLR.
6075652	6077453	That was during OLR.
6077533	6090001	Remember the DDR parties, the Bimani parties when people would inevitably end up like retardedly drunk and then try to play DDR and hit their head on the washing machine that was behind the monitor.
6090522	6091722	I don't know anything about that.
6095066	6113884	SSJ100 Matt says he got death threats the gaming community is sad that is stupid the action needs to be taken against the people who are making death threats over a video game console priorities people
6114534	6124166	Well, this is a problem though with the internet in general is that it's added this air of anonymity where people can just let the worst parts of their personality out without any sort of real consequence.
6124606	6126308	Except unless you know how to track IPs.
6127710	6130113	And then you can message them back and tell them where they live.
6131300	6135421	Alright, is there anything else you want to share with us for rapid fire news that's gone on for 20 minutes?
6135461	6135902	I'm done.
6136082	6136362	Alright.
6137222	6141503	Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week and let's see how many of them I can make it through tonight.
6141943	6143004	Fugle Question of the Week.
6143884	6145705	Where's my Fugle song?

6147505	6149146	There we go.
6149226	6149906	Becky can sing.
6149966	6150546	She's a good singer.
6150806	6151687	She is a good singer.
6154522	6158065	Facebook, Google, put them together, you get Fugle.
6158165	6162068	And every week we ask a question and we read some of the answers here on the show.
6162088	6163809	There's a lot of answers tonight, you guys.
6167472	6170374	Who is your favorite character in a video game ever and why?
6172006	6172987	Easy, right?
6173027	6174648	I thought, you know, it's a special episode.
6174688	6175429	Let's keep it simple.
6175489	6176349	Let's keep it positive.
6176690	6176950	Do it.
6177230	6179732	Alright, so who's your favorite character in a video game and why?
6180712	6185596	Red Entertainment on Google Plus says, I like it whenever I'm able to play with myself.
6190580	6191380	And we're done.
6191460	6192681	Thank you everybody for the food.
6192701	6194022	That's been a great show.
6194062	6194843	I'll see you later.
6195263	6196164	See you next week.
6196264	6197024	Episode 501.
6198025	6199226	Thanks for joining us tonight.
6201747	6227944	that was clue worthy Rob I like whenever I'm able to play with myself I like playing with characters that I can style to be like myself or an idealized version of myself that's the unique thing about video games rare is the media platform that allows yourself to project yourself into the media experience rare is the media platform that not only allows you to but downright encourages you to play with yourself
6229949	6232010	I think I see what you're doing there, Redertainment.
6235812	6237693	And didn't he marry our own little angel?
6239234	6239534	Huh?
6239754	6240335	Redertainment?
6240555	6241776	No, it was not Redertainment.
6242516	6243556	You're thinking of Big Red Pimp.
6243597	6244797	I'm thinking of Big Red Pimp.
6244857	6245418	Different Red.
6245578	6246018	Different Red.
6246778	6246998	Sorry.
6247078	6247979	I get people confused.
6248059	6253242	Shane just messaged me other memories of things that happened in that apartment that are not appropriate for air.
6253642	6254883	Shane sent me a message.
6254903	6255183	Did he?
6256083	6256924	No, I'm telling him to.
6258385	6260566	Flaco Jones says, I have to go with GLaDOS.
6260846	6261327	GLaDOS.
6261867	6262908	I've been drinking, you guys.
6263248	6263848	GLaDOS.
6264409	6270933	As if she wasn't already worthy of the title after the first game, Portal 2 manages to give her even more depth and a backstory as well.
6271673	6275596	She also may be the most quotable character in video game history.
6276036	6279899	More quotable than the old guy in Legend of Zelda?
6280099	6281080	It's dangerous to go alone.
6281520	6285963	Actdeft says, Kirby, of course, despite popular belief, he doesn't suck.
6287762	6289904	Evil says, missing no.
6290384	6297250	By a simple random encounter, you get infinite rare candies and master balls for the cost of being disgraced in the Hall of Fame.
6298471	6301514	And Dasnichi replies, solid snake.
6303055	6305257	But are you still going to feel that way if it's not David Hayter?
6306458	6307118	That's my question.
6309220	6311882	I need to not listen to any more of this while I'm having drinks.
6312679	6313580	What, these lulz?
6313960	6317063	Okay, so on Facebook we have 30 responses.
6317123	6317824	Should I read them all?
6318685	6320086	30 responses on Facebook.
6322288	6323789	Grandpa says Mega Man.
6323950	6327273	After he acquires the boss's skill powers, he's very versatile.
6327493	6329555	I like my men versatile.
6331412	6333673	DarkSakura replied, but nobody cares.
6333973	6335174	Shut up.
6335634	6341457	Tim P replied and said, Commander Shepard, he's the sexy space marine I always wished I could be.
6341837	6345019	He said he, a bro-shep fan, a bro-shep fan.
6345717	6348219	There are no room for dude chefs in my head.
6349160	6354004	Burr replied and said, Sonic the Hedgehog, too fast for the naked eye.
6354104	6356646	Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic, he can really move.
6356746	6358067	Sonic, he's got an attitude.
6358127	6359508	Sonic, he's the fastest thing alive.
6360069	6366294	Anyway, to me as a kid, that was the moment when video games started to be cool and not just goofy fun with ridiculous looking characters.
6366594	6368936	I'll always have a soft spot for Sonic as a series.
6369917	6374020	Syl replied, Garrus, first time I thought an alien was damn hot.
6374180	6374841	I love you, Syl.
6375761	6387009	Dark Tetsuya said Pantsless Rage Just kidding, in all seriousness I'd have to go with Solid Snake That was an old ass That was an old ass That was an old joke
6388275	6392236	Gamer Girl says Sophie, later known as Protoss Hias.
6393536	6395297	Okay, this music is starting to not do it for me.
6395317	6395617	All right.
6396637	6399478	From Tales of Grace's F because she's odd.
6400658	6403299	Red the Haze says Renegade Femshep.
6403879	6407540	I've never had a favorite game character, but Renegade Femshep comes to mind.
6408661	6409061	You know what?
6409321	6413006	I actually have to kind of agree with that playing Renegade FemShep is pretty fun.
6413406	6415208	Except in some situations, then it's just bitchy.
6415669	6417831	But I'm playing one right now with Ashley's face.
6418192	6418813	It's really funny.
6419193	6421155	James S. replied and said, I have this game.
6428684	6429465	I love that game.
6429545	6430566	Yes, good choice.
6431006	6438693	The journey that young Will endures in hopes to find out what became of his father who ventured off before him ultimately changes the course of the entire world.
6439053	6442836	This game came out during a time when games of this art style weren't just for children.
6443177	6445759	The themes were adult and the story utterly breathtaking.
6445799	6447200	The music alone gives me chills.
6447640	6449322	It was part of a three-part series, right?
6449382	6450943	It was Soul Blazer was one of them.
6452705	6455007	Oh God, I can't remember the other game in the series.
6457165	6458205	There's one other game in the series.
6458265	6460226	It's Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, and there was another one.
6461147	6461487	Damn it.
6461547	6463147	Well, somebody in chat will remember.
6463187	6464748	Somebody in chat, do our work for us.
6467289	6470270	Andrew S. said, The Chesire Cat from American McGee.
6470611	6475092	He's creepy and psychologically sane and insane at the same time and always cool and collected.
6476573	6479194	Bobby Blackwolf says, The Dot in Adventure.
6479354	6480134	He was so brave.
6481155	6481555	He was.
6482415	6483796	He had to figure out how to get through that maze.
6485274	6487857	Thank you, Ross Steel UT, Terranigma, that was it.
6488558	6490540	Oh, Prince Brightstar actually brought it up first too.
6490580	6492643	Yes, it was Terranigma was the other game.
6492903	6498130	Shane replied and said, another vote for Commander Shepard, but only if he's full on Paragon.
6498491	6502636	He sets the bar for what qualities I'm looking for in a man, video game character, I mean.
6505289	6508052	Giovedea says, the eye tetromino.
6508492	6510113	Everyone always wants the eye.
6510233	6512716	Alright, I have to go with Dante from the Devil May Cry series.
6513056	6515238	A complete badass, also a bit of an asshole.
6515538	6519461	You really get to see Dante go from reckless teen to equally reckless adult.
6520963	6523885	Ronnie B says, Aiko, he took me through a great journey.
6523965	6526526	He went through a lot in the story and overall the game was really original.
6527487	6530989	Extover says, Samus Aran, and I don't need to explain why.
6531749	6532570	Well, yes, you do.
6533811	6537933	Alternate Universe Extover thinks Nathan Drake is his favorite based on ass physics.
6538633	6541715	Also, Matt, my boyfriend's favorite is Yoshi.
6542656	6546238	Wonder Dog Harold says, Leon S. Kennedy, he's so dreamy.
6547335	6550278	Degenerate Johnny says, Craya from Knights of the Old Republic 2.
6551119	6559187	From being one of your companions at the beginning to becoming the ultimate villain at the end, you'll find that she's one of the most unique and best written characters you'll ever meet in a video game.
6560228	6563791	Emily C replied and said, the king of all cosmos in Katamari Damacy.
6564132	6566794	He is so fun, flamboyant, and makes me laugh every time.
6566835	6567615	That's a really good choice.
6568476	6573621	Barbara O says toss up between Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 and Balthier from Final Fantasy 12.
6573741	6578586	We get to watch Cloud make a terrifying discovery about himself and then fight his way back from it.
6579066	6585252	Balthier seems to be only a dashing pirate, but he slowly reveals both his trustworthiness and his strong moral convictions.
6585312	6587454	At least he's not talking about being a hero all the damn time.
6587474	6588435	These are all really good answers.
6589196	6593079	Austin replies and says woof old Donald from Star Fox because he can't let you do that.
6594780	6621012	Wicked says my favorite has to be Kratos not because of anything relatable but due to his utter ferocity and severe brutality I had not seen in a video game character beforehand it was almost like playing a villain as cold hearted and brutal as he was Kyrian G says Mayak the liar because his dialogue is extremely entertaining that or Luther son of Scotia from Lands of Lore 2 Guardians of Destiny who provided many sound bites to my family throughout the years
6622272	6639805	Edgar R replied Gene from God Hand There's nothing like roaming the post-apocalyptic world beating up mini Power Rangers and racing poison chihuahuas Rob H says Guybrush Threepwood He's a mighty pirate who can hold his breath for 10 minutes and he also has a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle How can you not like that?
6640686	6642367	There's a lot of unique answers tonight.
6642407	6642847	I like this.
6642867	6644548	That's why I'm reading them all, because there's so many different ones.
6645209	6647810	Matt J says, I feel equally about two characters.
6648030	6650232	Sama Saran, she's awesome and badass.
6650292	6652273	I fell in love with her in Super Metroid.
6653473	6656275	My other all-time fave is the adorable and amazing Garrus.
6656655	6660337	I wasn't too sure of him in Mass Effect 1, but by 2, they made his character so much better.
6660638	6662519	He's sweet, a bit of a dork, but kind.
6663519	6666021	Jay Links says, Will from Illusion of Gaia.
6666221	6667802	There's two people that said that.
6668402	6668943	Go figure.
6670044	6670805	People have good taste.
6670945	6677033	I could relate at that age when I played the game about being the outcast strange kid in class and having a clique of dorky friends.
6677373	6681999	It also didn't hurt that the game's story was amazing and I really fell in love with it as my first real RPG.
6682960	6685123	Dave Falcon says, Duke Nukem, why?
6685484	6686605	Hail to the king, baby.
6687486	6689327	TigerClaw says, I'm going to have to say Mario.
6689608	6689868	Why?
6690128	6691649	Because he always gets the girl in the end.
6692950	6695732	Marinko says, Knuckles the Echidna.
6695772	6696292	Echidna.
6696352	6696732	Echidna.
6696752	6697393	I can never say that.
6697793	6700035	No one has better background music than that red demon.
6700155	6701075	Pumpkin Hill, anyone?
6701996	6710602	And HaseoSumerWogara says, to be honest, I'd have to say Auron from Final Fantasy X, Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes, and Big Boss from the Metal Gear series.
6711362	6713964	I loved Big Boss in the very first game.
6714204	6715005	That was amazing.
6715725	6716266	Lastly,
6717106	6719008	Slagkick says Bayonetta.
6719389	6722372	She's a fierce witch who kicks major ass and has great hair.
6722712	6723192	Great hair.
6723593	6724113	Fabulous.
6725255	6725575	You know what?
6725595	6726836	I'm actually starting that game next week.
6726996	6727537	Good answers.
6727917	6729579	Bayonetta is freaking amazing.
6729599	6730220	Yeah.
6731221	6731541	All right.
6732722	6734064	So let's go around the table.
6734164	6735345	I'm curious what you guys all think.
6735805	6738288	DarkSakura, I'll start with you as if this is going to be a shock.
6738648	6740030	Favorite game character of all time?
6740973	6742395	The Guardian from Guardian Legend
6771578	6779730	It was a character that was going around and kicking a lot of ass in one of the most difficult games I have ever played in my life.
6780110	6782273	And we all know how freaking hard that game is.
6782574	6784637	I don't have nearly half the skill I used to have at that game.
6785118	6786079	It's so amazing, though.
6786119	6786640	I've beaten it.
6787020	6789162	God, I wish that game would come back somehow.
6789382	6792745	I don't really want a remake necessarily, but just a spiritual successor of sorts.
6792765	6797729	I'm still trying to... I'm debating putting an MSX emulator on so I can play Guardic, the first one.
6799751	6800571	Oh, sorry, anything else?
6801092	6804935	Well, the Guardian effect, yeah.
6805816	6811961	But I also would have to... I mean, as far as classic gaming, that would be probably my favorite character.
6812521	6814283	Anything more modern?
6814523	6815824	I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta.
6818131	6822954	I really would like to go with my own Shepard, but I have my own weird headcanon.
6823054	6824135	Then you're playing with yourself.
6824515	6827837	Then I'm playing with myself, and that can get dirty, especially the places my brain goes.
6832360	6835062	I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta, just because it's totally fabulous.
6835962	6837203	I love her character concept.
6837303	6838064	I love the game.
6838184	6839965	It was completely over the top.
6840525	6862672	and I watched Dan play through it for a little while because I didn't you know really do a lot of console gaming after my surgery except for playing Blue Dragon so um but I've got a lot more endurance in my hand now thanks to practicing a lot so I'm gonna sit down and try to play through Bayonetta so playing with yourself has gotten your hand a lot of practice no I've been drawing shut up all right uh Becky do you have a do you have a favorite that you'd want to mention
6864270	6871896	Since the last time I played video games before Jamie got me hooked on Mass Effect was on my parents' Commodore 64.
6872036	6873698	Good choice.
6873718	6877801	I think I would probably have to say FemShet.
6878621	6883805	I really like her mostly Paragon with just a little bit of bitchiness here and there because it makes her feel human.
6884906	6885307	Very good.
6885387	6886067	Very good answer.
6886087	6887709	You're in good company with some of our listeners tonight.
6888029	6888349	Loki?
6889450	6889630	Um...
6891147	6898490	One of my favorite characters, and unfortunately, they better bring him back for the goddamn fourth game because that was a fucking mistake to kill him off.
6898670	6900571	Johnny Gat from the Saints Row series.
6901051	6903412	Fucking awesome, awesome character.
6904213	6909315	Of course, voiced by Daniel Dae Kim, you know, from Lost and stuff.
6909915	6911796	It's just awesome.
6911816	6913236	He's just a really cool character.
6913256	6913637	And the...
6916448	6917469	That's probably it.
6918270	6923716	My favorite video game character ever would probably be Rydia from Final Fantasy 4.
6924076	6926319	That's a good choice.
6927941	6933608	Literally watching her grow up through the game and I have such an attachment to that story too because that game was so epic and
6934268	6960918	you know that was really the first time most people in America saw the summoner you know and that was such a badass thing when she would come back to your party and she had all those you know summons and you'd go to her homeland and everything and she used the whip which was cool and you know had the black magic and she was great I and you know obviously she she had to grow up a lot fast in that story and went through tragedy and overcame it but I I just I have such an attachment to Final Fantasy 4 but Rydia was a amazing character
6961297	6961917	Robo and Luka together.
6961937	6962277	Twins.
6962458	6962518	OTP.
6985697	6986138	Good choice.
6986238	6986618	Good choice.
6987159	6987439	All right.
6987459	6989482	Thank you guys for participating with the Fugle Question of the Week.
6989782	6991084	I know that was a lot this week.
6991244	6993287	I read every single answer because you know what?
6993387	6994809	It's a show where every gamer has a voice.
6994909	6995229	Why not?
6995650	6997472	Let's get back into some news.
6997632	6997892	Loki.
6998675	7002018	Alright, so let's talk about some more Xbox rumors.
7002519	7007003	And hopefully, I don't know, I hope these are all rumors, so I don't know.
7007043	7009686	This is kind of almost like the whole online thing.
7010667	7016313	But once again, I still am under the assumption, at least, I guess, hopeful assumption that...
7016793	7042363	Microsoft isn't dumb enough to have a console that's online only that you know would be a major gaming console that's online only and maybe some of this kind of ties into it and it's this leaked roadmap that's been our new roadmap that they had now this is coming from VG leaks so who knows but basically saying that there's going to be two Xboxes the next time around there's going
7042383	7043924	Thanks for watching!
7064272	7065113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7082665	7083405	XBLA and 360 Game Support
7100151	7110199	Come from the smaller Xbox unit, which may not have a disk drive like Apple TV, it would require a network connection and internet to provide any real functionality.
7110659	7113741	It may be possible they will design both consoles to be stackable.
7115082	7123548	And, you know, of course, the original rumor was that Durango is not going to be, you know, backwards compatible, which makes sense.
7123568	7125610	I mean, it's a different processor altogether.
7125690	7129473	And, you know, the PS4 is not going to be backwards compatible either.
7130294	7136542	Also, the Kinect, they're saying that a different department within Xbox handles the Kinect hardware and software.
7136582	7140627	The focus was more on developing and networking both consoles with Kinect.
7141227	7142970	More of an afterthought at that point.
7142990	7146154	It says, considering dealing with it is less an issue than hardware changes.
7146654	7148956	The main console, Kinect, isn't the primary focus.
7149437	7164910	However, it says development kits require several pieces of hardware combined, all the potential hardware, which may or may not be required to work with each other, which also includes the potential for any devices to require a network connection, which is where that required rumor comes from.
7165610	7170593	So, I'm thinking, I'm just hoping that it's not all online only.
7170613	7176196	This sounds a little bit more Microsoft, because Microsoft's always been about, like, streaming crap to your TV.
7176216	7180258	I mean, they have the whole Windows XP Media Center edition and that kind of shit.
7180838	7186224	So, I could see them wanting to be in your living room and kind of be this focus and stuff.
7186565	7188086	But, I don't know.
7188106	7193913	I'm just hoping that they don't make the mistake of having a console that's going to be a next-gen console that's only online.
7194133	7199039	Because, after all, Microsoft's live service hasn't been working very well the last few days.
7199059	7199599	Yeah, right.
7199860	7201742	So, it's not a good idea to say...
7202042	7203863	Hey, yeah, we're going to be online only.
7204063	7207424	Oh, ignore the fact that you couldn't connect to live the last few days.
7207524	7208765	But hey, yeah.
7208965	7212766	Let me ask this, though, because here we go again reporting on rumors.
7212926	7218909	Why do we keep – I'm not saying us specifically, but I'm just talking like the internet and the whole hype machine.
7219009	7221270	Why do we keep reporting on rumors?
7221730	7224251	Because we don't have anything to go off of from them.
7224712	7233156	All we know is that they're going to have, you know, some sort of, the rumor is that they're going to have some sort of reveal at the end of May.
7233536	7237078	But right now we have no information about it other than what's supposedly leaking out.
7237618	7240840	And I think, you know, mainly discussing this, I'm not saying this is all fact.
7240880	7242240	I'm just saying here's the rumor.
7242421	7242881	Sure, sure.
7243061	7248464	You know, this is a little bit, I hope it's a little bit more on this side than it's always online.
7248904	7251225	You know, there is no other, you know, way about it.
7251385	7255331	Alright, well I want to know how important talking about Xbox rumors are.
7255411	7256393	So you know what it's time for?
7256413	7259036	I think it's time for us to poll the listeners.
7260609	7264871	So we're going to put up a live poll right now at live.vognetwork.com.
7264931	7266692	If you want to vote in the poll, make sure you're logged in.
7266752	7268613	Live.vognetwork.com.
7269073	7272455	How much weight do you give to Xbox rumors?
7273096	7273896	It's Microsoft.
7273936	7274576	It's all true.
7275177	7277518	I think a lot of it is true, but I'm still quite skeptical.
7277998	7281500	I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.
7282060	7286743	Or the internet is full of lies and slander, and I don't believe any of it.
7287643	7288084	Vote now!
7288204	7291048	Live.VogNetwork.com in our instant poll.
7293231	7297297	We'll read the results here in a moment and try to get some of the answers as they come in.
7299073	7299653	Oh, Rob.
7300033	7305315	And then one other thing also there, another rumor going along with some of the launch titles.
7305695	7308335	Next Gen Forza game, Rise, remember?
7308595	7314277	A couple weeks ago I've been talking about Rise saying, where the fuck was that Gladiator game that they showed that was supposed to be a Kinect title?
7314977	7317497	So that may be something that's going to be there.
7317657	7322379	And then some sort of, you know, kind of Nintendo Land-esque Kinect game.
7323559	7327720	Although I am seeing a lot of Kinect titles, two of those being Kinect required titles, so...
7330141	7332783	Not interested, but Forza sounds cool.
7333083	7333704	Forza Horizon.
7334244	7335805	Next gen Forza Horizon, I could be down with that.
7336901	7342644	Right now in our instant poll, it's very tilted towards the bullshit side of things.
7343364	7348527	67% of the vote for, I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.
7348907	7350768	21% saying the internet is full of lies and slanders.
7350828	7351668	I don't believe any of it.
7352188	7354890	So only 13% of the vote at this point.
7354930	7357431	I think the math doesn't add up because it just updated.
7357711	7360152	13% of the vote right now only slightly leans true.
7360592	7362593	Zero people saying it's all true.
7363394	7363714	Zero.
7363734	7363814	Zero.
7365572	7366453	Rob, it's on the internet.
7366493	7367173	Of course it's true.
7367573	7368914	Well, some people would think that.
7369435	7369935	You know what?
7370075	7372477	Honestly, I almost lean towards that top option.
7372517	7377020	With Microsoft, there's very little that's fake anymore, it seems.
7377380	7377880	But we'll see.
7378100	7379822	We'll leave that poll up for about another minute.
7379882	7383504	Again, live.vognetwork.com, live on this Sunday evening if you want to vote in that poll.
7383644	7386746	I think we're all still UT has it wrong instead of the internet being 10% lies and 90% porn.
7386766	7387967	I think it's 10% lies, 10% hate, and 80% porn.
7394999	7397041	YYR in our chat room asking, where is the poll?
7397521	7403044	It will show up automatically at live.vognetwork.com if you are logged into the site.
7403425	7403785	Yeah.
7403845	7407127	If you're not logged into the site, it may not show up for you.
7407928	7411050	But this is a feature that's in beta right now, trademark.
7412671	7414072	So you can't talk about it to anybody.
7414232	7417774	Literally, this was not tested.
7418434	7420155	We are testing it as the show goes on.
7420236	7421056	So there you go.
7422117	7422417	All right.
7423254	7426056	Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing, optional in New Leaf
7442290	7448154	He is not there by default, and this is because of QQ Online.
7448675	7451937	Now, okay, tell people about Mr. Resetti, for those that don't know DarkSakura.
7451957	7459742	If you didn't save your game and just turned off your Animal Crossing, you turned off the system, well, you had Animal Crossing loading.
7460303	7467208	When you started your game back up, this mole comes out of the ground and yells at you for ten minutes.
7467228	7467548	Okay?
7468108	7470390	in all capital, huge letters.
7471150	7475773	And from what I understand, because I tried doing it on my Japanese version, he's really freaking rude.
7476493	7478654	And it was just absolutely hilarious.
7478934	7480575	He's like, what did you do in resetting this form?
7480595	7482156	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7482376	7483537	And he freaking chews you out.
7484398	7493563	This mole, bitter, crass, grumpy old mole digs itself out of a hole just to give you shit for not saving your game.
7494448	7496129	This is not popular in our chat.
7496389	7497410	Game Girl says, what?
7497490	7498571	He's the best part of the game.
7498751	7500312	YYR says, it's blasphemy.
7500793	7502954	Game Guru says, Mr. Resetti has been fired.
7503334	7504475	No, he's not fired.
7504515	7505556	Let me clarify here.
7506437	7513902	In a column called Iwata Asks, Resetti's status was updated, apparently out of guilt.
7514282	7520407	The developers made him optional in Animal Crossing New Leaf because apparently he brought some players to tears.
7521207	7521547	Good!
7522368	7523189	Save your game!
7524751	7529916	They also changed the goal of the game from paying off Tom Nook to improving the town as the mayor.
7529996	7532318	So Tom Nook is no longer your pimp.
7533079	7536102	YYR says Mr. Resetti is a critical feature of Animal Crossing.
7537143	7538665	It is required for the game to work properly.
7538705	7542769	He handles many of the game's calculations, so it's technically impossible to run Animal Crossing without it.
7543539	7568120	Strudels89 says he was a dick lol Loki's a dick but we all love him we keep him around he's a vital part of this show we couldn't do calculations without him you know what we used to do all the time fucking time travel fuck that Rosetti I'm time traveling like fucking Marty McFly I would travel to my birthday every year just to get more shit
7568300	7581906	Now in an article on Destructoid, I really like this point about it, but in an article published on Destructoid, they talked about how it was one of the more creative fourth wall breaking moments in gaming history along with Psycho Mantis reading your save files on the PlayStation card.
7581946	7584027	I see you like Final Fantasy.
7584887	7586528	Dan and I had Sweet Coden Sweet Coden
7609485	7610286	But what do you guys think?
7610727	7612589	Is it a great fourth wall breaking?
7612649	7614552	I think more games should break the fourth wall, to be honest.
7614572	7615272	I think so, too.
7615333	7618717	But it was pretty cool watching the controller move on the floor with Psycho Mantis.
7620800	7621080	All right.
7621100	7624064	That's going to bring our poll to an end at live.vognetwork.com.
7624104	7626407	So from the last story, here it is, the results.
7626787	7630012	How much weight do you give to Xbox rumors?
7630413	7635380	62% of the vote saying, I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits, but once in a while the truth leaks.
7635661	7639487	Hey, finally a vote, 3% of the vote for, it's Microsoft, it's all true.
7641102	7643043	Oh, poor naive child.
7643063	7644784	Somebody voted for it.
7644804	7647105	12%, I think a lot of it is true, but I'm still quite skeptical.
7647125	7649966	22%, the internet is full of lies and slanders.
7650406	7651206	I don't believe any of it.
7651366	7653227	Haseo Sumirogawa says a good point.
7653367	7654688	Deadpool will, I'm excited.
7655048	7656969	But Deadpool, you expected of Deadpool.
7656989	7659210	You didn't quite expect that in Animal Crossing.
7659650	7662711	To have a character come out of the ground and yell at you for 10 minutes.
7663291	7668353	Whereas, I mean, didn't you ever read Deadpool in comics?
7668473	7669554	It's supposed to happen, hi.
7670216	7671357	Video Game Match Game Video Game Match Game
7696747	7702709	What were the potato chips that Jamie got excited about when they were set on the table earlier in the evening?
7702749	7704329	This is test your memory earlier in the show.
7704729	7707490	First person to remember and shout it out in chat will get to play.
7708270	7712751	And we'll take the first caller right now on the Skype line.
7712771	7716352	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7716392	7723434	The first person to get through will get to play a video game match game against our chat room listener.
7723994	7727635	who answers first, which is Mako-chan or Joby Deya got the right answer.
7727715	7728175	There it is.
7728656	7729276	Mako-chan.
7729336	7733237	All right, so let me open up a chat window with Mako-chan.
7733737	7735398	Mako-chan from Makoto.
7735878	7736318	Oh, my bad.
7736838	7737399	Yeah, I'm drunk.
7737439	7740540	Well, I keep thinking of the Mako from Mass Effect.
7740560	7741080	You know what?
7741180	7746842	I kept calling it Mako because I took too much Japanese.
7747742	7756288	And the answer was Chicken and Waffles And Jason XV after that, Codeman, Tim TRP, got it What was in the cheese bread?
7756328	7764073	I just said the cheese bread was delicious Alright, let's see who Mako-chan is going to be competing against tonight Let's go to the Skype line right now Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7764594	7766215	Oh my god, I got in You got in?
7766235	7766295	OMG!
7766335	7766875	Who is this?
7769967	7770567	Raven's Dolphin
7792310	7793990	I totally love your icon, by the way.
7794050	7794611	It's gorgeous.
7794671	7796031	Thank you so much.
7796091	7798732	Flattery will get you everywhere, but it won't win you the match game.
7798932	7800492	You can come over and have murder brownies.
7801652	7802533	Would you like a murder brownie?
7803833	7805533	Yes, just send it over the internet, please.
7805633	7808454	I know you have to get the match game, but I have to know one question.
7808614	7809394	Alright, fair enough.
7811055	7813295	So you've been doing this show for 11 years.
7814516	7818877	Was there a time that you said, I don't know if I can go on?
7819457	7819677	Yes.
7821440	7823462	All right.
7823522	7827927	That was episode two.
7828127	7828407	Yes.
7828748	7834714	If I followed through every time I threatened to quit the show, there would have been about 20 Orange Lounge radios by now.
7834814	7838678	But you find your motivation and you keep going.
7838758	7841461	And a lot of the drama tends to work itself out.
7841561	7842882	And drama is drama.
7843323	7843963	And drama...
7844784	7847705	Drama was something I thrived a lot more on when I was in my 20s.
7848046	7853068	And now that I'm in my 30s, it's like, I don't know what else I'd have if I didn't have OLR.
7853868	7858490	The sad reality is, the sad reality is this show will end someday.
7858870	7859571	I mean, it has to.
7860071	7860911	Everything comes to an end.
7861271	7864153	But I like to think it's going to end because, you know...
7864973	7865474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7884173	7887755	or that we all sit down and we agree, you know what?
7887995	7889876	We don't have the passion for this we once did.
7890196	7899520	And I mentioned on a previous episode, I sometimes worry about where the gaming industry is going when we talk about all this always online and the management thinking they know what's best for gamers.
7899820	7902622	I sometimes sit here and wonder, am I going to be a video game fan?
7903322	7904163	Super Orange on Radio 2DX
7924355	7947226	which Loki still needs to update the freaking thing no it's on a different PSP website oh really yeah it was on like this called like PSP Drive and it was formatted for PSP and you were on there and I remember downloading it this was before the other sites and all that stuff this was before Black Wolf and A1 and I'm like oh Orange Lines Radio I'll download this oh VGN I'll download this and then yeah
7947458	7954400	Yeah, I have to admit, Loki got on that PSP bandwagon really early, and a lot of the PSP community really supported that older website.
7954740	7959301	We were on whatever the AOL blog was for PSP before they all merged into Joystick.
7959321	7961982	We were featured on there once, and that was really cool.
7962062	7970984	So as much as we joke about the PSP and that website and how out of date it is, that community really embraced Loki's little project, so we really appreciate that.
7971624	7974045	Yep, now it's Stitcher and iTunes.
7974245	7976026	Yeah, it's all about Stitcher and iTunes.
7976066	7984410	Especially Stitcher, I think, is really the wave of the future, especially as iTunes kind of continues to, you know, shove podcasting under the table.
7984450	7986171	But that's for another episode.
7986231	7987071	I do have to share this.
7987091	7990153	Frisbee says, when that happens, convert OLR to food in Disneyland talk.
7990873	7993434	And so John's like, episode 501, dull whips.
7995655	7998616	Ragenator in chat says, I've been a fan of gaming for 32 years.
7998656	8000497	I don't see myself losing my gaming passion.
8001077	8003318	You know, and I think ultimately I tend to agree.
8003499	8009961	I may get really pissed off at some of the decisions that happen in the gaming industry, but at the end of the day, I could always come on here and talk about Commodore 64.
8012943	8013083	Right.
8013163	8013803	I keep going.
8013903	8014503	You keep going.
8014623	8015784	You ready to play match game?
8015984	8016304	Of course.
8016544	8019125	All right, let's get to the match game.
8020246	8020686	All right.
8020806	8022527	Do you know how the match game works, Raven's Dolphin?
8022547	8022767	No.
8023382	8024647	Oh my god, do I know.
8024808	8028642	I mean, too bad we don't even have Charles Nelson Reilly or that guy from...
8030185	8031166	from Family Feud.
8031186	8033187	Well, you've got me, Richard Dawson.
8033227	8033868	You've got me.
8034188	8039532	And you've got on the panel tonight, you've got Techmaster Loki is here joining us on the panel tonight.
8039572	8039972	Hello.
8040233	8041433	And DarkSakura is here.
8041734	8041974	Hi.
8042354	8043135	And I'm here.
8043575	8044856	And Chef Becky is here.
8044976	8049540	Iron Chef Becky is here with her murder brownies to play with us.
8049560	8050040	Hello.
8050260	8051681	And Becky, you're going to play with us too, right?
8052262	8052522	Sure.
8052542	8053122	Sure, why not?
8053903	8057926	And then also joining us in studio tonight, say hello to... Hello, Mother Dollars.
8060652	8061053	Wow.

8323327	8325168	Question number two.
8326889	8335312	Question number two is, the cast of Orange Lounge Radio was really appreciative that Becky baked brownies for their 500th episode.
8337250	8341811	You know what would top this for our 666th show though, said Rob?
8342731	8346652	Loki piped up and said, yeah, you should cook the blank.
8348752	8349132	Ding.
8350972	8353573	Ding, I guess.
8353813	8355173	Becky baked brownies.

8368782	8369123	Ding.
8369443	8370124	Loki said ding.
8370164	8370865	DarkSakura, ding.

8377834	8378274	I do.
8378494	8378855	All right.
8378975	8379396	Here we go.
8379496	8383721	Loki piped up and said, yeah, you should cook the... Ferret.
8383941	8385183	Cook the ferret.
8386264	8391406	and Mako Chan in chat said, you should cook the ferret.
8393026	8393706	Oh, boy.
8393806	8394266	All right.
8394326	8396167	Well, let's see what happens.
8396887	8400608	It's going to be a tie either way, but let's see how many points this may or may not earn them.
8400948	8402149	Loki, yeah.
8402449	8403049	What did you say?
8403149	8405970	Yeah, she should cook the... Bacon El Diablo.
8406670	8410291	Bacon El Diablo.
8410351	8412451	Great answer, but not a match.
8413492	8413912	All right.
8414692	8415692	DarkSakura.
8415852	8417613	I did go for obvious and say The Ferret.
8417673	8418313	The Ferret.
8418733	8419493	Oh, my God.
8420193	8423234	It's a score on the match game leaderboard.
8423994	8424734	One to one.
8425635	8426615	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
8426655	8429055	This is more points than people usually get during this.
8429255	8429636	All right.
8429756	8430196	Excellent.
8430936	8431176	Alan.
8433290	8438174	She should cook the... I think this still counts, but my answer was the bungee ferret.
8438755	8440056	The bungee ferret.
8440196	8441217	Let's go to the judges.
8441517	8442938	All right, the judges will allow it.
8442998	8445040	Two to two for the ferret.
8445140	8446921	All right, and lastly, my answer.
8448102	8452766	She should cook the... Cylon-occupied Caprica cake.
8454327	8456969	The Cylon-occupied Caprica cake.
8457269	8458010	Old, old joke.
8458370	8459551	All right, there it is.
8460912	8461533	2-2 though!
8462935	8465338	That could be the highest score ever in the history of video game action.
8465358	8467881	I think our highest score was 3, to be honest.
8467982	8468302	Was it?
8468622	8469063	I think it was 3.
8469604	8471546	There is still two questions to go.
8471626	8472087	Here we go.
8472147	8473589	There are two questions.
8473629	8474690	There are two questions.
8474710	8475892	Watch your grammar, drunkie.
8477819	8478219	Shut up.
8478820	8479540	All right, here we go.
8480261	8481422	Oh, it's a question about Jamie.
8481462	8481882	Here we go.
8482723	8483724	You ready, Raven's Dolphin?
8483764	8484244	You ready for it?
8484304	8484704	I'm ready.
8484864	8485365	I'm ready.
8486185	8493010	Jamie decided to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give up coffee forever.
8493110	8493571	Lies!
8494755	8495435	This is make-believe.
8495455	8496016	I know.
8496536	8500138	Jamie decided to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give up coffee forever.
8500598	8511084	She came to episode 501 and in a coffee-deprived rage, instantly screamed into the mic, first one to mention blank dies.
8521644	8546654	she came to episode 501 and in a coffee deprived rage instantly screamed into the mic first one to mention blank dies I didn't think of an answer for this one and you wrote it I know right first one to mention ding
8549490	8551912	All right, here we go.
8552813	8553633	Raven, you got an answer?
8554274	8554834	I do.
8554954	8555735	All right, here we go.
8556456	8558197	She gave up coffee on episode 500.
8558518	8563442	She came to episode 501 and in a coffee-depraved rage, instantly screamed into the mic.
8563522	8564783	First one to mention?
8566024	8567205	Double Shot Mochaccino.
8567485	8569787	Double Shot Mochaccino dies.
8570007	8570928	That sounds amazing.
8570988	8571449	I want one.
8572569	8577393	Mako Chan in our chat room says, first one to mention, Mail Shep dies!
8578388	8579048	DarkSakura, BroShep
8605578	8607139	Bro Shep, really?
8608060	8610421	Oh my god, alright, I think we're going to count it.
8610441	8611762	I honestly couldn't think of anything else.
8611962	8614384	MakoCham pulls ahead 3-2.
8615104	8617806	Alright, Alan, first one to mention?
8618809	8619750	Mocha Pinkberry.
8620571	8621752	Mocha Pinkberry.
8621812	8623454	That was... Why does this not exist?
8623534	8628519	That was really close to what Raven said, but I don't think it's close enough, unfortunately.
8628539	8629400	Why does this not exist?
8629961	8630701	I don't know.
8630902	8632183	You should write Pinkberry.
8633104	8633404	All right.
8633765	8635767	And my answer was, first one to mention...
8639537	8642980	First one to mention Final Fantasy XI dies.
8644402	8644802	All right.
8645082	8645623	Not a match.
8646103	8647344	But one more question.
8647504	8648305	One more question.
8648505	8649066	So close.
8649246	8649666	So close.
8649686	8650827	Ravenstolphin, you can do it.
8651388	8652969	I have faith in you.
8653110	8654010	I have faith in you.
8654771	8655111	All right.
8655151	8656132	But what about the chatter?
8656933	8657173	All right.
8657213	8657674	Here we go.
8659696	8660977	Question number four.
8661057	8661758	The last one.
8661818	8663219	Ravenstolphin, your only hope.
8664917	8690737	Loki was very happy with the poster that Codeman drew to celebrate episode 500 of the show upon careful examination of the poster though he exclaimed Rob I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of blank Rob I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of blank
8694673	8695013	Ding.
8695413	8695773	Ding.
8695833	8696134	Ding.
8696574	8698574	Ooh, that was really quick on all the hosts.
8699015	8706837	I'm still waiting on Mako-chan to ping in there in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com where some people are going to feed the answers right now.
8707257	8715760	Loki, very happy with the poster the codeman drew, but on careful examination of the poster, exclaimed, Rob, I'm surprised he didn't just draw you as a fan of blank.
8716841	8718421	All right, Mako-chan's got an answer.
8718461	8719622	Raven's Dolphin you about good to go?
8720558	8721660	Yeah, I got one.
8721900	8722881	Alright, then here we go.
8723462	8728509	Rob, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of...
8729500	8730700	DDDR 4th Mix.
8730920	8732821	DDDR 4th Mix!
8732961	8733781	Good answer.
8734201	8735601	I was a fan of DDDR 4th.
8736021	8739082	4th Plus, to be specific, but we'd let that slide.
8739842	8746744	Mako Chan in our chatroom says, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of Rocky Horror.
8747944	8749264	Okay, good answer.
8749744	8751665	Alright, let's go around and see if there's a match.
8752265	8752605	Loki!
8753624	8756526	Surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of?
8756706	8757627	Nino Cooney's ending.
8758087	8759668	Nino Cooney's ending!
8760029	8760749	Wait a minute.
8762911	8763331	Alright.
8764291	8765672	Not a match, I'm sorry to say.
8766473	8770836	DarkSakura, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of?
8771036	8773138	Parapara Paradise Complete in Kogal outfit.
8774719	8774979	What?
8776202	8777262	You'd be such a cute getter.
8777282	8784764	You almost named the right Bomani game to match with Raven's Dolphin, but unfortunately, nope, not going to do it.
8784944	8787365	And I'll tell you what came with this, is watching you play the damn ABBA game.
8790266	8790626	All right.
8791226	8796708	I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan, Alan, and not as a fan of Miss Nude World 96.
8798041	8799162	Miss Nude World 96.
8799282	8801644	Damn it, I should have said that.
8802425	8803746	Oh, classic.
8803946	8804967	Classic answer.
8806028	8811733	Rob, I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of... Hey, I can be self-deprecating here.
8812093	8816437	My answer was, not as a fan of... Surprise butt sex!
8819073	8820274	Good night, ladies and gentlemen!
8844824	8845104	I know.
8845284	8846205	But thank you for playing.
8846505	8847165	You lose.
8847446	8848366	Good day, sir.

8851328	8852709	Thank you for playing Raven's Dolphin.
8852749	8853990	Enjoy your nothing.
8860874	8862796	Rob, you need to drink more often.
8864318	8864799	That's it.
8864899	8868724	You have a requisite two double shots.
8868924	8875793	I am actually under straight orders from my doctor not to drink, and I'm being a very naughty boy tonight, but what can you do?
8875853	8876934	Should we get out the paddle?
8878115	8879177	No, I did a second shot.
8881836	8883937	And they're double shots, but hey, who cares?
8885278	8886739	You only live once, right, Rob?
8886759	8887359	That's right.
8887459	8890080	All right, thank you for playing along with Match Game tonight, everybody.
8890120	8890821	We hope you had fun.
8891521	8891841	All right.
8893182	8895923	Oh, Mako-chan, what do we give Mako-chan for winning tonight?
8896704	8897164	My love.
8897824	8907029	Mako-chan, if you have something you want to plug, I have a feeling I know what it might be, but send me a private message and you can get a free plug for your Twitter, for your podcast, whatever you want.
8907089	8907829	But not a butt plug.
8908670	8909510	No, definitely not that.
8910290	8911951	All right, let's see.
8912451	8913792	Moving on, it's time for the mailbag.
8914313	8915253	Ah, crap.
8916114	8923819	DarkSakura is always excited to get into the mailbag and read some emails that you guys send to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8924319	8927982	So, DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind jumping into the email bag there.
8928322	8931684	We did get a lot of spam that arrived after the real email.
8931804	8932385	Oh, hooray.
8932645	8933085	I deleted it.
8933185	8935927	Well, I didn't delete it, but we need to delete a lot of old email.
8936387	8936627	Okay.
8937853	8938314	Are we ready?
8938575	8939136	Shall I do this?
8939297	8939638	Yep, yep.
8940339	8941141	Hey, OLR.
8941703	8945933	Just thought I'd write in and respond to that email about the graphic violence in Bioshock Infinite.
8946154	8946374	Ooh.
8947975	8952118	Not spoiling any major plot points here, but Booker's history is full of violence.
8952518	8958302	It's actually a major part of his character that he has done many terrible things in the past and has a very violent history.
8958942	8965127	Whenever you perform one of those brutal finishing moves with your skyhook, Elizabeth will always audibly shudder at the act.
8965687	8972011	As you get deeper in the game, Elizabeth questions the need for so much violence from both sides of the conflict and wonders if it's really helping anybody.
8972672	8977535	In that way, I think it's the approach to graphic violence is done in a way that serves the story and the characters.
8978415	9004151	now there is some gratuitous stuff in there but I'm a little tired of the comparisons to Call of Duty or that these were changes that made to these changes were made to appeal to that audience I played a couple of Call of Duty games and the violence though not the plot always seemed to ride closer to the side of realistic and not hyper real as it is in the Bioshock games including Infinite where you can electrocute someone to stun them then blast their entire head off dude I need to play that
9004963	9007086	You can do that in Bioshock Infinite, too.
9007126	9011551	That's what he's talking about, Bioshock Infinite?
9011591	9013633	Yes, it's awesome.
9013673	9013994	Okay.
9014574	9021383	In the Call of Duty games I played, I don't remember any heads popping off like corks, but I did only play single player mode, so who knows?
9021923	9035011	My point is Bioshock games have always been violent and they've always been first person shooters so I don't think the game had to compromise anything for sales or to appeal to a certain crowd and in fact would only have been compromising if it toned itself down.
9035791	9037232	That was all that was on my mind.
9037312	9043016	Congrats on an amazing 500 episodes even if you guys don't think it's such a big deal anymore.
9043536	9045357	It actually really is.
9045838	9048599	I'm just glad I've been listening for the last 200 or so.
9049019	9049820	That's from Flaco Jones.
9050834	9054899	We don't care if you've been listening since episode one or if this is your very first episode.
9054980	9057383	We say welcome aboard and thanks for being a part of the family.
9057843	9059145	Yeah, you're totally awesome.
9063334	9063735	Moving on.
9063995	9064816	Mm-hmm.
9064876	9065476	Hi, guys.
9065557	9068460	First and foremost, congratulations on your 500th episode.
9068940	9071963	I think it's amazing that you've been going for over 10 years.
9072044	9077549	You have an unshakable love of video games and a cast iron army of dedicated fans, too.
9077630	9078971	Dude, you guys are made of cast iron?
9079011	9079552	I didn't know that.
9080893	9081133	Okay.
9082074	9082835	So here's something.
9082855	9083716	I can fry in you.
9084617	9085938	Will you fry us an egg?
9087359	9089700	I bet you get really hot on warm days.
9090460	9091901	So here's something that may interest you.
9092301	9095523	Do you remember me talking about Project Possum a while ago?
9096264	9102888	When the Inside Xbox UK team were given the sack, they went off on Kickstarter to start their own show about video games.
9103308	9106550	Well, they finished the pilot and it's not what you'd call your average video game show.
9107550	9110872	It's called Thank You For Playing and you can find it at thankyouforplaying.com.
9111093	9112734	There are dashes in between each word.
9113614	9122900	It's structured much like a game, letting you view the features in order that you want and has unlockables in the form of extra goodies and editorials, expanding on the themes touched in the videos.
9123841	9126803	The plot's all about multiplayer and I really recommend you take a look.
9126903	9130405	I thought it was really interesting and hope to see a lot more from them soon.
9131205	9136609	Just like I hope to keep hearing from you guys for many years to come, take care and once again, congratulations, Picaruno.
9138325	9139786	Thank you for your support.
9141308	9143610	And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
9145231	9146592	I'm sorry, that's my favorite line from Grease.
9147233	9147433	Okay.
9147773	9150355	This is an OLR PSA from Catastrophic Magi.
9151456	9153778	Oh, it's my friend Magi who I chat with every day on Steam.
9154499	9154979	Come on, guys.
9154999	9159123	I think after 500 episodes, we can give the whole Loki in a tingle costume thing a rest.
9160364	9161125	He might like that.
9162166	9165909	Instead, for the next 500, we need to get Loki in a kitty costume.
9169196	9172122	And you have to say Meowth, that's right!
9172342	9174787	No, no, it has to be a kitty in costume.
9176255	9177136	I don't think he'd do that.
9177176	9178077	That's worse than Dingle.
9178537	9180819	He sent an image to you, but it didn't embed.
9181519	9181899	P.S.
9182700	9185002	I would have left an audio message, but Rob is a meanie.
9185562	9190106	Even if I stayed up late enough, I wouldn't be able to Skype after the disaster that was last time.
9190546	9192868	So I guess you don't get any congratulations from Moggy.
9195390	9197091	Send an MP3.
9197691	9198252	Send an MP3.
9198272	9200614	Dude, you talk to me on Steam.
9200654	9202555	Just attach me a file or something.
9205945	9212252	Hello is the one and only often imitated never duplicated DDR dollar bill I just wanted to write and congratulate you guys on your 500th episode
9227208	9227528	Well, thank you.
9249463	9250744	Not everyone can podcast.
9250864	9257530	True, we all wish to be heard, but it takes something special to keep going for a long time and not just make it into a small hobby that you grow out of.
9257630	9266277	It's a labor of love, one that the OL Army slash family have grown to be a part of, whether they hang around, come back once in a while when they can, or just move on.
9267097	9271322	If I could, I'd just like to take a moment to say why I do recommend your show to other listeners.
9272183	9272843	One, the host.
9273124	9273624	Why, thank you.
9274345	9281472	Every show you have three amazing, entertaining, intelligent, yet human hosts who talk about gaming that can appeal to the hardcore fans as well as the casuals.
9281572	9283194	Just to let you know, I'm really from another planet.
9284535	9284896	Once a month.
9287037	9304962	they are people who actually do game as part of their lives not game because it's their job to they talk about gaming like fans who talk about sports or comics or sci-fi with that casual yet knowledgeable flair and when they speak about gaming news they do it on a dual level of professionalism that gives a great analysis and yet keeps it simple and fun
9306341	9308122	Can I say something really quick about the sponsor thing?
9308623	9311904	Because we have a lot of friend podcasters that do do the sponsor thing.
9311944	9315566	And we've even, you know, we have had donations before in the past and so forth.
9315586	9323149	And I just want to say, like, there's nothing wrong with podcasters who want to get sponsors because contrary to popular belief, this shit ain't free for us to do.
9323710	9325450	It is costing us money to do.
9325570	9327411	But that's, you know, it's okay.
9327531	9329732	We pay the money because it's our hobby.
9329853	9330493	It's like, you know...
9331113	9336279	It's like the tax you pay to your club, your dues or whatever.
9337640	9338662	For us, that's fine.
9339122	9347672	And I have no problem with people that want to get sponsors to offset the cost of hosting, offset the cost of producing the show and so forth.
9348092	9352337	But I do start to get into a problem when – and I can think of particular –
9352977	9381979	individual podcast things that have gone up saying we need $30,000 to do this podcast this one podcast because we're going to rent a studio and we have to travel to conventions and this and this and this and I'm sorry but if they can get it and the listeners support them enough that's great I guess but I'm just kind of like you ain't fooling anybody I can tell you how much it costs to do a podcast and it's not as much as you're telling people it is
9383466	9386648	I mean, we've had generous donations in the past.
9386728	9389410	I mean, like what Kristen did.
9389950	9392432	I mean, we would not have new equipment if not for her.
9392912	9399697	But I just want to be clear because I have several peer podcasters that do raise money through sponsors and so forth.
9399757	9402139	We've got the ads on the site.
9402239	9412905	We have been super effing lucky that our website has been donated very generously for many years or else we would probably have to turn to that too because that could get very expensive.
9414046	9418048	I just want to clear the air and make sure that's understood.
9419392	9432857	so and I've sat up for I mean just on my own hours working on graphics and stuff for not just for Orange Niles but for VOG in general you know we've all put a lot of time and effort into this
9433530	9434791	And we're not doing ads for the man grate.
9454019	9454240	Yeah.
9454921	9455362	I'm sorry.
9455702	9461152	I have, you know, my overwhelming love for Greg Proops.
9461513	9461873	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9461893	9463777	But I do laugh every time he does the ad for The Man Great.
9463997	9465380	Anyhow, I apologize to interrupt the email.
9466533	9466913	2.
9466573	9466913	The show.
9467213	9472036	This show, while keeping the basic format, always finds a way to grow and yet never loses its focus.
9472436	9484103	Yes, they go off on tangents such as Pinkberry, trips to Disneyland, and other aspects of their daily lives, but I find that to be the greatest asset because you, the listener, participate in the show in any fashion.
9484584	9487746	It's so laid back and friendly that you do not feel they are corporate shills.
9488386	9512357	if you are right or wrong you can discuss this openly and even when it gets heated it's still more personal than some shows where the sense of keeping it professional loses that intimacy that's required for some difficult and passionate topics also each segment does include something for the listener whether it's mailbag to submit your letters and I actually do enjoy reading the email just throw on a hissy fit just for fun skyplanes to call in even when
9513780	9539783	even if just wish to get on and say what's up the classic game of the week my favorite part why thank you we used to do the website of the week there's website of the week and the advice DarkSakura's advice column yeah I could still give advice like I don't know pay your hose or you might get cut there's DarkSakura's advice
9541127	9543329	Was it never bet with a Sicilian when death is on the line?
9544931	9545712	Finish the email.
9545872	9546533	Okay.
9547674	9548795	Google question of the week.
9549095	9554521	It's always welcoming listener input, which leads into... The audience.
9555322	9555943	That was number three.
9556463	9557704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9578502	9581344	I'm sorry if this went on a bit more, but it was just something to note.
9581604	9583085	Here's to another 500 episodes.
9583185	9585626	I wonder how the future of gaming would look in another 11 years.
9585686	9586567	Tune in and find out.
9586947	9587207	Wink.
9588608	9589609	Oh, that was sweet.
9589629	9590529	That was a very nice email.
9590549	9592270	I'm going to do a quick sweep.
9592891	9593311	That was it.
9593371	9593751	I agree.
9593791	9595952	The audience is the best part.
9597153	9597794	We love you guys.
9598774	9599274	For dinner.
9599735	9600715	Speaking of which.
9601216	9601876	No, seriously.
9602016	9605258	And BlackWolfInChat actually follows up with that.
9605398	9606899	I don't think we have anybody banned.
9608488	9611092	I've smacked a few people around with a giant trout.
9628134	9634157	Anyhow, speaking of audience, Mako-chan has her plug ready to go that she won for Match Game.
9634437	9635857	Do I even have to mention this?
9636198	9637418	I somehow knew it would be this.
9637978	9640939	Anime Jam Session on Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
9641600	9642220	9.30 p.m.
9642300	9643621	Eastern is when the pre-show starts.
9643861	9646302	At 9.15, excuse me, is the pre-show at 9.15.
9646342	9647322	9.30 is the show.
9648142	9650663	Mako-chan gets to choose the pre-show music this week.
9650884	9651384	Oh, shit.
9651924	9652784	And happy 500th.
9653164	9654265	Yes, listen to Anime Jam Session.
9654305	9654745	It's a good time.
9655265	9656026	Totally a good time.
9657441	9662383	Go back and watch some classic anime, dude.
9662403	9662903	Get to the roots of it.
9662964	9664304	Go watch some Yamato or some Gatchaman.
9687977	9714364	Go 80s style and watch Bubblegum Crisis Let's do the FUs of the Week And Minecraft Server FUs of the Week time Yeah, we did ban a song on the show
9714946	9716247	DarkSakura, and we banned a website.
9716267	9717128	We banned solitary.
9717428	9718909	DarkSakura, your FU, please.
9719490	9726356	My FU goes to the hobag who was driving behind me in the Mercedes trying to do her makeup while tailgating me.
9728277	9735643	It would have been incredibly hilarious if I had brake-checked you and you completely ruined the back end of my car so that I get a new car and you have to pay for it.
9736284	9736724	Just saying.
9738165	9741228	Don't do your makeup while you drive and get off your damn phone and pull up your pants.
9743508	9744949	Loki, any FUs?
9745390	9772271	I guess an FU to the driver that I encountered last week when I was leaving the show about to enter onto the freeway when I had a guy pass me on the right in the actually off the road pass me on the right and then cut across into the next lane to not go on the freeway I don't even know why he was doing that it's just stupid, he could have just gone to the left and changed lanes but no, he had to pass me at the same time too for no reason
9772731	9774092	And then, what else?
9774293	9783581	Oh, and to my co-workers for not wanting to play games during lunch because they will flake on me unless we get all four people to play, including myself.
9783721	9788005	And a lot of times we can't do that because my boss will be gone or something.
9788705	9791928	They don't want to play games with just me because I kick their ass.
9793069	9794050	But you're so humble about it.
9794110	9795331	So FU to being good?
9795952	9797994	Yeah, I'm just too good for them, unfortunately.
9799745	9801046	Um, my F.U.
9801066	9804588	of the week goes to car repairs and the bills that go with them.
9805089	9806290	Oh my god, robbery!
9807670	9808331	So much money.
9808931	9810292	And everything breaks at once.
9810793	9811453	Not okay.
9813134	9813915	We all gave F.U.
9813935	9814995	to traffic related things.
9815075	9816917	How appropriate for our 500th episode.
9817097	9819378	We always freaking complain about drivers.
9820359	9820799	The hell.
9821119	9822220	Becky, you wanna throw out an F.U.
9822240	9823421	to cars too while you're at it?
9825122	9825883	You can throw out an F.U.
9825903	9826623	to Power Rangers.
9826643	9827884	Okay.
9829585	9831626	Shane might take issue to this F.U.
9832047	9848037	to Power Rangers Megaforce which my son wants to watch constantly and my brains are dribbling out my ears it is horrifying the acting makes me want to strangle my own brain by the way Megaforce is getting a brand new 3DS game coming this year
9849708	9852029	Aw, Shane will be offended by that, and that makes me happy.
9853749	9857091	I do still want to watch the Japanese version because I do like the Sentai series.
9860352	9862492	Shane in chat is like, why F you to Power Rangers?
9862852	9864073	Because she's a mom.
9865153	9867776	And little boys watch Power Rangers, Shane.
9867796	9868336	Not 30 year olds.
9868356	9870398	But Shane said that Megaforce is pretty bad.
9870999	9874462	Oh god, I wish I was still a 30 year old.
9875423	9881629	So if the Power Rangers fan of chat is saying it's bad, then you are fully justified.
9882131	9883613	All right.
9883873	9891220	All kidding aside, we got a couple more stories for you guys quickly, and then we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
9891240	9893823	There might be a few of you that want to call in tonight, so we'll get to that shortly.
9893863	9894864	But first, a couple quick stories.
9894924	9895124	Loki?
9895625	9895945	All right.
9896005	9904934	So Nintendo totally figuring out ways to revitalize the Wii U. Not sure if this is going to be one of those ways, but they have a new patent.
9905715	9911217	A patent that allows them to use the Wii Remote to remotely control mobile devices.
9912318	9913098	Like a robot.
9913859	9914979	That's what they have in the picture.
9915039	9918381	They have a robot with a Wii Remote in it.
9919441	9920161	Rob 2.0?
9921462	9924323	Or as the joke I made on Facebook, Rob you?
9926964	9927524	And it will!
9929601	9931282	What the hell would a Rob 2.0 do?
9931322	9934463	The first Rob was a really niche, stupid thing.
9934483	9936324	It just played Gyromite, right?
9936344	9936984	There was one other.
9937164	9937584	Stack'em?
9937764	9938244	Stack'em.
9938364	9938685	Yeah.
9939405	9947228	It would run up to people that are playing the Wii games, not standing up, because you're supposed to be active, and punch you in the balls.
9947288	9948028	That's what it would do.
9948788	9949549	Get off your couch.
9950069	9950409	Boom!
9950429	9950529	Boom!
9953450	9953911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9970749	9974230	Swapnote has a new version that's available now.
9974310	9976831	You can go get that right there in the little e-shop.
9977191	9981132	Get the free update, and there's a note that you should have got reminding you of that.
9981392	9984973	I've added some new OLR listeners recently, and I gotta say, it's like a Swapnote resurgence.
9985453	9987094	My little blue light is on almost every day.
9987134	9987474	It's great.
9988214	9995016	Some of the new features, you can now use a different color on each page of a message, so you don't just have to use black anymore.
9996056	10022212	you can do photos and audio while you write you don't have to import them from the SD card you can filter notes by who sent them if you want to find a note from somebody you can delete multiple notes at once you can see how many replies a note has received and you can slide the circle pad left to slow down writing and drawing animations from notes or use circle pad right to speed it up so it's like a speed up slow down
10023519	10024779	So very cool.
10024859	10031081	So basically trying to modernize Swapnote a little bit with some functionality that you kind of go, wow, that wasn't there before?
10032201	10032421	Nope.
10032841	10033521	But it's there now.
10034942	10035402	All right.
10035462	10038402	That brings us to the Skype line.
10038422	10039443	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10039523	10041283	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10041323	10049425	If you want to give us a call on this, our 500th episode to talk about whatever, we will take a few calls until we decide it's time to end the show or the calls stop coming in.
10049445	10050605	Before we run out of brownies.
10051229	10052329	This is Code Man
10082019	10084941	We are loving these posters you made, just so you know.
10085541	10087363	Well, no problem, man.
10087483	10091106	I hope I captured Orange Lounge Radio as much as I could.
10091646	10091906	Yeah.
10093187	10095929	I have to ask, is the little kitten on the bottom, is that Midna?
10097330	10099152	It could be Midna, or it could be Shermie.
10100433	10101334	I wanted to kind of...
10102344	10104866	I was gonna say, because it looks kind of like Midna.
10124861	10127442	Do you have a JPEG that you can forward me of this?
10127682	10130603	Well, I think DarkSakura, do we talk about the album art thing?
10131003	10131203	Yeah.
10131404	10131984	Is that going to happen?
10132484	10132664	Yes.
10133304	10135065	Awesome!
10135105	10139627	Good, the listeners can know what we're talking about because it's going to be the new album art to the show and it's fantastic.
10140207	10143208	And I thank you for, I got your message from Dropbox.
10143288	10143668	Thank you.
10143768	10145269	I will be printing out a copy for my wall.
10145870	10155046	Yes, and you can actually, if Loki wants a JPEG, you can probably just switch that over to a JPEG and then just send it to him.
10155246	10156869	Is it like just the full 300 DPI PSD?
10159031	10161012	Yeah, it's a PDF.
10161412	10162212	It's 18 by 24.
10162912	10166173	You can open it up in Illustrator because I did it all in Illustrator.
10167714	10170375	And you should be able to just export it as a JPEG.
10172175	10173115	All right, you nerds.
10173155	10174416	I want to talk about video games.
10175016	10176737	I'm actually going to resize it for the frame I have.
10177117	10177397	All right.
10178237	10181238	Well, Codeman, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?
10181741	10185923	I wanted to just call in and congratulate you guys on 500 shows, basically.
10186664	10196429	I started listening kind of at the end of my high school, my senior year of high school, all the way through college up until now.
10196669	10198150	Christ, how old are you now?
10199051	10202273	I am 27, I'll be 28 in September.
10202493	10204914	Oh my god!
10204934	10210257	You realize I'm going to be 37 on next Friday, right?
10210357	10216860	I'm just, you know, and like I said in the chat room earlier, I said if this show ever dies, a piece of my heart will die.
10216980	10217441	Because...
10218201	10226863	This show has been like, I think a lot of the listeners has gotten me through a lot of hard times in past issues in my life and stuff like that.
10227263	10236805	And just sitting down and when I'm at work and I'm listening to you guys, it brings a positivity to my day that I didn't have before.
10236905	10239045	So that's one of the reasons why I called.
10239065	10243846	I just wanted to tell you guys that you have done so many good things to a lot of people
10244406	10262158	that are out there listening to you every Sunday or on the podcast feed throughout the week and I know that every time somebody listens to you guys there is a positive, jokingly feeling of like they're in the same room as you guys and we're just all friends and that's amazing.
10262338	10263519	Don't make me cry, Code Man.
10263539	10264459	Don't do it.
10264479	10265159	Don't do it.
10266900	10278505	Well, I have to tell you, too, that just in the fact that we've been talking, what, over the last month's worth of shows, it's really nice to have a colleague who listens to, you know.
10278665	10286589	It's just been really cool chatting with you and, you know, sort of exchanging, you know, not just the video game stuff, but having the design thing in common, too.
10287119	10314044	well and and Codeman let me say this and I'm sure it it goes for DarkSakura and Loki as well because I know we've had we've all had these very difficult shows this show has helped us get through a lot of hard times as well like you know I'll talk about myself since I have the mic right now but you know a few years ago I had a near-death experience and that was very um you know very humbling in a way and and uh there's a lot of jokes about I don't want to turn 30
10314264	10314884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10341053	10363536	so yes but no that's that's basically what I called in I mean as far as video games go I mean I've ever I'm still struggling through Tomb Raider I I don't know Rob you've been playing it too I think and I don't know I just I haven't gotten to pick it up again when are we playing the very average multiplayer that I I shouldn't raz it because I haven't tried it yet but when are we gonna give it a try
10364684	10369048	I don't know.
10369409	10374213	All kinds of video games out right now that are just eating me up.
10374493	10377897	Like I mentioned before, I have a daughter, so most of the time I don't even get to play video games.
10377977	10384302	But when I do, I try to sit down for long periods of time and play video games.
10384403	10384763	But yes...
10386064	10386685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10403243	10405484	Code Man, we talked about the crying thing.
10405504	10406404	Don't do it.
10406424	10407284	Hey, you better cry.
10407604	10407844	It's the $500.
10423001	10424402	Maybe when Rob drinks more, he'll cry.
10424422	10425462	I'm going to make you cry.
10426182	10428103	Oh, Rob, is he an emotional drunk?
10429003	10429523	Because I am.
10429603	10431084	No, I'm just loud.
10432585	10435005	And horny, apparently, if these other stories are to be believed.
10435186	10437006	Oh, Jesus Christ.
10437606	10438467	It was hilarious.
10438507	10441848	That was, by the way, Shane reminded me, that's where dunk came from.
10442208	10443449	Oh no, all right, look.
10444330	10452478	Codeman, thank you so much, and I'm so glad everybody gets to see your talent now in our album art, and the fact that that is listener-created.
10452519	10464711	I mean, Jamie did great work beforehand for a previous era of the show, but this show really is about the listeners, and so that the listeners could contribute to that, and the way you capture that by having everybody's name in there...
10465191	10467252	or I should say not everybody, but a good chunk of the people.
10467272	10467993	That was a great touch.
10468033	10469213	That was a great touch.
10469613	10470234	I loved it.
10470634	10471734	So that was my favorite part.
10471975	10474356	It's wherever every gamer has a voice.
10474676	10476377	Absolutely.
10476457	10486282	It's not only about the hosts that are on the show, but it's about the people that could participate in the chat room and give a voice to the actual podcast itself.
10486322	10491665	So I want to thank you guys for doing so much for everybody and just...
10492365	10492725	Thank you.
10492865	10494946	That's all I can say.
10494966	10495506	Thank you.
10495586	10497147	Are you guys still doing the Down for Maintenance show?
10497727	10498267	We are.
10499448	10506150	Yeah, we have taken a couple of weekends off due to just really busy, busy lives.
10506170	10509912	I've been doing a lot of graphics for people on YouTube, and I've just been really, really, really busy.
10511112	10515454	But other than that, yeah, we're still on Stitcher now, which is awesome.
10515534	10515914	Nice.
10517275	10520236	And iTunes is kind of fuzzy because we –
10520856	10523957	We're not running the kind of server that iTunes accepts.
10524417	10528839	Oh, God, I hate... This is why iTunes is going to... Anyway, rabble, rabble.
10529219	10533000	But look them up at least on Stitcher, right?
10533320	10534660	We do have a website, though, now.
10534780	10535921	Please.
10536121	10539302	www.thedfmpodcast.com
10540022	10540583	Check it out.
10540623	10541464	It's a great show.
10541564	10544446	Probably the most ultimate compliment we get on this show.
10544466	10550731	And I'm not saying this is necessarily true of your show, but I get this so much is that you guys helped inspire me.
10551211	10554994	You guys showed me that anybody can really do this and that I can do this too.
10555054	10560198	And that is the greatest compliment when we see these other shows arise of our listenerships.
10560258	10560758	It's awesome.
10561439	10562900	It's one of the reasons why we did it.
10563180	10563981	Thank you so much.
10564041	10564421	All right, buddy.
10564441	10565542	I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
10566215	10566735	All right, man.
10566755	10570578	Well, you guys enjoy 500th show and I'm going to go to bed because I'm sleepy.
10570718	10570958	All right.
10570978	10571379	Good night.
10571439	10572139	Good night.
10572399	10572800	Bye bye.
10572920	10573760	All right.
10573780	10574601	I'll talk to you guys later.
10574641	10574821	Bye.
10574941	10575702	Code man.
10575782	10576422	Great call.
10576482	10576842	Thank you.
10576862	10577903	Even if you're going to make me cry.
10577923	10580205	I was feeling a little sniffly.
10580285	10581465	The phone is ringing off the hooks.
10581546	10582346	Let's get to another call.
10582386	10583367	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10583387	10583727	Who's this?
10586109	10586489	Hola.
10586509	10588190	Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
10588330	10588991	Are you muted?
10590191	10590812	I see you.
10591570	10593290	Hello, one more time.
10593591	10594551	Come in, Tokyo.
10594671	10595451	We don't hear you.
10596331	10596651	All right.
10597592	10600092	Echo 123 to test your connection, folks.
10600332	10602033	I think he's off at the esthetician.
10603293	10603753	Tsk, tsk.
10603773	10605014	I won't bring up that joke.
10605074	10606114	Well, let's try another call.
10606174	10607134	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10607174	10607574	Who's this?
10607994	10609555	Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.
10609635	10610475	Oh, and we see him.
10610495	10611495	We see him.
10611575	10612796	It's Brad from PodCulture.
10612836	10613616	What's on your mind, buddy?
10614526	10617607	Just going to say congratulations on 500, guys.
10617807	10619127	Thank you so much.
10619387	10621148	You're not that far behind.
10621248	10624349	PodCulture's been going quite a while itself, hasn't it?
10626749	10627769	In our eighth year, I guess.
10628290	10629110	That's something.
10629210	10629830	That's something.
10629870	10630450	That's amazing.
10630830	10633591	You and I have the same color microphone, I just realized.
10635171	10635871	Gee, I wonder why.
10635991	10636452	I know.
10637132	10641873	You've done a lot to help this show out over the years, PodCulture, from getting us drunk to getting us heard.
10642276	10646580	And thank you for all of the discs full of Doctor Who you've sent me in the past.
10647221	10648602	Oh, no problem, no problem.
10648622	10649904	I'm glad to do it.
10650825	10655409	But hey, without you guys, I don't think we would have lasted as long as we have.
10655469	10659774	And thanks for inviting us into the VOG community.
10660689	10661850	Oh, duh.
10661870	10662611	Happy to have you.
10663472	10675505	We knew when we were starting, when we knew we wanted to do something that was not just games, but a celebration of everything geek, and some of our favorite shows came to mind, and absolutely, you were near the top of that list.
10675525	10676766	You were seriously up there.
10676886	10677147	Yeah.
10677447	10677967	Well, thank you.
10678628	10681872	But congratulations, and I'm going to let you guys go, and...
10682952	10685133	Get some more calls in, and this one's for you guys.
10685373	10686133	Oh, look at that.
10686273	10687373	Oh, a shot on air.
10687434	10687854	Yeah.
10689474	10690054	Woo-hoo.
10690074	10691735	That's one of the best video calls we've ever got.
10691755	10695596	See, you took it far better than Rob did, because Rob turned red in the face, and it was awesome.
10696156	10697177	Well, I've had more practice.
10699277	10700758	It's become a regular thing on the show.
10701198	10701518	All right.
10701798	10708821	PodCultures, Monday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network, continuing a celebration of the various doctors on TARDIS Interruptus tomorrow.
10708861	10709681	Fourth doctor, right?
10710362	10710802	Yes, sir.
10710942	10711323	All right.
10711483	10713024	Fourth doctor was my doctor.
10713324	10714164	There you go.
10714645	10715945	He was pretty well known.
10715965	10717026	All right.
10717486	10717846	Good night, guys.
10717886	10718147	All right.
10718167	10718607	Take care, buddy.
10719888	10720248	All right.
10720328	10723590	Always a pleasure to hear from Brad from another great podcast.
10723890	10724791	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10724811	10725191	Who's this?
10726692	10728693	It's me, Mario.
10729373	10730194	Hi, Mario.
10731214	10731775	Hey.
10731915	10732475	What's on your mind?
10732535	10733796	Is this really Extifer?
10734837	10735237	What?
10735257	10736798	Yeah, it's me.
10739306	10740567	What's on your mind, Extover?
10741808	10742769	What is on my mind?
10742829	10743170	I don't know.
10743190	10744311	I was just calling.
10744551	10747134	You just wanted to see what's up?
10748373	10751236	Yeah, I wanted to see what's up in his house.
10751596	10761725	Well, we're doing this autism multiple sclerosis walk one week from today, and everybody should donate at HordeHouse.com through the link, right?
10761865	10763066	Yeah, totally.
10763266	10764147	There you go.
10764347	10767850	Thumbs up for multiple sclerosis walks.
10768111	10769752	We broke $1,000 today.
10769932	10770413	That's awesome.
10770453	10771514	We did break it.
10771834	10772475	We broke it.
10773095	10773796	We took it out.
10774912	10778896	We did take it out, and I'm very happy about that.
10779736	10781558	What video games have you been playing lately, Extover?
10783480	10788544	You know, Jetpack Joyride, and I don't know nothing else.
10790586	10791346	I'm boring.
10791647	10792668	You should know this already.
10793328	10795710	Well, what did you call to say tonight?
10795770	10798032	Did you want to wish us well on our 500th episode?
10799414	10801736	No, but I just thought I'd call and say hi.
10801756	10802076	Okay.
10802910	10803691	Oh, well, okay.
10804012	10804372	Hey.
10805794	10806315	Hey.
10807136	10808057	Hey.
10808097	10809259	Got any plans tomorrow?
10809399	10809920	Want to hang?
10810521	10811142	You know what?
10811162	10815648	You still need to come over and finish watching Firefly with me after five years of us not watching Firefly.
10816429	10817090	Who's getting called out?
10817150	10818151	Yeah, you know what?
10818232	10819453	I'll check my calendar.
10820865	10823886	stuff for that and get back to you.
10823906	10824807	Well, let's see.
10824907	10828248	My week is not working, not working, not working, not working, not working birthday.
10828288	10828729	You can come.
10829689	10831390	Oh, let me check my calendar.
10831610	10834631	I'm not working, not working, not working, not working.
10835391	10836452	And then birthday.
10836772	10839253	I guess we have the same calendar.
10839613	10840214	Awesome.
10840314	10840934	Amazing.
10843255	10845076	Extover, do you want to plug Horde House?
10846876	10850338	I will plug Horde House up the asshole for you.
10851490	10852289	Is it bleached?
10853257	10858220	Yes, it's a nicely bleached, freshly bleached asshole that Hornhouse has.
10858360	10865205	Let me ask you this, Extifer, since we have a lot of old school listeners that are revisiting us tonight and so forth.
10865285	10869688	For a while, you and I were roommates and OLR Studios was at your house.
10870188	10875812	So what would the listeners be most surprised to know about Orange Lounge Radio behind the scenes?
10875892	10881296	What do you think the OLR listeners would be most surprised to know behind the scenes?
10882423	10888267	Well, our studio in our apartment was freaking filthy.
10890829	10894232	And Rob falls asleep in random places.
10894712	10895953	It's totally true.
10896013	10897214	It's not just when he's drunk.
10897294	10898815	That is totally hilarious, too.
10900696	10905700	I would come home and he'd be asleep on the floor and be like, Oh, I'm glad I didn't trip over you.
10905780	10906961	I didn't see you down there.
10908883	10914087	I remember coming over to that apartment and being absolutely thrilled that you were totally into Devil's Crush.
10915829	10916209	Oh, yeah.
10916449	10917730	I love Devil's Crush.
10918150	10923094	Although the... Actually, it was... Alien's Crush.
10923435	10925336	Yeah, Alien's Crush, or whatever.
10925837	10929720	My favorite extra for memory was when you stood out in the line to get me the Wii.
10931381	10932302	I know, right?
10932562	10935344	And how many times did you play that thing?
10935364	10935925	You did it.
10937518	10939519	Every day is what I want to say.
10939659	10940919	I was a huge Wii fan.
10941659	10943500	Yeah, you were a total Wii fan.
10943520	10948921	You were like, it was like five years after it launched and you were like, Wii!
10949541	10951982	Like every single chance you would get, you would say that.
10952002	10953943	It was kind of weird and depressing.
10953983	10954743	It was a little awkward.
10955103	10958924	All right, well, Extover, before we let you go, is there any other final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10960889	10968372	Um, well, I gotta go wash my hands because I did some dirty work before you guys gave me a call.
10968732	10979055	In fact, when you called me earlier, I didn't say anything because I had just came and you didn't want to hear what my voice sounds like right after that.
10980336	10981736	I think you just better go wash your hands.
10981756	10983337	Were you touching yourself to the show?
10983417	10984317	That's a little awkward.
10984397	10985838	If you're like jerking it to my voice.
10985858	10988238	No, I took a shit on my chair and I was cleaning.
10988478	10989779	What did you think I was doing?
10990845	10992086	Never change, please.
10992247	10992887	Never change.
10993448	10994749	Extifer, I'm letting you go now.
10996090	10996771	Aw, thank you.
10996971	10997892	Alright, bye.
10998753	11000235	Are we holding him for any reason?
11002657	11003618	What the fuck?
11006120	11007201	Like, seriously.
11007242	11010445	I totally miss Extifer and the utter randomness.
11013895	11014596	Oh, lordy.
11014736	11015096	Hi, Rob.
11015116	11015496	Yes!
11015736	11016237	Oh, my God.
11017057	11018738	School bus reference in the chat room.
11019899	11021160	Hi, here on Orange Sounds Radio.
11021180	11021540	Who's this?
11023081	11023662	Oh, my God.
11023822	11024562	It's Swag Kick.
11024682	11025403	Hey, girl.
11025623	11026103	Hey.
11026123	11026644	And guy.
11026964	11027744	Hey, girl.
11027804	11028285	What's up?
11028525	11029045	Sorry, Rob.
11029085	11029585	Sorry, Rob.
11029605	11031207	You're not the guy.
11031247	11032027	You're one of the girls.
11032728	11033208	Whatever.
11033308	11035169	What's up, Swag Kick?
11035209	11038411	Hey, I just wanted to congratulate you like everyone else.
11038491	11040212	Like, I know it's totally not original.
11040873	11042134	And, like, how do I follow up, um...
11043243	11053370	You know, that call that Exifer just made, you know, I can't really, I am not touching myself, but I just wanted to congratulate all of you on your great achievement.
11053870	11055551	And yeah, that's amazing.
11055571	11057713	500, like, I can't believe that.
11057833	11058653	Well, thank you, baby.
11058713	11059454	I feel so nervous.
11059474	11060394	Like, I'm on the radio.
11061915	11062616	It's kind of famous.
11063136	11064117	It's just me.
11064417	11065018	You know me.
11065098	11065698	You've met me.
11066318	11067219	I'm not that scary.
11067299	11068480	We're not that scary, right?
11070721	11071482	You're a little scary.
11074728	11076029	Well, shoot, slide, kick.
11076049	11077489	Do you want to talk any games with us?
11077529	11078609	What games have you been playing lately?
11080750	11082850	I'm actually playing Fire Emblem Awakening.
11083311	11083571	Yeah?
11083671	11084091	How's that?
11084451	11088272	And I kind of suck at it, but it's cool.
11088332	11089212	I like it a lot.
11089312	11095094	I've never really played a lot of tactical strategy RPGs, so it's cool.
11095134	11095654	I like it.
11096414	11103356	There's a lot of people that are really into Fire Emblem on the 3DS, so I can't really blame you for being a fan of that.
11105461	11117443	for sure so Slykick you've done a couple podcasts of your own too I know you used to do a podcast with Alan not everybody knows about this but you used to do the amazing Warcraft podcast Fabulous Flames right Alan?
11117683	11134107	yes we did and I have to say Alan has been amazing tonight yes he has I was a big fan of the Miss Nude World 96 shout out I'm always a fan for Miss Nude World 96 what are you doing these days in podcasting?
11134127	11135047	do you have anything you want to plug?
11137399	11147466	Yeah, and since Exifer took the butt plug joke, I'll just go ahead and shout out to my podcast, which is GameBooey.
11147526	11153971	We're over at GameBooey.org, and we bring you gaming news and views that may be on your radar, but most definitely should be.
11154831	11164578	And we are definitely inspired and pretty much owe everything about who we are to Orange Sounds Radio, so thank you for being an inspiration and making it, you know, making...
11165566	11176501	a community out there for people to have a voice in gaming because it's super important for not just all the blogs and journalists
11177253	11179075	to be the only ones talking about games.
11179235	11180137	Well, thank you.
11180177	11181158	It means a lot.
11181298	11183481	And your show is very good.
11183521	11184021	I've heard it.
11184342	11189248	And even though in those first few episodes I wanted to kill you over your sound quality, you guys have improved so much.
11189268	11189808	You know what?
11189828	11190770	You sound great now.
11191110	11195015	It was actually better than it was in the previous one.
11195035	11196817	I do miss Fabulous Flames, just saying.
11197618	11215858	you sound great now and your content is very good and well researched and you and Spike are great and what I love most about your show is that you always pay it forward at the end and you do give shout outs and keep it indie and I think that's great and you know if we helped inspire that attitude then that's a huge compliment
11217614	11218735	We're your biggest fans.
11218915	11220937	We love you so much.
11221057	11223679	I have been begging to come on your show for like six months.
11223779	11224279	And look at this.
11224579	11227281	I totally miss, though, planning webcomics with you.
11230244	11231845	I still have the WoW viewer.
11232005	11232766	We can still do it.
11236228	11236468	All right.
11236709	11239251	Well, Slidekick, I'm going to let you go since I can get more calls.
11239351	11240892	But anything else real quick before I let you go?
11243045	11248007	No, except I need to get up there and have an OLR party sometime.
11248147	11249107	You're welcome anytime.
11249147	11250188	Get up here on Sunday night.
11250208	11251228	You have to come up on Friday.
11252368	11253129	Bring Captain Spike with you.
11253149	11253529	I will try.
11253989	11254509	I will try.
11254529	11255149	All right.
11255529	11255729	All right.
11255770	11256270	Take care, buddy.
11256310	11256730	Have a good one.
11257930	11258250	All right.
11258270	11258791	You too.
11258931	11259111	Bye.
11259131	11259531	Have a happy 500.
11260291	11261111	Thank you.
11261131	11262632	Thank you.
11262652	11263232	All right.
11263252	11264312	1-877-GAME-OLR.
11264392	11266293	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11266313	11267093	Let's go to another call.
11267133	11267974	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11267994	11268354	Who's this?
11269016	11271717	It's the undertaker of the internet, Raven Stolfen.
11271777	11272777	Wait a minute, weren't you just here?
11273717	11275858	I was, but give me two minutes, Rob.
11276318	11278978	I hope your pallbearer didn't die.
11279759	11280739	Time starts now.
11281459	11288401	Alright, so I want to congratulate Orange Lines Radio for 500 shows and inspiring me to do my show.
11288581	11294402	I'm not going to plug it, but I'm just going to say, Rob, your cast and your people have
11294758	11297699	Very diverse, and you kept me entertained for years.
11297819	11302460	I am now 26, and I've been listening since I was in high school as well.
11304861	11305681	Oh my god!
11305781	11307841	Oh my god, we're so old!
11308302	11310142	I can feel myself aging.
11310582	11311662	I've got cancer now.
11311922	11314383	No, it's amazing.
11314663	11316064	It really is amazing.
11316444	11317644	I also really like your voice.
11318868	11319208	Thanks.
11320589	11321989	Your voice is very much mature.
11322069	11327451	I remember when you used to call this show all the time when you were in high school and the years right after that and so forth.
11327791	11329572	Your voice really has matured.
11329752	11333473	I can hear it through undoubtedly your own podcast and so forth.
11333554	11335434	It's pleasant.
11336094	11337155	It came a long way.
11337295	11338355	Everything came a long way.
11338535	11345438	And I have to say, if Orange Silence Radio was a lighthouse in the beacon of the dark, you are awesome.
11346092	11350334	Well, I appreciate it so much, Raven Stolfen, and thank you so much for sticking with us for all the years.
11350374	11351695	It's a pleasure as always to hear from you.
11352495	11354416	I listen to every archive.
11354576	11355477	I never leave.
11355817	11357698	It's just sometimes I do my things on Sunday.
11357718	11358318	It makes it hard.
11358358	11362640	I had to cancel my own show for you guys because I had to be here for your special day.
11362980	11363240	Oh, my God.
11363340	11363761	Wow.
11363861	11365221	That's – oh, my gosh.
11365762	11365982	Wow.
11366242	11368423	What would you have talked about on your show tonight?
11368483	11372365	Maybe we can work a little bit of it in here, a little crossover episode.
11372385	11372665	Sure.
11373103	11379904	Well, I was going to talk about, and you guys didn't do it, it was the whole thing about Twitch TV, about that handicapped guy that wasn't handicapped.
11380164	11381605	Yeah, I heard about this.
11381685	11383605	So what, let me see if I can summarize.
11383645	11389326	Let's see, so he was getting donations because he was sick, and I guess it was donations for a surgery, right?
11390047	11396408	And, well, the cameras weren't stopping on Twitch TV, he didn't turn them off, and they caught him getting up out of his wheelchair.
11396588	11396728	What?
11397568	11398208	No funny business, people
11425716	11427877	Yeah, so we were going to talk about that.
11427957	11429898	I mean, I had problems in the past.
11429939	11432460	I mean, I'm on Social Security right now.
11433000	11435421	I had major problems, went to special schools.
11435582	11440124	So for me, for someone that faces an illness like that, you just slap me in the face.
11440464	11443626	And I'm not trying to get donations for what I'm doing, but...
11444670	11445371	I think that's worse.
11465567	11467328	The wheelchair thing is bad.
11467368	11468268	That's evil.
11468468	11470989	But jerking it on Twitch, that's funny.
11471870	11474611	Any live streaming site, you're going to see dick or boobs anyway.
11474631	11480053	Yeah, I was going to say, or the one dude that had sex with his girlfriend or something like that in the background, or he just forgot it was on.
11481078	11482139	Yeah, he forgot it was on.
11482399	11484542	That's why I'm very careful about when I have that.
11484662	11487004	I would not live stream 24-7 just because.
11487084	11488806	Extra for shame.
11488906	11490167	I know something bad would happen.
11490427	11493931	All right, RavensDolphin, I'm going to let you go to get more calls, but thank you so much for the kind words.
11494311	11495272	Thank you for taking my call.
11495412	11495572	Bye.
11495753	11497414	No problem.
11497474	11497574	Bye.
11497595	11499957	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11500477	11500678	Why not?
11500698	11501699	We can do a couple more calls, right?
11501719	11502079	We're only at 930.
11504341	11507162	We are being horribly rude to our East Coast people.
11507522	11507783	We are.
11507903	11508783	How about one more call?
11508963	11509543	One more call.
11509803	11510264	One more call.
11510504	11511204	Let's see who gets in.
11511224	11512505	1-877-GAME-OLR.
11512885	11513565	I'm totally jealous.
11513585	11513905	Wait a minute.
11513925	11515726	I'm totally jealous of all of them who have jobs.
11517547	11517727	No.
11517847	11518827	Keep them up all night.
11519888	11520228	All night.
11520668	11521148	You all right?
11521669	11523449	I was doing my Ronda Shearer impersonation.
11523489	11523790	Hello?
11524010	11524390	I see.
11524470	11524710	I see.
11524730	11527251	Except I'm not wearing, you know, extra padding in the boob region.
11527311	11527531	All right.
11527571	11528532	Let me go to one more call.
11528572	11529552	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11529572	11529952	Who's this?
11530653	11531173	Hey, what's up?
11531233	11531933	It's Tiger Claw.
11531993	11532854	Hey, Tiger Claw.
11532874	11533594	What's on your mind, buddy?
11534494	11535294	Oh, not much.
11535494	11538475	I just want to congratulate you guys on your 500th episode.
11539836	11546458	I guess you guys can go on record maybe as being the longest running podcast in history or something like that.
11547198	11550879	We're not the longest running podcast, but we are the longest running video game podcast.
11550919	11551599	I don't even know.
11552300	11556481	Well, you guys have been around way before podcasting was a thing, so...
11556741	11573087	I'd say live show that's what gives us a jump on the other people is that we had the live 365 years and so we kind of slid right into the podcasting thing but I would say I usually say we are the longest running internet show about video games weekly internet show about video games
11574573	11574934	Yeah.
11575134	11576315	But you know what?
11576435	11579296	The internet is a big place.
11579557	11588002	I've been putting together this special interest group on Facebook recently with some friends, and I found that there's all these other podcasters I didn't even know were out there.
11588222	11590044	I didn't even know these shows existed.
11590484	11594507	They're celebrating episode 100 and 60, and I'm like, what?
11595287	11601051	So you never know what's out there, which is why I'm very cautious to stake a claim like, we're the longest running show, bitches.
11601852	11603513	So I just want to be careful.
11605133	11614037	Yep, and just keep on doing what you're doing and hopefully people will listen and I don't know what else to say.
11615618	11621240	No matter how old you get, just keep on gaming because you'll still feel the same way.
11622101	11625682	Alright, well, Tigerclaw, I appreciate your support over the years.
11626203	11627103	It means an awful lot.
11628497	11629558	No problem, you're welcome.
11629698	11632160	So better let some other people call in.
11632400	11634982	Alright, we'll see if maybe we'll let one more sneak in since you were short.
11635022	11636002	But have a good one, Tigerclaw.
11636323	11636943	Alright, thanks.
11637283	11637703	Take care.
11638164	11638404	You too.
11638504	11638784	Bye-bye.
11640706	11641386	We can do one more.
11641446	11642147	Let's do one more.
11642907	11643547	One more, come on.
11643768	11644388	Sure.
11645449	11646309	One more, one more.
11646449	11647330	Especially this one.
11647430	11647890	Alright, hi.
11648411	11648591	Oh.
11649351	11649952	Oh my gosh!
11650312	11652093	It's a scary black man on the cam.
11652153	11652654	Oh my gosh.
11656005	11657487	No, I'm kidding, you guys.
11657547	11660129	It's DJ Ranma S. You are looking sharp in your VOG shirt.
11660149	11661930	You are looking very sharp today, young man.
11661990	11662370	How are you?
11663091	11663932	I'm doing fine.
11663952	11666193	How is everybody in the Sacramento studios?
11667274	11668475	I'm sobering up, sadly.
11669296	11672579	Oh, you should not be sobering up because I have a problem with that good sir.
11672759	11673559	Uh-oh, what's that?
11674580	11676822	Well... What are you drinking?
11678268	11680532	If you can see what I got here.
11680812	11683516	I love you and I need to be at your house right now.
11685940	11687402	He's got a bottle of Glenn Fittich.
11688224	11690728	This is one of two bottles of Glenn Fittich I have.
11690888	11692250	Okay, I'm at BRB going on a plane.
11695678	11700101	And also... Do you see this glass right here?
11700201	11700762	Yes, I do.
11701522	11702123	Oh, wait, hold it.
11702323	11704545	XFR once said something about a Luigi hat.
11704685	11705705	Give me one quick second.
11706106	11706746	Oh, Lord.
11706766	11710009	Wait, they can't... They can't... We're the only ones that can see you.
11711130	11711890	Okay, he's wearing that.
11712130	11712911	Yeah, he's wearing the VOG shirt.
11712931	11714572	Rob, do you know what print screen is?
11714793	11714893	Oh.
11715573	11716533	Oh, shit.
11716593	11717614	Yes, I do know print screen.
11717734	11718054	Wait, look.
11718414	11719254	You've got Photoshop, right?
11719274	11719855	I think I got it.
11719875	11720035	Wait.
11721115	11721475	I don't know.
11721595	11722196	I'll print screen.
11722216	11722996	We'll just get that window.
11723016	11723316	There we go.
11723356	11723596	All right.
11723636	11724236	I think I got them.
11724256	11724597	We'll see.
11725397	11725817	Woo-hoo.
11725857	11726197	Nice.
11727418	11729899	Do I even have PaintShop Pro on this computer or whatever?
11730039	11731099	God, PaintShop Pro.
11731179	11731759	Shut up.
11733240	11734380	Ugh, PaintShop Pro.
11734440	11735821	I might have MS Paint.
11736561	11736881	You know what?
11736921	11738062	You can paste it in paint.
11740366	11741126	Yes, I got it.
11741166	11741627	Woohoo.
11741707	11743947	All right, I'll save it as a paint thing and fix that up later.
11744428	11745208	All right, so anyhow.
11745268	11746128	Bitmap!
11746428	11747109	Woo!
11747749	11748169	Where was I?
11748469	11751710	I'm going to save it with the very clever untitled.bmp.
11752471	11752751	All right.
11754671	11756632	You're looking... Ranma already took the damn picture.
11757533	11759173	Ranma's sadly not on a Mac.
11759573	11767776	I'll continue to wear it to the end of the video broadcast, but as you can see, I am popping this bad boy open that has been in my freezer for the past two weeks.
11768437	11769137	Oh, nice.
11770567	11774050	And as I pour this, I want to thank each and every single one of you.
11774730	11778973	As everyone said before, if it wasn't for OLR, there wouldn't be no Anime Jam Session.
11780594	11786198	And also, I will not be one of those podcasters that will beg for money to do my show.
11786779	11792863	What me, Mako, and Ari, what we all do, we do it for love, and we pick up all our money and we do it together.
11794301	11797625	I'll do it for dollar bills to show my tatas, but that's it.
11801150	11802412	Someone did send me money one time.
11802692	11803573	For showing your tatas?
11803633	11803853	No.
11804855	11805556	I do that for free.
11807979	11809140	To Dan, to Dan.
11809820	11810620	She does that for drinks.
11811000	11812881	But no, remember when I had Pump Up the Volume?
11813201	11813522	I do.
11813602	11816563	And Loki put it in my intro to tune in and give me a dollar?
11816723	11817783	Oh yeah, somebody actually sent you a dollar.
11817803	11818624	Someone sent me a dollar.
11818644	11819084	I remember that.
11819144	11819764	It was good times.
11821405	11822926	Ranma, thank you so much for the toast.
11822986	11831609	And as I was saying before to some of the other callers, that is really the ultimate compliment to hear that, you know, we might have inspired even a portion of somebody else's show.
11831669	11833450	It's just like, it's outstanding.
11833590	11834771	You need to come back for Afoname.
11834811	11835891	We're just here having a good time.
11835911	11836792	And...
11838896	11839657	You cut out.
11839697	11840278	Go ahead, Ranma.
11840878	11844062	Well, I was going to say, OLR is not just a podcast.
11844082	11845744	We're like a freaking family.
11846064	11848347	A giant dysfunctional family.
11850209	11851590	We put the fun in dysfunction.
11851630	11852171	That's right.
11853212	11854994	I will go on record right now.
11856658	11885854	you guys really got me through the passing of my mother when I called that one night and asked for you guys to play Let's Screw that was one of my favorite songs you guys played it and I could not thank y'all enough for doing that I'm more than happy to do so especially if it'll help even just the slightest bit in somebody's really shitty day to put it lightly I'm happy to of course
11886451	11891012	Now to Sky, Loki, DarkSakura.
11891853	11896054	Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.
11896474	11900175	If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you and here's to me.
11900415	11901636	Fuck you too, buddy.
11902836	11904317	I hope that puts you on the floor.
11904417	11907098	That is seriously my second favorite toast ever.
11907538	11908198	That's great.
11909301	11912062	And before I go, I did say I have a little treat for you.
11912722	11914363	I love your hand flailing, that's cute.
11914383	11916143	I thought that was the treat.
11916163	11920845	I just came back from a J-pop concert I got in for free, okay?
11920865	11921305	Amazing.
11922825	11931968	But I was at PAX East, I happened to run into a famous nerdcore rapper, and I asked him to do a favor, and hopefully this will play through.
11933529	11934029	And here we go.
11935251	11939894	This is MC Frontalot and you are participating with the Voice of Geeks Network.
11941995	11943696	Shut the front door!
11944156	11945277	Oh my god!
11947058	11949619	Oh my god, that's amazing!
11950920	11951360	Wow.
11953081	11953822	I love you forever.
11955546	11956687	I'm buying you drinks.
11957027	11957808	Alright, that's it.
11958008	11959068	New York, where we going?
11959408	11960269	Right now, bye.
11960389	11961590	BRB, heading to New York.
11961650	11962550	BRB, New York.
11964271	11969414	You have to pick up Mako as you go because if you go take me without her, she's going to kick everybody's ass.
11969454	11970935	BRB stopping in New Jersey.
11973796	11975817	Alright, Ranma, that was amazing.
11976118	11976818	That was awesome.
11976838	11981400	You've been an amazing support over the years and thank you so much, buddy.
11981561	11982161	You don't even know.
11983621	11996290	No, thank you, because you guys gave me this opportunity to do this, so me running around, finding these opportunities to give you guys bumpers, interviews, this and that, this is more than my way of saying thank you, you know, this is...
11997850	12001775	All I ever wanted was to get my show on, and Rob, you gave me that opportunity.
12002156	12005340	So believe it or not, I'm in your eternal thanks for all of this.
12005560	12007683	Well, it's the least I could do.
12009125	12009426	All right.
12009906	12010647	Take care, my friend.
12010787	12011669	We have to go wrap up.
12012570	12013451	It's not a marathon show.
12013491	12013671	Yes?
12014452	12015272	Stay black, my brother.
12015413	12016413	I will, absolutely.
12018014	12018534	Good night.
12018554	12019674	Hey, Ranchan?
12020274	12021095	Yasukachan.
12021675	12022095	Stay drunk.
12024676	12025276	Bye, my friend.
12025517	12026497	I don't have the absinthe.
12027257	12027657	All right.
12027978	12030239	I'm hitting hang up now because I've said bye like five times.
12030579	12030899	All right.
12030939	12032960	That was amazing.
12032980	12034480	You'll always be my Ranchan.
12036181	12036881	What a great show.
12037762	12038742	I'm getting a little of the clemt.
12039318	12041441	I have a last minute story I like these brownies, they're awesome
12053368	12059292	I just want to say just kind of like a blanket thank you to the kind words on Twitter.
12059332	12064815	There's been a lot of tweet activity tonight, and I just want to say a big thank you for all of that.
12065655	12070738	I don't have the time yet because we're running way over to read each and every single one of them, but I just want to say thank you.
12071659	12073340	Quickly, some of these tweets real quick.
12074400	12089771	Actdeft tweeting us about Shadowrun returns backers for the DRM free copy of the game may have gotten screwed by Microsoft and in a nutshell the game will be free but the original game will be DRM free but the DLC will not.
12090791	12112445	so they're holding up their end of the bargain what it is is you get two versions of the game you get DRM free version of the game you get a Steam version of the game Steam version will support the DLC beyond the Kickstarter or Kickstarter exclusive DLC and then the free to play game or the DRM free game will only support the Kickstarter DRM or the Kickstarter DLC but no additional DLC
12113793	12118457	Tiger Claw tweeting us that Ska Studios challenges the view that Microsoft is bad for indies.
12118738	12121960	So not everybody is saying that Microsoft is this evil indie thing.
12122621	12126845	Bobby Blackwolf tweeting us about this is a travesty and a story about Disneyland.
12126885	12131089	Apparently Space Mountain was closed while Disneyland reviews safety.
12131449	12137054	Space Mountain, the Matterhorn bobsleds and Soarin' Over California were out of service today.
12137434	12139496	What a shitty day to be at Disneyland.
12139556	12140197	Hey, we weren't there.
12140777	12142718	You poor guys that went to Disneyland today.
12142958	12148759	But they did reopen Matterhorn bobsleds already, which, you know, is kind of... I'm just still irritated they took out the basketball court.
12149319	12149960	They did?
12150260	12152280	Yeah, they took out the basketball court when they redid the tracks.
12153881	12161743	For those who don't know their Disney trivia, the Matterhorn had a half court up in the very top of the mountain for cast members to go during their break.
12163567	12184553	Actdeft tweeting us saying Forza Horizon getting a new free DLC pack called the 1000 Club I like free DLC, I'm on board with that Also, Actdeft tweeting us I think I went over his too, but that's okay A New Jersey Assemblywoman wants to ban violent video games in public places Yeah, was that the same one where they want to ban M-rated arcade games?
12184573	12190535	Yeah, they want to ban M-rated and AO-rated arcade games Problem being, the SRB does not rate arcade games
12191115	12219501	Way to do your research How about if you don't like them don't take your children there And I just want to give some quick shout outs I know I said I wasn't going to read each and every one of these but we actually had some other fellow podcasters that tweeted us and said congratulations and I think it's important to give these guys a shout out because community makes us great and us indie podcasters we really really have to stick together so I do want to give a shout out to Godfrey from Gamertag Radio who sent a tweet earlier today
12219941	12222243	So, and they've been going a very long time as well.
12222283	12224564	I know they were one of the first shows on iTunes as well.
12224644	12227606	So he's had many, many great accomplishments.
12227826	12229507	So props to you, Godfrey.
12230107	12233349	Game Buoy, who you heard slide kick earlier, also sent us a tweet.
12233870	12237352	Those guys are a lot of fun, even though I think they should go weekly.
12237452	12241414	But when they do put out a show, it is fabulous and very well researched.
12241434	12242455	We always love when they put out.
12243996	12245017	Who doesn't love it when they put out?
12246138	12249541	The Rich from the Video Game Show tweeted us and said congrats on 500.
12249881	12264414	Now, Video Game Show, I think, as far as I know, I could be wrong, but as far as I know, Video Game Show is the only other podcast in iTunes when it went live about gaming, the day it went live, that is still going.
12264434	12265415	They're about to hit episode 400.
12266656	12266976	and IndieRadio.
12295591	12300153	and of course to our pal Bobby Blackwolf who's always before us here.
12300194	12301634	We love Bobby so much.
12301954	12303955	And Brad from PodCulture.
12304135	12307517	Critical Myth who's hitting 300 episodes tomorrow.
12308017	12308437	Nice.
12309358	12315601	And Anime Jam Session and Horde House and Girls Gone Wow and British Invaders.
12315621	12316541	Have I named everybody now?
12316581	12317162	I think I have.
12317362	12318102	Under Station Live!
12318142	12318542	Oh my god!
12318602	12319563	Under Station Live!
12320083	12322605	Well, I don't think that we would be here without them.
12322745	12323485	Isn't that funny?
12323806	12323986	Yeah.
12324106	12328269	Is that everybody's calling in saying, OLR, you inspired me to do this.
12328389	12329389	OLR, you did this.
12329429	12331231	And I think this is a good note for us to end on tonight.
12331251	12331511	You know what?
12331531	12333552	I'm going to sit on this for a minute because I want to end on that note.
12333952	12335653	So let me go around and get everybody's final thought.
12336634	12338075	Becky, thank you so much for being here.
12338095	12344579	I know you didn't get a chance to say an awful lot, but we really appreciate the culinary delights and your support still means the world to us.
12344599	12345400	So thank you for being here.
12347590	12348390	It's okay.
12348530	12349651	I'm a very quiet person.
12349691	12350111	That's all right.
12350151	12352572	Any final thoughts for our listeners, though, while you're at it?
12352932	12354472	Any last words of wisdom?
12357193	12359834	Don't let your kids watch SpongeBob.
12361174	12364195	It's horrible.
12364315	12366956	DarkSakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight.
12367076	12368177	Oh, why the fuck not?
12368257	12369277	Reject false icons.
12369955	12371797	Ooh, taking it back a notch.
12372518	12373659	Loki, your final thought tonight.
12373840	12374280	I have two things.
12374420	12375902	One, I have a picture of poop on my phone.
12376042	12378745	And two... Wow.
12379506	12382430	Let's do this Mark Forrest style, motherfuckers.
12384125	12391128	My final thought tonight, as promised, I want to say a lot of you gave props to us for helping inspire what you do.
12391489	12399272	But I really have to say, and I got into this on Facebook a little bit before, but I really just want to say that I studied radio in college.
12399352	12401953	And I actually originally was going to be a weatherman.
12402013	12404495	That was what I was in college to study originally.
12405235	12411598	I interned at a broadcast station at an actual news broadcast in the town I went to school in.
12412296	12423085	and although everybody was really nice and it was a really great eye-opening experience, the way my eyes were opened was that most people were very miserable in the jobs that they were doing and it really didn't want to be something I wanted to continue.
12423465	12431432	So I kind of got into radio as a result of that, but I felt a lot of that same stuff that in commercial radio, it's really not about who you know, but it's about who you blow.
12432112	12437737	And that wasn't really what I wanted, you know, contrary to what Jamie might tell you about when I drink, that wasn't really what I wanted to pursue.
12438277	12438637	Totally.
12438697	12442999	So I didn't finish school because I am very jaded with a lot of it.
12443039	12445000	And I was kind of like, what the hell am I wasting my time for?
12445060	12446561	I just need to go out into the working world.
12447021	12455365	And while I don't hate school and I think it's great that a lot of people do go to school and finish college and all that, for me at that time, it was what I needed to do and it was a great thing.
12455385	12457927	And I love where I ended up in my career, so I'm happy.
12458347	12465850	But I'm really thankful to my time I did spend at the college radio station, my very first radio show at KCSC.
12466431	12466631	Yeah.
12467311	12467792	and DarkSakura.com
12485094	12499775	and it was so much fun he asked me to come back and I came back over and over and over again and through him I learned how easy it was to do a show on live through CC5 and so I, like DJ Ranma was talking about with his show and what Codeman was talking about with his show and everybody else
12500456	12501577	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
12520673	12521894	This show would not be the same without him.
12522014	12525596	I do need to thank Travis too for having me on as a guest so much and filling in for Jessica.
12525756	12526276	Absolutely.
12526697	12527217	Absolutely.
12527357	12533280	So yeah, I guess this is in a way 500 episodes of paying it forward.
12533781	12535501	So really appreciate it.
12536002	12536962	I don't know what else to say.
12537803	12539764	I see lots of great stuff in the chat room right now.
12540084	12546808	YYR says, thank you guys for 500 great episodes and for devoting so much of your time and energy to contribute towards all of our lives, ours and yours.
12547548	12553914	Tim TRP says, Rob, you have a voice for radio, a face for TV news, and a body for hardcore pornography.
12553994	12554775	Wait a minute.
12555315	12556256	Wait a minute.
12557357	12557937	Oh, Tim.
12558578	12559339	Oh, Tim.
12560400	12560760	All right.
12561541	12562962	I'm going to cry in a second, by the way.
12563362	12563602	Are you?
12563662	12564863	What else can I say to make you cry?
12564924	12565264	Shut up.
12567586	12569107	If someone else brings up Shermie, maybe.
12569928	12570929	The chips are gone.
12576010	12578392	Alright, I think it's time we end the show.
12578592	12580794	Thank you guys so much for 500 great episodes.
12581214	12583215	Let's try to be less sappy next week, you guys.
12583376	12586858	I did pick something very, very, very classic for Cookie.
12587138	12588579	Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.
12588800	12589320	Alright, that's it.
12589700	12589980	We're done.
12590181	12590941	What do you say, guys?
12591141	12592702	We'll do it all again next week, alright?
12593343	12594924	Come on back next week for episode 501.
12595505	12600148	Until then, have a great week.
12600829	12601609	Don't be a dick.
12602950	12604071	And have fun.
12604111	12604812	It's only a game.
