47000	51000	For this April the 14th of 2013
51000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts
53000	60000	And I'm here with you every week for this very long, long, long time with my co-host
60000	65000	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
65000	66000	Hi
66000	68000	How are you Jamie?
68000	70000	I'm caffeinated now, now I can start drinking
70000	72000	You've had coffee
72000	74000	Now bring on the booze
74000	75000	Bring on the booze
75000	76000	Bring it on
76000	79000	I brought a bottle of pre-made mimosa
79000	80000	Nice
80000	81000	What is pre-made mimosa?
81000	84000	It means that you don't have to buy orange juice and champagne separately
84000	85000	How lazy are you?
85000	87000	They did that shit for you
87000	92000	I did something called saving time, space, and money
92000	94000	By just bringing it already done
94000	96000	Because, fuck it
96000	98000	It's booze, it drinks the same way
98000	101000	Speaking of fuck it, I decided to mark the occasion tonight
101000	103000	I'm gonna wear my pajama pants
103000	104000	I'm gonna take a picture of Rob
104000	107000	With all these little lips all over them that say kiss me
107000	109000	Because I'm wearing my pajamas to OLR tonight
109000	110000	Rob wants his pants kissed
110000	112000	I give no fucks
112000	114000	Happy 500th episode
114000	116000	I think you gave the last fuck last episode
116000	119000	So we're fresh out of fucks, sorry
119000	121000	Alright, say hello
121000	123000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki
123000	124000	Hello
124000	125000	How are you Loki?
125000	127000	I wish these fries were better
127000	129000	I'd throw them all away because they're crap
129000	130000	You went to McDonald's, duh
130000	132000	It's a crap shoot, I know
132000	135000	I wasn't that hungry so I expected them to suck
135000	138000	I just wanted to be pleasantly surprised that they were good
138000	139000	But they were not
139000	143000	Is that the tragedy that has followed you for 11 years here on this program?
143000	145000	Yeah, it's just, it's a
145000	148000	The problem is that I was very indecisive on what I wanted to eat
148000	151000	So, it was kind of like, you know
151000	154000	First I started driving towards Jack in the Box
154000	156000	And I'm like, eh, I'm not that hungry
156000	157000	Don't judge me
157000	159000	I'm not hungry enough for Jack in the Box
159000	161000	So then I went to McDonald's
161000	163000	I'm like, oh but I really want Subway
163000	164000	But it's across the street
164000	167000	So I'm like, eh, I'll just eat McDonald's
167000	168000	Because I need to get gas
168000	171000	Okay, so thanks to Alan for distracting things
171000	172000	Sorry, Loki
172000	174000	But while Loki was talking
174000	176000	Alan came over here and dropped on the table
176000	179000	I got this bag of the chicken and waffles Lay's
179000	180000	Because I knew Jamie has it
180000	181000	Actually, Alan got it
181000	182000	I have had them
182000	183000	Oh, you have had them?
183000	184000	They're pretty good
184000	186000	They're fairly amazing until you get halfway down through the bag
186000	188000	And then I was like, what the fuck am I eating?
188000	191000	Brad from Pod Culture said they were the worst absolute things in the world
191000	193000	They're amazing, I love them
193000	195000	I don't think they're the best potato chips I've ever had
195000	196000	But they're not bad
196000	198000	The cheesy garlic bread ones though are pretty epic
198000	199000	Are they?
199000	200000	They are quite epic
200000	203000	Whoever came up with that little contest at Lay's, genius
203000	206000	Here we are talking about food yet again
206000	207000	Why break tradition, folks?
207000	208000	Duh
208000	209000	Why break tradition, folks?
209000	210000	I'd rather just have a waffle
210000	211000	Alright
211000	213000	Dude, waffles would be awesome right now
213000	216000	We do have a special guest here joining us tonight
216000	219000	Say hello to Becky
219000	220000	Greetings
220000	221000	How are you, Becky?
221000	222000	I'm doing pretty well, thanks
222000	223000	Welcome back
223000	225000	Now Becky, for those that don't know, is Jamie's BFF
226000	228000	And so Jamie sometimes talks about her on the show
228000	231000	And she's also quite the chef
231000	234000	And so Becky was kind enough to actually cook
234000	236000	Here we go with food again on a video game show
236000	238000	Was kind enough to cook for us tonight
238000	240000	What did you make for us tonight, Becky?
240000	242000	I made red velvet brownies
242000	244000	And they look like murder
246000	250000	They are beautiful, glorious, dripping red
250000	252000	Hope y'all don't see the food boner in my jammies right now
253000	254000	Cause
254000	255000	I'm gonna go take pictures
255000	257000	That sounds pretty epic
257000	258000	Of the food boner?
262000	263000	No comment
264000	265000	Alright
266000	269000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
269000	272000	The always present fourth guest on our show
272000	274000	I know we have a fourth guest in the studio
274000	278000	But also always with us as you guys have been
278000	281000	And we would not have made it to 500 episodes without you guys
281000	282000	Let's be real
282000	284000	Hello everybody in our chat room
284000	287000	What the hell comment do I start with tonight?
287000	288000	How about Mako Chan?
288000	290000	Starts us off tonight saying
290000	292000	Murder is pretty fucking tasty
292000	295000	It would be awesome if you drew like super meat boy on those
295000	296000	Because that would be
296000	297000	That's perfect
297000	300000	That's it, Becky, we have to do this again next weekend
300000	302000	So what's going on, live listeners?
302000	303000	Is the stream not work-
303000	305000	I guess a lot of people are bitching that the stream is like
305000	307000	Stopping going tonight or something
307000	308000	So I don't know what's up with that
308000	309000	We're not doing anything different
309000	310000	I can do it
310000	312000	There's too many of you listening
312000	313000	That's what's happening
313000	314000	Bite your tongue
314000	317000	Alright, we do tape live every Wednesday
317000	320000	Every Wednesday when I'm not here
322000	325000	What fucking show is having a birthday today, Rob?
325000	329000	We do tape live every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
329000	332000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
332000	336000	At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
336000	338000	And thanks to all you guys who do turn out live
338000	341000	Or who do listen to us in the podcast
341000	343000	Speaking of Vognetwork
343000	345000	Are the brownies like really, really good?
345000	346000	Alright, I'm about to eat one
346000	348000	Okay, I want to try one in a minute
348000	350000	But I have to talk about Vognetwork things
350000	351000	Because this is really exciting
351000	352000	Fine, you can talk and we'll eat
352000	354000	Fine, sounds good, alright
354000	355000	So
355000	356000	I think I need new pants
356000	358000	Last week on the show
358000	364000	I complained that I wanted the Vognetwork website to have something
364000	367000	And that was the ability to have instant polls
367000	370000	So we could go and actually ask the listeners questions
370000	372000	And actually poll them instantly
372000	375000	Well, Bobby Black Wolf, in celebration of our 500th episode
375000	378000	Has made that a reality
378000	382000	So for all you guys that are right there on live.vognetwork.com
382000	384000	Because it's the only place you're going to see it
384000	387000	So if you're tuned into IRC via MIRC or something
387000	389000	Make sure you bring up live.vognetwork.com
389000	392000	You don't need to refresh the page or anything like that
392000	394000	This is going to happen automatically
395000	397000	But it is time
397000	398000	For the very first time
398000	403000	We are going to go to our live audience poll
406000	407000	Dork
407000	412000	Alright, tonight in the very first Vognetwork live poll
412000	415000	We are going to settle the great debate once and for all
415000	417000	Because we have to start with an epic question
417000	419000	So here it is
419000	420000	Tonight's question
420000	423000	Let us settle the great debate once and for all
423000	425000	Cake or pie?
428000	431000	Let us settle the great debate once and for all
431000	433000	Cake or pie?
436000	439000	There it is up there at live.vognetwork.com
439000	441000	You can participate right now and vote in the poll
441000	442000	And look at this
442000	443000	How cool is this
443000	445000	We see the results live as they come in
445000	447000	It's all tied up right now
447000	449000	Oh, cake just pulled ahead a little bit
450000	452000	This is the most amazing thing ever
452000	454000	Bobby is a genius
454000	455000	He's great
455000	456000	Alright, so there it is
456000	458000	Let us settle the great debate once and for all
458000	459000	Cake or pie?
459000	461000	We will read the results here momentarily
461000	464000	But it does look like cake is quite a bit ahead here in the live poll
464000	465000	Alright
465000	467000	Moving on
467000	469000	What else do I want to talk about tonight?
469000	471000	We have the new feature that I want to talk about
471000	477000	Anything you guys want to say in acknowledgement of our 500th episode?
477000	479000	What the fuck are we doing?
480000	481000	Look at your life
481000	483000	Look at your choices
484000	486000	Well said
486000	488000	I'm going to go drink now
488000	489000	I want to drink too
489000	491000	That poll is going to be too distracting
491000	492000	Because it's just
492000	494000	I have to keep watching it change
494000	496000	I know right
496000	498000	It's, it's, it's
498000	499000	Hypnotic
499000	501000	It's hypnotic to watch
501000	502000	Alright
502000	503000	That's awesome
503000	505000	Yeah, I love how it lives up
505000	506000	We are going to be required now
506000	507000	They'll use that sound clip though
507000	508000	Every time we do an instant poll
508000	509000	That was the plan
509000	510000	Oh sweet
510000	511000	So
511000	513000	Do brownies count as cake?
513000	514000	That's a good question
514000	516000	Maybe I should have added brownies to the list
516000	517000	Oh well
517000	518000	But what does ice cream cake count as?
518000	519000	I guess cake
519000	520000	It's not real cake
520000	522000	But what about pudding filled cake?
522000	524000	Like Boston cream pie
524000	526000	It's called a pie but it really has cake bits
526000	528000	Okay, you're making it too fucking complicated lady
528000	529000	So
529000	534000	I didn't see Boston cream pie as one of the options of cake versus pie so
534000	536000	Uh oh, here go hell come
536000	537000	So
537000	539000	And of course how thoughtful
539000	541000	Oh hi Alan
541000	542000	Hi
542000	545000	What did you just set down in front of me here in studio?
545000	547000	Take a whiff of it, smell it
547000	549000	Oh god
549000	551000	Oh my god it's that stuff I can't have
551000	553000	I'm getting drunk just smelling it
553000	554000	It has to smell how awful it is
554000	555000	You want to smell it?
555000	558000	This is a present from Brad from Pod Culture
558000	559000	Our pals
559000	561000	Thank god it smells more like whiskey than it does like cinnamon
561000	562000	Um
562000	563000	Do you want to smell it at all?
563000	564000	Alright
564000	566000	Uh, Alan do you want to introduce the drink?
566000	568000	Yes it's fireball whiskey
568000	570000	The bottle art is amazing
570000	572000	And we don't have anything for a chaser really
572000	574000	So I got you a glass of water
574000	576000	Apple juice I think would have been really good
576000	578000	But we don't have any so
578000	579000	I forgot to make apple pie
579000	580000	We poll
580000	581000	Um
581000	582000	Chase it with a brownie
582000	583000	Alright so uh
583000	584000	You have to chase it with a brownie
584000	586000	I'll chase it with a brownie but here's the thing
586000	588000	When was the last time we did drinking on OLR?
588000	589000	It was a very long time ago
589000	592000	I don't know but I remember one time I ate half a box of waffles
592000	594000	If I didn't have to take my son to uh
594000	596000	You know to school every morning
596000	598000	I would have totally you know
598000	599000	I know
599000	600000	Crashed but um
600000	601000	I forgot to take tomorrow off work
601000	605000	I remember when uh you had the uh tequila binge
605000	606000	That was kind of hilarious
606000	607000	I don't drink tequila
607000	608000	You did once
608000	609000	No I didn't
609000	611000	Or was it vodka?
611000	612000	It's always vodka
612000	614000	I could swear it was tequila but okay
614000	616000	Remember he married a Russian chick
616000	617000	It's always vodka right?
617000	618000	And
618000	619000	She doesn't drink anything
619000	620000	She likes rum
620000	624000	Are you ready to launch into your gaming week if Rob ends up in a coughing fit after he does the shot?
624000	626000	Get the first news story ready
626000	627000	I'm ready
627000	628000	Um
628000	630000	Don't we have a disclaimer we usually give during drinking shows?
630000	631000	Um
631000	632000	Don't drink and drive
632000	633000	I live here so I can drink
633000	634000	Um
634000	635000	Don't be irresponsible
635000	636000	Uh
636000	638000	And keep it in your pants
638000	639000	Yeah
639000	641000	Drink moderately

647000	650000	Okay so here's my cheers to all you non drinkers
650000	651000	Can you toast me with something?

706000	712000	No not really I don't have anything I want to say
712000	714000	Technically Rob just had a double
714000	721000	Just that I wish that the wife was capable of taking the son to school so then I could partake but yeah
721000	723000	I said I cannot
724000	731000	Alright I just really want to thank everybody for you know supporting our show and being here
731000	738000	And you know it would have been great to do like a giant convention for our 500th episode and just have you all in one room
738000	740000	But you know money
740000	741000	My apartment ain't that big
741000	743000	Exactly exactly
743000	745000	We're happy to just have you all here and chat with us
745000	749000	I do want to acknowledge this as well because this is like the most awesome thing that ever awesomed
749000	752000	This is something that one of our listeners Code Man
752000	754000	I need to take a picture of that too
754000	759000	Who would you who has a who has a YouTube channel and I'm a horrible person because I can't remember the name of it right now
759000	761000	But hopefully somebody will dig it up and post it in chat
761000	765000	But Code Man is a graphic artist like Dark Sakura
765000	770000	But he designed this really amazing poster to commemorate our 500th episode
770000	773000	And Jamie's going to put a picture of it right now at orange-radio.com
773000	777000	Yeah I might start reposting stuff just to tell him because it will take less time
777000	779000	I believe his channel is Ratchet 1785
779000	782000	Thank you you're very Tiger Claw tonight I love it
782000	786000	Alright so it's a poster to commemorate our 500th episode
787000	790000	What's awesome about this is that he's drawn us as these little chibi characters
790000	794000	And Dark Sakura is like an N7 trooper, she's basically femshep
794000	797000	Loki is Grand Theft Auto and he's got a bloody baseball bat
797000	800000	And I'm World of Warcraft and look guys look
800000	803000	I'm flaming there with my hand
803000	805000	And we have a ferret with dynamite strapped to him
805000	808000	But you know what I really love about this is that if you look at the background
808000	811000	He layered a bunch of listener names in the background
811000	815000	I don't know where he got this list of names because I recognize old and new names in there
815000	819000	Like I look at this list and I go okay Jim Sally of course I know who he is
819000	824000	But then I'm like Roboboy430 I haven't seen that name in years
824000	827000	So I think he did like a combination of people from like
827000	831000	The wiki as well as people he's seen in our chatroom and so forth
831000	835000	So you guys are all a part of this poster as well which I think is just amazing
835000	839000	He should sell prints of it I really wouldn't care and I think he'd make some good money
839000	841000	So I bet a lot of you guys would like that
841000	847000	Alright so oh Tigerclaw found it it's C Taylor 1785
847000	849000	Thank you Codeman he also does
849000	852000	Oh you know what he co-hosts a show called Down for Maintenance I should plug that
852000	855000	And it has very good artwork go figure
855000	857000	So thank you Codeman for that
857000	860000	Should we go to the results of our poll?
860000	863000	Sure by the way some of the photos are already up they're just being slow
863000	864000	Okay
864000	866000	At the very top of OrangeDawnsRadio.com
866000	869000	Alright here it is the results of our poll we're gonna go ahead and end it now
869000	871000	So if you didn't get in too bad
871000	873000	The results of the poll was
873000	875000	Cake 1
875000	881000	And cake was 62.86% to pie 37.14%
881000	883000	You all pissed me off
883000	885000	Alright
885000	886000	Just kidding
886000	889000	Alright I'm finally gonna eat one of these brownies I think it's about
889000	891000	I think it's about time to get into our gaming week
891000	894000	So DarkSakura how was your gaming week?
894000	896000	My gaming week was semi-productive
897000	899000	I really didn't play like a whole lot of stuff
899000	902000	But I did play some more drunken robot pornography
902000	904000	That game is so fun I swear
904000	908000	Okay everybody in the world by now should know how much I love Jumping Flash
908000	911000	It's Jumping Flash with guns and giant robots
911000	917000	And really really good music the game is crack I cannot wait for more of it to come out
917000	920000	I also played something that I'm not allowed to talk about
920000	925000	So I'm not gonna except I will totally leave one game for this one
926000	928000	That's all I can say
931000	935000	Oh yeah I played Minecraft I actually streamed me playing Minecraft so I could show off my house
935000	938000	Or I should say my underground bunker
938000	941000	So that I can hide from everybody else no one can find my house
941000	944000	You've been getting really into this streaming thing lately
944000	947000	I've more or less just wanted to get it to work
947000	950000	Because Dan and I have a plan
950000	953000	I'll go ahead and do like a semi-announcement
953000	957000	Dan and I have a plan to start doing classic gaming stuff on Twitch TV
957000	961000	And I'm trying to decide if Twitch or livestream works better
961000	966000	But we want to eventually get it to where we can run our capture card into
966000	971000	Well we get a capture card to run the video game systems through the PC
971000	976000	And then have everything run off of the main monitor while we
976000	980000	Sorry the liquor is starting to hit me so if I start smiling for no reason just ignore it
980000	983000	I was like Rob I'm feeling good
984000	988000	By the way I like never drink anymore so the fact that I had that is
988000	992000	I have no tolerance I have the alcohol tolerance of a
992000	994000	Oh Jaylinx you are hilarious
994000	995000	Of a child
995000	1000000	But yeah so I've just been practicing like with different things
1000000	1004000	Like lately I've just been streaming playing Mass Effect 2
1004000	1009000	Because there's a couple people who watched it who just completely skipped it and are playing 3
1009000	1011000	So like no no no fixing this
1011000	1016000	And then I was playing Drunken Robot Pornography and I've been doing some drawing you know
1016000	1019000	I tested out the webcam with it but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing webcam stuff
1019000	1023000	Now I don't know if you heard Cyl on Horde House this week which we all love Cyl
1023000	1024000	I love Cyl
1024000	1027000	She's the best but she was talking about some of her experiences in livestreaming
1027000	1031000	And how you know because she has the webcam on her and she's very resilient
1031000	1035000	And able to do that because she gets all these trolls coming in there going you know take your top off
1035000	1040000	Will you do you know will you make out with a German chick will you do mouth to ass
1040000	1045000	Will you do so yeah have you put your mug out there
1045000	1046000	No
1046000	1048000	Okay you probably don't want to
1048000	1052000	I had it pointing at a piece of paper
1052000	1056000	Don't take that the wrong way you're a very pretty lady and I don't think you give yourself enough credit
1056000	1062000	But there's just too many people on the internet that are crazy horny
1062000	1066000	Yeah they're crazy horny
1066000	1070000	Well fortunately none of them are my problem
1070000	1076000	But thank you Jason I will look into the black magic capture card
1076000	1083000	But no I was just practicing you know doing stuff and trying out different things
1083000	1088000	Because I think that what we're going to do is we're also going to maybe try to start bringing up you know
1088000	1093000	Stuff that's actually in our collection like lovely pajamas Rob
1093000	1099000	Like we have a whole lot of deluxe editions of games like for example the cyber bots limited edition
1099000	1105000	And that stupid card capture soccer game that I had to have and played once it came with a damn pillowcase
1105000	1115000	But we're just really wanting to and part of it is to we might actually be selling off part of the collection
1115000	1117000	Legasp
1117000	1124000	Legasp I'm talking about like the stuff that we actually don't play which you know would probably be the Neo Geo CD and the Intellivision
1124000	1137000	That's probably about it but yeah I still haven't decided what I'm going to use the rest of it for right now until we get this officially started
1137000	1144000	But Dan and I have been in the works talking about doing something like that for Twitch just because you know we're inspired by like classic game room
1144000	1149000	And the angry video game nerd which I just think that guy is absolutely hilarious
1149000	1154000	It didn't make our show roll tonight but I heard something about he's getting his own game or something or was it a movie or a game or what?
1154000	1155000	He did a movie already
1155000	1159000	He did a movie already because they had a kickstarter for the movie and it was so dumb but it was great
1159000	1160000	Yeah the movie looked ridiculous
1160000	1163000	The movie was absolutely ridiculous but it was hilarious too
1163000	1169000	Okay I just want to point out when Becky just took that brownie she left these in the shape of a dick
1169000	1170000	Did you notice that?
1170000	1173000	You were so perverted because I was thinking they were in the shape of a T
1173000	1176000	No those are balls and that's the shaft
1176000	1179000	I have never seen a dick that read before
1179000	1180000	That is a letter T
1180000	1184000	You would have to do this to make it a cup
1184000	1185000	Now it's balls
1185000	1189000	That is a cross because this show needs Jesus right now
1189000	1194000	You know what? You know who needs Jesus Rob?
1194000	1198000	Sorry did I offend the Jew? My bad
1198000	1201000	You didn't offend the Jew
1201000	1203000	Now try harder
1203000	1205000	The atheist is here
1205000	1207000	The atheist is here
1207000	1214000	Well then let me just call Justin Bieber because then maybe Justin Bieber can really offend you
1214000	1218000	You know Rob I'm so disappointed
1218000	1221000	You're such a heathen
1221000	1223000	No I don't know I don't care
1223000	1227000	I'll eat a ball
1227000	1229000	Best nuts ever
1229000	1232000	You don't even want to see the disgusting thing I saw today by the way
1232000	1234000	Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?
1234000	1236000	While you chow down on those balls?
1236000	1239000	Tasty balls
1239000	1241000	Alright I'm done
1241000	1243000	Alright Becky
1243000	1244000	Oh yeah I played well
1244000	1245000	Okay now I'm done
1245000	1251000	Okay Becky I know you don't play a whole lot of games but I think Dark Sakura got you into a game recently right?
1252000	1258000	God she got me into Mass Effect and it has sucked away my whole damn life
1258000	1259000	True
1259000	1261000	One of us one of us
1261000	1263000	You're welcome
1263000	1265000	Alright femshep or mailshep?
1265000	1270000	Femshep I have done a broshep I call it broshep because mailshep sounds weird
1270000	1276000	But I did a playthrough just because it was the only way I could romance Jack
1276000	1278000	Fair enough fair enough
1279000	1282000	I don't get why Jack wasn't a crazy lesbian hookup
1282000	1284000	I don't get it either
1284000	1285000	Doesn't make any sense
1285000	1286000	I would have gone for it
1286000	1290000	Who is your romance of choice? Because I know and I think it's a good one
1290000	1291000	Who is your romance of choice?
1291000	1292000	Thane
1292000	1298000	Now Thane kind of they really screwed with him in Mass Effect 3 by you know spoilers killing him off
1298000	1300000	The game is a year old now right?
1300000	1306000	But they tried to make things right with the Citadel DLC were you happy with what they did?
1306000	1310000	I was very happy with it because it never actually bothered me that he died
1310000	1314000	I mean he had a terminal illness if he hadn't died I would have found it stupid
1314000	1316000	I like that they let him die
1316000	1317000	It was realistic
1317000	1319000	In a heroic kind of way
1319000	1325000	What pissed me off was that nobody said they were sorry for your loss if you romanced him
1325000	1332000	I mean Garris is there at the memorial wall standing right in front of his name and doesn't say a word about it
1332000	1334000	And that was the part that pissed me off
1334000	1338000	So actually getting to have a memorial service made me very happy
1338000	1344000	Yeah and I have to admit I did watch the whole thing on YouTube and watching the videos
1344000	1346000	Because there's an extra video
1346000	1348000	Because you find out that Thane
1348000	1350000	This really isn't that bad of a spoiler you guys
1350000	1352000	You find out that Thane made all these videos
1352000	1353000	Well he said he did
1353000	1358000	Yeah and no matter if you romance him or not you get to see most of the videos
1358000	1361000	But if you romance him there's an extra video you get to see it
1361000	1363000	I have to admit I got a little choked up
1363000	1369000	And what especially got me was the goodbye scene at the very end when they're all getting back on the ship
1369000	1371000	I was like
1371000	1373000	The feels, the feels
1373000	1375000	I cried like a little girl
1375000	1380000	I copied off Becky's save files from her Xbox so that I could mod her Shepard
1380000	1388000	And so I played through all of the memorial and everything with her Shepard
1388000	1391000	Which it's always very weird playing somebody else's Shepard
1391000	1396000	But yeah I actually had to go get tissues and cuddle the cat for a little while
1396000	1398000	Because like ehhh
1398000	1400000	Technus in our chat room says
1400000	1404000	I think Jack being either bi or a lesbian would have been kind of cliche IMO
1404000	1406000	But Breakman corrects and says
1406000	1408000	It is part of Jack's backstory
1408000	1411000	She was in a relationship with a man and a woman
1411000	1414000	And that's again live.vognetwork.com
1414000	1415000	And Extover says
1415000	1417000	There goes any interest I had in playing the game too
1417000	1419000	Oh shush
1419000	1421000	Shush ya haters
1421000	1423000	Alright
1423000	1427000	Any other games that you've been into besides space operas
1427000	1431000	I've been adventure time
1431000	1434000	They do have adventure time DS games
1434000	1439000	Watching my son play a lot of adventure time and screaming at the computer
1439000	1443000	Is kind of adorable to watch an almost six year old going
1443000	1445000	Stupid computer stop that
1445000	1447000	You're not supposed to do that
1447000	1449000	It's so cute
1449000	1451000	It's so interesting watching kids now
1451000	1453000	When like you know back in my day
1453000	1455000	When I was six we had Commodore 64
1455000	1457000	And that was cutting edge
1457000	1459000	But now you know
1459000	1461000	Wow you had Commodore 64 when you were six
1461000	1463000	You're such a baby
1469000	1471000	Becky had to play with sticks
1476000	1477000	Alright
1477000	1479000	Assuming there's nothing else for Becky's gaming week
1479000	1480000	Let me go over to Loki
1480000	1482000	Loki how was your gaming week?
1482000	1483000	I played
1483000	1484000	Let's see
1484000	1486000	Lots of Saints Row of the Third actually
1486000	1488000	We've been trying to go through and 100%
1488000	1490000	100% almost everything
1490000	1491000	I guess it would be 98%
1491000	1493000	Because I don't want to play all the co-op stuff
1493000	1496000	I don't really want to play through the game for like a fourth time
1496000	1498000	It would just be so annoying
1498000	1501000	So I finished up the DLC stuff
1501000	1503000	I'm actually finishing up right now
1504000	1507000	The Gangstas in Space DLC
1507000	1509000	Which is alright
1509000	1511000	It's like the first DLC really sucked
1511000	1513000	And the other two were okay
1513000	1515000	They weren't necessarily like
1515000	1517000	I mean they were still kind of side missions
1517000	1519000	But they at least dressed them up a little bit more
1519000	1522000	And they're just so short
1522000	1524000	They're like three missions long
1524000	1525000	And that's it
1525000	1527000	It's like ten minute missions
1527000	1529000	And thirty minutes for like seven bucks initially
1529000	1531000	Kind of a rip off
1531000	1533000	So whatever
1533000	1535000	So I'm playing The Room
1535000	1539000	And hopefully I'll be done with it pretty soon
1539000	1542000	I'll finish the game and get all my achievements on Steam
1542000	1545000	And move on to something else
1545000	1547000	They have been playing Defiance
1547000	1548000	More of that
1548000	1551000	And actually still don't really know too much about
1551000	1553000	What's going on in the world
1553000	1555000	It's hard for me to follow
1555000	1557000	But the game is very similar to Borderlands
1557000	1561000	For example if you take a franchise you love
1561000	1562000	And then you think
1562000	1565000	Oh hey look there's a sci-fi rip off of that franchise
1565000	1567000	That's what Defiance is for Borderlands
1567000	1570000	It's basically a sci-fi rip off of Borderlands
1570000	1572000	And they've got all these different weapons
1572000	1574000	That you can use and stuff
1574000	1577000	And it's not necessarily that you specialize in anything
1577000	1579000	But the more you use a weapon
1579000	1580000	The better
1580000	1582000	Well eventually it gets better
1582000	1584000	And the more you use a weapon
1584000	1585000	The better
1585000	1587000	Well eventually it gets better
1587000	1588000	And then
1588000	1591000	They have the different elemental stuff
1591000	1594000	And it's kind of hard to get good weapons in the game
1594000	1595000	I've found so far
1595000	1597000	Unless I'm not doing something right
1597000	1599000	But they have these lock boxes
1599000	1601000	That you basically scavenge parts
1601000	1603000	From killing people
1603000	1605000	Or taking weapons that you find
1605000	1608000	In loot and breaking them down into parts
1608000	1610000	And then you use those parts to buy keys
1610000	1611000	And then using those keys
1611000	1615000	You buy these random loot chests I guess
1615000	1616000	That have two random weapons
1616000	1619000	Which for my so far
1619000	1621000	Doing tier two and tier three chests
1621000	1623000	They've all sucked
1623000	1624000	So
1625000	1626000	That's kind of lame
1627000	1629000	You were telling me about the TV show beforehand
1629000	1631000	And Tigerclaw is saying some stuff in our chatroom about that
1631000	1633000	Did you watch the TV show?
1633000	1634000	I haven't watched the TV show
1634000	1636000	I don't even know if it's on yet
1636000	1638000	But one thing I did know
1639000	1642000	Strudels89 in our chatroom says I think it airs in a week or so
1642000	1643000	I think it's coming soon
1643000	1644000	Monday
1644000	1646000	I think it's this week
1646000	1647000	Either Monday or Tuesday
1647000	1648000	I think it's airing
1648000	1649000	But here's the thing
1649000	1653000	They are trying so hard to almost be like a Battlestar Galactica
1653000	1654000	Or something like that
1654000	1656000	Like I was mentioning they have their own lingo
1656000	1658000	Or their own slang I guess
1658000	1661000	To be fair it's by the creators of Battlestar Galactica
1661000	1662000	Okay so
1662000	1663000	That is quite fair
1663000	1664000	So at least they're ripping themselves off
1664000	1665000	Yes they're ripping themselves off
1665000	1667000	But they're kind of forcing it a little bit
1667000	1671000	Because you know in Battlestar Galactica one of the most recognizable things
1671000	1673000	Is the use of the word frack instead of fuck
1673000	1677000	Well now they're trying to do the same type of thing for Defiance
1677000	1679000	Except they're kind of taking it even further
1679000	1681000	They have two words
1681000	1683000	Shtaco is one of them
1683000	1685000	Which is I guess equatable to shit
1685000	1687000	And so they say that a lot in the show
1687000	1688000	They're just like
1688000	1690000	What you're trying to be a fucking Battlestar Galactica
1690000	1692000	I mean seriously what's going on here
1692000	1694000	But anyways the game itself
1694000	1696000	It's kind of fun
1696000	1700000	I like the fact that you can kind of just run around and do whatever
1700000	1702000	I've been playing solo through the whole thing
1702000	1703000	But there's
1703000	1706000	The way it kind of works is if you happen to go into an area
1706000	1708000	Say you're doing a mission or something like that
1708000	1711000	And you're going into an area and someone else is also there doing a mission as well
1711000	1714000	You kind of get credit for it if you go and help them and stuff
1714000	1716000	So you can almost like
1716000	1718000	It's almost like partying but not
1718000	1720000	But you can actually party in the game I just don't
1721000	1724000	And then these arc fall things that happen
1724000	1726000	Which are a little repetitive but
1726000	1727000	They're pretty hard
1727000	1729000	And you have like you know
1729000	1731000	30 or 40 people just
1731000	1734000	Trying to take down like a massive alien or something
1734000	1738000	And that's kind of fun you get a lot of experience doing that
1738000	1740000	But basically I mean the whole like
1740000	1742000	Look of the game is very bland
1742000	1744000	I guess like I don't recognize
1744000	1746000	It's not like this is supposed to be San Francisco
1746000	1748000	And driving around I couldn't tell you
1748000	1750000	Like
1750000	1752000	I don't see any landmarks that I recognize
1752000	1754000	Well it's the future
1754000	1756000	Well it's the future
1756000	1758000	Nuclear war and all that you know it changes things
1758000	1760000	It's just it's kind of bland
1760000	1762000	But here's the thing who cares if it looks bland
1762000	1765000	It's fun I'm having fun with it so
1765000	1767000	Yeah
1767000	1769000	And I have not paid any money for
1769000	1772000	Because you can pay money to get a lot of things in the game
1772000	1774000	Not necessarily anything that's going to help
1774000	1776000	I mean you can buy I guess you know
1776000	1778000	Tokens that give you more experience
1778000	1780000	Like go up your experience by 10% or something like that
1780000	1782000	Or money drops or weapon drops
1782000	1784000	And that kind of thing
1784000	1786000	Or they will have like you know customizable things
1786000	1788000	To make your character look
1788000	1790000	Because right now my character looks like a 50 year old
1790000	1792000	Trying to look like a teenager
1792000	1794000	And it looks stupid
1794000	1796000	But I don't care because I don't really look at my avatar that much
1796000	1798000	He's facing the other way
1798000	1800000	But I swear to god there's like no customization
1800000	1802000	As far as how they look
1802000	1804000	They all look like some weird fucked up person
1804000	1806000	But that's fine
1806000	1808000	Because you can get a suit that covers their face up
1808000	1810000	And you'll ever see them again
1810000	1812000	I'm kind of surprised at all the hate for
1812000	1814000	Battlestar Galactica in our chat room
1814000	1816000	5th Dream in our chat says
1816000	1818000	70's Battlestar Galactica is only Battlestar Galactica
1818000	1820000	Brad from Pod Cultures asked
1820000	1822000	Good Battlestar Galactica
1822000	1824000	Remake Battlestar Galactica
1824000	1826000	I like the new Battlestar Galactica an awful lot
1826000	1828000	I guess I'm just crazy
1828000	1830000	But yeah it's fun
1830000	1832000	I just wish more people play
1832000	1834000	The only person I know that plays the game
1834000	1836000	Other than me on 360
1836000	1838000	I have a friend I met a long time ago
1838000	1840000	Matt who works at
1840000	1842000	Zappos actually
1842000	1844000	Oh rad the shoe plays
1844000	1846000	He was one of the line directors
1846000	1848000	There so
1848000	1850000	He plays
1850000	1852000	I friended him on Xbox a while ago
1852000	1854000	That's the only guy I know that plays that game
1854000	1856000	I think it's fun
1856000	1858000	Buy to play
1858000	1860000	There's no monthly fees
1860000	1862000	If you're running into Xbox
1862000	1864000	Outages like we had this week
1864000	1866000	You know it's not a big deal
1866000	1868000	Because hey I can just play later on
1868000	1870000	And that's kind of the thing I like about it
1870000	1872000	And the other thing I saw that was kind of cool
1872000	1874000	They have a lot of these
1874000	1876000	Different things just like in Borderlands
1876000	1878000	How you do different things like kill
1878000	1880000	Kill people in an assault rifle
1880000	1882000	Go to these places
1882000	1884000	Do this type of mission or something like that
1884000	1886000	And once you complete
1886000	1888000	All these challenges or whatever you experience
1888000	1890000	Well they have it broken up
1890000	1892000	Season 1 is all these
1892000	1894000	Different challenges so they're going to have different challenges
1894000	1896000	For the next season and I think actually
1896000	1898000	The whole game is going to change for season 2
1898000	1900000	So whatever happens on the show
1900000	1902000	Is going to reflect in the game and vice versa
1902000	1904000	Like if
1904000	1906000	I don't really know if there's any competing factions
1906000	1908000	Or anything right now but if they have something like that
1908000	1910000	It may reflect on the show
1910000	1912000	So it's interesting so far
1912000	1914000	I think
1914000	1916000	So I'm going to play a little more of that
1916000	1918000	And then the other thing I played that I really probably shouldn't be playing
1918000	1920000	Because it's
1920000	1922000	I think piracy
1922000	1924000	I mean we shouldn't really talk about it
1924000	1926000	Shame on you
1926000	1928000	Whatever I'm buying the game when it comes out anyways
1928000	1930000	But I wanted to play it early so that's
1930000	1932000	As long as you're going to buy it
1932000	1934000	I'm going to buy it so
1934000	1936000	The gameplay was Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
1936000	1938000	It's fucking awesome
1938000	1940000	Is that the Xbox Live one?
1940000	1942000	It's Xbox Live
1942000	1944000	PlayStation Network and Steam
1944000	1946000	It's going to be amazing
1946000	1948000	It's 15 bucks when it comes out on the first
1948000	1950000	It's going to be fantastic
1950000	1952000	It got leaked out earlier this week
1952000	1954000	Because of some hack on Uplay and stuff
1954000	1956000	So I had to try because I watch all the trailers
1956000	1958000	I watch gameplay footage and I'm like I gotta play this game
1958000	1960000	And it's just
1960000	1962000	It's so awesome
1962000	1964000	This is basically a developer making a game
1964000	1966000	They're like okay you guys make a game that's fun
1966000	1968000	That you guys want to play
1968000	1970000	It's just so fucking
1970000	1972000	Why aren't all video games?
1972000	1974000	It's just so cheesy though
1974000	1976000	Shouldn't that be the mindset that goes into any game?
1976000	1978000	But it's just so cheesy
1978000	1980000	It's basically this cliche
1980000	1984000	B science fiction type plot
1984000	1988000	That takes place in the year 2007
1988000	1990000	And it's
1990000	1992000	A lot of the details they have
1992000	1994000	First off they kind of poke fun at themselves
1994000	1996000	With the whole tutorial thing
1996000	1998000	Basically you drop down
1998000	2000000	To invade this base
2000000	2004000	And your partner
2004000	2006000	He kind of trolls you
2006000	2008000	By enabling this tutorial mode
2008000	2010000	In your suit
2010000	2012000	And so through the entire tutorial
2012000	2014000	Which is giving you stupid commands
2014000	2016000	And just breaking it down
2016000	2018000	Jumping allows you to
2018000	2020000	Change your orientation
2020000	2022000	Along the Z axis
2022000	2024000	Weird stuff like that
2024000	2026000	So he's just like I hate these tutorials
2026000	2028000	This is stupid I just want to kill somebody
2028000	2030000	It's kind of funny
2030000	2032000	And then there was also
2032000	2034000	Like a part where that guy is
2034000	2036000	Hacking this missile guidance system
2036000	2038000	Thing and all the jargon
2038000	2040000	He's throwing out
2040000	2042000	I'm hacking the motherboard
2042000	2044000	I'm doing this to this
2044000	2046000	It's just all completely
2046000	2048000	Obviously made up jargon
2048000	2050000	It's just hilarious though
2050000	2052000	And then they reference stuff that no one has any idea
2052000	2054000	What they're talking about
2054000	2056000	It's just like that time in South America
2056000	2058000	Yeah and then they go in there
2058000	2060000	And then also
2060000	2062000	I like how his partner
2062000	2064000	Uses the phrase
2064000	2066000	Motherfucker a lot
2066000	2068000	Because he's the cliche
2068000	2070000	Black action hero guy
2070000	2072000	Like we're gonna get those motherfuckers
2072000	2074000	You know
2074000	2076000	It's just awesome
2076000	2078000	Is Samuel L. Jackson voicing him?
2078000	2080000	I'm imagining those words coming out
2080000	2082000	Like if it was a comic panel in the same font
2082000	2084000	As I'm gonna get you sucka
2084000	2086000	Pretty much like that
2086000	2088000	And here's the best part about it
2088000	2090000	All just like old PC
2090000	2092000	Animated cutscenes like they're all static
2092000	2094000	Images that they're moving around and stuff like that
2094000	2096000	It looks just like an old NES game or something
2096000	2098000	Seriously it is an awesome
2098000	2100000	If you like Far Cry
2100000	2102000	Pick it up it's like 15 bucks it's great
2102000	2104000	The island's still pretty big
2104000	2106000	They have blood dragons
2106000	2108000	Which are cybernetic like
2108000	2110000	Dinosaur things that shoot lasers out of their eyes
2110000	2112000	And they're cyber panthers
2112000	2114000	Cyber panthers
2114000	2116000	I want a cyber panther
2116000	2118000	Yes I don't
2118000	2120000	I don't normally condone piracy but
2120000	2122000	This is a game that I was gonna pick up anyway
2122000	2124000	You just couldn't wait
2124000	2126000	I couldn't wait
2126000	2128000	I was already planning on
2128000	2130000	Picking it up on Xbox Live or Steam
2130000	2132000	Because I'm multi platform for some reason
2132000	2134000	You just gotta have achievements
2134000	2136000	I do
2136000	2138000	Anything else for your gaming week?
2138000	2140000	That's it
2140000	2142000	My gaming week pretty quick
2142000	2144000	Not a whole lot of new stuff
2144000	2146000	That freaking addicting
2146000	2148000	Jetpack joyride
2148000	2150000	If you're still listening you suck for getting me addicted to that
2150000	2152000	Also World of Warcraft
2152000	2154000	Been working on PVP
2154000	2156000	My character's level 65 now
2156000	2158000	I did try some new IOS
2158000	2160000	Games this week I wanted to plug real quick
2160000	2162000	Talk about a couple of them
2162000	2164000	I know some people don't really consider the iPhone
2164000	2166000	Games actual games
2166000	2168000	But whatever deal
2168000	2170000	I'd like to see them play through
2170000	2172000	Escabagaluda
2172000	2174000	These games are not quite as tricky as Escabagaluda
2174000	2176000	But I want to talk about them anyway
2176000	2178000	To be fair I've been playing them on my iPad 3
2178000	2180000	Which is the new iPad
2180000	2182000	But not the newest iPad
2182000	2184000	The first one is called
2184000	2186000	Puzzle and Dragons
2186000	2188000	Which apparently is a big hit over in Japan
2188000	2190000	Yeah I was about to say
2190000	2192000	Isn't that like a rehash of the old
2192000	2194000	Yeah it's partially a puzzle game
2194000	2196000	Mixed with Pokemon
2196000	2198000	It's an interesting little puzzler
2198000	2200000	And it has Pokemon elements in it
2200000	2202000	Where you can kind of combine
2202000	2204000	Which is funny because the combining elements
2204000	2206000	Was very similar to what I saw in that card game
2206000	2208000	Guardian Cross
2208000	2210000	From Square Enix that I got into
2210000	2212000	A couple of weeks ago
2212000	2214000	Overall Puzzle and Dragons
2214000	2216000	I didn't really care for it
2216000	2218000	The puzzle mechanic part of it
2218000	2220000	I didn't think was very good
2220000	2222000	Because you touch to move things
2222000	2224000	And line them up in 3's
2224000	2226000	And that doesn't attack
2226000	2228000	But you can literally move them anywhere
2228000	2230000	And you end up building up combos
2230000	2232000	And things like that to ultimately be able to take out enemies
2232000	2234000	But the challenge really wasn't there
2234000	2236000	And it felt like a bit of a grind
2236000	2238000	Fest and I just wasn't a fan
2238000	2240000	I would have to see it because I remember something about it being
2240000	2242000	Related to the
2242000	2244000	What was that game?
2244000	2246000	I actually did it as a classic game ages ago
2246000	2248000	The Puzzle and Desu
2248000	2250000	Oh yeah yeah yeah
2250000	2252000	Because that's where I heard about it
2252000	2254000	Because somebody was comparing the two
2254000	2256000	It could be but I didn't play the other one
2256000	2258000	So I couldn't tell you
2258000	2260000	Overall Puzzle and Dragons
2260000	2262000	It entertained me for a couple of evenings
2262000	2264000	But I'm kind of already over it
2264000	2266000	The puzzle mechanic isn't enough
2266000	2268000	To keep me interested in it
2268000	2270000	I'm sorry to say
2270000	2272000	I also checked out Nimble Quest
2272000	2274000	Which if you guys know Nimble Bit
2274000	2276000	They made Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes
2276000	2278000	Which you know hello crack
2278000	2280000	But this new game is actually nothing like those games
2280000	2282000	It still has the whole 8 bit feel
2282000	2284000	But they basically created a new version
2284000	2286000	Of Snake and they are not
2286000	2288000	They even say in the tutorial
2288000	2290000	Remember this game and they show the little cell phone
2290000	2292000	Picture of Snake and
2292000	2294000	That's basically what they've created but what you do
2294000	2296000	Is that instead of picking up
2296000	2298000	Squares that make your Snake longer
2298000	2300000	You pick up more heroes
2300000	2302000	And some will throw fireballs, some use swords
2302000	2304000	Some have bombs
2304000	2306000	You know and that's kind of the gist to it
2306000	2308000	And the other guys
2308000	2310000	Running around might try to attack you
2310000	2312000	So it's all about maneuvering
2312000	2314000	Not running into yourself
2314000	2316000	And kind of being in the right place
2316000	2318000	To use different attacks
2318000	2320000	It's very addicting
2320000	2322000	How long will it take Zinga to steal it?
2322000	2324000	I'm sure they've already worked on it
2324000	2326000	They're already working on it right now
2326000	2328000	So you know it's also free to play
2328000	2330000	So you can download it for free
2330000	2332000	You level up your characters
2332000	2334000	And they can get stronger but of course
2334000	2336000	If you spend real money you can level them up real fast
2336000	2338000	That's kind of the catch
2338000	2340000	But overall I liked Nimble Quest quite a bit
2340000	2342000	The only thing I didn't like about it
2342000	2344000	Is that you go through the same
2344000	2346000	Levels over and over again
2346000	2348000	You start at level one
2348000	2350000	It's like you're going through the same levels over and over again
2350000	2352000	Which you know is fine that's how a video game works
2352000	2354000	But in a game like this you would
2354000	2356000	Sort of think at some point
2356000	2358000	I can either branch and go to different
2358000	2360000	Stages or I can resume
2360000	2362000	Where I died or something a little
2362000	2364000	Different I was a little disappointed
2364000	2366000	That that basic mechanic wasn't somehow
2366000	2368000	Improved on
2368000	2370000	The last game that I checked out this week
2370000	2372000	Which actually is probably my favorite of the three
2372000	2374000	Is not free to play it's a 99 cent game
2374000	2376000	It's called Slayin
2376000	2378000	And this game is really cute it's very 8-bit
2378000	2380000	Style and it's retro-tasticness
2380000	2382000	But um
2382000	2384000	Basically it's just got left arrow right arrow
2384000	2386000	And button and you move left move right
2386000	2388000	And jump and your character is a little
2388000	2390000	8-bit knight that constantly has a sword
2390000	2392000	Out in front of it and you can either move left
2392000	2394000	Or right and you're killing little
2394000	2396000	Slimes or you can jump in the air
2396000	2398000	And hit little flying skulls
2398000	2400000	And as I talk about it
2400000	2402000	It sounds like super basic but it's really
2402000	2404000	Addicting and the graphics are
2404000	2406000	Part of the charm the music
2406000	2408000	Is part of the charm I like how at the
2408000	2410000	End of the level you can upgrade weapons
2410000	2412000	And it even integrates
2412000	2414000	Game center where you can kind of see the tombstones
2414000	2416000	Of your friends where they died and so
2416000	2418000	Forth so I thought that was kind of
2418000	2420000	Cool so I
2420000	2422000	Yeah I like that one that was my favorite of the three
2422000	2424000	Is Slayin so out of
2424000	2426000	Those three that's the one I recommend but go figure
2426000	2428000	That's the only one that's not free but it's only 99 cents
2428000	2430000	So
2430000	2432000	Rastielutianchat asks
2432000	2434000	Why the hell does no one ever do 16-bit
2434000	2436000	Retro?
2436000	2438000	You see it once in a while
2438000	2440000	To the moon? Yeah
2440000	2442000	I would say maybe even Slayer
2442000	2444000	Looks a little more 16-bit
2444000	2446000	Than 8-bit it's somewhere in between
2446000	2448000	It's like a 12-bit
2448000	2450000	Like a turbo graphics game
2450000	2452000	Or something it's kind of a little bit in between
2452000	2454000	It's two 8-bit processors together
2454000	2456000	So there you go
2456000	2458000	That was really my gaming week just a bunch of iOS games
2458000	2460000	But you know that's one of the places people
2460000	2462000	Play games on now
2462000	2464000	To be honest that's where I'm doing a lot of
2464000	2466000	My handheld gaming I haven't touched
2466000	2468000	My DS and
2468000	2470000	Except when I cleaned it
2470000	2472000	Actually the last handheld system I played was a Winter Swan
2472000	2474000	Well I still have been playing Harmonite
2474000	2476000	But I talked about that last week already and of course
2476000	2478000	Swap Note but I'll talk about that later in the show
2478000	2480000	And you know there's still other three
2480000	2482000	I even booted up Kid Icarus 3D classics
2482000	2484000	The other day just because I love
2484000	2486000	Kid Icarus and the 3D remakes
2486000	2488000	Surprisingly good because they
2488000	2490000	Didn't change much besides
2490000	2492000	The backgrounds and
2492000	2494000	Giving it some 3D effects so it's really
2494000	2496000	Good so
2496000	2498000	Anyhow let's get into
2498000	2500000	Tonight's news
2500000	2502000	Yes we're going to do news tonight just like we always do
2502000	2504000	So let's have Loki start us off
2504000	2506000	Alright so
2506000	2508000	EA has
2508000	2510000	Let some people go and of course
2510000	2512000	They're not going to say who or
2512000	2514000	Why or where but they
2514000	2516000	Basically
2516000	2518000	Had layoffs and they're
2518000	2520000	Not seeing which teams they're coming from and that kind of sucks
2520000	2522000	But isn't some of that leaking out to the internet anyway?
2522000	2524000	Who it is?
2524000	2526000	Yeah I believe it was EA Montreal if I remember correctly
2526000	2528000	It was supposed to be
2528000	2530000	I think some of the people
2530000	2532000	That are affected by it
2534000	2536000	Yeah EA Mobile Montreal
2536000	2538000	So
2538000	2540000	I don't know
2540000	2542000	And they're saying that I guess
2542000	2544000	60 to 70 permanent employees
2544000	2546000	Were let go and I guess another
2546000	2548000	100 people working under contract
2548000	2550000	Were let go as well
2550000	2552000	Mostly QA testers
2552000	2554000	So
2554000	2556000	I don't know
2556000	2558000	It's just kind of a normal cycle because after all
2558000	2560000	EA did have a bunch of games
2560000	2562000	Just come out recently and like you know
2562000	2564000	Three
2564000	2566000	I want to say like three or four games
2566000	2568000	Yeah four games
2568000	2570000	I want to say that they just had Tiger Woods
2570000	2572000	Army had two
2572000	2574000	Dead Space 3 and
2574000	2576000	Crysis 3 so
2576000	2578000	It might just be that they're
2578000	2580000	You know
2580000	2582000	They're just slowing down right now
2582000	2584000	And so they don't need people because the only other game they have coming out right now
2584000	2586000	Is Fuse and then NCAA
2586000	2588000	Yeah but we're on the cusp of the new E3
2588000	2590000	And who knows what's being developed
2590000	2592000	For next gen systems
2592000	2594000	Battlefield
2594000	2596000	My guess is a lot of Bioware people
2596000	2598000	They've already ruined the IPs now it's time for the
2598000	2600000	Layoff phase
2600000	2602000	Another game coming out?
2602000	2604000	It's Mobile
2604000	2606000	Montreal
2606000	2608000	I don't know what exactly EA Mobile Montreal
2608000	2610000	Was doing
2610000	2612000	Facebook games
2612000	2614000	Bioware is working on at least
2614000	2616000	The Don't Call It Mass Effect 4 game
2616000	2618000	The Dragon
2618000	2620000	E3 and the Unknown
2620000	2622000	Game that the old Mass Effect
2622000	2624000	Team is doing because they are not doing Mass Effect 4
2624000	2626000	The multiplayer team is doing it
2626000	2628000	So we'll see
2628000	2630000	Probably at E3 get some more information about that
2630000	2632000	Yeah because EA
2632000	2634000	Montreal
2634000	2636000	Well Montreal is
2636000	2638000	Army at two
2638000	2640000	But that would be just EA Montreal
2640000	2642000	Not necessarily Mobile Montreal
2642000	2644000	What else have they worked on?
2644000	2646000	As long as our friends
2646000	2648000	Here locally at Bioware Sacramento
2648000	2650000	Are okay but I think they're doing a lot of
2650000	2652000	What were they before?
2652000	2654000	ClickNation
2654000	2656000	They do a lot of Facebook
2656000	2658000	They had a really popular Facebook game
2658000	2660000	That's why they got grabbed up
2660000	2662000	So I'm sure any Dragon Age
2662000	2664000	Mass Effect kind of like Facebook tie-ins
2664000	2666000	Or something they were probably working on
2666000	2668000	I don't know I've applied for them three times and they haven't hired me
2668000	2670000	Aw poor thing
2670000	2672000	Sorry Loki anything else?
2672000	2674000	Yes and unsurprisingly
2674000	2676000	In a row they have been voted the worst company
2676000	2678000	In America by Consumerist
2678000	2680000	Which is you know a poll
2680000	2682000	That they have on a website that people vote
2682000	2684000	That are consumers that visit the website
2684000	2686000	It is completely
2686000	2688000	Well all the nominations
2688000	2690000	Are done by people that review the website
2690000	2692000	And then they take the top 16
2692000	2694000	Or so nominations I think it's more than 16
2694000	2696000	32 and then they
2696000	2698000	Narrow it down from there
2698000	2700000	And this really seems to carry a lot more weight
2700000	2702000	Than it ought to like a lot of people
2702000	2704000	I see a lot of people that are pissed
2704000	2706000	Like why did EA
2706000	2708000	Win this when Bank of America
2708000	2710000	Is a far more evil company
2710000	2712000	When Comcast is more evil
2712000	2714000	It's an anti-popularity contest
2714000	2716000	It's not even that it's just like
2716000	2718000	Bank of America was one of the I think even they went up against Bank of America
2718000	2720000	And it's just people voted
2720000	2722000	Maybe Bank of America is just not
2722000	2724000	That much in the forefront for some of these people
2724000	2726000	It's a fucking internet poll
2726000	2728000	Like do we give this much
2728000	2730000	Weight to something that's on Yahoo.com
2730000	2732000	I sure hope not
2732000	2734000	Like I don't
2734000	2736000	That's my thing like the results
2736000	2738000	It's like who's line is it anyway
2738000	2740000	The score doesn't matter
2740000	2742000	My vote for internet's
2742000	2744000	Worst poll goes to consumerist
2744000	2746000	Worst company in America
2746000	2748000	Oh you should be
2748000	2750000	We're analysts we can say this
2750000	2752000	I could run a poll right now
2752000	2754000	On the site who runs the worst poll
2754000	2756000	About the worst poll in America
2756000	2758000	Consumerist or somebody else
2758000	2760000	I won't right now
2760000	2762000	I have to save that for special
2762000	2764000	SSJ 100 Matt calls it an ass hattery contest
2764000	2766000	Whatever it's just a contest
2766000	2768000	It's just haha lols
2768000	2770000	That you know they won again
2770000	2772000	Because haha you screwed up all this SimCity stuff
2772000	2774000	And we hate you because of your DRM
2774000	2776000	And your policies regarding
2776000	2778000	Cashing in
2778000	2780000	Microtransactions and all that stuff
2780000	2782000	Haha see we showed it
2782000	2784000	We showed you
2784000	2786000	That's kind of what it is
2786000	2788000	I didn't log on to Mass Effect for a month
2788000	2790000	So I voted them the worst
2790000	2792000	Shadow Next Gen
2792000	2794000	Shadow Next Gen says in our chat room
2794000	2796000	Anyone who voted EA as the worst company
2796000	2798000	Should have their gaming rights rescinded
2798000	2800000	And be banned from the industry
2800000	2802000	Look people are welcome to their opinion as far as I'm concerned
2802000	2804000	But I'm just kind of like
2804000	2806000	You know
2806000	2808000	I tend to think
2808000	2810000	There are far bigger problems
2810000	2812000	Than you know EA
2812000	2814000	As a gamer do I like a lot of the things
2814000	2816000	That NCA has brought to the table? Hell no
2816000	2818000	And do I think they've deflected an awful lot
2818000	2820000	Of the blame? Hell yes
2820000	2822000	And have they made a lot of bad decisions
2822000	2824000	And possibly deserve to be having the lower financial
2824000	2826000	Quarter because of it? Yes
2826000	2828000	Do I think people should be losing their jobs?
2828000	2830000	No
2830000	2832000	But it's not those people's fault
2832000	2834000	It's the fault of? Who is it?
2834000	2836000	Management
2836000	2838000	So what management got laid off
2838000	2840000	As a part of this?
2840000	2842000	That's what we really should be
2843000	2845000	You got me
2845000	2847000	They did lose the CEO and that sadly
2847000	2849000	Or fortunately depending on which side you're on
2849000	2851000	Is the person that needed to take the fall
2851000	2853000	So we'll see if things get better
2853000	2855000	But if you know
2855000	2857000	If last year was any sort of
2857000	2859000	You know
2859000	2861000	Barometer of whether things are getting better
2861000	2863000	Nope
2863000	2865000	Besides how many years is it going to take
2865000	2867000	Before SimCity stops working
2867000	2869000	When they shut up those servers
2869000	2871000	DarkTetsuya in our chat room says
2871000	2873000	I do give EA credit for their pro
2873000	2875000	LGBT stance
2875000	2877000	And I do love Need for Speed
2877000	2879000	They blame that as one of the reasons they got voted
2879000	2881000	You know
2881000	2883000	It's a tricky
2883000	2885000	I appreciate the fact that
2885000	2887000	Peter Moore did come out and say
2887000	2889000	If that's the reason you're going to name us the worst
2889000	2891000	Company in America then by golly
2891000	2893000	We're the worst company in America
2893000	2895000	I appreciate that he said that but at the same time
2895000	2897000	I'm kind of like
2897000	2899000	But like
2899000	2901000	How do you focus on the real reasons you're getting
2901000	2903000	Voted for this
2903000	2905000	Like a lot of that is feeling like smoke
2905000	2907000	And mirrors and whether you deserve it or not
2907000	2909000	It's falling on deaf ears
2909000	2911000	It seems to me and that doesn't
2911000	2913000	Make it very promising
2913000	2915000	That you're going to change anything
2915000	2917000	I honestly would have put more of the crappy
2917000	2919000	If I was going just on video game companies
2919000	2921000	I would have put more crap on Activision
2921000	2923000	I think
2923000	2925000	Or maybe Capcom
2925000	2927000	I don't know
2927000	2929000	EA is the company that designed the whole
2929000	2931000	Online pass phenomenon
2931000	2933000	That we see nowadays
2933000	2935000	EA was also one of the first companies to
2935000	2937000	Hey you know those games that you had cheats in before
2937000	2939000	In Playstation 2 where you just enter
2939000	2941000	A little button press and you get those cheats
2941000	2943000	Yeah you can buy those now
2943000	2945000	And even in fact I remember
2945000	2947000	Is the first Godfather game they had
2947000	2949000	On Playstation 2 and Xbox
2949000	2951000	Where they didn't have such a way to purchase those
2951000	2953000	Bits of DLC
2953000	2955000	They actually had button presses to do those cheats
2955000	2957000	On the 360
2957000	2959000	That's going to cost some money
2959000	2961000	So yeah so they can go fuck themselves
2961000	2963000	Origin is just the thing that pisses me on
2963000	2965000	Origin is the worst part of it
2965000	2967000	Hey but Rob
2967000	2969000	There's 45 million people on Origin
2969000	2971000	How many satisfied customers
2971000	2973000	How many people on Origin
2973000	2975000	Because the game they wanted to play
2975000	2977000	Was only through Origin
2977000	2979000	If I could disable that shit I would
2979000	2981000	To be fair
2981000	2983000	And I have to say this I have to acknowledge it
2983000	2985000	Nobody liked Steam when it first came out
2985000	2987000	And it's great now but I just
2987000	2989000	To me there's a difference
2989000	2991000	I'm kind of like Valve fixing it
2991000	2993000	Yeah I kind of see that out of them
2993000	2995000	But EA fixing it I'm like I don't know if they're ever
2995000	2997000	Going to
2997000	2999000	I think that Steam though had it right from the get go
2999000	3001000	That you know let's put out games and put them out
3001000	3003000	At affordable prices
3003000	3005000	Get people interested in franchises do big sales
3005000	3007000	And EA's like oh that's not any way to make money
3007000	3009000	And look where they are
3009000	3011000	Hi
3011000	3013000	Alright well let's move on to one of those companies
3013000	3015000	That Dark Soccer has said you know they're not doing
3015000	3017000	Much better and that's Capcom
3017000	3019000	And Capcom had something interesting to say
3019000	3021000	This week where
3021000	3023000	Capcom Senior Vice President
3023000	3025000	Christian Svensson said on the
3025000	3027000	Ask Capcom forums
3027000	3029000	Quote, sadly I think we've probably
3029000	3031000	Run the course of feasible titles here
3031000	3033000	Given the drop off we've seen in sales
3033000	3035000	With each new introduction
3035000	3037000	That's in regards to HD ports and
3037000	3039000	Remakes of fighting games
3039000	3041000	That's a lot of games to be honest
3041000	3043000	Well
3043000	3045000	No they could really dig back
3045000	3047000	In the archive do like the Mega Man fighting
3047000	3049000	Games and
3049000	3051000	Capcom vs SNK
3051000	3053000	Although I guess that's coming out on the
3053000	3055000	Playstation 2 or whatever
3055000	3057000	It's going to be an old hit or whatever
3057000	3059000	Just how bad is it?
3059000	3061000	They've come out and said
3061000	3063000	That the Dark Stalkers resurrection
3063000	3065000	Sales are not good
3065000	3067000	Dark Stalkers
3067000	3069000	The Dark Stalkers resurrection didn't even place
3069000	3071000	On the list of best selling Playstation Network
3071000	3073000	Games
3073000	3075000	In further comments Christian Svensson saying
3075000	3077000	It's partially due to lack of a
3077000	3079000	Promotion
3079000	3081000	Quote, we've not given up but I'm disappointed in the opening
3081000	3083000	Sales response relative to any other fighting
3083000	3085000	Title we've put out on the same platforms
3085000	3087000	Given the frequency and urgency of
3087000	3089000	Requests we've had here over the last several years
3089000	3091000	And the quality of the execution
3091000	3093000	It's the most fully featured
3093000	3095000	And probably best project of this type
3095000	3097000	That we've done
3097000	3099000	Here's a question that comes to my mind when I'm
3099000	3101000	Reading about these stories and that is
3101000	3103000	Is possibly Xbox Live Arcade
3103000	3105000	And Playstation Network just too
3105000	3107000	Oversaturated and that's what's
3107000	3109000	Causing the drop off is that there's just
3109000	3111000	Too much stuff on there now and it's hard to stand
3111000	3113000	Out because I'll tell you what
3113000	3115000	When Xbox Live Arcade first came out
3115000	3117000	Shit I was buying everything
3117000	3119000	I bought almost like every other week there was a new
3119000	3121000	Release I would buy it like just because like hey
3121000	3123000	New game for five bucks right
3123000	3125000	I bought like everything
3125000	3127000	Now I honestly couldn't
3127000	3129000	Tell you the last game I bought on Xbox Live Arcade
3129000	3131000	I don't remember it was a while ago
3131000	3133000	Or even Playstation Network
3133000	3135000	I don't remember the last game
3135000	3137000	I got
3137000	3139000	Last game I got was Retro City
3139000	3141000	Rampage
3141000	3143000	So is it possible that maybe
3143000	3145000	Part of the sales drop off is it's hard
3145000	3147000	For this game to stick out because maybe
3147000	3149000	You know it's not
3149000	3151000	There's too much to pick
3151000	3153000	From now
3153000	3155000	Maybe just Darkstalkers
3155000	3157000	Is just not as popular as Street Fighter
3157000	3159000	But isn't that the game that everybody was asking for?
3159000	3161000	They wanted Darkstalkers 3
3161000	3163000	They wanted Darkstalkers
3163000	3165000	You mean Darkstalkers 4 but could that
3165000	3167000	Could this
3167000	3169000	Could this endanger a Darkstalkers
3169000	3171000	4 because this hasn't been selling well
3171000	3173000	He admitted themselves it was under promoted
3173000	3175000	So I mean a good portion
3175000	3177000	Of the failure to perform has to
3177000	3179000	Do with their failure to promote
3179000	3181000	ActDeft in chat says
3181000	3183000	The last Xbox Live Arcade game I bought was
3183000	3185000	Darkstalkers Resurrection
3185000	3187000	Yyr in chat says
3187000	3189000	I'll say this much
3189000	3191000	The moment Sony announced that Playstation 4
3191000	3193000	Would not be backwards compatible
3193000	3195000	I lost almost all desire to buy
3195000	3197000	Anything for Playstation 3
3197000	3199000	On the Playstation Store
3199000	3201000	That's a really good point
3201000	3203000	That's a very good point
3203000	3205000	I have to admit that crosses my mind too
3205000	3207000	And part of the
3207000	3209000	I mean and this is
3209000	3211000	I know where some people
3211000	3213000	Keep in mind a lot of people I hang out with are classic gamers
3213000	3215000	Why buy something in HD
3215000	3217000	That I have on how many
3217000	3219000	Other dozen systems
3219000	3221000	In the past that I have paid good money for
3221000	3223000	Yeah it's like I got a maim cabinet
3223000	3225000	If I want to play Darkstalkers I'll go play
3225000	3227000	Darkstalkers
3227000	3229000	I've got the Vampire Savior collection for Saturn
3229000	3231000	If I wanted to play that that's the best version
3231000	3233000	Out for a home console right now
3233000	3235000	I mean
3235000	3237000	Darkstalkers they do an anthology on Playstation 2 as well
3237000	3239000	I think so
3239000	3241000	Yeah so it's not like it's that hard to go out to your used game store
3241000	3243000	And buy a $5 Darkstalkers
3243000	3245000	It's not that hard
3245000	3247000	I do want a new Darkstalkers
3247000	3249000	That being said because it's probably one of my favorite fighting game
3249000	3251000	Franchises
3251000	3253000	But still
3253000	3255000	I mean doing these HD versions
3255000	3257000	Especially in a still depressed market
3257000	3259000	Not very
3259000	3261000	Not a very good idea you have to bring something innovative out
3261000	3263000	And just cleaning up the graphics isn't going to be enough
3263000	3265000	Interesting
3265000	3267000	But there's other HD remakes on the horizon
3267000	3269000	They might not be fighting games
3269000	3271000	But we do have the Dungeons and Dragons arcade game
3271000	3273000	And DuckTales Remastered coming out
3273000	3275000	Judging on the reaction
3275000	3277000	That everybody gave at least the DuckTales game
3277000	3279000	At Penny Arcade Expo
3279000	3281000	I'm thinking they don't have anything to worry about there
3281000	3283000	That's an HD reboot that's not in trouble
3283000	3285000	But the Dungeons and Dragons games
3285000	3287000	Now look I'm a fan
3287000	3289000	Hell yeah
3289000	3291000	But I worry they're a little niche
3291000	3293000	I don't know I'm hoping I'm wrong
3293000	3295000	I hope I am wrong
3295000	3297000	I will be more than happy to say
3297000	3299000	I was so wrong on that
3299000	3301000	And that game sold shit tons
3301000	3303000	But I have a feeling it's very niche
3303000	3305000	And it might not sell well
3305000	3307000	I keep my fingers crossed on it
3307000	3309000	But I mean they're not really giving it the best promotion either
3309000	3311000	Are they?
3311000	3313000	Well they unveiled it at the same expo
3313000	3315000	Well yeah DuckTales
3315000	3317000	But I mean since then
3317000	3319000	I think they'd have to promote the hell out of it
3319000	3321000	And to really get the type of sales they're looking for out of it
3321000	3323000	And again
3323000	3325000	I probably won't buy it because
3325000	3327000	I've already got it
3327000	3329000	Lots of people in our chat room saying some positive things about it
3329000	3331000	DungeonBuster says yay the D&D beat em ups
3331000	3333000	Marinko
3333000	3335000	I hope I said that right
3335000	3337000	Said I would love to see more Dungeons and Dragons
3337000	3339000	Well y'all better go buy it
3339000	3341000	Chiggers wants Mr. Do
3341000	3343000	They never did I thought they did a new Mr. Do
3343000	3345000	Not that long ago
3345000	3347000	I thought they did I could be wrong
3347000	3349000	I think it was out on a compilation
3349000	3351000	Or some type of like new Mr. Do
3351000	3353000	But it was really nothing like the old ones
3353000	3355000	The sequel Mr. Pooh
3355000	3357000	Mr. Does
3357000	3359000	Mr. Did
3359000	3361000	They had a Mr. Do game I don't remember what it was called
3361000	3363000	But yeah they actually had an arcade game
3363000	3365000	Where it was really weird
3365000	3367000	I don't remember
3367000	3369000	Like a platformer or something
3369000	3371000	And honestly though
3371000	3373000	Back to comparing the D&D to DuckTales
3373000	3375000	People underestimate
3375000	3377000	The love for the old DuckTales game
3377000	3379000	The DuckTales game was freaking sweet
3379000	3381000	I mean
3381000	3383000	That was one of the first things that Dan
3383000	3385000	And I ever talked about when we first met
3385000	3387000	Online ages and ages and ages ago
3387000	3389000	He's like we were talking about
3389000	3391000	Video game music and he says oh yeah my favorite
3391000	3393000	Is that DuckTales moon level
3393000	3395000	And I'm like oh yeah me too and you know
3395000	3397000	And then we started reading you know sharing
3397000	3399000	Bad fanfictions and it was love
3399000	3401000	Aww
3401000	3403000	Actually
3403000	3405000	You know what we met over right?
3405000	3407000	Um
3407000	3409000	Ranma one half
3409000	3411000	Oh I thought it was your sound rips you did
3411000	3413000	No I did those after
3413000	3415000	Actually I just started doing the sound rips after I moved out here
3415000	3417000	Ah
3417000	3419000	Alright well let's move on DarkSakura
3419000	3421000	If you have some news for us
3421000	3423000	Hey Codeman's in chat hi thank you for our poster it's awesome
3423000	3425000	And I need to talk to you later
3425000	3427000	Has to do with album art
3427000	3429000	Secret messages to listeners
3429000	3431000	Secret secret meh
3431000	3433000	Secret message how's that? Well there was
3433000	3435000	A survey that went out
3435000	3437000	That showed the
3437000	3439000	Income disparity between
3439000	3441000	Game developers based on gender
3441000	3443000	And it was
3443000	3445000	Actually a 2012 salary survey
3445000	3447000	That was put out in the March issue of Game
3447000	3449000	Developer magazine where
3449000	3451000	They were saying that even though the number of women
3451000	3453000	In the industry is growing
3453000	3455000	There is still a huge salary
3455000	3457000	Gap is something like
3457000	3459000	The average female game
3459000	3461000	Producer makes about
3461000	3463000	Maybe 79,000
3463000	3465000	And the average male makes
3465000	3467000	About 86,000
3467000	3469000	So we're talking about a huge
3469000	3471000	Disparity for the same work
3471000	3473000	For people who are just as capable
3473000	3475000	If not you know
3475000	3477000	Overlooking people who are more capable simply because
3477000	3479000	Gender
3479000	3481000	Well does the story get into why?
3481000	3483000	There's a big
3483000	3485000	Is that just you know because unfortunately
3485000	3487000	I can't get into the area that has the
3487000	3489000	Cool thing on it because I don't want to pay for a subscription
3489000	3491000	For it. I was going to say
3491000	3493000	Is that just an unfortunate echo
3493000	3495000	Of what can happen
3495000	3497000	In the greater world unfortunately
3497000	3499000	Well they're also
3499000	3501000	Talking a little bit more about
3501000	3503000	Where the bulk
3503000	3505000	Of women are working within the industry
3505000	3507000	And it says that
3507000	3509000	That's in art and animation at about 16%
3509000	3511000	And game designers around 11%
3511000	3513000	So
3513000	3515000	I wish I had more information
3515000	3517000	I tried to get into the thing but
3517000	3519000	I don't have a subscription so sorry
3519000	3521000	Um
3521000	3523000	Marinko in our chat room says
3523000	3525000	You would think we would be past
3525000	3527000	All this gender inequality at this point in human
3527000	3529000	Society. You would wouldn't you?
3529000	3531000	And it's unfortunately
3531000	3533000	That this industry has to
3533000	3535000	Really exacerbate that issue
3535000	3537000	It sounds like from these statistics
3537000	3539000	So
3539000	3541000	But it's just a really
3541000	3543000	It's just
3543000	3545000	Pretty sad I think
3545000	3547000	Sort of sad commentary that
3547000	3549000	I mean I am glad to see more women
3549000	3551000	Getting into the industry because I mean we definitely
3551000	3553000	Need it especially after what we talked last week
3553000	3555000	About the
3555000	3557000	Preference
3557000	3559000	Towards male leads in video games
3559000	3561000	Versus female leads when we've had
3561000	3563000	Awesome games with female leads like what mirrors
3563000	3565000	Edge and the new Tomb Raider
3565000	3567000	The new Tomb Raider
3567000	3569000	I really think that it's just
3569000	3571000	Something in the public perception that's gonna
3571000	3573000	Have to change so
3573000	3575000	Well we have the power
3575000	3577000	To change it so
3577000	3579000	If people would listen to us
3579000	3581000	I don't mean we I mean we as a generation
3581000	3583000	I know I know I know
3583000	3585000	How about this way if people would be
3585000	3587000	A little bit less distracted by
3587000	3589000	Things and actually get off their ass and do something
3589000	3591000	Just saying
3591000	3593000	Alright Loki speaking about the we changing
3593000	3595000	Uh
3595000	3597000	Yeah the uh
3597000	3599000	A lot of the features that are on the we
3599000	3601000	Online features maybe
3601000	3603000	Stuff that you don't use I'm sure it's a lot of stuff
3603000	3605000	You don't use are being
3605000	3607000	Deactivated starting June
3607000	3609000	28th this includes the
3609000	3611000	Nintendo channel the news channel
3611000	3613000	The forecast channel everybody votes channel
3613000	3615000	The me contest channel and
3615000	3617000	Some of the data exchange
3617000	3619000	With friends in other words
3619000	3621000	Data exchange includes the ability
3621000	3623000	To send messages to friends
3623000	3625000	And also all of the
3625000	3627000	Me data exchange
3627000	3629000	In some games
3629000	3631000	Will end as well
3631000	3633000	I'm wondering if that also means like the
3633000	3635000	Me plaza swapping of
3635000	3637000	Characters and stuff like that I wonder if that's gonna go away
3637000	3639000	But shit at this point I mean
3639000	3641000	That's almost like
3641000	3643000	Almost all the online functionality
3643000	3645000	Of the we I mean
3645000	3647000	Well like Nintendo's ever had
3647000	3649000	Any real concept of embracing
3649000	3651000	Online technology it's kinda
3651000	3653000	Dumb that they
3653000	3655000	Had all these curated channels and they couldn't have
3655000	3657000	Like just pulled you know
3657000	3659000	Weather information from
3659000	3661000	Yahoo or you know news
3661000	3663000	From like anything
3663000	3665000	I don't know RSS
3665000	3667000	Feeds I mean that's all they really are why couldn't they
3667000	3669000	Have just updated hey we're not gonna do these on
3669000	3671000	Our server anymore let's just update this
3671000	3673000	To like RSS feeds for different things
3673000	3675000	Uh Rasteel UT in chat
3675000	3677000	Asks does anyone use those stupid channels
3677000	3679000	I figured it'd be faster to just go with the browser
3679000	3681000	Well I haven't touched my we
3681000	3683000	It was fun to spin the globe
3683000	3685000	In the news channel and in the
3685000	3687000	The weather channel
3687000	3689000	The weather channel but yeah I mean that kinda
3689000	3691000	Loses it's luster after some time
3691000	3693000	But you know they're still actively
3693000	3695000	Selling the we
3695000	3697000	Granted the most recent model they came out with
3697000	3699000	In Canada had the internet parts just
3699000	3701000	Stripped out of it maybe that should've
3701000	3703000	Told us something but
3703000	3705000	You know it's not like they aren't
3705000	3707000	Still I mean there's a we game is
3707000	3709000	Coming out this week or just came out
3709000	3711000	The whole pandora's tower
3711000	3713000	Yeah this week so it's not like
3713000	3715000	The week itself is dead
3715000	3717000	It's dead but there's
3717000	3719000	But they're sure pulling the plug on
3719000	3721000	Basically we connect 24 is
3721000	3723000	Getting it's plug pulled anything that runs off the
3723000	3725000	Internet on the we is done yeah cause after pandora's tower
3725000	3727000	The next game you have coming out is
3727000	3731000	Smurfs 2
3731000	3733000	And then after that
3733000	3735000	Planes
3735000	3737000	Disney planes
3737000	3739000	And
3739000	3741000	Disney infinity
3741000	3743000	So it's all kids stuff but
3743000	3745000	You're not gonna get Madden
3745000	3747000	You're not gonna get in 6AA
3747000	3749000	You're not gonna get anything else
3749000	3751000	I think after this year and maybe
3751000	3753000	Maybe if you know
3753000	3755000	There's some indie developers out there
3755000	3757000	Or smaller developers that really
3757000	3759000	Want to just still focus on the we
3759000	3761000	I think you're gonna be out of titles
3761000	3763000	Probably by
3763000	3765000	Second quarter next year
3765000	3767000	Yyr in chat says
3767000	3769000	Darn I can't check the weather at the north pole anymore
3769000	3771000	Everyone you know you've done this
3771000	3773000	Guilty as charged
3773000	3775000	I have to say not guilty
3775000	3777000	Totally fun though I've actually never played with the weather channel
3777000	3779000	You wanna know where my we is?
3779000	3781000	In a dumpster?
3781000	3783000	No it's in a box at Dan's mom's house
3783000	3785000	Haven't touched that thing in months
3785000	3787000	I can't believe I waited in line for that thing
3787000	3789000	Although that was pretty fun giving donuts
3789000	3791000	And bribing for our spot online
3791000	3793000	Ravens dolphin in chat says
3793000	3795000	I don't think people were using that stuff on we
3795000	3797000	How many people sent messages on their we
3797000	3799000	And watch it glow blue
3799000	3801000	Not in years mine is on the floor
3801000	3803000	And yeah you know what let's be real
3803000	3805000	I haven't used that stuff in a long time either
3805000	3807000	So I can't sit here and go
3807000	3809000	Oh how dare they take away the stuff I used to love
3809000	3811000	It's over
3811000	3813000	I think what the thing that's
3813000	3815000	Annoying people the most is it's basically
3815000	3817000	Just saying that Nintendo's just giving up
3817000	3819000	Support on this console
3819000	3821000	They're just like eh we're done we have the Wii U now
3823000	3825000	Which they kinda need to do to help
3825000	3827000	You know motivate people to get the Wii U
3827000	3829000	Yeah but I mean what's gonna happen
3831000	3833000	When the new Wii U U comes out
3833000	3835000	The Wii U U?
3835000	3837000	Is it the Wii W?
3837000	3839000	That's funny
3839000	3841000	Her her I'm clever her
3841000	3843000	Alright
3843000	3845000	Hopefully also funny and light hearted
3845000	3847000	Like some of their previous games
3847000	3849000	And fun will be the next
3849000	3851000	Game from level 5
3851000	3853000	Level 5
3853000	3855000	Is probably most well known for
3855000	3857000	Ni No Kuni as of late
3857000	3859000	But they also did Dragon Quest 8
3859000	3861000	Which was so good and White Knight
3861000	3863000	Chronicles 1 and 2 which you know
3863000	3865000	Were kind of a little more controversial
3865000	3867000	In fact I heard the servers for those games are getting shut down
3867000	3869000	Which is kind of unfortunate but whatever
3869000	3871000	Games end
3871000	3873000	I guess in this day and age
3873000	3875000	But apparently a new PlayStation 4
3875000	3877000	Project is in the works
3877000	3879000	This is according to level 5 boss
3879000	3881000	Akihiro Hino talking
3881000	3883000	In an interview with Nikkei Trendy
3883000	3885000	It's in the planning stages
3885000	3887000	Hoping that they can announce something
3887000	3889000	More specific about it soon
3889000	3891000	Could that be
3891000	3893000	Ni No Kuni 2
3893000	3895000	Dragon Quest 8 2
3895000	3897000	Or okay to be fair
3897000	3899000	Maybe we don't necessarily need a sequel
3899000	3901000	They can do something new
3901000	3903000	That would be nice right
3903000	3905000	So
3905000	3907000	We will see what is next from
3907000	3909000	Level 5
3909000	3911000	Okay Ravenstaufen was hilarious
3911000	3913000	There's been a bunch of jokes going on in chat about Wii U 2
3913000	3915000	Featuring Bono and I said featuring
3915000	3917000	The Edge and Ravenstaufen
3917000	3919000	Says is the Wii U 2 slogan with or without you
3919000	3921000	I like it
3921000	3923000	It's funny
3923000	3925000	Yeah that is pretty clever
3925000	3927000	With or without you
3927000	3929000	Alright one more story for you guys
3929000	3931000	Then release dates, Dark Saga
3931000	3933000	I got a story for you
3933000	3935000	Well hackers gonna hack right
3935000	3937000	They cracked
3937000	3939000	Ubisoft's Uplay security
3939000	3941000	So they can download games for free
3941000	3943000	And Ubisoft actually sent out
3943000	3945000	A statement that they said that they are aware
3945000	3947000	Of the issue and are trying to resolve it
3947000	3949000	The rest of the quote goes no personal information
3949000	3951000	Was compromised
3951000	3953000	Uplay's PC download service will be unavailable
3953000	3955000	Until the problem is fixed however all other Uplay services
3955000	3957000	Remain available
3957000	3959000	So basically it was actually a group of Russian
3959000	3961000	Hackers that broke into it and downloaded
3961000	3963000	Games for free
3963000	3965000	Wow
3965000	3967000	Hackers gonna hack
3967000	3969000	Yeah but that's quite something to get in there and
3969000	3971000	Download games for free
3971000	3973000	Loki
3973000	3975000	Including that's how Far Cry
3975000	3977000	Give us some more details
3977000	3979000	How did this exactly happen
3979000	3981000	It's basically a trick with the client
3981000	3983000	I think they said it's easy
3983000	3985000	Even maybe like a console command
3985000	3987000	Or something like that
3987000	3989000	But basically
3989000	3991000	Tricked Uplay into thinking
3991000	3993000	That you own the game and allowed you
3993000	3995000	To re-download it
3995000	3997000	So they did that with
3997000	3999000	Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
3999000	4001000	And some other stuff
4001000	4003000	To prove that it worked
4003000	4005000	And so now they're gonna try to patch that out
4005000	4007000	But
4007000	4009000	If you mean that sucks that your DRM
4009000	4011000	Is able to be defeated that quickly
4011000	4013000	Especially to have a game like that
4013000	4015000	Leak out early
4015000	4017000	But it is awesome so I do recommend
4017000	4019000	Everyone go buy it
4019000	4021000	Well they've
4021000	4023000	Taken down
4023000	4025000	Well it's not gonna stop people from the re-up
4025000	4027000	Probably how you got yours but
4027000	4029000	Once it's on the internet it's
4029000	4031000	On the internet for a second on there for an eternity
4031000	4033000	But yeah
4033000	4035000	They
4035000	4037000	Did their best to get that shut down as soon as possible
4037000	4039000	But still
4039000	4041000	It was Gameranx
4041000	4043000	G-A-M-E-R-A-N-X
4043000	4045000	Put an image of the game being
4045000	4047000	Downloaded
4047000	4049000	That was for Far Cry 3
4049000	4051000	Blood Dragon
4051000	4053000	And basically said here is us
4053000	4055000	Sending it to the torrent sites
4055000	4057000	You know
4057000	4059000	Bite our ass
4059000	4061000	So
4061000	4063000	Hackers gonna hack
4063000	4065000	Alright so don't put your full games
4065000	4067000	Online
4067000	4069000	Or like a month before they're supposed to come out
4069000	4071000	Unless I mean
4071000	4073000	I'm gonna do a brag about being unhackable
4073000	4075000	Cause usually that follows immediately being hacked
4075000	4077000	No but Ubisoft had that whole
4077000	4079000	DRM thing which nobody liked
4079000	4081000	Not that that makes it okay
4081000	4083000	I'm just saying that's you know
4083000	4085000	Probably the justification
4085000	4087000	I got the Ubisoft little service myself and I said
4087000	4089000	You know what I don't really need to play Assassin's Creed
4089000	4091000	That much
4091000	4093000	I registered some of my games with it
4093000	4095000	It's you know whatever
4095000	4097000	So
4097000	4099000	Alright let us travel around the world
4099000	4101000	Check out some release dates
4101000	4103000	And uh
4103000	4105000	Loki we'll start with you in the US
4105000	4107000	Pandora's Tower this week on the Wii
4107000	4109000	On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4109000	4111000	And the Wii U and Justice Gods Among Us
4111000	4113000	Shimagami Tensei Devil Summoner

4295000	4297000	You guys don't deserve any more Japanese
4297000	4299000	Japanese release dates
4299000	4301000	That's it
4301000	4303000	There's some stuff coming out in Europe
4303000	4305000	On the 18th of April
4305000	4307000	We have Pappo and Yo on PC

4311000	4313000	Fire Emblem Awakening and Injustice
4313000	4315000	Gods Among Us
4315000	4317000	And that's it
4317000	4319000	No more
4319000	4321000	You guys don't get any more games
4321000	4323000	It's kind of a slow time of year
4323000	4325000	Yeah
4325000	4327000	Alright, let's go for a few more stories
4327000	4329000	And then the classic game of the week
4329000	4331000	I bet y'all can't wait to see what she picked for this episode
4331000	4333000	You guys are going to be so surprised
4333000	4335000	Actually, I legitimately was
4335000	4337000	Loki, what did you pick tonight for news?
4337000	4339000	For news? Let's see
4339000	4341000	I picked
4341000	4343000	The UK government investigating
4343000	4345000	In-app purchases
4345000	4347000	Because they believe it's putting too much
4347000	4349000	Pressure on children to accidentally
4349000	4351000	Or maybe
4351000	4353000	Mislead them into
4353000	4355000	Purchasing smurf objects
4355000	4357000	Or stuff that they don't need
4357000	4359000	Basically saying
4359000	4361000	We're concerned that children and their parents
4361000	4363000	Could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase
4363000	4365000	When they're playing games they
4365000	4367000	Thought were free, but which actually
4367000	4369000	Run up a substantial cost
4369000	4371000	The OFT
4371000	4373000	Is not seeking to ban in-game purchases
4373000	4375000	But the games industry must ensure
4375000	4377000	That it's complying with
4377000	4379000	Relevant regulations so that children
4379000	4381000	Are protected. Think of the children
4381000	4383000	They're coming for you smurf village
4383000	4385000	La la la la la la spend my mom's credit card
4385000	4387000	Are we going to get smurf village 2 with the
4387000	4389000	Smurfs 2 movie coming out?
4389000	4391000	Smurfs village 2 electric boogaloo?
4391000	4393000	I hope not
4393000	4395000	If it was really combining those two movies
4395000	4397000	I might have to watch it
4397000	4399000	The Smurfs movie is
4399000	4401000	It's so bad
4401000	4403000	Katy Perry is one of the
4403000	4405000	I kind of wanted to watch it just because
4405000	4407000	Neil Patrick Harris is in it
4407000	4409000	Unfortunately did not
4409000	4411000	Want to see that movie
4411000	4413000	He can't see that movie
4413000	4415000	Now if Neil Patrick Harris
4415000	4417000	The character
4417000	4419000	From all of the wonderful
4419000	4421000	Harold and Kumar movies
4421000	4423000	Was in that movie
4423000	4425000	That might be something
4425000	4427000	Okay
4427000	4429000	I have to go on a little tangent here
4429000	4431000	Dan and I had a very interesting discussion
4431000	4433000	About the Smurfs
4433000	4435000	Yes my husband and I discussed the Smurfs
4435000	4437000	Through Fry's Electronics
4437000	4439000	He picked up a plushy smurf and said
4439000	4441000	That's a big smurf. He said actually this would be about how big a smurf really is
4441000	4443000	And then he started stacking
4443000	4445000	Like what the size of apples
4445000	4447000	Would have been because they're three apples high
4447000	4449000	And he was like how did nobody ever
4449000	4451000	Find the damn smurf village
4451000	4453000	If they came up to your shins?
4453000	4455000	So
4455000	4457000	End of story
4457000	4459000	Alrighty
4459000	4461000	That means there would be no plot ever
4461000	4463000	Because everyone would be
4463000	4465000	Well maybe they just
4465000	4467000	Lived in like remote Canada
4467000	4469000	Where nobody thought to look
4469000	4471000	People live in Canada
4471000	4473000	Not that far north
4473000	4475000	Yes they do
4475000	4477000	They lived in Nunavut
4479000	4481000	Alright
4481000	4483000	Nobody lives there
4483000	4485000	Breakman voted for Gargamel
4485000	4487000	I voted for Asriel because Gargamel was pretty stupid
4487000	4489000	To register participation
4489000	4491000	For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4491000	4493000	At vognetwork.com
4493000	4495000	Use the passphrase
4495000	4497000	Pancake
4497000	4499000	Well would you vote for this?
4499000	4501000	I know a lot of people are very
4501000	4503000	They're purist when it comes to their Japanese voiceovers
4503000	4505000	But here's an interesting one
4505000	4507000	How much would you pay for Japanese voiceovers?
4507000	4509000	Square Enix
4509000	4511000	Is going to be selling a Japanese voiceover pack
4511000	4513000	For the Steam version of Tomb Raider
4513000	4515000	It's already available in Japan
4515000	4517000	Through the Western store
4517000	4519000	Here's the thing though
4519000	4521000	If you want to get the Japanese localization pack
4521000	4523000	It will cost $30
4523000	4525000	That's $30 DLC
4525000	4527000	That's on top of
4527000	4529000	What the game costs already
4529000	4531000	Now it should be noted
4531000	4533000	Japanese games do tend to be
4533000	4535000	A little bit higher in price
4535000	4537000	Anyway
4537000	4539000	The Japanese version of the game
4539000	4541000	Actually comes out on April 25th
4541000	4543000	That is the same day
4543000	4545000	As the voiceover pack
4545000	4547000	And it will retail for $80
4547000	4549000	This is typical for Japan
4549000	4551000	So in a way it's kind of like
4551000	4553000	Well the $50 you paid for it on Steam
4553000	4555000	Plus the $30 for the voiceover pack
4555000	4557000	Equals the $80 it would have cost you anyway
4557000	4559000	But there went your deal
4559000	4561000	The only reason I could remotely
4561000	4563000	Think of it being that high would be
4563000	4565000	Simply the cost of paying voice actors
4565000	4567000	Especially with
4567000	4569000	I mean
4569000	4571000	It ain't cheap
4571000	4573000	They'd have to
4573000	4575000	Basically decide what they've had to pay
4575000	4577000	The voice actors for
4577000	4579000	And then see what their overhead is for the recording
4579000	4581000	And then adjust the price
4581000	4583000	There's still I think pulling a big profit off of it
4583000	4585000	And I know people will buy it
4585000	4587000	Yeah there's a lot of people in chat going
4587000	4589000	What? What? Why? But then you have Zombie Princess
4589000	4591000	That gives us a little perspective here
4591000	4593000	At live.vaughnightware.com
4593000	4595000	Says I would pay that much for Japanese voices in Mass Effect
4595000	4597000	I would not
4597000	4599000	Because it was not ever dubbed in Japanese
4599000	4601000	But neither was Tomb Raider
4601000	4603000	No
4603000	4605000	However
4605000	4607000	Actually I do have to say that Mass Effect
4607000	4609000	In French sounds pretty fucking cool
4609000	4611000	I want to know
4611000	4613000	What her voice sounds like
4613000	4615000	Did they go the route where she's super chibi
4615000	4617000	Or did they pick like a deep male
4617000	4619000	Japanese voice for her
4619000	4621000	It's Japanese voice acting she probably sounds
4621000	4623000	Super kawaii
4623000	4625000	YYR in chat says
4625000	4627000	When was the last time a Japanese game was released here with subtitles
4627000	4629000	And the English dub cost an extra
4629000	4631000	$20
4631000	4633000	You know to import a game from Japan
4633000	4635000	Remember when we used to import
4635000	4637000	DDR and BeatMania and all that stuff
4637000	4639000	Well um
4639000	4641000	Shoot what was it
4641000	4643000	There was another game
4643000	4645000	Oh yeah Sonic Adventure
4645000	4647000	Remember when it came out on Dreamcast
4647000	4649000	It had the Japanese
4649000	4651000	You could choose the Japanese voice track with the English subtitles
4651000	4653000	Which because
4653000	4655000	I played through it the first time in Japanese
4655000	4657000	On my import
4657000	4659000	So I played through it again in Japanese
4659000	4661000	Because I was used to the voices
4661000	4663000	I think of a lot of fighting games nowadays
4663000	4665000	I want to say like Soul Calibur
4665000	4667000	The Street Fighter series you can choose language
4667000	4669000	You can choose between the two
4669000	4671000	But the amount of dialogue in Street Fighter versus
4671000	4673000	Tomb Raider
4673000	4675000	But it also changed the in game voice acting
4675000	4677000	To the Japanese voice actors
4677000	4679000	Which honestly
4679000	4681000	If I'm going to listen to Ryu I don't want him to sound like
4681000	4683000	He's a white boy
4683000	4685000	Break Man
4685000	4687000	Going back in time a little bit
4687000	4689000	Excuse me
4689000	4691000	Not going back in time
4691000	4693000	But Break Man going back to an earlier comment saying
4693000	4695000	I would pay that much for a Mass Effect nude code
4695000	4697000	But I'm a perv
4697000	4699000	You know what you can do that for free it's called text mod
4699000	4701000	Let me introduce you to the internet
4701000	4703000	It is your friend and there's lots of nudity on it
4703000	4705000	Actually I have
4705000	4707000	When I was putting in all those outfits
4707000	4709000	From my Shepard and everything
4709000	4711000	One of them is completely naked except there is absolutely no features on it
4711000	4713000	I'm sure that there's already a mod out there
4713000	4715000	For Tomb Raider
4715000	4717000	Again it's the internet
4717000	4719000	It's been done
4719000	4721000	Actdeft in our chat room says
4721000	4723000	Just a friendly reminder guys
4723000	4725000	It's optional
4725000	4727000	Reminding us that if you don't want to buy the $30 pack
4727000	4729000	You don't have to
4729000	4731000	But Black Wolf goes it's required
4731000	4733000	It exists therefore I must have it
4733000	4735000	There are consumer whores out there
4735000	4737000	And honestly
4737000	4739000	It's the same reason why people buy Dubbed Anime here
4739000	4741000	Even though I paid a little bit extra
4741000	4743000	For the subtitled versions
4743000	4745000	When they were on VHS
4745000	4747000	It's people
4747000	4749000	The average person would like
4749000	4751000	To watch something in their native language
4751000	4753000	It's more comfortable
4753000	4755000	For the average person to do
4755000	4757000	People don't want to read
4757000	4759000	At least that's America anyway
4759000	4761000	Well let's move on
4761000	4763000	To a simpler time
4763000	4765000	Let's travel back in time
4765000	4767000	They didn't have to worry about
4767000	4769000	Dubbing over
4769000	4771000	On different voice overs
4771000	4773000	Couldn't talk
4801000	4803000	I'm a little bit older than that
4803000	4805000	I see what you did there
4805000	4807000	Yeah I picked a video game
4807000	4809000	That was made in the 1940's
4809000	4811000	This is the legit
4811000	4813000	First video game that existed
4813000	4815000	I am going so classic
4815000	4817000	Like some of your parents weren't alive
4817000	4819000	So chew on that
4819000	4821000	And actually
4821000	4823000	If anyone ever remembers
4823000	4825000	When I used to write for a geek life
4825000	4827000	I wrote for my
4827000	4829000	Geeks in History
4829000	4831000	David Smith Jr.
4831000	4833000	Who basically is the guy that invented this
4833000	4835000	He was from Greenville, South Carolina
4835000	4837000	Born in 1910
4837000	4839000	And he actually
4839000	4841000	Filed a patent
4841000	4843000	For a game with
4843000	4845000	Estelle Ray Mann in 1948
4845000	4847000	That is a cathode ray tube
4847000	4849000	Game that uses radar displays
4849000	4851000	Used from World War II
4851000	4853000	And basically it's table tennis
4853000	4855000	You had adjusting difficulties
4855000	4857000	You would basically
4857000	4859000	Have paddles on either side
4859000	4861000	Very pong like
4861000	4863000	If you want to have something that is a frame of reference
4863000	4865000	But it would knock the ball
4865000	4867000	From one side to the other
4867000	4869000	Using the same type of light moves
4869000	4871000	On a radar screen
4871000	4873000	It had adjustable difficulties
4873000	4875000	He also had
4875000	4877000	A missile game
4877000	4879000	Using screen overlays
4879000	4881000	You could shoot at targets
4881000	4883000	It was sort of like
4883000	4885000	The Vectrex
4885000	4887000	But it used
4887000	4889000	Basically the CRT's electron gun
4889000	4891000	Kind of like an edge sketch
4891000	4893000	The same type of
4893000	4895000	Theory behind it
4895000	4897000	Now how long before somebody
4897000	4899000	Drew a penis?
4899000	4901000	Using the technology
4901000	4903000	45 seconds?
4903000	4905000	Rob, this was in the 40s
4905000	4907000	People were so repressed
4907000	4909000	Like I said
4909000	4911000	They made a cock overlay for it
4911000	4913000	And had
4913000	4915000	Becky said they didn't
4915000	4917000	Talk about it in public back then
4917000	4919000	They were polite company Rob
4919000	4921000	Rob, you're so dirty Rob
4921000	4923000	Sorry I'm trying to
4923000	4925000	I will call her later if you push me
4925000	4927000	I love your mom, your mom's awesome
4927000	4929000	Okay but no
4929000	4931000	I'm imagining they put a little
4931000	4933000	Penis shaped overlay on it
4933000	4935000	And had the little white ball shoot out of the top
4935000	4937000	Anyway
4937000	4939000	Basically it detected
4939000	4941000	The targets mechanically
4941000	4943000	And then
4943000	4945000	I'm just going to read this here
4945000	4947000	By connecting a cathode retube to an oscilloscope
4947000	4949000	And devising knobs that controlled
4949000	4951000	The angle and trajectory of the light
4951000	4953000	Traces displayed on the oscilloscope
4953000	4955000	They were able to invent a missile game that when
4955000	4957000	Using the overlays created the effect of firing
4957000	4959000	Missiles at various targets
4959000	4961000	So we're looking at the history
4961000	4963000	Of video gaming starting right there
4963000	4965000	I mean unless you want to talk about
4965000	4967000	Why can I never remember
4967000	4969000	Her name too
4969000	4971000	Lady that created the first programming language
4971000	4973000	Lord Byron's daughter
4973000	4975000	Why can't I remember her name?
4975000	4977000	Do you remember?
4977000	4979000	I don't remember her name
4979000	4981000	Lady Byron?
4981000	4983000	No
4983000	4985000	But I mean
4985000	4987000	She invented the first programming language
4987000	4989000	So we could just go back to her but
4989000	4991000	Still
4991000	4993000	Are you looking at
4993000	4995000	I'm trying to look it up
4995000	4997000	Ada Lovelace, thank you
4997000	4999000	Ada Lovelace
4999000	5001000	So yeah
5001000	5003000	This guy here pretty much
5003000	5005000	Without him screwing around
5005000	5007000	With radar screens
5007000	5009000	Would we have
5009000	5011000	Earth Defense Force
5011000	5013000	Just ask him
5013000	5015000	Alright
5015000	5017000	Thank you World War 2
5017000	5019000	For making video games
5019000	5021000	There it is your classic game of the week
5021000	5023000	Radar games
5023000	5025000	Radar games
5025000	5027000	Radar Love
5027000	5029000	Is that what you're going to name it?
5029000	5031000	Radar Love
5031000	5033000	We should have played the song in the background
5035000	5037000	That's great
5037000	5039000	Let's see
5039000	5041000	Akuma JP linked this to me
5041000	5043000	And this was definitely worth playing
5043000	5045000	With the prior story
5045000	5047000	This is Tomb Raider Japanese voice acting
5047000	5049000	But I want to point out
5049000	5051000	This is the older Tomb Raider
5051000	5053000	This is not from the new game
5053000	5055000	It's a Sega Saturn Sony Playstation game
5061000	5063000	She's watching a computer there
5063000	5065000	Let me fast forward
5065000	5067000	To a loading screen
5067000	5069000	Good lord
5077000	5079000	That's the tutorial telling her how to play the damn game
5079000	5081000	This is not a great video
5081000	5083000	This represented the voice acting here
5083000	5085000	Let me go back
5085000	5087000	You know what forget it
5087000	5089000	It's lost its
5089000	5091000	I wanted the British accent
5091000	5093000	Thank you Royal Steel U.T.
5093000	5095000	It's a cathode ray tube amusement device
5095000	5097000	I'm still calling it Radar Love
5097000	5099000	I like Radar Love it's easier to remember
5099000	5101000	Alright

5255000	5257000	The air from my lungs

5275000	5277000	To a zombie princess

5279000	5281000	Hey it's money shut up
5281000	5283000	Alright
5283000	5285000	Moving on let's get to
5285000	5287000	Rapid fire news
5287000	5289000	And talk about what else is going on in the video game industry
5289000	5291000	Coming up the FUGL question of the week
5291000	5293000	Match game in this segment as well
5293000	5295000	We're going to get players for that soon
5295000	5297000	But first Loki
5297000	5299000	Alright so let's talk a little bit about
5299000	5301000	Ridge Racer
5301000	5303000	That's right Ridge Racer
5303000	5305000	Driftopia
5305000	5307000	Is a new game that they announced that they're going to be putting out
5307000	5309000	No it's not like your classic Ridge Racer
5309000	5311000	It's actually kind of an extension
5311000	5313000	Of Ridge Racer Unbounded
5313000	5315000	Which is done by Bugbear
5315000	5317000	And they're doing a new one
5317000	5319000	It's going to be a free to play game
5319000	5321000	So you're going to have
5321000	5323000	I guess the ability to buy cars, repair kits, and XP packs
5323000	5325000	Hopefully it's just not going to be crippled
5325000	5327000	By the free to play stuff
5327000	5329000	It's coming to PS3 and PC
5329000	5331000	Hurry
5331000	5333000	This is something I actually backed on
5333000	5335000	On Kickstarter, Road Redemption
5335000	5337000	It is a spiritual successor to
5337000	5339000	Road Rash, it's in 3D
5339000	5341000	And they're looking for $160,000
5341000	5343000	Over the next 30 days
5343000	5345000	And
5345000	5347000	As of right now I believe
5347000	5349000	They're not quite there
5349000	5351000	They are
5351000	5353000	Let's see
5353000	5355000	$34,000
5355000	5357000	Not bad, so I think they'll make it
5357000	5359000	And it looks kind of neat
5359000	5361000	It is not though done by anybody
5362000	5364000	And last but not least
5364000	5366000	Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
5366000	5368000	It's fantastic
5368000	5370000	If you haven't watched the trailer yet
5370000	5372000	For the game
5372000	5374000	You should definitely check it out
5374000	5376000	They even have a fake 80's cartoon
5376000	5378000	That they made for the advertisement
5378000	5380000	For this game
5380000	5382000	Seriously, buy this game when it comes out in the first
5382000	5384000	It's out on Steam
5384000	5386000	And PS3 and
5386000	5388000	Xbox 360
5388000	5390000	Hopefully all around at the same time
5390000	5392000	They have, instead of loading screens
5392000	5394000	They have tracking screens
5394000	5396000	Like VHS tracking
5396000	5398000	It's awesome
5398000	5400000	So what does that mean?
5400000	5402000	It does the little fuzzy wuzzies
5402000	5404000	Like a tape that's been de-magnetized
5404000	5406000	It's all fuzzy and then there's the tracking
5406000	5408000	Thing going back and forth on the bottom
5408000	5410000	Can you adjust it?
5410000	5412000	No
5412000	5414000	And it's great that they have tool tips on there
5414000	5416000	For example, fast travel
5416000	5418000	Is like traveling
5418000	5420000	Fast
5420000	5422000	Or
5422000	5424000	Guns, or was it
5424000	5426000	Shooting enemies within range
5426000	5428000	Will cause them damage
5428000	5430000	I need this in my life
5430000	5432000	Alright
5432000	5434000	Let's get to
5434000	5436000	Some other stories here
5436000	5438000	This is interesting
5438000	5440000	Armature Studio was working on an unreleased
5440000	5442000	Mega Man first person shooter
5442000	5444000	Called Maverick Hunter
5444000	5446000	This is in a report from Polygon
5446000	5448000	Armature Studio is the Austin based developer
5448000	5450000	That was formed from Retro Studios originally
5450000	5452000	Yeah, it was a Mega Man X first person shooter
5452000	5454000	I don't know if that necessarily means
5454000	5456000	You know, like Mega Man Legends or all that
5456000	5458000	But I think this was supposed to be a little more
5458000	5460000	Like, you know, hardcore
5460000	5462000	Or something like that
5462000	5464000	Capcom did cancel the project
5464000	5466000	You know, cause Mega Man Universe and Mega Man Legends 3
5466000	5468000	All those went to hell, so why not this one as well
5468000	5470000	Armature did have a prototype in 2010
5470000	5472000	And it looks like there was a little screenshot
5472000	5474000	That leaked to the web as well
5474000	5476000	I watched it already
5476000	5478000	How'd it look? I didn't see the video
5478000	5480000	It gave me a lot of vibe
5480000	5482000	I don't know if it would have been this bad
5482000	5484000	But it gave me a lot of the
5484000	5486000	Bomberman
5486000	5488000	Act Zero vibe
5488000	5490000	Cause it didn't really look like Mega Man
5490000	5492000	He was firing, you know, like machine guns
5492000	5494000	And stuff like that
5494000	5496000	And, you know, just kind of fighting some generic
5496000	5498000	Looking robots and doing all sorts of weird
5498000	5500000	Take downs and stuff
5500000	5502000	It just didn't seem very much like Mega Man
5502000	5504000	It looked neat, but I don't know if it was necessarily
5504000	5506000	Mega Man
5506000	5508000	I don't know
5508000	5510000	I would have probably played it, but
5510000	5512000	I don't know
5512000	5514000	He sort of resembled Mega Man
5514000	5516000	I mean, I can kind of see the look
5516000	5518000	But it was very Bomberman Act Zero-ish
5518000	5520000	Ubisoft
5520000	5522000	Has picked up German developer related
5522000	5524000	Designs
5524000	5526000	They made the Anno strategy series
5526000	5528000	Including Anno 1404
5528000	5530000	Which is Dawn's Discovery over here
5530000	5532000	Ubisoft previously held a 30% share
5532000	5534000	In the company, but they have purchased the other 70%
5534000	5536000	It is undisclosed for how much
5536000	5538000	That went for, but you can expect more
5538000	5540000	Strategy style games for Ubisoft in the near future
5540000	5542000	Unfortunately, Atari
5542000	5544000	Closed a studio this week
5544000	5546000	They closed Eden Games
5546000	5548000	Which was the mind behind Test Drive Unlimited
5548000	5550000	And Alone in the Dark
5550000	5552000	A long time ago
5552000	5554000	This is according to a report from Eurogamer
5554000	5556000	I can't believe they closed that
5556000	5558000	Studio after such a wonderful game
5558000	5560000	Like Alone in the Dark
5560000	5562000	I like the Test Drive games
5562000	5564000	The problem was
5564000	5566000	It wasn't Forza
5566000	5568000	It just wasn't
5568000	5570000	That same level
5570000	5572000	They had a charm of their own
5572000	5574000	To get away from the police, you drove in the grass
5574000	5576000	I can't get you, you've left a road
5576000	5578000	How am I going to get you now?
5578000	5580000	Damn you grass
5580000	5582000	And also, Lamborghinis make really awesome
5582000	5584000	Off-road vehicles
5584000	5586000	Twitch Game Guru in our chatroom
5586000	5588000	At live.vognetwork.com says
5588000	5590000	Atari still exists?
5590000	5592000	What have they put out lately?
5592000	5594000	Actually, they were supposed to be liquidating soon
5594000	5596000	Weren't they? Because all their properties
5596000	5598000	Are supposed to be up for sale
5598000	5600000	I don't know what happened to that
5600000	5602000	It's supposed to happen
5602000	5604000	Marble Madness up for sale
5604000	5606000	Somebody needs to pick up Marble Madness
5606000	5608000	That's an Xbox Live Arcade
5608000	5610000	PlayStation Network thing worth
5610000	5612000	Picking up for sure
5612000	5614000	They would have to do a lot to Marble Madness though
5614000	5616000	More stages than 6
5616000	5618000	And longer levels
5618000	5620000	And more challenges
5620000	5622000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5622000	5624000	I have some stuff and things
5624000	5626000	It would help if I was actually on the right window
5626000	5628000	On my stupid iPad
5628000	5630000	We have a new mobile game coming out soon
5630000	5632000	The Prince of Persia
5632000	5634000	The Shadow and the Flame
5634000	5636000	Is going to mobile on that
5636000	5638000	Fun date
5638000	5640000	That we like to refer to as
5640000	5642000	Soon
5642000	5644000	But soon
5644000	5646000	And it's
5646000	5648000	Being developed by
5648000	5650000	Ubisoft Pune
5650000	5652000	Ubisoft Pune?
5652000	5654000	What?
5654000	5656000	P-U-N-E
5656000	5658000	You say it
5658000	5660000	Who likes the Pune?
5660000	5662000	Come over to Ubisoft
5662000	5664000	You gave me this story
5664000	5666000	So you can give me shit
5666000	5668000	Get yourself the Pune
5668000	5670000	You gave me this story
5670000	5672000	Ubisoft and saved yourself from trying to
5672000	5674000	It's Rob's fault
5674000	5676000	Do not get in the way of me blaming Rob for shit
5676000	5678000	I will judge you
5678000	5680000	Ok
5680000	5682000	Dark Souls
5682000	5684000	Cause I know that there are a lot of people out there who like this game
5684000	5686000	It sold 2.3 million copies worldwide
5686000	5688000	And that was
5688000	5690000	From Software
5690000	5692000	That put this out
5692000	5694000	They actually had an event to announce this out
5694000	5696000	For the Japanese press
5696000	5698000	It sold 375,000 copies for PS3 in Japan
5698000	5702000	And 1.3 million internationally for PS3 and Xbox 360
5702000	5704000	So yay for Dark Souls fans
5704000	5706000	You know what I think they should do with that series?
5706000	5708000	They should get the guy that made
5708000	5710000	I want to be the guy
5710000	5712000	And have him help with level design
5712000	5714000	For that game cause that would be awesome
5714000	5716000	Just to fuck with the fans
5716000	5718000	And make it so hard
5718000	5720000	That would make people jump off buildings
5720000	5722000	Or into bullet trains
5722000	5724000	And that type of thing
5724000	5726000	It'd be like a rehash of the beginning of Suicide Club
5726000	5728000	And then last but not least
5728000	5730000	Oh ha ha
5730000	5732000	Remember that guy Adam Orth?
5732000	5734000	We were kind of giving him shit last week
5734000	5736000	Kinda
5736000	5738000	Well guess what? He quit
5738000	5740000	Either he quit or was fired
5740000	5742000	He's the one that said
5742000	5744000	Sorry I don't get the drama about having an always on console
5744000	5746000	Every device is always on
5746000	5748000	That's the world we live in
5748000	5750000	Hashtag deal with it
5750000	5752000	He decided to retire so he could get all the Pune
5752000	5754000	Well
5754000	5756000	Rob
5756000	5758000	I've been drinking leave me alone
5762000	5764000	Well someone actually went back and asked him
5764000	5766000	Did you learn nothing from Diablo 3 or SimCity
5766000	5768000	You know some people's internet goes out right
5768000	5770000	Deal with it is a shitty reason
5770000	5772000	And he replied electricity goes out too
5772000	5774000	That somebody worked for BioWare if I remember right
5774000	5776000	Manveer
5776000	5778000	Could that have just been friends
5778000	5780000	Giving each other shit cause I'm way
5780000	5782000	Way meaner to people on Twitter than that guy was
5782000	5784000	Well
5784000	5786000	I mean the person made another good point
5786000	5788000	You lived in Seattle, San Francisco, LA
5788000	5790000	Very connected places try living in
5790000	5792000	Jamesville, Wisconsin or Blacksburg, Virginia
5792000	5794000	And then he said why on earth
5794000	5796000	Would I live there
5798000	5800000	It's a fair question
5800000	5802000	I mean I'm sorry
5802000	5804000	But
5804000	5806000	Come on like you haven't said way worse shit
5806000	5808000	On the internet like you haven't said way worse shit
5808000	5810000	I'm completely innocent
5810000	5812000	Yeah but I've said shit about places I've actually lived
5812000	5814000	Look
5814000	5816000	I get it though this is just the day and age
5816000	5818000	That we live in is that you know
5818000	5820000	Whether or not you want to represent your company
5820000	5822000	When you are the creative director for Microsoft
5822000	5824000	There are people that are going to read way
5824000	5826000	Too much into your stuff
5826000	5828000	Like you know create a second account
5828000	5830000	That's anonymous or something like that
5830000	5832000	But like cause I mean if you're like
5832000	5834000	Working at Microsoft you don't go
5834000	5836000	I don't understand what the big deal is
5836000	5838000	You're the creative director for Microsoft
5838000	5840000	You don't go posting shit on the internet
5840000	5842000	Unless you hate your job
5842000	5844000	Do you think that he ever imagined
5844000	5846000	That the entirety of gaming
5846000	5848000	Online would read so
5848000	5850000	Much into his tweets
5850000	5852000	People on the internet don't think about consequence
5852000	5854000	Usually
5854000	5856000	I know right
5856000	5858000	No one put a gun to his head to tell him to be stupid
5858000	5860000	Yeah but some people are just stupid
5860000	5862000	Okay but by your guys definition
5862000	5864000	Is stupid I act stupid all the time
5864000	5866000	Yes you do Rob
5866000	5868000	I don't but I
5868000	5870000	Rather I like my job
5870000	5872000	And I wouldn't want to lose it due to my opinion
5872000	5874000	But I'm also smart enough to not talk about my industry
5874000	5876000	Well exactly and no matter how drunk
5876000	5878000	You might be right now Rob I've seen you far drunker
5878000	5880000	And even in
5880000	5882000	You've seen me at my most drunkest
5882000	5884000	And even in the depths of inebriation
5884000	5886000	I have never seen you said I'm gonna go post
5886000	5888000	About my work on Tumblr or Twitter
5888000	5890000	Me
5890000	5892000	Rob's never done that I have seen you kiss a girl
5892000	5894000	Which was very weird
5894000	5896000	Why are we bringing this up?
5896000	5898000	Because you were drunk
5898000	5900000	What does me kissing a girl
5900000	5902000	Have to do with an always online Xbox
5902000	5904000	It's less offensive than this guy
5908000	5910000	I love watching Rob turn red it's hilarious
5910000	5912000	He is literally like blowing
5912000	5914000	I almost want to put that into a poll question
5914000	5916000	What's more offensive Rob kissing a girl
5916000	5918000	Or that guy
5918000	5920000	So anyway
5920000	5922000	The guy actually
5922000	5924000	Apart from
5924000	5926000	Somehow or another losing
5926000	5928000	His means of employment
5928000	5930000	Which by the way I'm open for employment
5930000	5932000	Microsoft you can hire me
5932000	5934000	I don't go saying stupid shit on the internet just saying
5934000	5936000	Are you sure? Rob
5936000	5938000	500 episodes dark soccer
5938000	5940000	I don't say stupid shit about my job
5940000	5942000	Honey you've said a lot of stupid shit on this show
5942000	5944000	I have said a lot of stupid shit on this show
5944000	5946000	A real friend will tell you that
5946000	5948000	I love this show
5948000	5950000	I admit it
5950000	5952000	Anyway the dude actually locked
5952000	5954000	His Twitter and deleted
5954000	5956000	His linked in account
5956000	5958000	So yeah he's like
5958000	5960000	I'm going to hide now
5960000	5962000	Can you blame him?
5962000	5964000	I don't blame him he's kind of stupid
5964000	5966000	If freaking loltaku is going to be posting everything
5966000	5968000	That you tweet about then yeah
5968000	5970000	It's suddenly going to become a new headline
5970000	5972000	Then yeah I'd go into hiding too
5972000	5974000	And you all want to know why I don't use my real name
5974000	5976000	On this show because you know
5976000	5978000	I like my job
5978000	5980000	I just don't care
5980000	5982000	What about all this mess or what?
5982000	5984000	Everything
5984000	5986000	You don't care about everything
5986000	5988000	I just don't care I still didn't get
5988000	5990000	Other than the fact that his comments
5990000	5992000	Are a little insensitive to the fact that
5992000	5994000	Hey there are a lot of people
5994000	5996000	That are trying to figure out what this new
5996000	5998000	Xbox is going to be like and
5998000	6000000	The rumors that it's going to be online only
6000000	6002000	And then you come out and say well I don't see
6002000	6004000	The problem with that is I mean after all it sounds
6004000	6006000	Like a fucking wonderful thing
6006000	6008000	And then you start being insensitive to everybody
6008000	6010000	That people might be a little bit
6010000	6012000	Pissed off about that and you just don't
6012000	6014000	Understand why well
6014000	6016000	Come on can't you put yourself
6016000	6018000	In other people's shoes obviously not
6018000	6020000	Why would I want to live there?
6020000	6022000	Obviously they're not asking you to move to this
6022000	6024000	Fucking city they're talking about hey be
6024000	6026000	Empathetic
6026000	6028000	And by the way Rob just for the record I'm not offended
6028000	6030000	I was just like that's bizarre
6030000	6032000	Well it's Queen Simeon
6032000	6034000	Chat says well hey if some people become
6034000	6036000	Bicurious when inebriated
6036000	6038000	Look I just like to make out okay
6038000	6040000	I cook
6040000	6042000	What's wrong with that?
6042000	6044000	It's actually a true story I cook when I'm drunk
6044000	6046000	Who doesn't like enjoy a little kissy kissy
6046000	6048000	Every now and then come on
6048000	6050000	You guys were playing spin the bottle
6050000	6052000	And I was the only one sober because I had to drive
6052000	6054000	Which was boring
6054000	6056000	This was like ten years ago too
6056000	6058000	This was at the U.N. Loki apartment
6058000	6060000	That was a long time ago
6060000	6062000	I remember that
6062000	6064000	I think you were there
6064000	6066000	I remember you
6066000	6068000	Some of the things that happened when you weren't there Loki
6068000	6070000	I remember you like
6070000	6072000	Matrix walking up the
6072000	6074000	Or trying to matrix walk up the wall
6074000	6076000	That was fun
6076000	6078000	Remember the
6078000	6080000	DDR parties
6080000	6082000	People would
6082000	6084000	Inevitably end up like retardedly drunk
6084000	6086000	And then try to play DDR
6086000	6088000	And hit their head on the washing machine
6088000	6090000	That was behind the monitor
6090000	6092000	I don't know anything about that
6092000	6094000	La la la la
6094000	6096000	Let's see going to
6096000	6098000	The chat SSJ100 Matt talking about this guy
6098000	6100000	Says he got death threats the gaming community
6100000	6102000	Is sad that is stupid
6102000	6104000	That is stupid
6104000	6106000	The action
6106000	6108000	Needs to be taken against the people who are making
6108000	6110000	Death threats over a video
6110000	6112000	Game console
6112000	6114000	Priorities people
6114000	6116000	This is a problem though with the internet in general
6116000	6118000	Is that it has added this
6118000	6120000	Air of anonymity where people can just let the worst
6120000	6122000	Parts of their personality out
6122000	6124000	Without any sort of real consequence
6124000	6126000	Except unless you know how to track
6126000	6128000	IPs
6128000	6130000	And then you can message them back and tell them where they live
6130000	6132000	Alright is there anything else
6132000	6134000	You want to share with us for rapid fire
6134000	6136000	News that has gone on for 20 minutes?

6202000	6204000	That was clue worthy Rob
6206000	6208000	I like whenever I'm able to play with myself
6208000	6210000	I like playing with characters
6210000	6212000	That I can style to be like myself
6212000	6214000	Or an idealized version of myself
6214000	6216000	That's the unique thing about video games
6216000	6218000	Rare is the media platform
6218000	6220000	That allows yourself to project yourself
6220000	6222000	Into the media experience
6222000	6224000	Rare is the media platform
6224000	6226000	That not only allows you to
6226000	6228000	Right encourages you to play with yourself
6230000	6232000	I think I see what you're doing there Redertainment
6236000	6238000	And didn't he marry our own little angel?
6238000	6240000	Huh? Redertainment?
6240000	6242000	No it was not Redertainment
6242000	6244000	You're thinking of big red pimp
6244000	6246000	Different red
6246000	6248000	Sorry
6248000	6250000	Shane just messaged me other memories
6250000	6252000	Of things that happen in that apartment that are not
6252000	6254000	Appropriate for error
6254000	6256000	Send me a message
6256000	6258000	No I'm telling him to
6258000	6260000	Flaco Jones says I have to go with
6260000	6262000	GLaDOS
6262000	6264000	I've been drinking you guys
6264000	6266000	As if she wasn't already worthy of the title
6266000	6268000	After the first game
6268000	6270000	Portal 2 manages to give her even more depth
6270000	6272000	And a backstory as well
6272000	6274000	She also may be the most quotable character
6274000	6276000	In a video game history
6276000	6278000	More quotable than the old guy in Legend of Zelda?
6280000	6282000	It's dangerous to go alone
6282000	6284000	Kirby of course
6284000	6286000	Despite popular belief he doesn't suck
6286000	6288000	Evil says
6288000	6290000	Missing no
6290000	6292000	By a simple random encounter you get
6292000	6294000	Infinite rare candies and master
6294000	6296000	Balls for the cost of being disgraced
6296000	6298000	In the hall of fame
6298000	6300000	And Dasnichi replies
6300000	6302000	Solid snake
6302000	6304000	But are you still gonna feel that way
6304000	6306000	If it's not David Hayter?
6306000	6308000	That's my question
6308000	6310000	I need to not listen to
6310000	6312000	Any more of this while I'm having drinks
6312000	6314000	What, these lulls?
6314000	6316000	Ok so on Facebook we have
6316000	6318000	30 responses, should I read them all?
6318000	6320000	30 responses on Facebook
6322000	6324000	Grandpa says Mega Man
6324000	6326000	After he acquires the boss's skill powers
6326000	6328000	He's very versatile, I like my men
6328000	6330000	My men versatile
6330000	6332000	DarkSakura
6332000	6334000	replied but nobody cares
6334000	6336000	Tim P.
6336000	6338000	replied and said Commander Shepherd
6338000	6340000	He's the sexy space marine
6340000	6342000	I always wished I could be
6342000	6344000	He said he, a brochep fan
6344000	6346000	A brochep fan
6346000	6348000	There are no room for dude chefs in my head
6348000	6350000	Burr replied and said
6350000	6352000	Sonic the hedgehog
6352000	6354000	Too fast for the naked eye
6354000	6356000	Sonic the hedgehog, Sonic
6356000	6358000	He can really move, Sonic he's got an attitude
6358000	6360000	Sonic he's the fastest thing alive
6360000	6362000	Anyway to me as a kid that was the moment
6362000	6364000	When video games started to be cool
6364000	6366000	And not just goofy fun with ridiculous looking characters
6366000	6368000	I'll always have a soft spot for Sonic
6368000	6370000	as a series
6370000	6372000	Sil replied Garrus
6372000	6374000	First time I thought an alien was damn hot
6374000	6376000	I love you Sil
6376000	6378000	Dark Tetsuya said pantsless rage
6378000	6380000	Just kidding, in all seriousness I'd have to go
6380000	6382000	with Solid Snake
6382000	6384000	That was an old ass
6384000	6386000	That was an old ass
6386000	6388000	That was an old joke
6388000	6390000	Gamergirl says
6390000	6392000	Sophie, later known as Protos Hyas
6392000	6394000	Ok this music
6394000	6396000	is starting to not do it for me
6396000	6398000	From Tails of Graces F
6398000	6400000	because she's odd
6400000	6402000	Red the Haze says
6402000	6404000	Renegade femshep
6404000	6406000	I've never had a favorite game character but
6406000	6408000	Renegade femshep comes to mind
6408000	6410000	You know what, I actually have to
6410000	6412000	kind of agree with that playing Renegade femshep
6412000	6414000	is pretty fun, except in some
6414000	6416000	situations then it's just bitchy
6416000	6418000	But I'm playing one right now with Ashley's face
6418000	6420000	It's really funny
6420000	6422000	James S. replied and said
6422000	6424000	There's a sorely underrated mid-90s
6424000	6426000	NX game called The Illusion
6426000	6428000	of Gaia, that game rules
6428000	6430000	I have this game
6430000	6432000	Good choice
6432000	6434000	The journey that young Will endures in hopes to find out
6434000	6436000	what became of his father who ventured off
6436000	6438000	before him ultimately changes the course of the
6438000	6440000	entire world
6440000	6442000	This game came out during a time when games of this art style
6442000	6444000	weren't just for children
6444000	6446000	The themes were adult and the story utterly breathtaking
6446000	6448000	The music alone gives me chills
6448000	6450000	It was part of a three part series
6450000	6452000	Soul Blazer was one of them
6452000	6454000	Oh god, I can't remember the first
6454000	6456000	other game in the series
6456000	6458000	There's one other game in the series
6458000	6460000	It's Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia and there was another one
6460000	6462000	Dammit, well somebody in chat will remember
6462000	6464000	Yeah, somebody in chat do our
6464000	6466000	work for us
6466000	6468000	Andrew S. said
6468000	6470000	The Chesire Cat from American McGee
6470000	6472000	He's creepy and psychologically
6472000	6474000	sane and insane at the same time and always
6474000	6476000	cool and collected
6476000	6478000	Bobby Blackwolf says
6478000	6480000	Dot in Adventure, he was so brave
6480000	6482000	He was
6482000	6484000	He had to figure out how to get through that maze
6484000	6486000	Thank you
6486000	6488000	Rasteel UT, Terranigma, that was it
6488000	6490000	Oh, Prince Brightstar actually brought it up
6490000	6492000	first too, yes it was Terranigma was the other game
6492000	6494000	Shane replied and said
6494000	6496000	Another vote for Commander Shepard
6496000	6498000	but only if he's full on paragon
6498000	6500000	He sets the bar for what qualities
6500000	6502000	I'm looking for in a man, video game character
6502000	6504000	I mean
6504000	6506000	Gio Videa says
6506000	6508000	The Eye Tetromino
6508000	6510000	Everyone always wants the eye
6510000	6512000	Alright, I have to go with Dante from the Devil May Cry
6512000	6514000	series, a complete badass
6514000	6516000	also a bit of an asshole, you really get to see
6516000	6518000	Dante go from reckless teen
6518000	6520000	to equally reckless adult
6520000	6522000	Ronnie B says
6522000	6524000	Ico, he took me through a great journey
6524000	6526000	He went through a lot in the story and overall the game was really
6526000	6528000	original
6528000	6530000	Extover says Samus Aran and I don't need
6530000	6532000	to explain why
6532000	6534000	Well yes you do
6534000	6536000	The alternate universe extover thinks Nathan Drake
6536000	6538000	is his favorite based on ass physics
6538000	6540000	Also Matt, my boyfriend's
6540000	6542000	favorite is Yoshi
6542000	6544000	Wonder Dog Harold says
6544000	6546000	Leon S. Kennedy, he's so dreamy
6546000	6548000	Degenerate Johnny says
6548000	6550000	Kreia from Knights of the Old Republic 2
6550000	6552000	From being one your companions
6552000	6554000	at the beginning to becoming the ultimate
6554000	6556000	villain at the end, you'll find that she's one of the
6556000	6558000	most unique and best written characters you'll ever
6558000	6560000	meet in a video game
6560000	6562000	Emily C. replied and said
6562000	6564000	I love all cosmos in Katamari Dimash
6564000	6566000	He is so fun, flamboyant and makes me
6566000	6568000	laugh every time, that's a really good choice
6568000	6570000	Barbara O. says
6570000	6572000	Toss up between Cloud from Final Fantasy 7
6572000	6574000	and Balthier from Final Fantasy 12
6574000	6576000	We get to watch Cloud make a terrifying
6576000	6578000	discovery about himself and then fight his way
6578000	6580000	back from it. Balthier seems to be
6580000	6582000	only a dashing pirate, but he
6582000	6584000	slowly reveals both his trustworthiness
6584000	6586000	and his strong moral convictions
6586000	6588000	At least he's not talking about being a hero all the damn time
6588000	6590000	These are all really good answers
6590000	6592000	Wolf O'Donnell from Star Fox
6592000	6594000	because he can't let you do that
6594000	6596000	Wicked says
6596000	6598000	My favorite has to be Kratos, not because
6598000	6600000	of anything relatable, but due to his
6600000	6602000	utter ferocity and severe brutality
6602000	6604000	I had not seen in a video game character beforehand
6604000	6606000	It was almost like playing a villain, as cold-hearted
6606000	6608000	and brutal as he was
6608000	6610000	Kyrian G. says
6610000	6612000	Myak the Liar because his
6612000	6614000	dialogue is extremely entertaining
6614000	6616000	That or Luther, son of Scotia from
6616000	6618000	Lands of Lore 2, Guardians of Destiny
6618000	6620000	who provided many sound bites to my family
6620000	6622000	throughout the years
6622000	6624000	Edgar R. replies
6624000	6626000	There's nothing like roaming the post-apocalyptic world
6626000	6628000	beating up mini Power Rangers
6628000	6630000	and racing poison chihuahuas
6630000	6632000	Rob H. says
6632000	6634000	Guybrush Threepwood
6634000	6636000	He's a mighty pirate who can hold his breath for 10 minutes
6636000	6638000	and he also has a rubber chicken with a pulley
6638000	6640000	in the middle. How can you not like that?
6640000	6642000	There's a lot of unique answers
6642000	6644000	tonight. I like this. That's why I'm reading them all
6644000	6646000	because there's so many different ones
6646000	6648000	I feel equally about two characters
6648000	6650000	Samus Aran, she's awesome and badass
6650000	6652000	I fell in love with her in Super Metroid
6652000	6654000	My other all-time
6654000	6656000	fave is the adorable and amazing
6656000	6658000	Garrus. I wasn't too sure of him in Mass Effect
6658000	6660000	1, but by 2 they made his character so much
6660000	6662000	better. He's sweet, a bit of a dork,
6662000	6664000	but kind. J. Link
6664000	6666000	says Will from Illusion of Gaia
6666000	6668000	There's two people that said that
6668000	6670000	Go figure
6670000	6672000	People have good taste. I could relate at that age
6672000	6674000	when I played the game about being the outcast
6674000	6676000	change kid in class and having a clique
6676000	6678000	of dorky friends. It also didn't hurt
6678000	6680000	that the game story was amazing and I really
6680000	6682000	fell in love with it as my first real RPG
6682000	6684000	Dave Falcon says
6684000	6686000	Duke Nukem. Why? Hail to the
6686000	6688000	king, baby. Tiger Claw
6688000	6690000	says I'm gonna have to say Mario. Why?
6690000	6692000	Because he always gets the girl in the end
6692000	6694000	Marinko says
6694000	6696000	Knuckles the Echidna
6696000	6698000	I can never say that. No one
6698000	6700000	has better background music than that Red Demon
6700000	6702000	Pumpkin Hill, anyone?
6702000	6704000	Haseo Sumeruwagara says
6704000	6706000	To be honest, I'd have to say Oran from Final Fantasy
6706000	6708000	X, Travis Touchdown from No More
6708000	6710000	Heroes, and Big Boss from the Metal Gear
6710000	6712000	series. I loved
6712000	6714000	Big Boss in the very first game.
6714000	6716000	That was amazing. Lastly,
6716000	6718000	Slagkick says
6718000	6720000	Bayonetta. She's a fierce
6720000	6722000	witch who kicks major ass and has great
6722000	6724000	hair. Great hair. Fabulous.
6724000	6726000	You know what? I'm actually starting
6726000	6728000	that game next week. Good answers.
6728000	6730000	Bayonetta is freaking amazing.
6730000	6732000	Alright.
6732000	6734000	So, let's go around the table.
6734000	6736000	I'm curious what you guys all think. Dark
6736000	6738000	Sakura, I'll start with you as if this is gonna be a
6738000	6740000	shock. Favorite game character of all time?
6740000	6742000	The Guardian from
6742000	6744000	Guardian Legend.
6744000	6746000	Good pick. Why The Guardian?
6746000	6748000	Because Guardian Legend, first of all, is my favorite game.
6748000	6750000	And it was just
6750000	6752000	it was really neat when playing through the game
6752000	6754000	and then
6754000	6756000	having to pause the game and going, is that
6756000	6758000	a girl? That's a girl.
6758000	6760000	Yeah. And it was, you know,
6760000	6762000	an early NES game that had
6762000	6764000	a female protagonist. And yeah, we had Metroid
6764000	6766000	but you didn't find out that Samus
6766000	6768000	was female until you beat the
6768000	6770000	game or put in Justin Bailey.
6770000	6772000	You know, it was
6772000	6774000	a character that was
6774000	6776000	going around and kicking a lot of ass
6776000	6778000	in one of the most difficult
6778000	6780000	games I have ever played in my life.
6780000	6782000	And we all know how freaking hard that game
6782000	6784000	is. I don't have nearly half the skill I used to
6784000	6786000	have at that game. It's so amazing though.
6786000	6788000	I've beaten it. God, I wish that game
6788000	6790000	would come back somehow. I don't really want
6790000	6792000	like a remake necessarily, but just a spiritual
6792000	6794000	successor of sorts. Well, I'm still trying to
6794000	6796000	I'm debating putting an MSX emulator on
6796000	6798000	so I can play Gardic, the first one.
6798000	6800000	Yeah. Oh,
6800000	6802000	sorry, anything else? Well,
6802000	6804000	The Guardian Effect, yeah.
6804000	6806000	But
6806000	6808000	I also would have to, I mean,
6808000	6810000	as far as classic gaming, that
6810000	6812000	would be probably my favorite character.
6812000	6814000	Anything more modern,
6814000	6816000	I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta.
6816000	6818000	Yeah. Because, well,
6818000	6820000	I mean, I really would like to go with
6820000	6822000	my own Shepard, but I have my own
6822000	6824000	weird head canon. Then you're playing with yourself
6824000	6826000	like ready to chamber. Then I'm playing with myself.
6826000	6828000	And I can get dirty, especially the places my brain goes.
6828000	6830000	So, Hey all!
6830000	6832000	So, um,
6832000	6834000	I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta just because
6834000	6836000	it's totally fabulous. And I love
6836000	6838000	her character concept. I love the game.
6838000	6840000	It was completely over the top.
6840000	6842000	And I watched Dan play through it for a little while
6842000	6844000	because I didn't, you know, really do a lot
6844000	6846000	of console gaming after my surgery.
6846000	6848000	Except for playing Blue Dragon.
6848000	6850000	So, um, but I've got a lot more
6850000	6852000	endurance in my hand now thanks to practicing a lot.
6852000	6854000	So I'm going to sit down and try to play through
6854000	6856000	Bayonetta. So playing with yourself has gotten
6856000	6858000	your hand a lot of practice. No, I've been drawing!
6858000	6860000	Shut up! Alright.
6860000	6862000	Becky, do you have a favorite
6862000	6864000	that you'd want to mention?
6864000	6866000	Well, since the last time I
6866000	6868000	played video games before Jamie got
6868000	6870000	me hooked on Mass Effect was
6870000	6872000	on my parents, Commodore 64.
6872000	6874000	Good choice.
6874000	6876000	I think I would probably have to say
6876000	6878000	FemShep.
6878000	6880000	I like, I really like her
6880000	6882000	mostly paragon with just a little bit of bitchiness
6882000	6884000	here and there because it makes her feel human.
6884000	6886000	Very good. Very good answer.
6886000	6888000	You're in good company with some of our listeners tonight.
6888000	6890000	Loki?
6890000	6892000	One of my favorite characters
6892000	6894000	and unfortunately they better bring him
6894000	6896000	back for the goddamn fourth game because that was
6896000	6898000	a fucking mistake to kill him off.
6898000	6900000	Johnny Gap from the Saints
6900000	6902000	Row series. Fucking awesome
6902000	6904000	awesome character.
6904000	6906000	Of course, voiced by
6906000	6908000	Daniel Dae Kim.
6908000	6910000	From Lost and stuff.
6910000	6912000	Just awesome.
6912000	6914000	Really cool character.
6916000	6918000	That's probably it.
6918000	6920000	My favorite video game character
6920000	6922000	ever would probably be
6922000	6924000	Rydia from Final Fantasy IV.
6924000	6926000	That's a good choice. Because
6926000	6928000	just literally
6928000	6930000	watching her grow up through the game
6930000	6932000	and I have such an attachment to that story too
6932000	6934000	because that game was so epic and
6934000	6936000	that was really the first time most
6936000	6938000	people in America saw the summoner
6938000	6940000	and that was such a badass thing when she would come back
6940000	6942000	to your party and she had all those
6942000	6944000	summons and you'd go to her homeland and everything
6944000	6946000	and she used the whip which was cool and
6946000	6948000	had the black magic and
6948000	6950000	she was great.
6950000	6952000	Obviously she had to grow
6952000	6954000	up a lot faster in that story and
6954000	6956000	went through tragedy and overcame it.
6956000	6958000	But I have such an attachment
6958000	6960000	to Final Fantasy IV but Rydia was an
6960000	6962000	amazing character.
6962000	6964000	Where Dan in this room, he would
6964000	6966000	probably list Cain as one of his favorite characters
6966000	6968000	from the same.
6968000	6970000	Or Zero.
6970000	6972000	I want to know what Allen
6972000	6974000	would pick. Allen,
6974000	6976000	sorry to put you on the spot. I know you came in here
6976000	6978000	to get a snack but what's your favorite
6978000	6980000	video game character ever?
6980000	6982000	Robo and Luca together.
6982000	6984000	Twins. OTP.
6984000	6986000	Good choice.
6986000	6988000	Good choice. Alright, thank you guys for
6988000	6990000	participating with the Fugu Question of the Week. I know
6990000	6992000	that was a lot this week. I read every
6992000	6994000	single answer because you know what? It's a show where
6994000	6996000	every gamer has a voice. Why not? Let's get back
6996000	6998000	into some news. Loki.
6998000	7000000	Alright, so let's
7000000	7002000	talk about some more Xbox rumors
7002000	7004000	and hopefully, I don't
7004000	7006000	know, I hope that these are all rumors
7006000	7008000	so I don't know. This is kind of almost
7008000	7010000	like the whole online thing.
7010000	7012000	But once again, I
7012000	7014000	still am under the assumption
7014000	7016000	at least I guess hopeful assumption
7016000	7018000	that Microsoft isn't dumb enough
7018000	7020000	to have a console that's
7020000	7022000	online only. That would
7022000	7024000	be a major gaming console that's online only
7024000	7026000	and maybe some of this kind of ties into it
7026000	7028000	and it's this leaked
7028000	7030000	roadmap that's been
7030000	7032000	a new roadmap that they had.
7032000	7034000	Now, this is coming
7034000	7036000	from VG Leaks so
7036000	7038000	who knows? But basically saying that
7038000	7040000	there's going to be two
7040000	7042000	Xboxes the next time around.
7042000	7044000	There's going to be a mini Xbox that's going to
7044000	7046000	operate kind of like an
7046000	7048000	Apple TV. Basically, all the
7048000	7050000	video streaming stuff
7050000	7052000	maybe even like Xbox Live Arcade
7052000	7054000	that kind of thing. That
7054000	7056000	will be online only because it will not have
7056000	7058000	a disk drive. However,
7058000	7060000	the regular console will
7060000	7062000	not be online only.
7062000	7064000	That makes a little more sense
7064000	7066000	because an Apple TV
7066000	7068000	kind of operates the same way. It's not
7068000	7070000	necessarily online only but to get
7070000	7072000	all the functionality of it, you have to be connected.
7072000	7074000	You mean to use Netflix? I have to be online?
7074000	7076000	Shut the front door.
7076000	7078000	And they're saying
7078000	7080000	that basically the
7080000	7082000	whole
7082000	7084000	tying in with the TV is going to be
7084000	7086000	a big thing. Basically, they're saying the smaller
7086000	7088000	Xbox is to compete with the Apple TV
7088000	7090000	but also provides XBLA and
7090000	7092000	360 game support
7092000	7094000	which will give it an edge over the Apple
7094000	7096000	TV. Basically,
7096000	7098000	saying that the rumors of the online
7098000	7100000	only requirement
7100000	7102000	come from the smaller Xbox unit which may
7102000	7104000	not have a disk drive like Apple TV.
7104000	7106000	It would require
7106000	7108000	a network connection and internet
7108000	7110000	to provide any real functionality.
7110000	7112000	It may be possible they will design
7112000	7114000	both consoles to be stackable.
7114000	7116000	And
7116000	7118000	of course, the original
7118000	7120000	rumor was that Durango is not
7120000	7122000	going to be backwards compatible
7122000	7124000	which makes sense. It's a
7124000	7126000	different processor altogether.
7126000	7128000	The PS4 is not going to be
7128000	7130000	backwards compatible either.
7130000	7132000	Also, the Kinect, they're saying that
7132000	7134000	a different department within
7134000	7136000	Xbox handles the Kinect hardware and
7136000	7138000	software. The focus was more on developing
7138000	7140000	and networking both consoles
7140000	7142000	with Kinect more of an
7142000	7144000	afterthought at that point. It says concerning
7144000	7146000	dealing with it, it's less an issue than hardware changes.
7146000	7148000	The main console, Kinect, isn't the
7148000	7150000	primary focus. However,
7150000	7152000	development kits require several pieces
7152000	7154000	of hardware combined. All the potential
7154000	7156000	hardware which may or may not be
7156000	7158000	required to work with each other.
7158000	7160000	Which also includes the potential for any
7160000	7162000	devices to require a network
7162000	7164000	connection which is where that required
7164000	7166000	rumor comes from.
7166000	7168000	I'm thinking
7168000	7170000	I'm just hoping that it's not all
7170000	7172000	online only. This sounds a little bit more
7172000	7174000	Microsoft. Microsoft's
7174000	7176000	always been about streaming crap to your TV.
7176000	7178000	They have the whole Windows
7178000	7180000	XP Media Center edition and that kind of
7180000	7182000	shit.
7182000	7184000	I could see them wanting to be in
7184000	7186000	your living room and have this focus and
7186000	7188000	stuff.
7188000	7190000	I'm just hoping that they don't make the mistake of
7190000	7192000	having a console that's going to be a next gen
7192000	7194000	console that's only online.
7194000	7196000	After all, Microsoft's
7196000	7198000	live service hasn't been working very
7198000	7200000	well the last few days.
7200000	7202000	It's not a good idea to say
7202000	7204000	hey, we're going to be online only.
7204000	7206000	Ignore the fact that you couldn't connect
7206000	7208000	to live the last few days.
7208000	7210000	Let me ask this though,
7210000	7212000	because here we go again reporting
7212000	7214000	on rumors.
7214000	7216000	I'm not saying us specifically,
7216000	7218000	but I'm just talking the internet and the whole
7218000	7220000	hype machine. Why do we keep
7220000	7222000	reporting on rumors?
7222000	7224000	Because we don't have anything to go off of from
7224000	7226000	them. All we know is that they're going to
7226000	7228000	have
7228000	7230000	some sort of, the rumor is that
7230000	7232000	they're going to have some sort of
7232000	7234000	reveal at the end of May, but right now
7234000	7236000	we have no information about it other than what's
7236000	7238000	supposedly leaking out.
7238000	7240000	I think mainly discussing this, I'm not saying
7240000	7242000	this is all fact. I'm just saying here's the rumor
7242000	7244000	and I hope
7244000	7246000	it's a little bit more on this side
7246000	7248000	than it's always
7248000	7250000	online. There is no other
7250000	7252000	way about it.
7252000	7254000	I want to know how important talking
7254000	7256000	about Xbox rumors are. You know what it's
7256000	7258000	time for? I think it's time for us
7258000	7260000	to poll the listeners.
7260000	7262000	We're going to put up a live poll right
7262000	7264000	now at live.vognetwork.com
7264000	7266000	If you want to vote in the poll, make sure
7266000	7268000	you're logged in. live.vognetwork.com
7268000	7270000	How much weight
7270000	7272000	do you give to Xbox
7272000	7274000	rumors? It's Microsoft, it's
7274000	7276000	all true. I think a lot of it is
7276000	7278000	true, but I'm still quite skeptical.
7278000	7280000	I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,
7280000	7282000	but once in a while the truth leaks.
7282000	7284000	Or the internet is full of lies
7284000	7286000	and slander, and I don't
7286000	7288000	believe any of it. Vote now
7288000	7290000	live.vognetwork.com
7290000	7292000	Our Instant Poll
7292000	7294000	We'll read the results
7294000	7296000	here in a moment, and try to
7296000	7298000	get some of the answers as they come in.
7298000	7300000	Alright.
7300000	7302000	And then one other thing also,
7302000	7304000	another rumor coming along with
7304000	7306000	some of the launch titles. Next-Gen
7306000	7308000	Forza game, Rise,
7308000	7310000	a couple weeks ago I've been talking about
7310000	7312000	Rise saying, where the fuck was that
7312000	7314000	gladiator game that showed that it was supposed to be a
7314000	7316000	Kinect title? So that
7316000	7318000	may be something that's going to be there. And then
7318000	7320000	some sort of, you know, kind of
7320000	7322000	Nintendo Land-esque Kinect
7322000	7324000	game. Although I
7324000	7326000	am seeing a lot of Kinect titles, two of those
7326000	7328000	being Kinect-required titles, so
7328000	7330000	ehhhhh
7330000	7332000	Not interested, but
7332000	7334000	Forza sounds cool. Forza Horizon.
7334000	7336000	Next-Gen Forza Horizon, I could be down with that.
7336000	7338000	Alright, right now in our Instant
7338000	7340000	Poll, very much, it's very tilted
7340000	7342000	towards the bullshit side of things.
7342000	7344000	67% of the vote for
7344000	7346000	I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,
7346000	7348000	but once in a while the truth leaks.
7348000	7350000	21% saying the internet is full of
7350000	7352000	lies and slanders, I don't believe any of it.
7352000	7354000	So only 13%
7354000	7356000	of the vote at this point, I think the math doesn't add up because
7356000	7358000	it just updated, 13% of the vote
7358000	7360000	right now only slightly leans true.
7360000	7362000	Zero people saying
7362000	7364000	it's all true. Zero.
7364000	7366000	Rob, it's on the
7366000	7368000	internet, of course it's true. Well, some
7368000	7370000	people would think that. You know what,
7370000	7372000	honestly, I almost lean towards that top
7372000	7374000	option. With Microsoft, there's
7374000	7376000	very little that's fake anymore
7376000	7378000	it seems. But we'll see.
7378000	7380000	We'll leave that poll up for about another minute.
7380000	7382000	Again, live.vognetwork.com, live on this
7382000	7384000	Sunday evening if you want to vote in that poll.
7384000	7386000	I think we're all still UT has it wrong, instead of the internet
7386000	7388000	being 10% lies and 90% porn.
7388000	7390000	I think it's 10% lies,
7390000	7392000	10% hate,
7392000	7394000	and 80% porn.
7394000	7396000	YYR in our chatroom asking
7396000	7398000	where is the poll? It will show
7398000	7400000	up automatically at live.vognetwork.com
7400000	7402000	if you are logged
7402000	7404000	into the site. If you're not
7404000	7406000	logged into the site, it may not
7406000	7408000	show up for you.
7408000	7410000	This is a feature that's in beta
7410000	7412000	right now. Trademark.
7412000	7414000	So you can't talk about it to anybody.
7414000	7416000	Literally, this
7416000	7418000	was not tested.
7418000	7420000	We are testing it as the show goes on.
7420000	7422000	So, there you go.
7422000	7424000	Alright. You're all under NDA
7424000	7426000	you can't talk about it.
7426000	7428000	Alright, we'll do one more story and then I'll go to the results of that poll.
7428000	7430000	I'll shut it off and do that.
7430000	7432000	This is a story about Animal Crossing and I
7432000	7434000	can't flippin' believe this.
7434000	7436000	I know, right? That's the same sound I make.
7436000	7438000	Mr. Resetti
7438000	7440000	from Animal Crossing, optional
7440000	7442000	in New Leaf. What?
7442000	7444000	He is not there by
7444000	7446000	default and this is because of
7446000	7448000	QQ online.
7448000	7450000	Now, tell people
7450000	7452000	about Mr. Resetti for those that don't know Dark Star.
7452000	7454000	If you didn't save your game
7454000	7456000	and just turned off your
7456000	7458000	Animal Crossing, you turned off the system
7458000	7460000	where you had Animal Crossing loading.
7460000	7462000	When you started your game back up
7462000	7464000	this mole comes out of the ground
7464000	7466000	and yells at you
7466000	7468000	for ten minutes
7468000	7470000	in all capital huge letters
7470000	7472000	and from what
7472000	7474000	I understand, because I tried doing it on my Japanese
7474000	7476000	version, he's really freakin' rude.
7476000	7478000	And it was just absolutely
7478000	7480000	hilarious. He's like, what did you do in resetting
7480000	7482000	this form? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7482000	7484000	And he freakin' chews you out.
7484000	7486000	This mole, bitter
7486000	7488000	crass,
7488000	7490000	grumpy old mole
7490000	7492000	digs his self out of the hole just to give
7492000	7494000	you shit for not saving your game.
7494000	7496000	This is not popular in our chat.
7496000	7498000	Gamegirl says, what? He's the best part
7498000	7500000	of the game. YYR says, it's blasphemy.
7500000	7502000	Gameguru says, Mr. Resetti
7502000	7504000	has been fired. No, he's not
7504000	7506000	fired. Let me clarify here.
7506000	7508000	In a column called Iwata
7508000	7510000	Asks, Resetti's
7510000	7512000	status was updated.
7512000	7514000	Apparently out of guilt
7514000	7516000	the developers made him optional
7516000	7518000	in Animal Crossing New Leaf because
7518000	7520000	apparently he brought some players to
7520000	7522000	tears. Good!
7522000	7524000	Save your game!
7524000	7526000	They also changed the goal of the
7526000	7528000	game from paying off Tom Nook
7528000	7530000	to improving the town as the mayor.
7530000	7532000	So Tom Nook is no longer your
7532000	7534000	pimp. YYR says, Mr.
7534000	7536000	Resetti is a critical feature of Animal Crossing.
7536000	7538000	It is required for the game to
7538000	7540000	work properly. He handles many of the game's calculations
7540000	7542000	so it's technically impossible to run Animal
7542000	7544000	Crossing without it. Strudels89
7544000	7546000	says, he was a dick, lol.
7546000	7548000	Loki's a dick, but we all
7548000	7550000	love him. We keep him around.
7550000	7552000	He's a vital part
7552000	7554000	of the show. We couldn't do calculations
7554000	7556000	without him. In fact, you know what?
7556000	7558000	You know what we used to do all the time?
7558000	7560000	Fucking time travel. Fuck that
7560000	7562000	Resetti. Hell yeah. I'm time traveling like
7562000	7564000	fucking Marty McFly.
7564000	7566000	I would travel to my birthday every
7566000	7568000	year just to get more shit.
7568000	7570000	Now in an article on Destructoid, I
7570000	7572000	really like this point about it, but in an article
7572000	7574000	published on Destructoid, they talked about how it was
7574000	7576000	one of the more creative fourth-wall
7576000	7578000	breaking moments in gaming history
7578000	7580000	along with Psycho Mantis reading
7580000	7582000	your save files on the Playstation card.
7582000	7584000	I see you like Final Fantasy.
7584000	7586000	Did he actually? He only called
7586000	7588000	that other Konami games, didn't he? No, I'm sorry.
7588000	7590000	He said Xenogears
7590000	7592000	and it was on there before
7592000	7594000	Xenogears. What am I saying? Are you thinking Castlevania?
7594000	7596000	No. Yeah, he said Symphony of the Night
7596000	7598000	because Dan and I had... Sweet Coden?
7598000	7600000	It was Sweet Coden. That was it because Sweet Coden
7600000	7602000	hadn't come out yet.
7602000	7604000	By the way, we tried that
7604000	7606000	with our Japanese save file for Castlevania
7606000	7608000	and it did not work.
7608000	7610000	But what do you guys think?
7610000	7612000	Is it a great fourth-wall breaking
7612000	7614000	moment? I think more games should break the fourth-wall
7614000	7616000	to be honest. I think so too, but it was pretty cool
7616000	7618000	watching the controller move on the floor
7618000	7620000	with Psycho Mantis.
7620000	7622000	Alright, that's going to bring our poll
7622000	7624000	to an end at live.vognetwork.com
7624000	7626000	So from the last story, here it is.
7627000	7629000	How much weight do you give to Xbox Rumors?
7629000	7631000	62% of the vote saying
7631000	7633000	I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits
7633000	7635000	but once in a while the truth leaks.
7635000	7637000	Hey, finally a vote.
7637000	7639000	3% of the vote for it's Microsoft.
7639000	7641000	It's all true.
7641000	7643000	Oh, poor naive child.
7643000	7645000	12% I think a lot of it is true
7645000	7647000	but I'm still quite skeptical.
7647000	7649000	22% the internet is full of lies
7649000	7651000	and slanders. I don't believe any of it.
7651000	7653000	Hasea Sumiragawa says a good point.
7653000	7655000	Deadpool will. I'm excited.
7655000	7657000	But Deadpool you expected of Deadpool.
7657000	7659000	You didn't quite expect that in Animal Crossing.
7659000	7661000	To have a character come out of the ground
7661000	7663000	and yell at you for 10 minutes.
7663000	7665000	Whereas, I mean didn't you
7665000	7667000	ever read Deadpool
7667000	7669000	in comics? It's supposed to happen.
7669000	7671000	Hi. You know what else people
7671000	7673000	weren't expecting?
7673000	7675000	Video game match game
7675000	7677000	coming back to OLR tonight. When was the last
7677000	7679000	time we did this? It was a long time ago wasn't it?
7679000	7681000	A while. It was a while.
7681000	7683000	But we are going to do video game match game tonight
7683000	7685000	but we need some contestants for video game
7685000	7687000	match game. So let's get
7687000	7689000	a listener in the chat room. Here's
7689000	7691000	how we're going to pick a listener from the chat room.
7691000	7693000	The first person to name
7693000	7695000	that wants to play match game. First person
7695000	7697000	to shout out in chat. What
7697000	7699000	were the potato chips
7699000	7701000	that Jamie got excited about when they
7701000	7703000	were set on the table earlier in the evening?
7703000	7705000	This is test your memory earlier in the show.
7705000	7707000	First person to remember and shout it out in chat
7707000	7709000	will get to play. And
7709000	7711000	we'll take the first caller right now
7711000	7713000	on the skype line 1877 game
7713000	7715000	OLR or a user name on skype
7715000	7717000	orange lounge radio. The first person
7717000	7719000	to get through will get to play
7719000	7721000	video game match game against
7721000	7723000	our chat room
7723000	7725000	listener who answers first which is
7725000	7727000	Mako Chan or Jovidea got the
7727000	7729000	right answer. There it is. Mako Chan.
7729000	7731000	Alright so let me open
7731000	7733000	up a chat window with Mako Chan.
7733000	7735000	Mako Chan from Makoto.
7735000	7737000	Oh my bad.
7737000	7739000	Well I keep thinking of the Mako from
7739000	7741000	Mass Effect.
7741000	7743000	You know what? I kept calling it Mako
7743000	7745000	because
7745000	7747000	I took too much Japanese.
7747000	7749000	And the answer was
7749000	7751000	Chicken and Waffles and JasonXV
7751000	7753000	after that. CodeMan
7753000	7755000	TimTRP
7755000	7757000	got it. It wasn't the cheese bread. I just said the cheese
7757000	7759000	bread was delicious. Alright let's see
7759000	7761000	who Mako Chan is going to be competing against
7761000	7763000	tonight. Let's go to the skype line right now. Hi you're on
7763000	7765000	Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god
7765000	7767000	I got in. You got in? Hi.
7767000	7769000	OMG! Who is this?
7769000	7771000	It's Raven's Dolphin. Raven's
7771000	7773000	Dolphin! You always come out
7773000	7775000	for the big landmark episodes. I always
7775000	7777000	love hearing from you. Oh my god I
7777000	7779000	have to. You guys. I know you
7779000	7781000	have to get to match game but I have to say
7781000	7783000	you guys are an inspiration to me and my
7783000	7785000	show. What I do. I look
7785000	7787000	at you guys. I'm like wow they keep going.
7787000	7789000	I keep going. But
7789000	7791000	it is absolutely a pleasure to be
7791000	7793000	with you tonight. I totally love
7793000	7795000	your icon by the way. It's gorgeous. Thank you
7795000	7797000	so much and you know flattery will get you
7797000	7799000	everywhere but it won't win you the match game.
7799000	7801000	You can come over and have murder brownies.
7801000	7803000	Would you like a murder brownie?
7803000	7805000	Yes just send it over the internet
7805000	7807000	please. I know you have to get to match game but I
7807000	7809000	have to know one question. Alright
7809000	7811000	fair enough. Alright
7811000	7813000	so you've been doing this show for 11 years
7813000	7815000	and was there
7815000	7817000	a time that you said
7817000	7819000	I don't know if I can go on?
7819000	7821000	Yes.
7821000	7823000	Alright.
7823000	7825000	That was episode 2.
7825000	7827000	Yes.
7827000	7829000	If I
7829000	7831000	followed through every time I
7831000	7833000	threatened to quit the show there would have been about
7833000	7835000	20 Orange Lounge radios by now but
7835000	7837000	you know you find your motivation
7837000	7839000	and you keep going and you know
7839000	7841000	a lot of the drama tends to work itself
7841000	7843000	out and you know drama is drama
7843000	7845000	and drama
7845000	7847000	was something I thrived a lot more on when I was
7847000	7849000	in my 20s and now that I'm in my 30s
7849000	7851000	it's like I don't know what else
7851000	7853000	I'd have if I didn't have O.L.R.
7853000	7855000	The sad reality is
7855000	7857000	the sad reality is
7857000	7859000	this show will end someday.
7859000	7861000	I mean it has to. Everything comes to an end.
7861000	7863000	But I like to think it's going to end because
7863000	7865000	you know. Murder.
7865000	7867000	It's not going to end in murder. It's going to end
7867000	7869000	because Dark Sakura
7869000	7871000	has to move for a great
7871000	7873000	dream job of hers or something or
7873000	7875000	you know low key. It had to be a hell of a dream job.
7875000	7877000	You know I'm just saying like it's going to
7877000	7879000	be something along those lines
7879000	7881000	or you know the honest.
7881000	7883000	It would have to be something that would dramatically change our
7883000	7885000	dynamic. Or that
7885000	7887000	you know we all sit down and we agree
7887000	7889000	you know what we don't have the passion
7889000	7891000	for this we once did. And I mentioned on a
7891000	7893000	previous episode I sometimes worry about
7893000	7895000	where the gaming industry is going when we talk about all this
7895000	7897000	always online and
7897000	7899000	the management thinking they know what's best
7899000	7901000	for gamers. I sometimes sit here and wonder
7901000	7903000	am I going to be a video game fan
7903000	7905000	in a few years.
7905000	7907000	But I like to think I would
7907000	7909000	and even if I fell out of
7909000	7911000	love with new consoles the
7911000	7913000	dynamic of the show would just shift again.
7913000	7915000	We didn't start as a video
7915000	7917000	game show.
7917000	7919000	Super Orange on Radio 2X.
7919000	7921000	I was there when you
7921000	7923000	were at 2Go and I found you on a
7923000	7925000	PSP website. Which
7925000	7927000	Loki still needs to update the freaking thing.
7927000	7929000	No it was on a different PSP website.
7929000	7931000	Oh really?
7931000	7933000	Yeah it was on like this called
7933000	7935000	PSP Drive and it was formatted for
7935000	7937000	PSP and you were on there
7937000	7939000	and I remember downloading it
7939000	7941000	before the other sites and all that stuff.
7941000	7943000	This was before Black Wolf and A1 and I went like
7943000	7945000	oh Orange on Radio I'll download this.
7945000	7947000	Oh VGN I'll download this.
7947000	7949000	Yeah I have to admit Loki got
7949000	7951000	on that PSP bandwagon really early
7951000	7953000	and a lot of the PSP community really
7953000	7955000	supported that older website. We were
7955000	7957000	on whatever the AOL blog was for
7957000	7959000	PSP before they all merged into Joystiq.
7959000	7961000	We were featured on there once and
7961000	7963000	that was really cool.
7963000	7965000	As much as we joke about the PSP and that
7965000	7967000	website and how out of date it is, that
7967000	7969000	community really embraced Loki's
7969000	7971000	little project so we really appreciate that.
7971000	7973000	Now it's
7973000	7975000	Stitcher and iTunes.
7975000	7977000	Yeah it's all about Stitcher and iTunes. Especially Stitcher
7977000	7979000	I think is really the wave of the future especially as
7979000	7981000	iTunes continues to
7981000	7983000	shove
7983000	7985000	podcasting under the table.
7985000	7987000	That's for another episode.
7987000	7989000	I do have to share this. Frisbee says when that happens convert
7989000	7991000	OLR to food and Disneyland talk.
7991000	7993000	So Jon's like episode 501
7993000	7995000	dull whips.
7995000	7997000	Ragenator in chat says I've been
7997000	7999000	a fan of gaming for 32 years. I don't see
7999000	8001000	myself losing my gaming passion.
8001000	8003000	You know and I think ultimately I tend to
8003000	8005000	agree. I may get really pissed off at some
8005000	8007000	of the decisions that happen in the gaming industry
8007000	8009000	but at the end of the day I could always come on
8009000	8011000	here and talk about Commodore 64.
8011000	8013000	Right.
8013000	8015000	I keep going. You keep going.
8015000	8017000	It's an inspiration. Of course.
8017000	8019000	Let's get to the match game.
8019000	8021000	All right.
8021000	8023000	Do you know how the match game works Ravenstaufen?
8023000	8025000	Oh my god do I know.
8025000	8027000	I mean too bad we don't even have Charles Nelson
8027000	8029000	Wiley or that guy from
8029000	8031000	from Family Feud.
8031000	8033000	Well you've got me. Awesome.
8033000	8035000	Richard Dawson. You've got me and
8035000	8037000	you've got on the panel tonight you've got
8037000	8039000	Techmaster Loki is here joining us on the
8039000	8041000	panel tonight. Hello. And Dark Soccer
8041000	8043000	is here. Hi. And I'm here
8043000	8045000	and Chef Becky is here.
8045000	8047000	Iron Chef Becky is here
8047000	8049000	with her murder brownies to play
8049000	8051000	with us. Hello. And Becky you're going to play with
8051000	8053000	us too right? Sure. Sure why not.
8053000	8055000	And then also joining us in studio
8055000	8057000	tonight say hello to
8057000	8059000	Hello Mother Dolly.
8059000	8061000	Wow.
8061000	8063000	Oh Alan you're the best.
8063000	8065000	Or excuse me is it is it little
8065000	8067000	Alan tonight? It's not little Edie
8067000	8069000	it's just Alan. Hello.
8069000	8071000	All right Alan is going to be joining us tonight. So here's how
8071000	8073000	it works for the listeners who may not know.
8073000	8075000	We're going to read some statements
8075000	8077000	and these statements will have a blank
8077000	8079000	at the end of them or near
8079000	8081000	the end of them. It's up to Ravens Dolphin
8081000	8083000	and Mako Chan playing along
8083000	8085000	in our chat room to guess what will
8085000	8087000	be said in that blank by
8087000	8089000	the hosts on the panel.
8089000	8091000	For every answer they get right
8091000	8093000	they will get a point.
8093000	8095000	But like whose line is it anyway the
8095000	8097000	points really don't matter. But we'll give our
8097000	8099000	winner a little something. Listen to a no prize.
8099000	8101000	All right. So here we go
8101000	8103000	and Mako Chan if you're sitting there
8103000	8105000	in our chat room be sure to
8105000	8107000	send your answers over
8107000	8109000	private message to me as I give
8109000	8111000	them to you. All right
8111000	8113000	so here we go. Here is question
8113000	8115000	number one tonight.
8115000	8117000	Bobby Blackwolf.
8117000	8119000	It's the first question
8119000	8121000	it's got to be about Bobby.
8121000	8123000	Bobby Blackwolf brought
8123000	8125000	on the ire of 4chan
8125000	8127000	this week by voicing his opinion
8127000	8129000	on Twitter.
8129000	8131000	He didn't really seem to care at
8131000	8133000	first but he really lost
8133000	8135000	it when they came for
8135000	8137000	his blank.
8137000	8139000	Ding.
8139000	8141000	Bobby Blackwolf
8141000	8143000	brought on the ire of 4chan
8143000	8145000	this week by voicing his opinion on Twitter.
8145000	8147000	He didn't really seem to care about
8147000	8149000	it at first but he really
8149000	8151000	lost it when they came for his blank.
8151000	8153000	Chatters you can help out
8153000	8155000	by voicing your answer in our chat room
8155000	8157000	live.vognetwork.com
8157000	8159000	You know I actually did
8159000	8161000	miss the whole 4chan
8161000	8163000	thing I don't even know
8163000	8165000	It wasn't really that serious
8165000	8167000	Bobby had an opinion
8167000	8169000	and some folks disagreed with it.
8169000	8171000	You know what 4chan is for? Rolling my eyes.
8171000	8173000	And porn.
8173000	8175000	Ding for me.
8175000	8177000	Becky you good? You got an answer?
8177000	8179000	She's thinking.
8179000	8181000	Peek over
8181000	8183000	Jamie show the iPad and get some help
8183000	8185000	from the chatters. You have an answer
8185000	8187000	Alan?
8189000	8191000	He really lost it when they came
8191000	8193000	for his blank.
8195000	8197000	Am I supposed to say something now?
8197000	8199000	No no not yet because we need Becky
8199000	8201000	to ding first.
8201000	8203000	She's
8203000	8205000	Oh Becky will do
8205000	8207000	great. Help her out Jamie. Feed her one of the
8207000	8209000	answers it'll be funny.
8213000	8215000	Does Becky not want to play?
8215000	8217000	Alright Becky doesn't want to play. Alright fine.
8217000	8219000	It'll be four of us.
8219000	8221000	It's because Becky hasn't met Bobby.
8221000	8223000	She can't say it the same way.
8223000	8225000	Well here we go anyway.
8225000	8227000	So Raven's
8227000	8229000	Wait let me make sure Mako got an answer in because I didn't even check.
8229000	8231000	I usually check for that first.
8231000	8233000	Here we go.
8233000	8235000	Raven's Dolphin
8235000	8237000	The question is Bobby Blackwolf
8237000	8239000	brought on the Ira 4chan this week by
8239000	8241000	voicing his opinion on Twitter. He didn't really seem
8241000	8243000	to care at first but he really lost it when they
8243000	8245000	came for his
8245000	8247000	Ban hammer. His ban hammer.
8247000	8249000	Good answer good
8249000	8251000	answer. It's the only thing I could
8251000	8253000	come up with. Makochan in chat says
8253000	8255000	when they came for his
8255000	8257000	Anon membership card
8257000	8259000	I did not know Bobby was in
8259000	8261000	Anon but apparently he was. Alright
8261000	8263000	let's go around and see if we've got any match.
8263000	8265000	Ban hammer or Anon membership card.
8265000	8267000	Loki what did you get when they came for his
8267000	8269000	Fence. When they came for his
8269000	8271000	Fence. Not a match

8273000	8275000	No when they came for his Fence.
8275000	8277000	Dark Sakura

8285000	8287000	and his Fence. Allen what did you say
8287000	8289000	when they came for his.
8289000	8291000	Anti-brony propaganda.
8291000	8293000	Anti-brony propaganda.
8293000	8295000	Oh damn it. Not a match.
8295000	8297000	Not a match alright. And I said they
8297000	8299000	that he really lost it when they came for
8299000	8301000	his Clicky pen.
8301000	8303000	Clicky.
8303000	8305000	Clicky pen. I thought it was Clicky the pen.
8305000	8307000	Also not a match.
8307000	8309000	But it's a Clicky pen.
8309000	8311000	Alright. The score

8387000	8389000	Chan in chat said you

8397000	8399000	going to be a tie either way but let's see how many
8399000	8401000	points this may or may not earn them.
8401000	8403000	Loki yeah what did you say
8403000	8405000	yeah she should cook the
8405000	8407000	bacon el diablo. Bacon
8407000	8409000	el diablo.
8409000	8411000	Great answer
8411000	8413000	but not a match.
8413000	8415000	Alright. Dark
8415000	8417000	soccer. I did go for obvious
8417000	8419000	and say the ferret. The ferret did. Oh my
8419000	8421000	god. It's a
8421000	8423000	score on the match game leaderboard.
8423000	8425000	One to one.
8425000	8427000	Ding ding ding ding.
8427000	8429000	More points than people usually get during this.
8429000	8431000	Alright excellent. Uh
8431000	8433000	Alan
8433000	8435000	she should cook the
8435000	8437000	I think this still counts but my answer
8437000	8439000	was the bungee ferret. The
8439000	8441000	bungee ferret. Let's go to the judges.
8441000	8443000	Alright the judges will allow it.
8443000	8445000	Two to two for the ferret.
8445000	8447000	Alright and lastly my answer
8447000	8449000	she should cook the
8449000	8451000	Cylon occupied
8451000	8453000	caprica cake.
8453000	8455000	The Cylon
8455000	8457000	occupied caprica cake. Old
8457000	8459000	old joke. Alright there
8459000	8461000	it is. Two
8461000	8463000	two though. That
8463000	8465000	could be the highest score ever in the history of
8465000	8467000	video game matches. I think our highest score was three
8467000	8469000	to be honest. Was it? I think it was
8469000	8471000	three. There is still two questions
8471000	8473000	to go. Here we go. There are two
8473000	8475000	questions. There are two questions. Watch your
8475000	8477000	grammar drunkie.

8489000	8491000	of the 500th episode
8491000	8493000	to give up coffee forever.

8497000	8499000	to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give
8499000	8501000	up coffee forever. She came
8501000	8503000	to episode 501
8503000	8505000	and in a coffee deprived rage
8505000	8507000	instantly screamed into

8529000	8531000	First one to mention
8531000	8533000	blank dies.
8533000	8535000	I didn't think
8535000	8537000	of an answer for this one.

8559000	8561000	episode 501 and in a coffee
8561000	8563000	depraved rage instantly screamed
8563000	8565000	into the mic. First one to mention

8581000	8583000	and see what
8583000	8585000	we got. If we got any matches.
8585000	8587000	First one to mention Loki?
8587000	8589000	I almost said male chef
8589000	8591000	but I said Propel instead. Propel
8591000	8593000	first one to mention Propel
8593000	8595000	dies.
8595000	8597000	Do they even make Propel anymore?

8605000	8607000	Bro chef? Really?
8607000	8609000	Oh my god.
8609000	8611000	Alright I think we're gonna count it. I honestly couldn't think
8611000	8613000	of anything else. Mako Chan pulls
8613000	8615000	ahead three to two.
8615000	8617000	Alright Alan
8617000	8619000	first one to mention
8619000	8621000	Mocha Pinkberry.
8621000	8623000	Oh my god. Why does this not
8623000	8625000	exist? That was really close
8625000	8627000	to what Raven said but
8627000	8629000	I don't think it's close enough unfortunately. Why does this not
8629000	8631000	exist? I don't know. You should
8631000	8633000	write Pinkberry.
8633000	8635000	Alright and my answer was
8635000	8637000	first one to mention. Why not?
8637000	8639000	First
8639000	8641000	one to mention
8641000	8643000	Final Fantasy 11 dies.
8643000	8645000	Alright
8645000	8647000	not a match but one more
8647000	8649000	question. One more question. So close.
8649000	8651000	So close. Ravenstaufen you can do it.
8651000	8653000	I know. I have faith in you.
8653000	8655000	I have faith in you. I know. Alright.
8655000	8657000	But what about the chatter?
8657000	8659000	Alright here we go.
8659000	8661000	Question number four
8661000	8663000	the last one Ravenstaufen your only
8663000	8665000	hope. Alright.
8665000	8667000	Loki was very happy with the
8667000	8669000	poster that Codeman drew
8669000	8671000	to celebrate episode 500 of the show.
8671000	8673000	Upon careful
8673000	8675000	examination of the poster though
8675000	8677000	he exclaimed Rob I'm
8677000	8679000	surprised he drew you as a World
8679000	8681000	of Warcraft fan and not
8681000	8683000	as a fan of blank.
8685000	8687000	Rob I'm surprised he
8687000	8689000	drew you as a World of Warcraft fan
8689000	8691000	and not as a fan of blank.
8695000	8697000	Oh that was
8697000	8699000	really quick on all the hosts.
8699000	8701000	I'm still waiting on MakoChan to
8701000	8703000	ping in there in our chat
8703000	8705000	room at live.vognetware.com where some
8705000	8707000	people are going to feed the answers right now.
8707000	8709000	Loki very happy with the poster that
8709000	8711000	Codeman drew but
8711000	8713000	on careful examination of the poster
8713000	8715000	exclaimed Rob I'm surprised he didn't just draw you
8715000	8717000	as a fan of blank. Alright
8717000	8719000	MakoChan's got an answer. Ravenstaufen
8719000	8721000	you about good to go? Yeah
8721000	8723000	I got one. Alright then here we go.
8723000	8725000	Rob I'm surprised he drew
8725000	8727000	you as a World of Warcraft fan
8727000	8729000	and not as a fan of
8729000	8731000	DDR 4th mix.
8731000	8733000	DDR 4th mix.
8733000	8735000	Good answer. I was a fan of
8735000	8737000	DDR 4. 4th plus to be
8737000	8739000	specific but we'd let that slide.
8739000	8741000	MakoChan in our chat room says
8741000	8743000	I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft
8743000	8745000	fan and not as a fan of
8745000	8747000	Rocky Horror.
8747000	8749000	Okay good good
8749000	8751000	answer. Alright let's go around and see if
8751000	8753000	there's a match. Loki
8753000	8755000	surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft
8755000	8757000	fan and not as a fan of
8757000	8759000	Ni No Kuni's ending. Ni No Kuni's ending.
8759000	8761000	Wait a minute.
8761000	8763000	Alright.
8763000	8765000	Not a match I'm sorry
8765000	8767000	to say. DarkSakura
8767000	8769000	I'm surprised he drew you as a World of
8769000	8771000	Warcraft fan and not as a fan of
8771000	8773000	Para Para Paradise complete and kogal outfit.
8773000	8775000	What?
8775000	8777000	You'd be such a cute
8777000	8779000	get it. You almost named the right
8779000	8781000	Bamani game to match with
8781000	8783000	Raven's Dolphin but unfortunately
8783000	8785000	nope not gonna do it.
8785000	8787000	And I'll tell you what came with this is watching you play the damn
8787000	8789000	Abba game.
8789000	8791000	Alright.
8791000	8793000	I'm surprised he drew you as a World
8793000	8795000	of Warcraft fan and not as a fan
8795000	8797000	of Miss Nude World 96.
8797000	8799000	Miss Nude World
8799000	8801000	96.
8801000	8803000	Oh classic
8803000	8805000	classic answer.
8805000	8807000	Rob I'm surprised he
8807000	8809000	drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of
8809000	8811000	Hey I can be self
8811000	8813000	deprecating here. My answer was
8813000	8815000	not as a fan of
8815000	8817000	surprise butt sex.
8819000	8821000	Goodnight ladies and gentlemen.
8823000	8825000	Oh shoot I apparently
8825000	8827000	gave Codeman an idea. Uh oh.
8827000	8829000	What did you do? I have no
8829000	8831000	idea but I'm looking forward to it.
8831000	8833000	Alright.
8833000	8835000	Apparently Alan wins.
8835000	8837000	Alright apparently Alan won. Alright
8837000	8839000	looking at the scoreboard it is
8839000	8841000	3 to 2 Raven's

8863000	8865000	That's it you have
8865000	8867000	a requisite two
8867000	8869000	double shots. I'm actually
8869000	8871000	under straight orders from my doctor not
8871000	8873000	to drink and I'm being a
8873000	8875000	very naughty boy tonight but
8875000	8877000	what can you do? Should we get out the paddle?
8877000	8879000	No I did a second shot.
8879000	8881000	Laughter.
8881000	8883000	Alright and they're double shots but
8883000	8885000	hey who cares.

8893000	8895000	Megachan what do we give
8895000	8897000	Megachan for winning tonight? My love.
8897000	8899000	Megachan if you have
8899000	8901000	something you want to plug I have a feeling I know
8901000	8903000	what it might be but send me a private message
8903000	8905000	and you can get a free plug for your Twitter
8905000	8907000	for your podcast whatever you want.
8907000	8909000	But not a butt plug. No definitely
8909000	8911000	not that. Alright
8911000	8913000	let's see moving on it's
8913000	8915000	time for the mailbag. Ah crap.
8915000	8917000	Dark soccer is always
8917000	8919000	excited to get into the mailbag and read some emails
8919000	8921000	that you guys send to mailbag
8921000	8923000	at orange lounge radio
8923000	8925000	dot com. So dark
8925000	8927000	soccer if you wouldn't mind jumping
8927000	8929000	to the emailbag there. We did get a lot
8929000	8931000	of spam like that arrived after
8931000	8933000	the real email. Oh hooray. I deleted
8933000	8935000	well I didn't delete it but we need to delete
8935000	8937000	a lot of old email.
8937000	8939000	Are we ready? Shall I do this?
8939000	8941000	Yep yep. Hey O-L-R
8941000	8943000	just thought I'd write in and respond
8943000	8945000	to that email about the graphic violence
8945000	8947000	of Bioshock Infinite. Ooh.
8947000	8949000	Not spoiling any major
8949000	8951000	plot points here but Booker's history
8951000	8953000	is full of violence. It's actually a
8953000	8955000	major part of his character that he has done many
8955000	8957000	terrible things in the past and has
8957000	8959000	a very violent history.
8959000	8961000	Whenever you perform one of those brutal finishing
8961000	8963000	moves with your sky hook Elizabeth will always
8963000	8965000	audibly shudder at the act.
8965000	8967000	As you get deeper in the game Elizabeth
8967000	8969000	questions the need for so much violence from both
8969000	8971000	sides of the conflict and wonders if it's really
8971000	8973000	helping anybody. And that way
8973000	8975000	I think it's the approach to graphic violence is
8975000	8977000	done in a way that serves the story and the
8977000	8979000	characters. Now there is
8979000	8981000	some gratuitous stuff in there but I'm a little tired
8981000	8983000	of the comparisons to Call of Duty or
8983000	8985000	that these were changes that made to
8985000	8987000	these were changes
8987000	8989000	these changes were made to appeal to that
8989000	8991000	audience. I played a couple of
8991000	8993000	Call of Duty games and the violence
8993000	8995000	though not the plot always seemed to ride
8995000	8997000	closer to the side of realistic and not hyper
8997000	8999000	real as it is in the Bioshock games
8999000	9001000	including Infinite where you can electrocute someone
9001000	9003000	to stun them then blast their entire head off.
9003000	9005000	Dude I need to play that.
9005000	9007000	You can do that in Bioshock Infinite
9007000	9009000	As we saw in Bioshock Infinite
9009000	9011000	Yes, it's awesome.
9011000	9013000	In the Call of Duty games
9013000	9015000	we rest our case
9015000	9017000	In the Call of Duty games I played I don't remember
9017000	9019000	any heads popping off like quarks
9019000	9021000	but I did only play single player mode so
9021000	9023000	who knows. My point is Bioshock
9023000	9025000	games have always been violent
9025000	9027000	and they've always been first person shooters
9027000	9029000	so I don't think the game had to compromise
9029000	9031000	anything for sales or to appeal to a certain crowd
9031000	9033000	and in fact would only have been
9033000	9035000	compromising if it toned itself down.
9035000	9037000	That was all that was on my mind
9037000	9039000	congrats on an amazing 500
9039000	9041000	episodes even if you
9041000	9043000	guys don't think it's such a big deal anymore
9043000	9045000	it actually really
9045000	9047000	is. I'm just glad I've
9047000	9049000	been listening for the last 200 or so
9049000	9051000	that's from Flaco Jones.
9051000	9053000	We don't care if you've been listening since episode 1
9053000	9055000	or if this is your very first episode
9055000	9057000	we say welcome aboard and thanks for being a part of the
9057000	9059000	family. Yeah, you're totally awesome.
9059000	9061000	So
9061000	9063000	moving on
9063000	9065000	Hi guys!
9065000	9067000	First and foremost congratulations on your
9067000	9069000	500th episode. I think it's
9069000	9071000	amazing that you've been going for over
9071000	9073000	10 years. You have an unshakable love
9073000	9075000	of video games and a cast iron army
9075000	9077000	of dedicated fans
9077000	9079000	to...dude you guys made a cast iron? I didn't know that.
9079000	9081000	Okay.
9081000	9083000	So here's something.
9083000	9085000	I think he's frying you.
9085000	9087000	Will you fry us an egg?
9087000	9089000	I bet you get really hot on
9089000	9091000	warm days. So here's something
9091000	9093000	that may interest you. Do you remember me talking
9093000	9095000	about Project Possum a while
9095000	9097000	ago? When the Inside
9097000	9099000	Xbox UK team were given the
9099000	9101000	sack, they went off on Kickstarter
9101000	9103000	to start their own show about video games.
9103000	9105000	Well, they finished the pilot and that's not what you
9105000	9107000	call your average video game show.
9107000	9109000	It's called Thank You For Playing
9109000	9111000	and you can find it at ThankYouForPlaying.com
9111000	9113000	there are dashes in between each word.
9113000	9115000	It's structured much like a game
9115000	9117000	letting you view the features in order
9117000	9119000	that you want and has unlockables in the form of extra
9119000	9121000	goodies and editorials, expanding
9121000	9123000	on the themes touched in the videos.
9123000	9125000	The plot's all about multiplayer
9125000	9127000	and I really recommend you take a look.
9127000	9129000	I thought it was really interesting and
9129000	9131000	hope to see a lot more from them soon.
9131000	9133000	Just like I hope to keep hearing from you guys
9133000	9135000	for many years to come, take care and once again
9135000	9137000	congratulations, Picaruno.
9137000	9139000	Thank you
9139000	9141000	for your support.
9141000	9143000	And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an
9143000	9145000	athletic supporter.
9145000	9147000	I'm sorry, this is my favorite line from Greece.
9147000	9149000	Okay, this is an OLR PSA
9149000	9151000	from CatastrophicMoggie.
9151000	9153000	Oh, it's my friend Moggie who I chat with
9153000	9155000	every day on Steam. Come on guys,
9155000	9157000	I think after 500 episodes we can give the whole
9157000	9159000	Loki in a tingle costume thing a rest.
9159000	9161000	He might like that.
9161000	9163000	Instead for the next
9163000	9165000	500 we need to get Loki
9165000	9167000	in a kitty costume.
9167000	9169000	A kitty costume?
9169000	9171000	And you have to say
9171000	9173000	meow, that's right.
9173000	9175000	It has to be a kitty in costume.
9175000	9177000	I don't think he'd do that.
9177000	9179000	That's worse than tingle.
9179000	9181000	He sent an image to you but it didn't embed.
9181000	9183000	P.S. I would have
9183000	9185000	left an audio message but Rob is a meanie.
9185000	9187000	Even if I stayed up late enough
9187000	9189000	I wouldn't be able to Skype after the disaster
9189000	9191000	that was last time. So I guess you don't
9191000	9193000	get any congratulations from Moggie.
9195000	9197000	Send an MP3.
9197000	9199000	Send an MP3.
9199000	9201000	Dude, you talked to me on Steam.
9201000	9203000	Just attach me a file or something.
9205000	9207000	Excuse me.
9207000	9209000	Is that it or is there more?
9209000	9211000	No, there's one more.
9211000	9213000	I had an oddly mimosa red velvet brownie flavored burp.
9213000	9215000	Imagine that.
9215000	9217000	Imagine that.
9217000	9219000	Alright, here's the last one.
9219000	9221000	Hello is the one and only
9221000	9223000	often imitated, never duplicated DDR dollar bill.
9223000	9225000	I just wanted to write and congratulate you guys
9225000	9227000	on your 500th episode.
9227000	9229000	To the last 500 episodes is something truly
9229000	9231000	of an accomplishment. Not just for the fact
9231000	9233000	that most podcasts end in a few years
9233000	9235000	but that the show keeps the same
9235000	9237000	basic formula without getting stale.
9237000	9239000	That you also survived in a market where some
9239000	9241000	have turned to sponsors and subscription fees
9241000	9243000	to even make a presence
9243000	9245000	is even more of a reason to celebrate.
9245000	9247000	Well, thank you.
9247000	9249000	I'm all broke.
9249000	9251000	Not everyone can podcast.
9251000	9253000	True, we all wish to be heard but it takes something
9253000	9255000	special to keep going for a long time
9255000	9257000	and not just make it into a small hobby that you grow
9257000	9259000	out of. It's a labor of love, one that
9259000	9261000	the O.L. Army slash family
9261000	9263000	have grown to be a part of, whether they
9263000	9265000	hang around, come back once in a while
9265000	9267000	when they can, or just move on.
9267000	9269000	If I could, I'd just like to take a moment
9269000	9271000	to say why I do recommend your show to other listeners.
9271000	9273000	One, the host.
9273000	9275000	Why, thank you. Every show you have
9275000	9277000	three amazing, entertaining, intelligent, yet human
9277000	9279000	hosts who talk about gaming
9279000	9281000	that can appeal to the hardcore fans as well as
9281000	9283000	the casuals. Just to let you know I'm really from another planet
9283000	9285000	once a month.
9285000	9287000	They are
9287000	9289000	people who actually do game as part of
9289000	9291000	their lives, not game because it's their
9291000	9293000	job to. We talk about gaming like
9293000	9295000	fans who talk about sports or comics or
9295000	9297000	sci-fi with that casual yet knowledgeable
9297000	9299000	flair. And when they speak about
9299000	9301000	gaming news, they do it on a dual level of
9301000	9303000	professionalism that gives a great analysis
9303000	9305000	and yet keeps it simple and fun.
9305000	9307000	Can I say something really
9307000	9309000	quick about the sponsor thing? Because we have
9309000	9311000	a lot of friend podcasters that do
9311000	9313000	the sponsor thing and we've even, you know,
9313000	9315000	we have had donations before in the past
9315000	9317000	and so forth and I just want to say, like, there's
9317000	9319000	nothing wrong with podcasters who want to get
9319000	9321000	sponsors because, contrary to popular belief,
9321000	9323000	this shit ain't free for us to do.
9323000	9325000	True. It is costing us money
9325000	9327000	to do, but that's, you know, it's okay.
9327000	9329000	We pay the money because
9329000	9331000	it's our hobby. It's like, you know,
9331000	9333000	it's like the tax you pay to
9333000	9335000	your club, you know,
9335000	9337000	your dues or whatever.
9337000	9339000	For us, that's fine.
9339000	9341000	And, you know, I have no problem with people that
9341000	9343000	want to get sponsors to offset the cost of
9343000	9345000	hosting, offset the cost of, you know,
9345000	9347000	producing the show
9347000	9349000	and so forth. But I do start to
9349000	9351000	get into a problem when, you know,
9351000	9353000	and I can think of particular
9353000	9355000	individual podcast things that have
9355000	9357000	gone up saying, we need
9357000	9359000	$30,000 to do this
9359000	9361000	podcast, this one
9361000	9363000	podcast because we're going to rent a studio
9363000	9365000	and we have to travel to conventions
9365000	9367000	and this and this and this. And
9367000	9369000	I'm sorry, but like,
9369000	9371000	you know, if they can get it and the listeners
9371000	9373000	support them enough, that's
9373000	9375000	great, I guess. But I'm
9375000	9377000	just kind of like, you ain't fooling
9377000	9379000	anybody. I could tell you how much it costs to
9379000	9381000	do a podcast and it's not as much as
9381000	9383000	you're telling people it is.
9383000	9385000	I mean, we've had
9385000	9387000	generous donations in the past. I mean,
9387000	9389000	like what Kristen did.
9389000	9391000	I mean, we would not have
9391000	9393000	new equipment if not for her.
9393000	9395000	But I just want to be clear because I have very
9395000	9397000	several peer podcasters that do
9397000	9399000	raise money through sponsors
9399000	9401000	and so forth.
9401000	9403000	We've got the ads on the site. We have been super
9403000	9405000	effing lucky that our website
9405000	9407000	has been donated very generously
9407000	9409000	for many years or
9409000	9411000	else we would probably have to turn to that
9411000	9413000	too because that could get very expensive.
9413000	9415000	So, I just, you know,
9415000	9417000	I just want to clear the air and make
9417000	9419000	sure that's understood.
9419000	9421000	So, and I've
9421000	9423000	sat up for, I mean,
9423000	9425000	just on my own hours working on
9425000	9427000	graphics and stuff
9427000	9429000	for, not just for Orange Nails, but
9429000	9431000	for VOG in general, you know.
9431000	9433000	We've all put a lot of time and effort into this.
9433000	9435000	Uh, DDR dollar bill in chat says
9435000	9437000	I think the best way to put it is
9437000	9439000	people don't like to be shilled.
9439000	9441000	And I agree with that. And I would not do that to
9441000	9443000	the audience. You guys are far too intelligent for me
9443000	9445000	to sit here and say, please send me to all these
9445000	9447000	exotic places so I can
9447000	9449000	talk about them with you. You know,
9449000	9451000	like, I'm not, I'm not
9451000	9453000	going to do that. You guys are... And we're not doing ads for the
9453000	9455000	man-grate. Yeah.
9455000	9457000	I'm sorry, I have, you know,
9457000	9459000	my overwhelming love
9459000	9461000	for, uh, Greg Proops.
9461000	9463000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do laugh every time he does
9463000	9465000	the ad for the man-grate. Anyhow, I apologize to interrupt
9465000	9467000	the email. Okay. To the show.
9467000	9469000	This show, while keeping the basic format,
9469000	9471000	always finds a way to grow and yet
9471000	9473000	never loses its focus. Yes, they go off on
9473000	9475000	tangents and just Pinkberry trips to Disneyland.
9475000	9477000	Let's go get Pinkberry. Okay. Trips to Disneyland
9477000	9479000	and other aspects of their
9479000	9481000	daily lives. But I find that to be the greatest
9481000	9483000	asset because you, the listener, participate in
9483000	9485000	the show in any fashion. It's so laid back
9485000	9487000	and friendly that you do not feel they are
9487000	9489000	corporate shills. If you are right
9489000	9491000	or wrong, you can discuss this openly.
9491000	9493000	And even when it gets heated, it's still
9493000	9495000	more personal than some shows where the sense
9495000	9497000	of keeping it professional loses that intimacy
9497000	9499000	that's required for some difficult and passionate
9499000	9501000	topics. Also,
9501000	9503000	each segment does include something for the listener,
9503000	9505000	whether it's mailbag to submit your letters,
9505000	9507000	and I actually do enjoy reading the email.
9507000	9509000	I'll just throw on a hissy fit
9509000	9511000	just for fun. Um, Skyplines
9511000	9513000	to call in even when
9513000	9515000	even if just wish
9515000	9517000	to get on and say, what's up?
9517000	9519000	The classic game of the week, my favorite part,
9519000	9521000	why, thank you. We used to do the
9521000	9523000	website of the week.
9523000	9525000	There was website of the week and the advice,
9525000	9527000	Star Soccer's advice column.
9527000	9529000	I could still give advice.
9529000	9531000	Um, uh,
9531000	9533000	like, uh,
9533000	9535000	I don't know.
9535000	9537000	Pay your hoes or you might get cut.
9537000	9539000	There's
9539000	9541000	Star Soccer's advice.
9541000	9543000	Was it never bet with a Sicilian when death is
9543000	9545000	on the line?
9545000	9547000	Finish the email. Okay.
9547000	9549000	Fugal question of the week.
9549000	9551000	It's always welcoming listener input, which
9551000	9553000	leads into
9553000	9555000	dot, dot, dot, dot, the audience.
9555000	9557000	That was number three. The chatroom is
9557000	9559000	full of people who often come up with amazing
9559000	9561000	nuggets of joy. It's rarely
9561000	9563000	censored, meaning you'd really have to be
9563000	9565000	a dick to have the mighty ban hammer cast upon
9565000	9567000	yourself. But like, um,
9567000	9569000	but like a good wrestling federation,
9569000	9571000	the show wouldn't be much without the loyal fans
9571000	9573000	who have helped keep the
9573000	9575000	energy going. Friendly and
9575000	9577000	often hilarious, they are never ignored
9577000	9579000	by the host. I'm sorry if this
9579000	9581000	went on a bit more, but it was just something to
9581000	9583000	note. Here's to another 500 episodes.
9583000	9585000	I wonder how the future of gaming would look in another
9585000	9587000	11 years. Tune in and find out. Wink.
9587000	9589000	Oh, that was
9589000	9591000	sweet. That was a very nice email. I'm gonna do
9591000	9593000	a quick sweep. That
9593000	9595000	was it. I agree. The audience is
9595000	9597000	the best part.
9597000	9599000	We love you guys. For dinner.
9599000	9601000	Speaking of which.
9601000	9603000	No, seriously. And Black Wolf and chat
9603000	9605000	actually follows up with
9605000	9607000	that. I don't think we have anybody banned.
9607000	9609000	I don't think we've
9609000	9611000	had to ban anybody yet.
9611000	9613000	That's not a request or
9613000	9615000	a contest. No, no. Don't challenge
9615000	9617000	this. Bammers.
9617000	9619000	I've kicked people out of chat
9619000	9621000	for being dicks. Well, but we haven't
9621000	9623000	banned anybody. Most people
9623000	9625000	learn their lesson. Yeah.
9625000	9627000	I've smacked a few people around with a giant trout.
9627000	9629000	Anyhow. Speaking
9629000	9631000	of audience. Mako Chan has
9631000	9633000	her plug ready to go that
9633000	9635000	she won for Match Game. Do I even
9635000	9637000	have to mention this? I somehow knew it would
9637000	9639000	be this. Anime Jam session
9639000	9641000	on Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
9641000	9643000	9.30 PM Eastern is when the pre-show
9643000	9645000	starts at 9.15.
9645000	9647000	Excuse me, it's the pre-show at 9.15. 9.30 is the
9647000	9649000	show. Mako Chan gets to
9649000	9651000	choose the pre-show music this week. Oh
9651000	9653000	shit. And happy 500th.
9653000	9655000	Yes, listen to Anime Jam session. It's a good time.
9655000	9657000	Totally a good time.
9657000	9659000	So, alrighty.
9659000	9661000	Let's see.
9661000	9663000	Is that it for emails?
9663000	9665000	We're done, huh? You want to know something? I've actually
9665000	9667000	started getting back into
9667000	9669000	watching some old school series now. Oh yeah?
9669000	9671000	Because Dan's little brother
9671000	9673000	Mason, who is a teenager.
9673000	9675000	He was posting on Facebook
9675000	9677000	Oh, teenagers.
9677000	9679000	I'm bored and I don't know any
9679000	9681000	I was like, go back and watch some classic anime, dude.
9681000	9683000	Get to the roots of it.
9683000	9685000	You know, go watch some Yamato
9685000	9687000	or some Gachamon.
9687000	9689000	Alright. Go 80s style and watch
9689000	9691000	Bubblegum Crisis.
9691000	9693000	Let's do the FUs of the Week.
9693000	9695000	And Minecraft Server.
9695000	9697000	FUs of the Week time.
9705000	9707000	Here is punishment.
9707000	9709000	Here.
9709000	9711000	This is fucked up.
9711000	9713000	Yeah, we did
9713000	9715000	ban the song on the show.
9715000	9717000	And we banned a website. We banned
9717000	9719000	Politary. DarkSakura, your FU, please.
9719000	9721000	My FU goes to
9721000	9723000	the hoe bag who was driving behind me
9723000	9725000	in the Mercedes, trying to do her
9725000	9727000	makeup while tailgating me.
9727000	9729000	It would have been incredibly
9729000	9731000	hilarious if I had brake checked you
9731000	9733000	and you completely ruined the back end of my car
9733000	9735000	so that I get a new car and
9735000	9737000	you have to pay for it. Just saying.
9737000	9739000	Don't do your makeup while you drive
9739000	9741000	and get off your damn phone and pull up your pants.
9743000	9745000	Loki, any FUs? Get off my lawn.
9745000	9747000	I guess an FU to the driver that I encountered
9747000	9749000	last week when I was leaving the show
9749000	9751000	about to enter onto the freeway
9751000	9753000	when I had a guy pass
9753000	9755000	me on the right in the
9755000	9757000	in the meat, like actually off the
9757000	9759000	road, pass me on the right and then
9759000	9761000	cut across into the next lane
9761000	9763000	to not go on the
9763000	9765000	freeway. I don't even know why he was doing that.
9765000	9767000	It's just stupid. He could have just gone to the
9767000	9769000	left and changed lanes.
9769000	9771000	But no, he had to pass me at the same time too.
9771000	9773000	For no reason.
9773000	9775000	And then, what else? Oh.
9775000	9777000	And to my co-workers for not wanting to play
9777000	9779000	games during lunch because they're, you know,
9779000	9781000	they will flake on me unless
9781000	9783000	we get all four people to play, including
9783000	9785000	myself. And a lot of times we can't do
9785000	9787000	that because, you know, my boss will be
9787000	9789000	gone or something and they don't
9789000	9791000	want to play games with just me because I kick their ass.
9791000	9793000	So they need to...
9793000	9795000	But you're so humble about it. So FU'd at being good?
9795000	9797000	Yeah, I'm just too good
9797000	9799000	for them, unfortunately.
9799000	9801000	Um, my FU of the week
9801000	9803000	goes to car repairs
9803000	9805000	and the bills that go with them.
9805000	9807000	Oh my god, robbery!
9807000	9809000	So much money!
9809000	9811000	And everything breaks at once!
9811000	9813000	Not okay.
9813000	9815000	We all gave FU to traffic-related things.
9815000	9817000	How appropriate for our 500th episode.
9817000	9819000	We always freaking complain about
9819000	9821000	drivers. The hell.
9821000	9823000	You want to throw out a nephew to cars, too,
9823000	9825000	while you're at it?
9825000	9827000	You can throw out a nephew to Power Rangers.
9827000	9829000	Oh god, yes.
9829000	9831000	Shane might take issue to this.
9831000	9833000	FU to Power Rangers
9833000	9835000	Megaforce, which my son wants to
9835000	9837000	watch constantly and my brains
9837000	9839000	are dribbling at my ears.
9839000	9841000	It is horrifying. The acting
9841000	9843000	makes me want to strangle my own brain.
9843000	9845000	By the way, Megaforce is
9845000	9847000	playing a brand new 3DS game
9847000	9849000	coming this year.
9849000	9851000	Aw, Shane will be offended by that
9851000	9853000	and that makes me happy.
9853000	9855000	I do still want to watch the
9855000	9857000	Japanese version because I do like the Sentai series.
9857000	9861000	Shane and Chad's like,
9861000	9863000	why FU to Power Rangers?
9863000	9865000	Because she's a mom
9865000	9867000	and little boys watch
9867000	9869000	Power Rangers, Shane, not 30-year-olds.
9869000	9871000	But Shane said that Megaforce is pretty bad.
9871000	9873000	Oh god,
9873000	9875000	I wish I was still a 30-year-old.
9875000	9877000	So if
9877000	9879000	the Power Rangers fan of Chad
9879000	9881000	is saying it's bad,
9881000	9883000	then you are fully justified.
9883000	9885000	All kidding aside,
9885000	9887000	we've got a couple more stories for you guys quickly
9887000	9889000	and then we're going to go to the Skype line
9889000	9891000	at 1-877-GAME-OLR
9891000	9893000	There might be a few of you that want to call in tonight
9893000	9895000	so we'll get to that shortly,
9895000	9897000	but first a couple quick stories.
9897000	9899000	Alright, so Nintendo
9899000	9901000	totally figuring out ways to revitalize the Wii U.
9901000	9903000	Not sure if this is going to be one of those ways,
9903000	9905000	but they have a new patent.
9905000	9907000	A patent that allows them
9907000	9909000	to use the Wii remote
9909000	9911000	to remotely control mobile devices
9911000	9913000	like a robot.
9913000	9915000	That's what they have in the picture.
9915000	9917000	They have a robot with a Wii
9917000	9919000	remote in it.
9919000	9921000	Rob 2.0?
9921000	9923000	Or as the joke I made on Facebook,
9923000	9925000	Rob U?
9925000	9927000	And it will.
9927000	9929000	And it will.
9929000	9931000	What the hell would a Rob 2.0 do?
9931000	9933000	The first Rob was a really
9933000	9935000	niche, stupid thing.
9935000	9937000	It just played Gyromite, right?
9937000	9939000	There was one other. Stack'em?
9939000	9941000	It would run up to people
9941000	9943000	that are playing the Wii games
9943000	9945000	not standing up,
9945000	9947000	because you're supposed to be active,
9947000	9949000	and punch you in the balls.
9949000	9951000	Get off your couch. Boom!
9951000	9953000	I need one of those
9953000	9955000	to motivate me to exercise more.
9955000	9957000	Can I get a Rob U to punch me in the balls
9957000	9959000	when I'm not, you know, exercising?
9959000	9961000	Perhaps.
9961000	9963000	Wouldn't that be awesome?
9963000	9965000	Well, speaking of Nintendo devices,
9965000	9967000	the must-have, most important
9967000	9969000	application on the 3DS has
9969000	9971000	been updated. That's right.
9971000	9973000	SwapNote has a new version
9973000	9975000	that's available now. You can go get that
9975000	9977000	right there in the little eShop.
9977000	9979000	Get the free update, and there's a note
9979000	9981000	that you should have got reminding you of that.
9981000	9983000	I've added some new OLR listeners recently,
9983000	9985000	and I gotta say, it's like a SwapNote resurgence.
9985000	9987000	My little blue light is on almost every day.
9987000	9989000	It's great. Some of the new features.
9989000	9991000	You can now use a
9991000	9993000	different color on each page of a message,
9993000	9995000	so you don't just have to use black anymore.
9995000	9997000	You can do photos
9997000	9999000	and audio while you write.
9999000	10001000	You don't have to import them from the SD card.
10001000	10003000	You can filter notes by who
10003000	10005000	sent them if you want to find a note from somebody.
10005000	10007000	You can delete multiple notes at once.
10007000	10009000	You can
10009000	10011000	see how many replies
10011000	10013000	a note has received, and you can
10013000	10015000	slide the CirclePad left to
10015000	10017000	slow down writing and drawing animations
10017000	10019000	from notes, or use
10019000	10021000	CirclePad right to speed it up.
10021000	10023000	It's like a speed up, slow down.
10023000	10025000	Very cool.
10025000	10027000	Basically trying to modernize SwapNote
10027000	10029000	a little bit with some functionality
10029000	10031000	that you kind of go, wow, that wasn't there before.
10031000	10033000	Nope.
10033000	10035000	But it's there now.
10035000	10037000	All right. That brings us to the Skype line.
10037000	10039000	1877 Game OLR.
10039000	10041000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10041000	10043000	If you want to give us a call on this,
10043000	10045000	our 500th episode to talk about whatever,
10045000	10047000	we will take a few calls until
10047000	10049000	we decide it's time to end the show or the calls stop
10049000	10051000	coming in.
10051000	10053000	Well, there's a whole
10053000	10055000	other plate, huh?
10055000	10057000	Oh, boy. All right. So,
10057000	10059000	we are going to take the calls right now.
10059000	10061000	I'm also going to bring up Twitter topics.
10061000	10063000	I don't know, Loki, if you have any last minute stories over there.
10063000	10065000	Not yet.
10065000	10067000	Power Rangers Megaforce game,
10067000	10069000	that's all I had.
10069000	10071000	Oh, you were trying to incorporate things.
10071000	10073000	All right. Well, lucky for us, we're getting saved
10073000	10075000	with a phone call. So, let's get to it.
10075000	10077000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10077000	10079000	This is CodeMan.
10079000	10081000	CodeMan, what is up?
10081000	10083000	What's up, man?
10083000	10085000	We are loving these posters you made, just so you know.
10085000	10087000	Well, no problem, man.
10087000	10089000	I hope I captured
10089000	10091000	OrangeLoungeRadio as much as I could.
10091000	10093000	Uh, yeah.
10093000	10095000	I have to ask, is the little kitten on the bottom,
10095000	10097000	is that Midna?
10097000	10099000	It could be Midna, or it could be Shirmi.
10099000	10101000	I wanted to kind of
10101000	10103000	go both ways
10103000	10105000	because, you know, Shirmi was a big
10105000	10107000	part of OrangeLoungeRadio, and
10107000	10109000	we all, as all listeners,
10109000	10111000	miss
10111000	10113000	her as much as
10113000	10115000	we can, you know.
10115000	10117000	She was a huge part of
10117000	10119000	OrangeLoungeRadio. And she was huge.
10119000	10121000	It's an every cat.
10121000	10123000	Yeah, it's an every cat.
10123000	10125000	I was going to say, because it looks kind of like Midna.
10125000	10127000	Do you have a JPEG that you can forward me
10127000	10129000	of this? Well, I think Dark Sakura,
10129000	10131000	do we talk about the album art thing?
10131000	10133000	Yeah. Is that going to happen?
10133000	10135000	Awesome!
10135000	10137000	Good, the listeners can know what we're talking about because
10137000	10139000	it's going to be the new album art to the show, and it's fantastic!
10139000	10141000	And I thank you
10141000	10143000	for, I got your message from Dropbox.
10143000	10145000	Thank you, I will be printing out a copy for my wall.
10145000	10147000	Yes, and you can, um,
10147000	10149000	you can actually, if, if, uh,
10149000	10151000	Loki wants a JPEG,
10151000	10153000	you can probably just, uh, you know, switch
10153000	10155000	that over to a JPEG and then just send it to him.
10155000	10157000	Or whatever, it doesn't matter. Is it, like, just the full 300
10157000	10159000	DPI PSD?
10159000	10161000	Yeah, it's, well, no, it's a PDF.
10161000	10163000	It's 18 by 24.
10163000	10165000	You can open it up in Illustrator,
10165000	10167000	because I did it all in Illustrator.
10167000	10169000	Um, and you should be able to just
10169000	10171000	export it as a JPEG.
10171000	10173000	Alright, you nerds,
10173000	10175000	I want to talk about video games.
10175000	10177000	I'm actually going to resize it for the frame I have.
10177000	10179000	Alright. Well, Codeman,
10179000	10181000	uh, what did you, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?
10181000	10183000	I wanted to just call in and
10183000	10185000	congratulate you guys on 500 shows,
10185000	10187000	basically. I, I, I
10187000	10189000	started listening, um, kind of
10189000	10191000	at the end of my high school,
10191000	10193000	uh, my senior year of high school,
10193000	10195000	all the way through college, up
10195000	10197000	until now. And so that, that
10197000	10199000	Christ, how old are you now?
10199000	10201000	I am 27. I'll be 28 in,
10201000	10203000	uh, September, so. Oh my god!
10203000	10205000	You know, you
10205000	10207000	realize I'm going to be 37 on
10207000	10209000	next Friday, right?
10209000	10211000	I'm just, I'm just, I,
10211000	10213000	you know, and, and like I said in the chat room
10213000	10215000	earlier, um, I said if this show ever dies,
10215000	10217000	a piece of my heart will die.
10217000	10219000	Because this show has
10219000	10221000	been like, I think a lot of the listeners has
10221000	10223000	gotten me through a lot of hard times,
10223000	10225000	um, you know, in past,
10225000	10227000	past issues in my life and stuff like that.
10227000	10229000	And just sitting down and like,
10229000	10231000	when I'm at work, and
10231000	10233000	I'm listening to you guys, it just, it brings a
10233000	10235000	positivity to, to my day
10235000	10237000	that I didn't have before. So
10237000	10239000	that, that's one of the reasons why I called it.
10239000	10241000	I just wanted to tell you guys that you have
10241000	10243000	done so many good things
10243000	10245000	to a lot of people that are, that
10245000	10247000	are out there listening to you every,
10247000	10249000	every Sunday or on the podcast
10249000	10251000	feed throughout the week. And,
10251000	10253000	and I know that every time somebody listens
10253000	10255000	to you guys, there is a positive
10255000	10257000	jokingly feeling
10257000	10259000	of like, they're in the same room as you
10259000	10261000	guys and we're just all friends. And that's,
10261000	10263000	and that's amazing. Don't make me cry,
10263000	10265000	Code Man. Don't do it. Don't do it.
10265000	10267000	Well,
10267000	10269000	I have to tell you too
10269000	10271000	that just in the fact that we've been talking
10271000	10273000	over the last month worth of shows,
10273000	10275000	it's really nice to have a colleague
10275000	10277000	who listens to, you know,
10277000	10279000	it's, it's been kind of, it's just been
10279000	10281000	really cool chatting with you and, you know,
10281000	10283000	sort of exchanging, you know, not just
10283000	10285000	the video game stuff, but having
10285000	10287000	the design thing in common too.
10287000	10289000	Well, and, and Code Man, let me say this,
10289000	10291000	and I'm sure it goes for
10291000	10293000	Dark Sakura and Loki as well, because I know
10293000	10295000	we've had, we've all had these very difficult
10295000	10297000	shows. This show has helped
10297000	10299000	us get through a lot of hard times
10299000	10301000	as well. Like, you know, I'll
10301000	10303000	talk about myself since I have the mic right now,
10303000	10305000	but, you know, a few years ago, I had a near
10305000	10307000	death experience and that was very,
10307000	10309000	you know,
10309000	10311000	very humbling in a way. And,
10311000	10313000	and there's a lot of jokes
10313000	10315000	about, I don't want to turn 30. I don't want to turn
10315000	10317000	30, 30. I might as well be dead if I'm gonna be
10317000	10319000	30. Well, I, I almost did die at
10319000	10321000	29. So, to make it to
10321000	10323000	30, now I'm like, being
10323000	10325000	30 is fucking rad.
10325000	10327000	And it really is, like, it's, it's awesome.
10327000	10329000	I was just saying, earlier, when I turned 30, I stopped
10329000	10331000	giving a crap. Exactly. You just kind of
10331000	10333000	learned all that. So, you know, this show
10333000	10335000	helped me through a lot of that
10335000	10337000	as well. You gave me tequila
10337000	10339000	and told me not to think about it.
10341000	10343000	So. Yes, but, no,
10343000	10345000	that's, that's basically what I called in. I mean,
10345000	10347000	as far as video games go, I mean,
10347000	10349000	I've ever, I've been, I'm still
10349000	10351000	struggling through Tomb Raider. I,
10351000	10353000	I don't know, Rob, you've been playing it too,
10353000	10355000	I think, and I, I don't know, I just,
10355000	10357000	I haven't gotten to pick it up again.
10357000	10359000	When are we playing the very average
10359000	10361000	multiplayer that I, I, I, I shouldn't
10361000	10363000	razz it because I haven't tried it yet, but when are we gonna
10363000	10365000	give it a try? Uh, I don't know.
10365000	10367000	Alright. You know, anyway, yeah, I, I,
10367000	10369000	I, you know, and then, and then all, I mean,
10369000	10371000	all kinds of video games out
10371000	10373000	right now that are just, I don't know, just
10373000	10375000	eating me up. And, like I, like I mentioned before,
10375000	10377000	I have a daughter, so I, most of the time, I don't even
10377000	10379000	get to play video games, but, you know, it,
10379000	10381000	it, when I do, I, I try to sit down for,
10381000	10383000	like, just long periods of time
10383000	10385000	and play video games, but, uh,
10385000	10387000	but yes, I'll let you guys go and get another
10387000	10389000	caller in here, but, um, because it is your 500th
10389000	10391000	show, and I'm sure a bunch of people want to call in,
10391000	10393000	but, um, I just want to say
10393000	10395000	congratulations, guys, and I hope you enjoy the,
10395000	10397000	the poster. I, I put so much
10397000	10399000	heart and, and just
10399000	10401000	stuff into it that, because I want you guys
10401000	10403000	to understand how much
10403000	10405000	you guys mean to me, and how
10405000	10407000	much you mean to all of your fans
10407000	10409000	and all of your, your, your
10409000	10411000	listeners that are out there, all around
10411000	10413000	the United States, and I just wanted to kind of
10413000	10415000	put that all in a poster, and I didn't even
10415000	10417000	capture all of it, um, and-
10417000	10419000	Code Man, we talked about the crying thing, don't do it.
10419000	10421000	Hey, you better cry, it's a 500th show, come on, Bob.
10421000	10423000	Maybe
10423000	10425000	when Rob drinks more, he'll cry. I'm gonna make you
10425000	10427000	cry. Oh, Rob, is he,
10427000	10429000	is he an emotional drunk? Because I,
10429000	10431000	because I am. No, I'm just loud. But,
10431000	10433000	um, I, and horny
10433000	10435000	apparently, if these other stories are to be believed.
10435000	10437000	Oh, you can't spin the bottle. Oh, Jesus Christ.
10437000	10439000	It was hilarious. That was, that was
10439000	10441000	by the way, um, Shane reminded me, that's where
10441000	10443000	Dunk came from. Oh, no.
10443000	10445000	Alright, look, uh, Code Man,
10445000	10447000	thank you so much, and I'm, I'm so glad
10447000	10449000	everybody gets to see your talent now in
10449000	10451000	our album art, and the fact that that is
10451000	10453000	listener created, I mean, Jamie
10453000	10455000	did, did great work beforehand for, for
10455000	10457000	a previous era of the show, but, you know,
10457000	10459000	this show really is about the listeners, and,
10459000	10461000	and so that the listeners could contribute to that,
10461000	10463000	and the way you capture that by having
10463000	10465000	everybody's name in there,
10465000	10467000	or, I should say, not everybody, but a good chunk of the people.
10467000	10469000	That was a great touch. That was a great
10469000	10471000	touch. I loved it. So, that was
10471000	10473000	my favorite part. Well, it's, it's, it's, wherever
10473000	10475000	every gamer has a voice. Absolutely.
10475000	10477000	It's not, yeah, it's, it's not only,
10477000	10479000	you know, about the hosts
10479000	10481000	that are on the show, but it's about the people that could
10481000	10483000	participate in the chat room, and, you
10483000	10485000	know, give a voice to the actual
10485000	10487000	podcast itself. So,
10487000	10489000	I want, I want to thank you guys for, for
10489000	10491000	doing so much for everybody, and
10491000	10493000	just thank you. That's all I can say.
10493000	10495000	Thank you. Are you guys still doing the
10495000	10497000	down for maintenance show?
10497000	10499000	We are!
10499000	10501000	Yeah, we, we have taken
10501000	10503000	a couple of weekends off due to
10503000	10505000	just, just really busy,
10505000	10507000	busy lives. I've been doing a lot of graphics
10507000	10509000	for people on YouTube, and I've just been really,
10509000	10511000	really, really busy, so,
10511000	10513000	but other than that, yeah, we're still on,
10513000	10515000	we're on Stitcher now, which is
10515000	10517000	awesome. Nice.
10517000	10519000	And iTunes is kind of
10519000	10521000	fuzzy, because we, we're not
10521000	10523000	running the kind of server that
10523000	10525000	iTunes accepts, so,
10525000	10527000	God, I hate, this is why iTunes is
10527000	10529000	gonna, anyway, rabble, rabble.
10529000	10531000	But, look, look them
10531000	10533000	up at least on Stitcher, right? Down for maintenance.
10533000	10535000	We do have a, we do have a website, though, now.
10535000	10539000	Please. www.thedfmpodcast.com
10539000	10541000	Alright, check it out. It's a great show.
10541000	10543000	You know, probably the most ultimate compliment
10543000	10545000	we get on this show, and I'm not saying this
10545000	10547000	is necessarily true of your show, but
10547000	10549000	I, I get this so much, is that, you know,
10549000	10551000	you guys helped inspire me,
10551000	10553000	you guys showed me that anybody can really do
10553000	10555000	this, and that I can, I can do this, too,
10555000	10557000	and that, that is like the greatest compliment
10557000	10559000	when we see these other shows
10559000	10561000	arise of our listenerships. It's awesome.
10561000	10563000	So. It's one of the reasons why we did it.
10563000	10565000	Thank you so much. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go
10565000	10567000	so we can get more calls. Alright, man, well,
10567000	10569000	you guys enjoy five rounds of the show, and I'm
10569000	10571000	gonna go to bed, cause I'm sleepy.
10571000	10573000	Good night. Good night. Bye-bye.
10573000	10575000	Alright, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.
10575000	10577000	Code man. Great call. Thank you.
10577000	10579000	Even if you're gonna make me cry. Alright, listen.
10579000	10581000	I was feeling a little sniffly. The phone is
10581000	10583000	ringing off the hook, so let's get to another call.
10583000	10585000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10585000	10587000	Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
10587000	10589000	Are you muted?
10589000	10591000	I see you.
10591000	10593000	Hello. One more time.
10593000	10595000	Come in, Tokyo. We don't hear you.
10595000	10597000	Alright.
10597000	10599000	Echo 123 to test your
10599000	10601000	connection, folks. I think he's off
10601000	10603000	at the esthetician.
10603000	10605000	Well, I'll bring up that joke.
10605000	10607000	Well, let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10607000	10609000	Who's this? Hey, this is Brad from
10609000	10611000	Pod Culture. Oh, and we see him.
10611000	10613000	We see him. It's Brad from Pod Culture. What's on
10613000	10615000	your mind, buddy? Oh, just calling
10615000	10617000	to say congratulations on 500,
10617000	10619000	guys. Thank you so much.
10619000	10621000	You're not that far behind.
10621000	10623000	Pod Culture's been going quite a while
10623000	10625000	itself, hasn't it?
10625000	10627000	In our
10627000	10629000	eighth year, I guess. Yeah, that's something.
10629000	10631000	That's something. That's amazing.
10631000	10633000	You and I have the same color microphone I just
10633000	10635000	realized with the little...
10635000	10637000	Gee, I wonder why. I know.
10637000	10639000	You've done a lot to help this show out over the years,
10639000	10641000	Pod Culture, from getting us drunk to
10641000	10643000	getting us heard. And thank you for
10643000	10645000	all of the discs full of Doctor Who
10645000	10647000	you've sent me in the past.
10647000	10649000	Oh, no problem. No problem. I'm glad
10649000	10651000	to do it. But hey,
10651000	10653000	without you guys, you know,
10653000	10655000	I don't think we would have lasted as long as we
10655000	10657000	have, and thanks for the
10657000	10659000	inviting us into the
10659000	10661000	Vogue community. Oh,
10661000	10663000	duh. Happy to have you.
10663000	10665000	We knew when we were starting...
10665000	10667000	We knew we wanted to do something that was not
10667000	10669000	just games, but a celebration of everything
10669000	10671000	geek, and some of our
10671000	10673000	favorite shows came to mind, and absolutely,
10673000	10675000	you were near the top
10675000	10677000	of that list. You were seriously up there.
10677000	10679000	Well, thank you. But
10679000	10681000	congratulations, and I'm gonna let you
10681000	10683000	guys go and get
10683000	10685000	some more calls in, and this one's for you guys.
10685000	10687000	Oh, look at that. Oh, oh, oh! Shot
10687000	10689000	on air! Yeah!
10689000	10691000	That's one of the best video
10691000	10693000	calls we've ever got. See, you took it far better than Rob
10693000	10695000	did, because Rob turned red in the face, and it was
10695000	10697000	awesome. Well, I've had more practice.
10699000	10701000	It's become a regular thing on the show.
10701000	10703000	All right. Pod Cultures, Monday nights
10703000	10705000	here at the Voice Geeks Network, continuing
10705000	10707000	a celebration of the various
10707000	10709000	Doctors on Tardis Interruptus tomorrow.
10709000	10711000	Fourth Doctor, right? Yes, sir.
10711000	10713000	All right. Fourth Doctor was my Doctor.
10713000	10715000	There you go. He was
10715000	10717000	pretty well known.
10717000	10719000	Good night, guys. All right, take care, buddy.
10719000	10721000	All right, always a pleasure to
10721000	10723000	hear from Brad, from another great
10723000	10725000	podcast. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's
10725000	10727000	this? It's
10727000	10729000	me, Mario.
10729000	10731000	Hi, Mario.
10731000	10733000	Hey. What's on your mind? Is this really
10733000	10735000	Extrofer? What?
10735000	10737000	Yeah, it's me.
10737000	10739000	What's
10739000	10741000	on your mind, Extrofer?
10741000	10743000	What is on my mind? I don't
10743000	10745000	know. I was just calling. Hair.
10745000	10747000	You just wanted to see what's up?
10747000	10749000	Yeah, I wanted to see
10749000	10751000	what's up in his house.
10751000	10753000	Well, we're doing this
10753000	10755000	aussism
10755000	10757000	multiple sclerosis walk
10757000	10759000	one week from today, and everybody should
10759000	10761000	donate at Hoardhouse.com through the
10761000	10763000	link, right? Yeah, totally.
10763000	10765000	There you go. Thumbs up for
10765000	10767000	multiple sclerosis
10767000	10769000	box. We broke a thousand
10769000	10771000	dollars today. That's awesome. We did break
10771000	10773000	it. We broke it.
10773000	10775000	We took it out.
10775000	10777000	We did take it out.
10777000	10779000	And I'm very happy about that.
10779000	10781000	What video games have you been playing
10781000	10783000	lately, Extrofer?
10783000	10785000	You know, Jetpack Joyride
10785000	10787000	and
10787000	10789000	I don't know, nothing else.
10789000	10791000	I'm boring.
10791000	10793000	You should know this already.
10793000	10795000	Well, what did you call to say
10795000	10797000	tonight? Did you want to wish us well on our
10797000	10799000	500th episode?
10799000	10801000	Um, no. I just thought I'd call
10801000	10803000	and say hi.
10803000	10805000	Oh, well, okay. Hey.
10805000	10807000	Hey.
10807000	10809000	Hey. Got any plans tomorrow?
10809000	10811000	Want to hang? You know what?
10811000	10813000	You still need to come over and finish watching Firefly with
10813000	10815000	me after five years of us not
10815000	10817000	watching Firefly. Who's getting called out?
10817000	10819000	Yeah, you know, I'll check my calendar
10819000	10821000	and stuff
10821000	10823000	for that and get back
10823000	10825000	to you. Well, let's see. My
10825000	10827000	week is not working, not working, not working,
10827000	10829000	not working, not working birthday. You can come.
10829000	10831000	Oh, let me check my calendar.
10831000	10833000	I'm not working, not working,
10833000	10835000	not working, not working.
10835000	10837000	And then birthday.
10837000	10839000	I guess we have the same calendar.
10839000	10841000	Awesome. Amazing.
10841000	10843000	Uh,
10843000	10845000	Extrofer, do you want to plug Horde House?
10845000	10847000	I will
10847000	10849000	plug Horde House up the asshole
10849000	10851000	for you.
10851000	10853000	Is it bleached?
10853000	10855000	Yes, it's a bleached, nicely bleached,
10855000	10857000	freshly bleached asshole
10857000	10859000	that Horde House has. Let me, let me
10859000	10861000	ask you this, Extrofer, since, uh,
10861000	10863000	you know, we have a lot of old school listeners that are
10863000	10865000	revisiting us tonight and so forth.
10865000	10867000	You know, for a while, you and I were roommates
10867000	10869000	and OLR Studios was at
10869000	10871000	your house. So what would
10871000	10873000	the listeners be most surprised
10873000	10875000	to know about Orange Lounge Radio behind
10875000	10877000	the scenes? What do you think? What do you think
10877000	10879000	the OLR listeners
10879000	10881000	would be most surprised to know behind the scenes?
10881000	10883000	Well, our studio
10883000	10885000	in our apartment was freaking
10885000	10887000	filthy.
10887000	10889000	And, um,
10889000	10891000	and, uh,
10891000	10893000	Rob falls asleep in random
10893000	10895000	places. It's totally
10895000	10897000	true. It's not just when he's drunk.
10897000	10899000	That is totally hilarious, too.
10899000	10901000	What's the most- Like, I would come
10901000	10903000	home and he'd be like asleep on the floor
10903000	10905000	and be like, oh, I'm glad I didn't trip
10905000	10907000	over you. I didn't see you down there.
10907000	10909000	I
10909000	10911000	remember coming over to that apartment
10911000	10913000	and being absolutely thrilled that you were
10913000	10915000	totally into Devil's Crush.
10915000	10917000	Oh, yeah. I love
10917000	10919000	Devil's Crush. Although, the,
10919000	10921000	um,
10921000	10923000	actually, it was- Alien Crush.
10923000	10925000	Yeah, Alien's Crush, or
10925000	10927000	whatever. My favorite Extrofer
10927000	10929000	memory was when you stood out on the line to get
10929000	10931000	me the Wii.
10931000	10933000	I know, right? And
10933000	10935000	how many times did you play that
10935000	10937000	thing?
10937000	10939000	Every day is what I want to say.
10939000	10941000	Every day. I was a huge Wii fan.
10941000	10943000	Yeah, you were a total Wii
10943000	10945000	fan. You were like- It was like
10945000	10947000	five years after it launched and you were like
10947000	10949000	Wii!
10949000	10951000	Like, every single chance you would
10951000	10953000	get, you would say that. It was kind of weird and
10953000	10955000	depressing. It was a little awkward.
10955000	10957000	Alright, well, Extrofer, before we let you go, is there
10957000	10959000	any other final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10959000	10961000	Um,
10961000	10963000	well, I gotta go wash my hands
10963000	10965000	because I did some dirty work before
10965000	10967000	you guys
10967000	10969000	gave me a call. In fact,
10969000	10971000	when you called me earlier, I didn't
10971000	10973000	say anything because
10973000	10975000	I had just came and
10975000	10977000	you didn't want to hear what
10977000	10979000	my voice sounds like right after that.
10979000	10981000	Were you- I think you just better
10981000	10983000	go wash your hands. Were you touching yourself to the
10983000	10985000	show? That's a little awkward. If you're, like, jerking
10985000	10987000	it to my voice- No! I took a shit on my
10987000	10989000	chair and I was cleaning- What did you think
10989000	10991000	I was doing? Never
10991000	10993000	change, please. Dirty work, okay? Never change.
10993000	10995000	Extrofer, I'm letting you go now.
10995000	10997000	Aww, thank you.
10997000	10999000	Alright, bye!
10999000	11001000	Are we holding him for any reason?
11001000	11003000	What the
11003000	11005000	fuck?
11005000	11007000	Like, seriously!
11007000	11009000	I totally miss Extrofer
11009000	11011000	and the utter randomness.
11013000	11015000	Ah, lordy. Hi, you're-
11015000	11017000	Yes! Oh my god, we-
11017000	11019000	School bus reference in the chatroom.
11019000	11021000	Hi, here on Orange Nails Radio,
11021000	11023000	who's this?
11023000	11025000	Oh my god, it's Slidekick. Hey,
11025000	11027000	girl. Hey, I'm the guy.
11027000	11029000	Hey, girl, what's up? Sorry, Rob.
11029000	11031000	Sorry, Rob, you're not one of- you're not the guy.
11031000	11033000	You're one of the girls. Whatever.
11033000	11035000	What's up, Slidekick?
11035000	11037000	Hey, I just wanted to congratulate
11037000	11039000	you, like, everyone else. Like, I know
11039000	11041000	it's totally not original. And, like,
11041000	11043000	how do I follow up?
11043000	11045000	You know, that call that Extrofer just made,
11045000	11047000	you know, I can't really-
11047000	11049000	I am not touching myself, but
11049000	11051000	I just wanted to congratulate all
11051000	11053000	of you on your great achievement.
11053000	11055000	And, yeah, that's amazing.
11055000	11057000	500, like, I
11057000	11059000	can't believe that. Well, thank you, baby. I appreciate it.
11059000	11061000	I feel so nervous. Like, I'm on the radio.
11061000	11063000	Like, I'm kind of famous now.
11063000	11065000	It's just me. You know me.
11065000	11067000	You've met me. I'm not that scary.
11067000	11069000	We're not that scary, right?
11069000	11071000	You're a little
11071000	11073000	scary.
11073000	11075000	Well,
11075000	11077000	shoot, Slidekick, do you want to talk any games
11077000	11079000	with us? What games have you been playing lately?
11079000	11081000	I'm actually
11081000	11083000	playing Fire Emblem Awakening.
11083000	11085000	Yeah? How's that?
11085000	11087000	And I kind of suck at it, but
11087000	11089000	it's cool. I like it a lot.
11089000	11091000	I've never really played a lot of
11091000	11093000	tactical strategy
11093000	11095000	RPGs, so it's cool.
11095000	11097000	I like it. There's a lot
11097000	11099000	of people that are really into Fire Emblem
11099000	11101000	on the 3DS, so I can't really
11101000	11103000	blame you for being a fan of that.
11103000	11105000	For sure.
11105000	11107000	So, Slidekick,
11107000	11109000	you've done a couple of podcasts of your own, too.
11109000	11111000	I know you used to do a podcast with Alan.
11111000	11113000	Not everybody knows about this, but you used to do the
11113000	11115000	Amazing Warcraft podcast,
11115000	11117000	Fabulous Flames, right, Alan?
11117000	11119000	Yes, we did.
11119000	11121000	And I have to say, Alan
11121000	11123000	has been amazing tonight.
11123000	11125000	Yes, he has. I was a big
11125000	11127000	fan of the Miss Nude World 96.
11127000	11129000	I'm always
11129000	11131000	a fan of the Miss
11131000	11133000	Nude World 96.
11133000	11135000	What are you doing these days in podcasting?
11135000	11137000	Do you have anything you want to plug?
11137000	11139000	Yes, and since
11139000	11141000	Exifer took the butt plug joke,
11141000	11143000	I'll just
11143000	11145000	go ahead and shout out to
11145000	11147000	my podcast, which is
11147000	11149000	Game Buoy. We're over at Gamebuoy.org,
11149000	11151000	and we bring you gaming news
11151000	11153000	and views that may be on your radar, but
11153000	11155000	most definitely should be.
11155000	11157000	And we are definitely inspired and
11157000	11159000	pretty much owe everything about
11159000	11161000	who we are, so thank you
11161000	11163000	for being an inspiration
11163000	11165000	and making
11165000	11167000	a community out there
11167000	11169000	for people to have a voice in gaming
11169000	11171000	because it's super important
11171000	11173000	for not just
11173000	11175000	all the blogs and
11175000	11177000	journalists
11177000	11179000	to be the only ones talking about games.
11179000	11181000	Well, thank you. It means a lot,
11181000	11183000	and your show is
11183000	11185000	very good. I've heard it. And even though in those
11185000	11187000	first few episodes I wanted to kill you over your
11187000	11189000	sound quality, you guys have improved so
11189000	11191000	much. You sound great now.
11191000	11193000	It was actually better than it was on the previous
11193000	11195000	one.
11195000	11197000	I do miss Fabulous Flames, just saying.
11197000	11199000	You sound great now, and
11199000	11201000	your content is very good and
11201000	11203000	well-researched, and you and Spike
11203000	11205000	are great. And what I love most about your
11205000	11207000	show is that you always pay it forward at the end,
11207000	11209000	and you do give shout-outs and keep it
11209000	11211000	indie, and I think that's great.
11211000	11213000	And, you know, if we helped
11213000	11215000	inspire that attitude, then that's
11215000	11217000	a huge compliment.
11217000	11219000	We're your biggest fans. We love
11219000	11221000	you so much.
11221000	11223000	I have been begging to come on your show for, like,
11223000	11225000	six months, and look at this.
11225000	11227000	I totally miss planning webcomics
11227000	11229000	with you.
11229000	11231000	I still have
11231000	11233000	the WoW viewer. We can still do it.
11233000	11235000	Yay!
11235000	11237000	Alright, well,
11237000	11239000	Slidekick, I'm gonna let you go so I can get more calls,
11239000	11241000	but anything else real quick before I let you go?
11241000	11243000	Um, no.
11243000	11245000	Except I need to get
11245000	11247000	up there and have an OLR party
11247000	11249000	sometime. You're welcome any time.
11249000	11251000	Get up here on Sunday. You have to come up on Friday.
11251000	11253000	Bring Captain Spike.
11253000	11255000	I will try. I will try.
11255000	11257000	Alright, take care, buddy. Have a good one.
11257000	11259000	Alright, you too.
11259000	11261000	Have a happy 500. Thank you.
11261000	11263000	Alright, 1877
11263000	11265000	game OLR, username on Skype
11265000	11267000	is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call.
11267000	11269000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
11269000	11271000	It's the undertaker of the internet,
11271000	11273000	Ravenstaufen. Wait a minute, weren't you just here?
11273000	11275000	I was, but give me
11275000	11277000	two minutes, Rob. Alright. I hope your
11277000	11279000	Paul Bearer didn't die. Alright, time
11279000	11281000	starts now.
11281000	11283000	Alright, so I want to
11283000	11285000	congratulate OrangeLoungeRadio
11285000	11287000	for 500 shows and inspiring me
11287000	11289000	to do my show. I'm not gonna
11289000	11291000	plug it, but I'm just gonna say,
11291000	11293000	Rob, your cast
11293000	11295000	and your people are very
11295000	11297000	diverse, and you kept me entertained
11297000	11299000	for years. I am now 26,
11299000	11301000	and I've been listening since
11301000	11303000	I was in high school as well.
11303000	11305000	Oh my god.
11305000	11307000	Oh my god, we're so old.
11307000	11309000	I can feel myself
11309000	11311000	aging. I've got cancer now.
11311000	11313000	No, it's, it's, it's
11313000	11315000	amazing. It's, that's amazing.
11315000	11317000	It really is amazing. I also really
11317000	11319000	like your voice.
11319000	11321000	Thanks. It's so funny. Your voice
11321000	11323000	is very much mature. I remember when you used to
11323000	11325000	call this show all the time when you were in high school,
11325000	11327000	and the years right after that
11327000	11329000	and so forth, your voice really has matured.
11329000	11331000	Like, I can hear it through
11331000	11333000	undoubtedly your own podcast and
11333000	11335000	so forth. It's, it's, it's
11335000	11337000	pleasant. It came a long way.
11337000	11339000	Everything came a long way, and I have to
11339000	11341000	say, if OrangeLoungeRadio
11341000	11343000	was a lighthouse in the beacon of the dark,
11343000	11345000	you are
11345000	11347000	awesome. Well, I appreciate
11347000	11349000	it so much, Ravenstaufen, and thank you so
11349000	11351000	much for sticking with us for all the years. It's a pleasure, as
11351000	11353000	always, to hear from you. I've, I've, I
11353000	11355000	listen to every archive. I've never
11355000	11357000	leave. It's just sometimes I do my things
11357000	11359000	on Sunday and it makes it hard. I had to cancel
11359000	11361000	my own show for you guys because I had
11361000	11363000	to be here for your special day.
11363000	11365000	Wow, that's, oh my gosh.
11365000	11367000	Wow. What would you have talked
11367000	11369000	about on your show tonight? Maybe we can
11369000	11371000	work a little bit of it into here, a little
11371000	11373000	crossover episode.
11373000	11375000	Well, I was gonna talk about, and you guys
11375000	11377000	didn't do, it was the whole thing about
11377000	11379000	Twitch TV, about that handicapped guy that
11379000	11381000	wasn't handicapped. Yeah, I heard
11381000	11383000	about this. So what, let me see if I can
11383000	11385000	summarize. Let's see. So he was getting donations
11385000	11387000	because he was sick
11387000	11389000	and I guess it was donations for a surgery,
11389000	11391000	right? And, uh, well
11391000	11393000	the cameras weren't stopping on Twitch
11393000	11395000	TV. He didn't turn them off and they caught
11395000	11397000	him getting up out of his wheelchair.
11397000	11399000	Like, just getting up and walking
11399000	11401000	away. So the, the cake was
11401000	11403000	a lie, ladies and gentlemen, but that
11403000	11405000	just goes to show, you gotta be, it's,
11405000	11407000	it's sad that we can't just
11407000	11409000	trust people and we can't, but like
11409000	11411000	you, you do have to be skeptical.
11411000	11413000	Like, that's why with the MS Walk stuff, and
11413000	11415000	you know, we've been plugging that a lot. Like, I was very
11415000	11417000	much like, we're gonna take it
11417000	11419000	directly to the MS Walk
11419000	11421000	society, the MS society and you donate
11421000	11423000	right there, directly. We're not, you know,
11423000	11425000	I don't, no funny business people.
11425000	11427000	Yeah, so we were
11427000	11429000	gonna talk about that. I mean, I had problems
11429000	11431000	in the past. I mean, I'm on Social Security
11431000	11433000	right now. I, you know, I
11433000	11435000	had major problems, went to special
11435000	11437000	schools. So for me, for someone that
11437000	11439000	fakes an illness like that, like, you
11439000	11441000	just slapped me in the face. And I'm not trying
11441000	11443000	to get donations for what I'm doing,
11443000	11445000	but it came a long
11445000	11447000	way. It's, it's, you
11447000	11449000	know what, though? That's, Karma
11449000	11451000	will bite you when you do stuff like that. Karma
11451000	11453000	will bite you. And Karma bit that guy
11453000	11455000	big time. Big time. Yeah. So
11455000	11457000	DJ Darknight
11457000	11459000	in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says
11459000	11461000	that's just as bad as the guy that was caught spanking
11461000	11463000	himself on Twitch. That's funny.
11463000	11465000	That's funny.
11465000	11467000	The wheelchair thing is, is bad.
11467000	11469000	That's evil. That's awful. But the
11469000	11471000	But that's the internet, though. Jerking it on Twitch, that's funny.
11471000	11473000	Any live streaming site, you're going
11473000	11475000	to see dick or boobs anyway. Yeah, I was
11475000	11477000	gonna say, or the one dude that had sex with his girlfriend
11477000	11479000	or something like that in the background, or like, he
11479000	11481000	just forgot it was on.
11481000	11483000	Yeah, he forgot it was on. That's why I'm very
11483000	11485000	careful about when I have the, I would not
11485000	11487000	live stream 24-7 just because
11487000	11489000	Extra for, for shame. I know
11489000	11491000	something bad would happen. Alright,
11491000	11493000	Ravenstaufen, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls, but thank you so
11493000	11495000	much for the kind words. I understand. Thank you for taking my call.
11495000	11497000	Bye. No problem. Bye.
11497000	11499000	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype.
11499000	11501000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Why not? We can do a couple
11501000	11503000	more calls, right? We're only at 9-30.
11503000	11505000	We are being
11505000	11507000	horribly rude to our East Coast people.
11507000	11509000	We are. How about one more call?
11509000	11511000	One more call. One more call. Let's see who gets in.
11511000	11513000	1-877-GAME-OLR. I'm
11513000	11515000	totally, wait a minute, I'm totally jealous of all of them
11515000	11517000	who have jobs.
11517000	11519000	No. Keep them up all night.
11519000	11521000	All night. You alright?
11521000	11523000	I was doing my Rhonda Shear
11523000	11525000	impersonation. Hello? I see, I see.
11525000	11527000	Except I'm not wearing, you know, extra padding in the boob region.
11527000	11529000	Alright, let me go to one more call. Hi, you're on
11529000	11531000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
11531000	11533000	Hey, what's up? It's TigerClaw. Hey, TigerClaw.
11533000	11535000	What's on your mind, buddy? Oh,
11535000	11537000	I just want to congratulate you guys
11537000	11539000	on your 500th episode.
11539000	11541000	I guess you guys can go
11541000	11543000	on record, maybe,
11543000	11545000	as being the longest running podcast
11545000	11547000	in history or something like that.
11547000	11549000	We're not the longest running podcast. We are the longest
11549000	11551000	running video game podcast. I don't
11551000	11553000	even know. Well, you guys
11553000	11555000	been around way before
11555000	11557000	podcasting was a thing, so.
11557000	11559000	I'd say live show. That's what gives
11559000	11561000	us a jump on the other people is that we had
11561000	11563000	the live 365 years and so
11563000	11565000	we kind of slid right into the podcasting
11565000	11567000	thing. But I would say
11567000	11569000	I usually say we are the longest
11569000	11571000	running internet show about
11571000	11573000	video games. Weekly internet show about video games.
11573000	11575000	Uh, yeah.
11575000	11577000	But you know what? The internet, the internet
11577000	11579000	TigerClaw, the internet is a big place.
11579000	11581000	Like, uh, I've been putting
11581000	11583000	together this special interest group on Facebook
11583000	11585000	recently, uh, with some friends and I
11585000	11587000	found that there's all these, like, other podcasters
11587000	11589000	I didn't even know were out there. Like, I didn't even know
11589000	11591000	these shows existed and, like, they're celebrating
11591000	11593000	episode 100 and, and, and, like
11593000	11595000	60 and I'm like, what?
11595000	11597000	So, you never know what's out there, which is
11597000	11599000	why I'm very cautious to stake a claim, like,
11599000	11601000	we're the longest running show, bitches.
11601000	11603000	You know, so I, I just,
11603000	11605000	I want to be careful.
11605000	11607000	Yep, and just keep on doing
11607000	11609000	what you're doing and
11609000	11611000	and hopefully people will listen
11611000	11613000	and, um,
11613000	11615000	I don't know what else to say, uh,
11615000	11617000	no matter how old you get
11617000	11619000	just keep on gaming because
11619000	11621000	you'll still feel the same way.
11621000	11623000	Alright, well, TigerClaw,
11623000	11625000	I appreciate your support over
11625000	11627000	the years. It means an awful lot.
11627000	11629000	Uh, no problem.
11629000	11631000	You're welcome. So, better let some other
11631000	11633000	people call in. Alright, we'll see if
11633000	11635000	maybe we'll let one more sneak in since you were short.
11635000	11637000	But have a good one, TigerClaw. Alright, thanks.
11637000	11639000	Alright. Take care. Mm-hmm, you too. Bye-bye.
11639000	11641000	Bye. Well, we can do
11641000	11643000	one more. Let's do one more.
11643000	11645000	One more, come on. Show up. Alright,
11645000	11647000	one more, one more. Especially this one.
11647000	11649000	Alright, hi, oh.
11649000	11651000	Oh my gosh, it's a scary
11651000	11653000	black man on the cam, oh my gosh.
11655000	11657000	No, I'm kidding, you
11657000	11659000	guys, it's DJ Rama S. You are looking
11659000	11661000	sharp in your vlog shirt. You are looking very sharp
11661000	11663000	today, young man. How are you?
11663000	11665000	I'm doing fine. How is everybody in the
11665000	11667000	Sacramento studios? We're,
11667000	11669000	I'm sobering up, sadly.
11669000	11671000	Oh, you should not be sobering up, because
11671000	11673000	I have a problem with that good sir. Uh-oh,
11673000	11675000	what's that? Well,
11675000	11677000	ah. What are you drinking?
11677000	11679000	If you can
11679000	11681000	see what I got here. I
11681000	11683000	love you, and I need to be at your house
11683000	11685000	right now.
11685000	11687000	He's got a bottle of
11687000	11689000	Glenfiddich. This is one of
11689000	11691000	two bottles of Glenfiddich I have.
11691000	11693000	Okay, I'm a BRB going on a plane.
11695000	11697000	Of course, I could just go to Becky's house.
11699000	11701000	Do you see this glass right here? Yes, I do.
11701000	11703000	Oh, wait, hold it, except for once
11703000	11705000	it says something about a Luigi hat. Give me
11705000	11707000	one quick second. Oh, lord.
11707000	11709000	Wait, they can't, they can't, they can't, we're the
11709000	11711000	only ones that can see you.
11711000	11713000	Okay, he's wearing that, well you can, Rob,
11713000	11715000	do you know what print screen is?
11715000	11717000	Oh, uh, yes, I do
11717000	11719000	print screen.
11719000	11721000	You've got Photoshop, right?
11721000	11723000	I'll print screen, we'll just get that window.
11723000	11725000	There we go. Alright, I think I got him, we'll see.
11725000	11727000	Nice.
11727000	11729000	Do I even have PaintShop Pro on this
11729000	11731000	computer or whatever? God, PaintShop Pro.
11731000	11733000	Shut up.
11733000	11735000	PaintShop Pro. I might have
11735000	11737000	MS Paint. You know what, you
11737000	11739000	can paste it in Paint.
11739000	11741000	There you go, you got it. Yes, I got it.
11741000	11743000	Woohoo. Alright, I'll save it as a paint thing
11743000	11745000	and fix that up later. Alright, so anyhow.
11745000	11747000	Bitmap.
11747000	11749000	Where was I? I'm gonna save it
11749000	11751000	with the very clever untitled
11751000	11753000	.bmp. Alright,
11753000	11755000	um, you're looking,
11755000	11757000	Rob, I already took the damn picture.
11757000	11759000	Rob is sadly not on a Mac.
11759000	11761000	I'll continue to wear it to the end of the
11761000	11763000	video broadcast, but as you can see,
11763000	11765000	I am popping this bad boy open
11765000	11767000	that has been in my freezer for the past
11767000	11769000	two weeks. Oh, nice.
11769000	11771000	And, as I
11771000	11773000	pour this, I want to thank each and every
11773000	11775000	single one of you. As everyone
11775000	11777000	said before, if it wasn't for OLR,
11777000	11779000	there wouldn't be no anime jam session.
11779000	11781000	And also,
11781000	11783000	I will not be one of those
11783000	11785000	podcasters that will beg for
11785000	11787000	money to do my show. What me,
11787000	11789000	Marco, and Ari, what we all do,
11789000	11791000	we do it for love, and we pick up
11791000	11793000	all our money and we do it together.
11793000	11795000	I'll do it for dollar
11795000	11797000	bills to show my tatas,
11797000	11799000	but that's it.
11799000	11801000	Someone
11801000	11803000	did send me money one time. For showing
11803000	11805000	your tatas? No. I do
11805000	11807000	that for free.
11807000	11809000	To Dan.
11809000	11811000	She does that for drinks.
11811000	11813000	But no, remember when I had Pump Up the Volume?
11813000	11815000	And Loki put it in my intro
11815000	11817000	to tune in and give me a dollar? Oh yeah,
11817000	11819000	someone actually sent me a dollar. I remember that.
11819000	11821000	It was good times.
11821000	11823000	Rama, thank you so much for the toast,
11823000	11825000	and as I was saying before to some of the other
11825000	11827000	callers, that is really the ultimate
11827000	11829000	compliment to hear that we might
11829000	11831000	have inspired even a portion of somebody
11831000	11833000	else's show. It's outstanding.
11833000	11835000	You need to come back for fun of me.
11835000	11837000	We're just here having a good time.
11837000	11839000	Go on.
11839000	11841000	You cut out. Go ahead, Rama.
11841000	11843000	Well, I was going to say, OLR
11843000	11845000	is not just a podcast. We're like a
11845000	11847000	frickin' family. A giant
11847000	11849000	dysfunctional family.
11849000	11851000	We put the fun
11851000	11853000	in dysfunction. That's right.
11853000	11855000	I will go on record right now.
11855000	11857000	You guys
11857000	11859000	really got me through
11859000	11861000	the passing of my mother when I called that
11861000	11863000	one night and asked for you guys to play
11863000	11865000	Let's Screw.
11865000	11867000	That was one of my favorite songs.
11867000	11869000	You guys played it, and I could not
11869000	11871000	thank y'all enough for doing that.
11871000	11873000	I'm more than happy
11873000	11875000	to do so, especially if it'll help
11875000	11877000	even just the slightest bit
11877000	11879000	in somebody's really shitty day,
11879000	11881000	to put it lightly. I'm
11881000	11883000	happy to.
11883000	11885000	Hearts.
11885000	11887000	Of course. Now to
11887000	11889000	Sky.
11889000	11891000	Loki. Dark
11891000	11893000	Sakura. Here's to you.
11893000	11895000	Here's to me. The best of friends
11895000	11897000	will ever be. If you should ever
11897000	11899000	happen to disagree, well, fuck you
11899000	11901000	and here's to me. Fuck you too,
11901000	11903000	buddy. I hope
11903000	11905000	that puts you on the floor. That is seriously
11905000	11907000	my second favorite toast ever.
11907000	11909000	That's great.
11909000	11911000	And before I go, I did say I have a
11911000	11913000	little treat for you. Okay. I love
11913000	11915000	your hand flailing. That's cute.
11915000	11917000	I thought that was the treat.
11917000	11919000	I just came back from a J-pop concert and I got
11919000	11921000	in for free, okay?
11921000	11923000	Amazing.
11923000	11925000	But I'll have PAX East.
11925000	11927000	I happen to run into a famous
11927000	11929000	Nerdcore rapper, and I asked him to do
11929000	11931000	a favor, and hopefully
11931000	11933000	this will play through.
11933000	11935000	And here we go.
11935000	11937000	This is MC Frontalot, and you are
11937000	11939000	participating with the Voice of Geeks
11939000	11941000	Network.
11941000	11943000	Shut the front
11943000	11945000	door. Oh my god.
11945000	11947000	Oh
11947000	11949000	my god. That's amazing.
11949000	11951000	Wow.
11951000	11953000	Work it.
11953000	11955000	I love you forever.
11955000	11957000	I'm buying you drinks.
11957000	11959000	Alright, that's it. New York. When we going?
11959000	11961000	Right now. Bye, BRB.
11961000	11963000	Head to New York. BRB, New York.
11963000	11965000	Alright, no. You have to pick up
11965000	11967000	Marco as you go, because if you go, take
11967000	11969000	me without her. She's going to kick everybody's
11969000	11971000	ass. BRB is stopping in New Jersey.
11971000	11973000	Alright,
11973000	11975000	Rama, that was
11975000	11977000	amazing. That was awesome.
11977000	11979000	You've been an amazing support over the
11979000	11981000	years, and thank you so much,
11981000	11983000	buddy. You don't even know.
11983000	11985000	No, thank you, because
11985000	11987000	you guys gave me this opportunity to do
11987000	11989000	this, so me running around, finding
11989000	11991000	these opportunities to give you guys
11991000	11993000	bumpers, interviews, this and that.
11993000	11995000	This is more than my way of saying
11995000	11997000	thank you, you know? This is,
11997000	11999000	you know, all I ever wanted
11999000	12001000	was to get my show on, and Rob, you gave
12001000	12003000	me that opportunity, so
12003000	12005000	believe it or not, I'm in your eternal thanks for all
12005000	12007000	of this. Well, it's the
12007000	12009000	least I could do.
12009000	12011000	Alright, take care of my friend. We have
12011000	12013000	to go wrap up. It's not a marathon
12013000	12015000	show. Yes? Stay black, my
12015000	12017000	brother. I will, absolutely.
12017000	12019000	Good night. Hey,
12019000	12021000	run, run, Sean. Yeah, that's okay, Sean.
12021000	12023000	Stay drunk.
12023000	12025000	Bye, my friend.
12025000	12027000	I don't have to have sinned.
12027000	12029000	Alright, I'm hitting hang up now,
12029000	12031000	because I've said bye like five times. Alright.
12031000	12033000	That was
12033000	12035000	amazing. It'll always be my run, Sean.
12035000	12037000	What a great show.
12037000	12039000	I'm getting a little of a clempt.
12039000	12041000	Do we have any last minute stories? Oh, I need to read
12041000	12043000	Twitter topics. Where's my iPad?
12043000	12045000	Do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
12045000	12047000	No. No, he's ready to go.
12047000	12049000	I have a last
12049000	12051000	minute story. Okay.
12051000	12053000	I like these brownies. They're awesome.
12053000	12055000	I just want to say, just kind of like a
12055000	12057000	blanket thank you to
12057000	12059000	the kind words on
12059000	12061000	Twitter. There's been a lot of tweet
12061000	12063000	activity tonight, and I just want to say a
12063000	12065000	big thank you for all of that.
12065000	12067000	I don't have the time yet, because we're
12067000	12069000	running way over to read each and every single
12069000	12071000	one of them, but I just want to say thank you.
12071000	12073000	Quickly, some of these tweets, real

12075000	12077000	tweeting us about Shadowrun Returns
12077000	12079000	backers for the DRM-free copy of the game
12079000	12081000	may have gotten screwed by Microsoft,
12081000	12083000	and in a nutshell, the game will be
12083000	12085000	free, but the
12085000	12087000	original game
12087000	12089000	will be DRM-free, but the DLC
12089000	12091000	will not. So they're holding
12091000	12093000	up their end of the bargain. Basically what it is, is you get
12093000	12095000	two versions of the game. You get a DRM-free
12095000	12097000	version of the game. You get a Steam version of the game.
12097000	12099000	Steam version will support the DLC
12099000	12101000	beyond the Kickstarter
12101000	12103000	exclusive DLC, and then
12103000	12105000	the free-to-play
12105000	12107000	DRM-free game will only
12107000	12109000	support the Kickstarter
12109000	12111000	DLC, but no
12111000	12113000	additional DLC.
12113000	12115000	Tigerclaw tweeting us that
12115000	12117000	Ska Studios challenges the view that
12117000	12119000	Microsoft is bad for indies, so not
12119000	12121000	everybody is saying that Microsoft is this
12121000	12123000	evil indie thing. Bobby Blackwolf
12123000	12125000	tweeting us about this is a travesty
12125000	12127000	in a story about Disneyland. Apparently
12127000	12129000	Space Mountain was
12129000	12131000	closed while Disneyland reviewed safety.
12131000	12133000	Space Mountain, the Matterhorn Bobsleds,
12133000	12135000	and Soarin' Over California were
12135000	12137000	out of service today.
12137000	12139000	What a shitty day to be at Disneyland.
12139000	12141000	Hey, we weren't there.
12141000	12143000	You poor guys that went to Disneyland today.
12143000	12145000	But they did reopen Matterhorn Bobsleds already,
12145000	12147000	which, you know, is kind of... I'm just still
12147000	12149000	irritated they took out the basketball court.
12149000	12151000	They did? Yeah, they took out the basketball
12151000	12153000	court when they redid the tracks.
12153000	12155000	For those who don't know their
12155000	12157000	Disney trivia, the Matterhorn had a half
12157000	12159000	court up in the very top of the
12159000	12161000	mountain for cast members
12161000	12163000	to go during their break.
12163000	12165000	ActDeft tweeting us saying
12165000	12167000	Wars of Horizon getting a new free DLC
12167000	12169000	pack called the 1000 Club.
12169000	12171000	I like free DLC. I'm on board
12171000	12173000	with that. Also,
12173000	12175000	ActDeft tweeting us...
12175000	12177000	I think I went over his too, but that's okay.
12177000	12179000	A New Jersey assemblywoman wants to
12179000	12181000	ban violent video games in public
12181000	12183000	places. Yeah, was that the same one where they
12183000	12185000	want to ban M-rated arcade games? Yeah, they want
12185000	12187000	to ban M-rated and AO-rated arcade
12187000	12189000	games. Problem being, the ESRB does not
12189000	12191000	rate arcade games.
12191000	12193000	Yeah. So,
12193000	12195000	way to do your research.
12195000	12197000	How about if you don't like them? Don't take your
12197000	12199000	children there. And I just want to give
12199000	12201000	some quick shout outs. I know I said I wasn't going to read
12201000	12203000	each and every one of these, but we actually had some other
12203000	12205000	fellow podcasters that tweeted us
12205000	12207000	and said congratulations. And I think it's
12207000	12209000	important to give these guys a shout out because
12209000	12211000	community
12211000	12213000	makes us great. And us indie podcasters,
12213000	12215000	we really, really have to stick together.
12215000	12217000	So I do want to give a shout out to Godfrey
12217000	12219000	from Gamertag Radio who sent a tweet earlier
12219000	12221000	today. And they've been going
12221000	12223000	a very long time as well. I know they were one of the
12223000	12225000	first shows on iTunes as well, so
12225000	12227000	he's had many, many great
12227000	12229000	accomplishments. So props to you, Godfrey.
12229000	12231000	GameBui, who you
12231000	12233000	heard Slidekick earlier, also sent us a tweet.
12233000	12235000	Those guys are a lot of fun.
12235000	12237000	Even though I think they should go weekly,
12237000	12239000	but when they do
12239000	12241000	put out a show, it is fabulous and very well
12241000	12243000	researched. We always love it when they put out.
12243000	12245000	Who doesn't love it when they put out?
12245000	12247000	The Rich from the Video Game
12247000	12249000	Show tweeted us and said congrats on
12249000	12251000	500. Now Video Game Show, I
12251000	12253000	think, as far as I
12253000	12255000	know, I could be wrong, but as
12255000	12257000	far as I know, Video Game Show is
12257000	12259000	the only other podcast
12259000	12261000	in iTunes when it went
12261000	12263000	live about gaming the day it went
12263000	12265000	live that is still going. They're about to hit
12265000	12267000	episode 400. And again, if
12267000	12269000	we didn't have the live 365 years to count,
12269000	12271000	we'd probably be tied with them right now. So
12271000	12273000	big props to the Video Game
12273000	12275000	Show for keeping it going for all this time.
12275000	12277000	Our old friends at All Games Radio
12277000	12279000	also wishing us well on episode 500
12279000	12281000	tonight. I think that's very nice.
12281000	12283000	I'm glad to hear that they're doing well
12283000	12285000	as well too. They've added a lot
12285000	12287000	of cool shows to their lineup. They've really
12287000	12289000	diversified things a little bit.
12289000	12291000	Props to you guys at All Games
12291000	12293000	Radio for keeping it
12293000	12295000	going and Indie Radio.
12295000	12297000	And of course, to our pal
12297000	12299000	Bobby Blackwolf who's
12299000	12301000	always before us here. We love Bobby so
12301000	12303000	much. And Brad from
12303000	12305000	PodCultured. CriticalMyth
12305000	12307000	who's hitting 300 episodes tomorrow.
12307000	12309000	Nice.
12309000	12311000	And Anime Jam Session
12311000	12313000	and Hoard House and Girls Gone
12313000	12315000	Wow and British
12315000	12317000	Invaders. Have I named everybody now? I think I have.
12317000	12319000	Understation Live. Oh my God.
12319000	12321000	Understation Live. Well, I don't think that we would
12321000	12323000	be here without them. Isn't that
12323000	12325000	funny? Is that everybody's
12325000	12327000	calling in saying, O-L-R
12327000	12329000	you inspire me to do this. O-L-R you
12329000	12331000	did this. And I think this is a good note for us to end on
12331000	12333000	tonight. You know what? I'm going to sit on this for a minute because I want to end
12333000	12335000	on that note. So let me go around and get everybody's
12335000	12337000	final thought. Becky,
12337000	12339000	thank you so much for being here. I know you didn't get a chance to
12339000	12341000	say an awful lot, but we really
12341000	12343000	appreciate the culinary delights. And your
12343000	12345000	support still means the world to us. So thank you for
12345000	12347000	being here. You're welcome.
12347000	12349000	It's okay. I'm just, I'm a very
12349000	12351000	quiet person. That's alright. Any final thoughts for our listeners
12351000	12353000	though? While you're at it? Any
12353000	12355000	last words of wisdom?
12357000	12359000	Don't let your kids watch Sponge
12359000	12361000	Bob.
12361000	12363000	It's horrible.
12363000	12365000	Dark
12365000	12367000	Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight?
12367000	12369000	Oh, why the fuck not? Reject false
12369000	12371000	icons. Ooh,
12371000	12373000	taking it back a notch.
12373000	12375000	Loki, your final thought tonight? I have two things. One, I have a picture
12375000	12377000	of poop on my phone. And two,
12377000	12379000	uh, wow.
12379000	12381000	Let's do this
12381000	12383000	Mark IV style, motherfuckers.
12383000	12385000	My final thought
12385000	12387000	tonight, as promised, I want to
12387000	12389000	say a lot of you gave props
12389000	12391000	to us for helping inspire what you do.
12391000	12393000	But I really have to say, and I
12393000	12395000	got into this on Facebook a little bit before,
12395000	12397000	but I really just want to say that, you know,
12397000	12399000	I studied radio in college
12399000	12401000	and I actually originally was
12401000	12403000	going to be a weatherman. That was what I was in
12403000	12405000	college to study originally.
12405000	12407000	I interned at a broadcast station
12407000	12409000	at an actual
12409000	12411000	news broadcast in the town I went
12411000	12413000	to school in. And although
12413000	12415000	everybody was really nice and it was a really great
12415000	12417000	eye-opening experience, the way
12417000	12419000	my eyes were open was that most people
12419000	12421000	were very miserable in the jobs that they were doing and
12421000	12423000	it really didn't want to be something I wanted to continue.
12423000	12425000	So I kind of got into radio as a result
12425000	12427000	of that, but I felt a lot of that same
12427000	12429000	stuff. That in commercial radio
12429000	12431000	it's really not about who you know, but it's about who
12431000	12433000	you blow. And that wasn't really what
12433000	12435000	I wanted, you know, contrary to what Jamie might tell
12435000	12437000	you about when I drink, that wasn't really what I
12437000	12439000	wanted to pursue. So
12439000	12441000	I didn't finish school
12441000	12443000	because I became very jaded with a lot of it.
12443000	12445000	And I was kind of like, what the hell am I wasting my time for?
12445000	12447000	I just need to go out into the working world.
12447000	12449000	And while I don't hate school and I think it's
12449000	12451000	great that a lot of people do go to school and finish
12451000	12453000	college and all that, for me at that time
12453000	12455000	it was what I needed to do and it was a great
12455000	12457000	thing. And I love where I ended up in my career
12457000	12459000	so I'm happy. But I'm really thankful
12459000	12461000	to my time
12461000	12463000	I did spend at the college radio station,
12463000	12465000	my very first radio show at KCSC
12465000	12467000	Student Radio.
12467000	12469000	I just want to say props to that and for my time there.
12469000	12471000	And then I also want to say a big thank you to
12471000	12473000	Travis Donahue
12473000	12475000	from Understation Live for bringing me
12475000	12477000	on to his show back in
12477000	12479000	what, 2000, 2001
12479000	12481000	when I came on to his show for the first
12481000	12483000	time. And it was so much fun
12483000	12485000	he asked me to come back and I came back
12485000	12487000	over and over and over again. And through
12487000	12489000	him I learned how easy it was to do a show on
12489000	12491000	Live 365. And so
12491000	12493000	I, like DJ Rama
12493000	12495000	was talking about with his show and
12495000	12497000	Code Man was talking about his show and everybody else,
12497000	12499000	I said, you know, I want to do something like
12499000	12501000	this for the day. And I
12501000	12503000	you know, I want to do something like this for the
12503000	12505000	DDR community and for
12505000	12507000	the, you know, Bamani
12507000	12509000	community and all my new friends
12509000	12511000	that I've been making playing Dance Dance Revolution.
12511000	12513000	And Jamie, of course, was a big part
12513000	12515000	of that. We kind of thought of all the basic
12515000	12517000	concepts on that Bart ride.
12517000	12519000	And then Loki, well, he just tagged along for
12519000	12521000	the ride, but this show
12521000	12523000	would not be the same without him. I do need to thank Travis, too,
12523000	12525000	for having me on as a guest so much and filling in
12525000	12527000	for Jessica. Absolutely. Absolutely.
12527000	12529000	So, yeah,
12529000	12531000	I guess this is in a way
12531000	12533000	500 episodes of paying it forward.
12533000	12535000	So really appreciate
12535000	12537000	it. I don't know what else to say.
12537000	12539000	I see lots of great stuff in the
12539000	12541000	chat room right now. YYR says, thank you
12541000	12543000	guys for 500 great episodes and for devoting
12543000	12545000	so much of your time and energy to contribute towards
12545000	12547000	all of our lives, ours and yours.
12547000	12549000	Tim TRP says, Rob, you have a
12549000	12551000	voice for radio, a face for TV
12551000	12553000	news and a body for hardcore
12553000	12555000	pornography. Wait a minute.
12555000	12557000	Wait a minute.
12557000	12559000	Oh, Tim.
12559000	12561000	Tim. All right.
12561000	12563000	I'm going to cry in a second, by the way.
12563000	12565000	Are you? What else can I say to make you cry?
12565000	12567000	Shut up.
12567000	12569000	If someone else brings up Sharmi, maybe.
12569000	12571000	The chips are gone.
12571000	12573000	I missed them already.
12573000	12577000	All right.
12577000	12579000	I think it's time we end the show. Thank you guys
12579000	12581000	so much for 500 great episodes.
12581000	12583000	Let's try to be less sappy next week, you guys.
12583000	12585000	I did pick something very, very,
12585000	12587000	very classic for Cookie.
12587000	12589000	Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.
12589000	12591000	All right, that's it. We're done. What do you say, guys?
12591000	12593000	We'll do it all again next week, all right?
12593000	12595000	Come on back next week for episode
12595000	12597000	501.
12597000	12599000	Until then,
12599000	12601000	have a great week.
12601000	12603000	Don't be a dick.
12603000	12605000	And have fun. It's only a game.
12605000	12607000	Good night.
