27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February 17th, 2013.
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
49000	53000	First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53000	54000	Blarg.
54000	56000	Blarg, yarg. How you doing?
56000	57000	I'm tired.
57000	58000	Tired?
58000	61000	Actually, thank you for the ca-ca-coc-pa-pa.
61000	65000	I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time and then it came out.
65000	69000	The caffi. You were just saying it, you know, with an accent. The caffi.
69000	70000	I love coffee.
70000	71000	Yeah, I love coffee too.
71000	78000	I'm drinking it and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit because I went to San Francisco yesterday.
78000	79000	How was San Francisco?
79000	81000	It was gay.
81000	84000	What'd you do in San Francisco? I'm sure the weather was great. What'd you do in San Francisco?
84000	91000	It was fantastic. Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.
91000	101000	And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara and, well, there was beer involved and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.
101000	103000	I have been there.
103000	104000	It's good.
104000	106000	Yeah, it's not just a clever title.
106000	108000	It's freaking good pizza.
108000	110000	Yeah, it is. Good stuff.
110000	120000	So, yeah, there was some bar hopping and some curry rice earlier in the day and an anime convention that I had no idea was going on.
120000	126000	And I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie, because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.
126000	131000	And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone's like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?
131000	136000	And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japan town.
136000	139000	I was like, I'm not here for the con. I'm just wearing my jacket.
139000	140000	Did you do a deadpan just like that?
140000	141000	Yeah.
141000	142000	Awesome.
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	145000	I love the random impromptu anime convention.
145000	147000	Dark Sakura approaches. Quick, throw an anime convention.
147000	154000	Well, I saw people putting on armor in the in the Japan town.
154000	159000	Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?
159000	162000	OK, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.
162000	165000	I saw people putting on armor. I was like.
165000	169000	It's not the cherry blossom festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.
169000	172000	Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?
172000	178000	Sure enough, I, you know, I run into somebody and wearing a blue trench coat and a button up shirt.
178000	180000	I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?
180000	183000	He's like, yeah, and there's my my doctor over there.
183000	185000	I was like, so is there a convention going on?
185000	187000	He's like, oh, yeah, it sucks.
187000	190000	Oh, I don't even remember what the convention was called.
190000	195000	Where was that? Was it at the was it was over the Kabuki Hotel.
195000	198000	Interesting. You know, that's where they're going to be having the gamer expo,
198000	203000	but they call it gamer X now because they can't call it gamer con legal stuff.
203000	207000	But that's where they're having that. So it seemed like a pretty good venue.
207000	209000	But I mean, I want to go to that one.
209000	215000	But it was cosplay central all over Japan town and assholes with cameras.
215000	217000	That's the other thing I call them assholes.
217000	220000	And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.
220000	223000	You know, there's people who know how to behave,
223000	226000	how to assure people aside when they're taking their photos.
226000	232000	This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband,
232000	233000	looking for the girls to the biggest.
233000	240000	I'm up with this in backing up into Techmaster Loki, everybody backing up into people
240000	242000	and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.
242000	246000	And, you know, he tried to I ran into him again and I just said,
246000	249000	you know, look where you're going ass face or something.
249000	254000	And it was just being rude. You know, there's a way to take photos at a convention.
254000	256000	And the way this guy did it is not it.
256000	260000	Did you go to the anime convention and say I wasn't supposed to be here today?
260000	264000	I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.
264000	267000	All right. I don't keep up with the concert anymore.
267000	268000	How do I know all this?
268000	271000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki, officially everybody.
271000	272000	Hello. How are you doing?
272000	273000	I'm doing fine.
273000	275000	You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?
275000	276000	No.
276000	277000	Good. Don't do that.
277000	278000	But I can remember.
278000	280000	You had to think for a minute.
280000	283000	It's been a while since I've been to the con. No, I don't think I have.
283000	285000	It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.
285000	287000	I don't even remember the last con I went to. It was probably like ASET.
287000	289000	I remember the last con job I pulled.
289000	292000	What's a con job? It sounds hot.
292000	294000	Con? Con artist?
294000	296000	Oh, OK.
296000	298000	It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.
298000	300000	OK. Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.
300000	303000	Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.
303000	304000	He's a familiar guy.
304000	307000	You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show
307000	310000	or ever listened to Hoard House and hear his e-mails and tweets and all that.
310000	314000	Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.
314000	316000	It is Flaco Jones, everybody.
316000	317000	Hello, everybody.
317000	318000	How are you doing?
318000	319000	I'm doing great.
319000	322000	As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.
322000	323000	Yeah, I love that.
323000	327000	Because you just reminded me of Ni No Kuni and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.
327000	329000	You're sticky and smell of caramel?
329000	330000	Yes.
330000	331000	Can I smell you?
331000	332000	It's all this English candy.
332000	335000	Yes, it's all the Cyl candy, which much love to Cyl.
335000	338000	I don't know if Cyl listens to Orange Lawn Triadio, but I hope she won't mind.
338000	339000	I've been giving some of the candy away.
339000	342000	It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.
342000	346000	I had to lay claim to the Mars Bar because I love Mars Bars.
346000	351000	So, yes, Cyl from Girls Gone Wow, which if you haven't heard the show, it's a fantabulous show.
351000	356000	And it's you can hear it Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geek or Wednesday mornings, excuse me, at the Voice of Geeks Network.
356000	360000	It's Wednesday nights if you're in the UK, but they are a lovely British based group.
360000	363000	It's not just Cyl, it's Cyl, EJ, Raven and Rob.
363000	367000	But I correspond mostly with Cyl because, you know, in getting her shows and so forth.
367000	371000	And Cyl offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing.
371000	378000	So she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain, like the Smarties over there, which are like totally different than Smarties here.
378000	381000	And like Aero Bars, which we don't have here at all.
381000	384000	Jelly Babies, which I'd never had, which were pretty good.
384000	385000	I can't eat Jelly Babies.
385000	389000	It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.
389000	394000	But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town.
394000	398000	But she sent stuff that I've never seen there, like the Bubblies. I've never seen them there.
398000	400000	Yeah, yeah. So pretty cool.
400000	408000	And oh my God, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.
408000	411000	She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs. I had one yesterday.
411000	414000	Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.
414000	418000	So I have a return package. I don't want to spoil, just in case Sil is listening.
418000	420000	But I might spoil by the time it gets there.
420000	425000	I do have a return package we're sending. And all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.
425000	427000	So if you know Sil.
427000	429000	And we're sending her a token of our love.
429000	436000	That's right. In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Sil that we're sending.
436000	438000	So we'll send that over there soon.
438000	445000	Alright, Flaco, what's new with you? What have you been up to? When was the last time you were on the show? A couple months ago, right?
445000	447000	I was on the year-end show.
447000	448000	That's right.
448000	449000	So December 30th.
449000	453000	That's right, the last show of the year. Because you ruined one of the shows in June.
453000	454000	Yes.
454000	456000	And hopefully tonight's show will be better.
456000	462000	I scared everybody in December because something happened that hadn't happened. I guess the stream went down and that hadn't happened in a few weeks.
462000	464000	So it was scaring people.
464000	473000	Well, I should warn everybody. I was having major internet issues yesterday. Like, Alan and I were trying to play World of Warcraft and disconnected like eight times. It was insane.
473000	474000	He had net flatulence.
474000	487000	My iPad wouldn't even connect to the internet. It was dumb. So we unplugged our routers overnight. And so far today, they've been fine. So we'll keep our fingers crossed. But Flaco's presence could break them again.
487000	493000	I like that I have this reputation with the show. I'm the number one fan of Hoard House and the number one curse on a locker.
493000	502000	Exactly. Exactly. So you you have two young ones at home. You just how old is your little girl now?
502000	505000	She's almost one. She turns a year next month.
505000	509000	So you have a less than a year old at home. Yes. How do you juggle that with game playing?
509000	520000	I play very late at night or early in the morning. And you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni, something like that, I can actually play when they're up. They don't get bothered by it too much.
520000	527000	My son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon. You know, he doesn't like the battle. He gets bored of that, which I guess a lot of people do.
527000	537000	You read some of the online reviews. But yeah, he loves the animated cut scenes in that. And, you know, another game we've been playing lately is The Unfinished Swan, and he loves that game.
537000	543000	So if he loves the game, he'll actually request it. And Unfinished Swan, obviously, you can't say that, but he calls it tree.
543000	551000	Because when you, when you highlight the icon on the PlayStation, it just has a picture of, you know, like an ink splattered tree. And so that's what he calls it.
551000	556000	So when he comes in the living room, he starts saying tree, tree. And like, you want us to play tree? Yeah.
556000	562000	So we put, you know, we load up that game when we start playing it. And he just, he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game.
562000	574000	Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I've used those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff.
574000	583000	Whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari had just, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?
583000	588000	I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.
588000	591000	Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.
591000	602000	So it's just interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve. And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.
602000	603000	I think they will.
603000	604000	It'll just be different.
604000	606000	They're holding back on it right now. They just want to save it.
606000	607000	You think so?
607000	608000	Yeah.
608000	609000	Holding back on it.
609000	610000	They can do it now.
610000	613000	Or Oliver will be able to have the Aluma Room that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.
613000	614000	Yes.
614000	615000	Just in time for that phase.
615000	616000	Boobs everywhere.
616000	617000	Just in time for that phase.
618000	620000	I thought you just called the motorboat room.
623000	625000	Akuma JP in our chat room.
625000	626000	By the way, hi, chatters.
626000	631000	We're always joined with the live chat room because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
631000	633000	vognetwork.com.
633000	636000	Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
636000	639000	Akuma JP in chat says, sky sounds old.
639000	640000	Ha ha ha.
641000	644000	Well, jerk, keep this in mind.
644000	647000	OLR is on our 11th year this year.
647000	653000	So, if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.
653000	655000	We didn't start this show when we were 18.
655000	658000	We were more like 23 or 24.
658000	659000	So, you do the math.
659000	662000	You know what? The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.
662000	663000	And what's that?
663000	664000	Because I'll be 37.
664000	665000	In a row?
667000	668000	I rest my case.
670000	671000	So, and I'll be 35.
671000	673000	So, Jamie's the old one.
673000	674000	Come on, Akuma.
674000	676000	Redirect your jokes appropriately.
676000	678000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
678000	679000	Vintage.
680000	682000	This rack took years to grow.
683000	685000	And I'm two weeks older than Rob.
685000	687000	I know. I feel like the young kid.
687000	690000	If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.
690000	694000	And all my friends, I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.
694000	696000	I guess I just hang out with youngins.
696000	697000	That's the deal.
698000	701000	So, Akuma JP in our chat room says, so you are old, lol.
701000	702000	Bonk.
702000	704000	You're only as old as you feel, honestly.
704000	706000	And I will say this with all honesty.
706000	711000	We will talk about video games in a minute here, but obviously I still play video games,
711000	715000	which a lot of people think is a youthful activity, although I don't think so.
715000	720000	I think because we all grew up in a generation that at least had Atari 2600,
720000	722000	video games has always been a part of our lives.
722000	727000	So, I can't imagine not playing video games at this point, right?
727000	730000	But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.
730000	731000	Really, for real.
731000	733000	I have to agree with that for myself as well.
733000	737000	I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20 year olds.
737000	738000	That's totally not the case.
738000	742000	But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time
742000	744000	know that I was really sick when I was 29.
744000	747000	I missed two or three weeks at OLR because I'd been in the hospital.
747000	749000	I'd have surgery.
749000	753000	So, it was one of those things where they had to screen me
753000	756000	because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer
756000	758000	and that was the type of stuff I had going on.
758000	762000	So, it was scary and I think all that stuff going through that before 30
762000	766000	kind of definitely made me feel like turning 30 is awesome.
766000	768000	I get to turn 30, yes!
768000	769000	You want to know what's funny?
769000	770000	What?
770000	774000	Back in my early days on AOL, I had a friend who I chatted,
774000	777000	another anime fan who was 10 years old.
777000	780000	I remember chatting with him when he graduated college.
780000	782000	That makes me feel old.
782000	783000	Yeah, I know, right?
783000	786000	I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.
786000	788000	I'm like, my nieces can drink.
788000	789000	It's weird.
789000	791000	I remember when they were born.
791000	794000	But now you can take them out drinking.
794000	798000	The other day, we got an email to the show that was like,
798000	801000	I've been listening to you since I was 13.
801000	803000	I'm like, oh my God.
803000	805000	He's like, I'm in college now.
805000	807000	Oh my God.
807000	812000	Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?
812000	813000	Not many.
813000	815000	Gunsmoke, The Simpsons.
815000	818000	Doctor Who.
818000	820000	There's only a few.
820000	822000	So we're awesome.
822000	826000	Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room
826000	828000	and live at the Voice Ease Network.
828000	831000	I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.
831000	836000	Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.
836000	838000	What the hell was that?
838000	841000	They say that that kind of stuff happens all the time.
841000	844000	It happened in San Francisco, right?
844000	845000	Later on.
845000	847000	Yeah, but it totally wasn't the same thing.
847000	849000	It didn't shatter windows and stuff.
849000	851000	It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.
851000	853000	Probably somebody's science project out there.
853000	857000	Russia, meteor shatter you.
857000	860000	Yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook.
860000	862000	Little pictures in Soviet Russia.
862000	865000	I was busy being asleep.
865000	867000	Well, you don't live in Russia.
867000	870000	I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.
870000	872000	Well, no, no, no, no.
872000	874000	I actually didn't see the news until I got up late today
874000	876000	because I've been sick most of the day.
876000	879000	So I was like, meteor, fuck, sleep.
879000	882000	No, watching the videos online blew my mind.
882000	885000	You can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass
885000	887000	and of course the car alarms is always the best part.
887000	891000	Somebody get Bruce Willis's Armageddon.
891000	895000	I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia
895000	897000	as they have these dash cams going.
897000	900000	Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.
900000	904000	And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never fazed by any of this.
904000	906000	There's no like, oh my God!
906000	908000	It's just like, right?
908000	910000	It's like, what?
910000	912000	You're just like, oh, that's weird.
912000	914000	Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die, oh well.
914000	916000	Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in like, I don't know,
916000	918000	Philadelphia or something?
918000	921000	Yeah, and there's like a camera going. I can just imagine it right now.
921000	923000	Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said,
923000	925000	and it was just like a small thing.
925000	927000	The guy's like driving on the freeway and he's like,
927000	929000	Oh my God, did you see that?
929000	931000	It's just like, okay.
931000	933000	Oh my God, thanks Obama.
933000	936000	I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.
936000	938000	I was driving home really late at night
938000	940000	and there was a big green streak across the sky,
940000	942000	but it didn't explode like that one,
942000	944000	so obviously it wasn't even close to the size,
944000	946000	but I thought it was pretty cool.
946000	948000	I was like, oh wow, that thing just comes streaking across
948000	950000	and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.
950000	953000	If it had been in my neck of the South, it'd be, the fuck is that?
953000	955000	Hand me a beer.
955000	957000	Shit, that means we're going to get them another hurricane.
957000	959000	Porkchop in our chat room says,
959000	961000	I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.
961000	964000	I guess I'm assuming they're in public cars.
964000	966000	Yeah, so I thought maybe the police cars.
966000	968000	No, apparently they're really, from what I read,
968000	971000	they're really into dash cams because I guess in traffic courts and stuff,
971000	973000	they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.
973000	975000	They have to have physical evidence.
975000	977000	And so because of altercations like that,
977000	979000	you know, any sort of car accident,
979000	981000	they want to have something to document it.
981000	983000	So that's why they do it.
983000	985000	You know, Nelly was born in Russia.
985000	987000	Did she have anything to say about it?
987000	989000	No.
989000	991000	Thank God it didn't happen here.
991000	993000	She was born in the Ukraine.
993000	995000	So it's a little different.
995000	997000	A little different.
997000	999000	Uh, interesting.
999000	1001000	Well, I don't know what that has to say.
1001000	1003000	Yeah, Rob, everything Slavic is not Russian. Thank you.
1003000	1005000	Are you sure?
1005000	1007000	It was in the 80s.
1007000	1009000	I thought Canada was a state.
1009000	1011000	Anyhow, I don't know what that had to do with video games,
1011000	1013000	but as far as like nerd news goes,
1013000	1015000	like it was one of those things where I watched it.
1015000	1017000	I was like, oh my God.
1017000	1019000	You make a burning Legion joke.
1019000	1021000	Yes, I saw that on Twitter.
1021000	1023000	Kashi Meteor.
1023000	1025000	Someone Kashi Meteor.
1025000	1029000	Code Man in chat says it was Team Rocket.
1029000	1033000	Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.
1033000	1035000	There was a gif of the lights going out and Team Rocket shows up.
1035000	1037000	I guess it was Goku.
1037000	1039000	All right.
1039000	1041000	Let's get into video games
1041000	1043000	and the video games that you have been playing this week
1043000	1045000	in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1045000	1047000	Dark Sakura.
1047000	1049000	I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar. That was awesome.
1049000	1051000	You inhaled that thing.
1051000	1053000	I love Mars bars.
1053000	1055000	Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.
1055000	1057000	So I beat Mass Effect 2 again.
1057000	1059000	I started on Mass Effect 3
1059000	1061000	and got Fly Cam working.
1061000	1063000	But now,
1063000	1065000	you know, we got that patch 1.5
1065000	1067000	and none of my cheats
1067000	1069000	work anymore.
1069000	1071000	So I just figured out how to put in
1071000	1073000	key binding commands using the coalesced editor.
1073000	1075000	And now all I have to do is hit
1075000	1077000	zero for god mode.
1077000	1079000	No, but really,
1079000	1081000	I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.
1081000	1083000	I played WoW
1083000	1085000	for an hour.
1085000	1087000	And I
1087000	1089000	would actually log on and play more WoW
1089000	1091000	but I would like people
1091000	1093000	to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to
1093000	1095000	you know, plug it.
1095000	1097000	And
1097000	1099000	yes, I know that Mars bars
1099000	1101000	are Milky Ways but they're not the regular
1101000	1103000	Milky Ways. They taste better.
1103000	1105000	They're different-er.
1105000	1107000	They're actually from Mars.
1107000	1109000	They are.
1109000	1111000	And you don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid
1111000	1113000	so having it say Mars with the packaging
1113000	1115000	on it and everything makes me
1115000	1117000	stupendously happy.
1117000	1119000	So, now if I can find
1119000	1121000	whatchamacallits I'd be even happier.
1121000	1123000	I played
1123000	1125000	I played
1125000	1127000	something else.
1127000	1129000	I don't remember what it was.
1129000	1131000	Oh yeah, Dan had a friend
1131000	1133000	over and they played through Contra hardcore
1133000	1135000	and then played
1135000	1137000	through Ghouls
1137000	1139000	and Ghosts
1139000	1141000	which was pretty fun because
1141000	1143000	my friend and I left
1143000	1145000	and then we came back
1145000	1147000	and they were still playing Ghouls and Ghosts
1147000	1149000	like hours later.
1149000	1151000	So I'm like, what playthrough were you on? Oh, just the beginning
1151000	1153000	of the second playthrough.
1153000	1155000	Really. So yeah.
1155000	1157000	And then I got
1157000	1159000	now this isn't a game but it's related to a game
1159000	1161000	I found the Mass Effect
1161000	1163000	Paragon Lost
1163000	1165000	for like 16 bucks brand new.
1165000	1167000	So I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money
1167000	1169000	let's buy it.
1169000	1171000	It didn't suck.
1171000	1173000	The only thing that I really didn't like about it was
1173000	1175000	how the kroken were drawn.
1175000	1177000	I did not care for the character design.
1177000	1179000	And it got me in the feels.
1179000	1181000	Damn you Bioware.
1181000	1183000	So yeah.
1183000	1185000	Damn those feels.
1185000	1187000	Damn the battle tits.
1187000	1189000	Full speed ahead.
1189000	1191000	Alright, let's move on to Loki.
1191000	1193000	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1193000	1195000	I didn't play a whole ton this week.
1195000	1197000	I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim
1197000	1199000	I'm sure I started some of the
1199000	1201000	kind of DLC stuff
1201000	1203000	or not DLC stuff, the
1203000	1205000	mod quests
1205000	1207000	I guess if you will. There's one that's kind of
1207000	1209000	where you hire a boat and you can actually go
1209000	1211000	to a bunch of different islands and stuff.
1211000	1213000	And it was neat, I guess.
1213000	1215000	I mean, it's pretty well done.
1215000	1217000	And they voice acted everything
1217000	1219000	so that's a little weird hearing people that
1219000	1221000	don't sound like the five different
1221000	1223000	NPCs that are in the game.
1223000	1225000	They have voice, all the characters
1225000	1227000	it's ridiculous.
1227000	1229000	So I played a little bit of that
1229000	1231000	and then
1231000	1233000	a little bit of Borderlands
1233000	1235000	and
1235000	1237000	more Call of Duty.
1237000	1239000	We actually bought Map Pack 4
1239000	1241000	or Content Pack 4
1241000	1243000	so now we have a few more maps
1243000	1245000	that I've already kind of gotten sick of.
1245000	1247000	But we got to do something because
1247000	1249000	Grand Theft Auto 5 is not coming out
1249000	1251000	in May like we had hoped it was so
1251000	1253000	got to have something to tide us over.
1255000	1257000	And then I just got done playing
1257000	1259000	DDRX2
1259000	1261000	on my PC.
1261000	1263000	Even though, yes, that's an arcade
1263000	1265000	game, but it
1265000	1267000	runs on a PC so I played
1267000	1269000	it anyways.
1269000	1271000	And it isn't the versus
1271000	1273000	second mixing, that's 3 I guess.
1273000	1275000	But it's X2.
1275000	1277000	It's cool, looks like
1277000	1279000	Stepmania, I guess.
1279000	1281000	It looked a lot to me like the
1281000	1283000	Playstation 3 version of the game.
1283000	1285000	They just adapted that engine.
1285000	1287000	Or the Wii, DDR2 on the Wii.
1287000	1289000	I'm surprised they don't release a PC version.
1289000	1291000	It runs on a PC, there's
1291000	1293000	no work to be done.
1293000	1295000	Literally no work to be done.
1295000	1297000	Licensing would be the only thing.
1297000	1299000	I guess, but just put
1299000	1301000	Konami Originals in there.
1301000	1303000	Done. Put it on Steam. There you go.
1303000	1305000	Money. Just rolling in.
1307000	1309000	So there's that. And then my wife
1309000	1311000	has been taking
1311000	1313000	over the Xbox because she's been
1313000	1315000	playing Fable 3.
1315000	1317000	Really? Yeah.
1317000	1319000	That's not even the best Fable game.
1319000	1321000	She played Fable 2 all the way.
1321000	1323000	And so she's playing Fable 3.
1323000	1325000	Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games.
1325000	1327000	Who's getting into Fable. Or is into Fable.
1327000	1329000	Yeah, she is into Fable.
1329000	1331000	Does she play good or bad? She's playing good.
1331000	1333000	Okay.
1333000	1335000	That game is...
1335000	1337000	It just makes me realize
1337000	1339000	how much Peter Molyneaux is full of
1339000	1341000	crap.
1341000	1343000	And he's just like talking
1343000	1345000	about all these different
1346000	1348000	enhancements
1348000	1350000	and all this is the first time
1350000	1352000	ever in the game and the dog is awesome
1352000	1354000	blah blah blah blah.
1354000	1356000	Okay, you're so full of shit it's not even funny.
1356000	1358000	By the way folks, is anyone still curious
1358000	1360000	about curiosity? Because I'm pretty sure
1360000	1362000	everybody's fucking forgotten about this
1362000	1364000	curiosity. No, you know who hasn't
1364000	1366000	forgotten about curiosity is Alan.
1366000	1368000	Because he'll be sitting there on my iPad and
1368000	1370000	he'll walk into the room and he'll be like,
1370000	1372000	Have you checked on the cube Rob? Have you checked on the cube? What's in the cube?
1372000	1374000	Did you find what's in the cube yet?
1374000	1376000	Break the touch. Break the cubes.
1376000	1378000	He does it just like that too. Break the cubes Rob.
1380000	1382000	I don't know what you would even
1382000	1384000	what that's going to be. I think it's going to just be like
1384000	1386000	whoever finally, the last person
1386000	1388000	to give that game up is going to be the winner
1388000	1390000	pretty much.
1390000	1392000	Well I was going to ask you about this because
1392000	1394000	there was that new Alien game
1394000	1396000	that came out this week from Gearbox
1396000	1398000	and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet
1398000	1400000	except for one site. Apparently really liked it.
1400000	1402000	But whatever. And then I went
1402000	1404000	on this Twitter thing. Now I don't know
1404000	1406000	shit about this game really but
1406000	1408000	I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's
1408000	1410000	jock? Because you know one particular
1410000	1412000	organization seemed to like it.
1412000	1414000	And I was like, well isn't like a difference of opinion
1414000	1416000	okay? And it was really weird
1416000	1418000	because Metacritic retweeted or no
1418000	1420000	favorited one of my tweets. I was like, that was kind of
1420000	1422000	weird but okay.
1422000	1424000	Alright. But yeah
1424000	1426000	there was all this crap going on. I guess
1426000	1428000	a big part of it was that
1428000	1430000	a lot of the stuff they'd been showing at E3
1430000	1432000	and the type of stuff they'd been talking about
1432000	1434000	didn't actually come to fruition in the game.
1434000	1436000	Well yeah it makes a lot of sense.
1436000	1438000	And people are like, oh we're going to sue
1438000	1440000	and I'm just like
1440000	1442000	well game companies have been doing
1442000	1444000	this shit for years and you just brought up Peter
1444000	1446000	Molyneux. Like he's the master of this shit.
1446000	1448000	He makes up shit all the time.
1448000	1450000	Exactly. Who's trying to sue him?
1450000	1452000	I know nothing.
1452000	1454000	He's not really working
1454000	1456000	he's not really attached to any more Fable games
1456000	1458000	or anything like that as far as I'm aware.
1458000	1460000	There was Fable It's Not On Rails.
1460000	1462000	I seriously don't even know the name of the game.
1462000	1464000	It's just Fable It's Not On Rails.
1464000	1466000	Fable The Journey
1466000	1468000	Fable The Book The Game
1468000	1470000	The Series The Movie
1470000	1472000	I don't know. But yeah
1472000	1474000	even the whole Gearbox
1474000	1476000	well there's two jokes I made about it.
1476000	1478000	First off Gearbox you've got
1478000	1480000	Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox
1480000	1482000	and Borderlands Gearbox
1482000	1484000	well this is made by Duke Nukem
1484000	1486000	Forever Gearbox.
1486000	1488000	And then the second thing is
1488000	1490000	yeah it's just because they showed
1490000	1492000	more fancy features and stuff like that
1492000	1494000	that may have been running on a PC version
1494000	1496000	or something like that
1496000	1498000	that come time to actually
1498000	1500000	implement that on a console
1500000	1502000	oh we don't have the memory
1502000	1504000	bandwidth to do all these fancy
1504000	1506000	things we've got to scale it back a bit
1506000	1508000	or oh we don't have enough processing
1508000	1510000	power or the frame rates and shit
1510000	1512000	or whatever and so maybe that's why.
1512000	1514000	But then again why wouldn't they just
1514000	1516000	allow that to kind of run
1516000	1518000	unleashed on the PC
1518000	1520000	probably because it's a console port
1520000	1522000	I don't know.
1522000	1524000	Who cares?
1524000	1526000	Bad games happen all the time. Are you really surprised
1526000	1528000	that a movie tie-in game
1528000	1530000	is bad? Really?
1530000	1532000	I mean everyone's shocked that
1532000	1534000	this movie tie-in game is bad
1534000	1536000	I mean
1536000	1538000	it doesn't really matter it's just
1538000	1540000	yeah
1540000	1542000	we all really kind of hope that
1542000	1544000	Duke Nukem is as good as Borderlands
1544000	1546000	hell I thought Duke Nukem forever
1546000	1548000	this is going to be awesome because it's somebody of the guys that did Borderlands
1548000	1550000	No
1550000	1552000	No it's the team that did Duke Nukem forever
1552000	1554000	clearly
1554000	1556000	RossDielUT in our chatroom at
1556000	1558000	live.vognetwork.com says
1558000	1560000	differences is great but when there's literally one
1560000	1562000	that looks shady even with a game that doesn't get
1562000	1564000	well received there's always at least a group of
1564000	1566000	people who like the game
1566000	1568000	well yeah I mean you know
1568000	1570000	one guy liked the game but I can think of
1570000	1572000	like you know there's been like that one voice
1572000	1574000	that passionately defended it
1574000	1576000	Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as like
1576000	1578000	you know what they say now it'd be different if they didn't mention
1578000	1580000	any of the flaws
1580000	1582000	but maybe they just thought that you know it didn't really
1582000	1584000	affect the game too much it's a person's
1584000	1586000	opinion one guy's opinion and you're just like
1586000	1588000	flipping shit over it
1588000	1590000	There's also no evidence in this scenario
1590000	1592000	I mean people are like oh because it's running next
1592000	1594000	to an ad for the same game it's clearly
1594000	1596000	been bought I can't believe first off
1596000	1598000	I can't believe I am the one
1598000	1600000	defending a big name site
1600000	1602000	like I'm usually the first one to
1602000	1604000	criticize that stuff Yeah because you know what they're going to sell ads
1604000	1606000	so they can run that site
1606000	1608000	Oh my gosh game sites sell game ads
1608000	1610000	get out but there's no further
1610000	1612000	evidence that this whole thing was you know
1612000	1614000	and so the Twitter wants to convict
1614000	1616000	and say this is full of shady it's not
1616000	1618000	like that whole scenario with what was the
1618000	1620000	freaking game at GameSpot that got that guy
1620000	1622000	Kane and Lynch Yeah that whole thing
1622000	1624000	like there was more evidence and there
1624000	1626000	was stuff that came out about that and all
1626000	1628000	the shady dealings and the guy himself basically
1628000	1630000	said you know yeah it was
1630000	1632000	you know there was some stuff going on
1632000	1634000	where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff
1634000	1636000	I mean I don't know
1636000	1638000	I just think like the internet
1638000	1640000	should just get over it okay there was one
1640000	1642000	person that said it was good you know
1642000	1644000	well you know what somebody out there
1644000	1646000	probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2
1646000	1648000	somebody out there probably liked Yaris
1648000	1650000	it was free I like Silent Hill
1650000	1652000	Revelations the movie nobody
1652000	1654000	else like that I want it I need to see
1654000	1656000	it you and Ospher actually
1656000	1658000	Ospher on Twitter would defend that so there you
1658000	1660000	go it's something about being high on
1660000	1662000	leaderboards on VoG ActDef would probably like
1662000	1664000	it too well he did like it I
1664000	1666000	think look at oh my god
1666000	1668000	you know look at you know if you're gonna like blame
1668000	1670000	or mark games down just because
1670000	1672000	of like glitches and stuff like that then
1672000	1674000	Earth Defense Force 2017
1674000	1676000	should have gotten like a one out of ten
1676000	1678000	because that thing is
1678000	1680000	glitchy as hell there is
1680000	1682000	no physics
1682000	1684000	no physics whatsoever or at least
1684000	1686000	no realistic physics
1686000	1688000	it's just it's crap the AI
1688000	1690000	is completely retarded
1690000	1692000	so yeah it
1692000	1694000	happens get over it
1694000	1696000	Ross Steel UT in chat says and it
1696000	1698000	wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with
1698000	1700000	the game it took seven fucking years to make
1700000	1702000	and had eight devs on it
1702000	1704000	Lincoln just came out
1704000	1706000	a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think
1706000	1708000	18 years to make that's
1708000	1710000	why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd
1710000	1712000	because she was cast in it like ten years ago
1712000	1714000	and you know had to defend
1714000	1716000	the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated
1716000	1718000	for an Oscar sometimes things
1718000	1720000	get trapped in development hell it doesn't necessarily mean
1720000	1722000	they turn out bad like you're doing forever
1722000	1724000	well but that's that's that's not
1724000	1726000	helping my case actually L.A. Noire
1726000	1728000	I think was in development hell thank you that's
1728000	1730000	that's a better that's a good review thank you
1730000	1732000	Grand Theft Auto 5 just got delayed yeah
1732000	1734000	but that that had that hasn't been out
1734000	1736000	no that hasn't been that's very
1736000	1738000	long I mean it's not like this
1738000	1740000	Grand Theft Auto 5 came out in 2001
1740000	1742000	you know it's like wait a second
1742000	1744000	hey we're missing some numbers here
1744000	1746000	alright let's move on with
1746000	1748000	gaming week so we're gonna be here for an hour I'll talk
1748000	1750000	about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go to Flaco
1750000	1752000	I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week
1752000	1754000	because I've been having long hours
1754000	1756000	at work and you know when I come home I'm like
1756000	1758000	I have to raid in WoW or something but
1758000	1760000	I did play one new game and
1760000	1762000	it was something where it went
1762000	1764000	on sale this weekend and
1764000	1766000	so I get a text message from Shane
1766000	1768000	hey you should get Pokemon Black 2
1768000	1770000	it's on sale Black 2 has the
1770000	1772000	sassier Pokemon and it's on sale
1772000	1774000	right now at Best Buy so
1774000	1776000	you should get it I get a text an hour later
1776000	1778000	did you get it yet text an hour later
1778000	1780000	you know you can order it online you can just go pick it up after work
1780000	1782000	before it sells out and it's like you know
1782000	1784000	he keeps texting me like did you buy the Pokemon yet
1784000	1786000	why haven't you bought Pokemon why won't you take a good deal
1786000	1788000	you can talk about it on OLR so finally it's like
1788000	1790000	shut up alright I'll buy the game
1790000	1792000	so Jamie are you gonna get in the Pokemon now
1792000	1794000	pretty soon because you guys are all
1794000	1796000	talking like gateway
1796000	1798000	game addicts or something
1798000	1800000	yeah okay you say that now
1800000	1802000	let me see it you want to see it
1802000	1804000	no I want to see the box it's actually super cute
1804000	1806000	I don't care
1806000	1808000	alright so here's the thing
1808000	1810000	it's on the DS not the 3DS but the DS
1810000	1812000	and well then I could play it
1812000	1814000	but I don't care I've been having
1814000	1816000	fun with it you know what here's what I like
1816000	1818000	compared to Pearl it moves at a faster
1818000	1820000	pace it gives you all this shit up front
1820000	1822000	and you know you don't have to like go
1822000	1824000	forever and grind more and I
1824000	1826000	feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon
1826000	1828000	at the beginning than there was in Pearl
1828000	1830000	and it's just kind of
1830000	1832000	little quality of life improvements
1832000	1834000	here's where the game kind of
1834000	1836000	like goes crazy though is that there's all these
1836000	1838000	like online things like
1838000	1840000	I can't figure out half this shit with the online
1840000	1842000	like some of it's in the
1842000	1844000	manual and some of it I tried to go online
1844000	1846000	I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me but it's just
1846000	1848000	it's so weird like
1848000	1850000	you can use your little
1850000	1852000	online gear to put your Pokemon
1852000	1854000	to sleep and then you go on the
1854000	1856000	website and you register for the website
1856000	1858000	and then you link your DS
1858000	1860000	to the website and then you
1860000	1862000	can do that Pokemon
1862000	1864000	that you just put to sleep you can
1864000	1866000	have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville
1866000	1868000	but you can also play these little online
1868000	1870000	games so your Pokemon can send
1870000	1872000	you things back in the regular game
1872000	1874000	once you tell your Pokemon to wake
1874000	1876000	up and then you launch your game again
1876000	1878000	and you hit the button
1878000	1880000	to tell it to wake up and go find where
1880000	1882000	like it's like oh my god
1882000	1884000	it's like an 18 step process
1884000	1886000	my brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment
1886000	1888000	you said put him to sleep
1890000	1892000	put him down sorry Pikachu
1892000	1894000	it's funny
1894000	1896000	but I mean it's not I can
1896000	1898000	appreciate that the Pokemon company is like trying to do
1898000	1900000	these new things with Nintendo's infrastructure
1900000	1902000	which I can't imagine is a
1902000	1904000	real delight to work with
1904000	1906000	but it just kind of goes to show
1906000	1908000	like the fact that there's
1908000	1910000	just all these bells and whistles that are
1910000	1912000	buried like five minutes deep is just I don't know
1912000	1914000	I feel like Pokemon kind of needs
1914000	1916000	a better interface like
1916000	1918000	it would be better if they could streamline
1918000	1920000	a lot of that maybe
1920000	1922000	the new 3DS version X and Y
1922000	1924000	will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks
1924000	1926000	good so it'll be
1926000	1928000	cool to see that
1928000	1930000	but yeah I mean don't let
1930000	1932000	my little rant get you wrong especially
1932000	1934000	for the core game about finding
1934000	1936000	the new Pokemon and challenging
1936000	1938000	the gym leaders and all that it's all
1938000	1940000	it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace
1940000	1942000	than the other games do so you'll get pretty
1942000	1944000	immediate rewards out of it
1944000	1946000	there's a medal system in the game since
1946000	1948000	Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did
1948000	1950000	their own little thing with medals and you can have
1950000	1952000	your little title when you go online
1952000	1954000	you know what
1954000	1956000	I found my copy of Pearl
1956000	1958000	did you? yeah it was dusty
1958000	1960000	yeah
1960000	1962000	I had played Pearl about three weeks ago
1962000	1964000	and then I was like gosh this
1964000	1966000	game kind of moves really slow but this one's
1966000	1968000	a little better actually it's a lot better
1968000	1970000	it's all animations
1970000	1972000	in the little cut scenes too which is much
1972000	1974000	better than what it was before
1974000	1976000	where it's just like you know you see them
1976000	1978000	like shake up and down and that's like their little
1978000	1980000	attack a little silly
1980000	1982000	you know what my cat's butt
1982000	1984000	makes me think of Pokemon
1984000	1986000	what? because she does
1986000	1988000	you know when you see the little Pokemon bounce
1988000	1990000	back and forth on the thing she does
1990000	1992000	this little thing now where she wiggles her butt and then
1992000	1994000	jumps back and forth and I'm like
1994000	1996000	Midna used fetch
1996000	1998000	or something
1998000	2000000	oh I should say this too I'm playing Pokemon Black 2
2000000	2002000	and I didn't play Black 1 and I'm
2002000	2004000	doing just fine it's like the sequel thing
2004000	2006000	not an issue and I can appreciate
2006000	2008000	that that you know it didn't have to like they
2008000	2010000	always reference like all the people that you
2010000	2012000	talk to are like two years ago this happened
2012000	2014000	two years ago this happened so I guess that's
2014000	2016000	kind of its way of catching you up so that's
2016000	2018000	that's kind of cool I guess
2018000	2020000	what is this that you're showing me?
2020000	2022000	that okay that internet meme is seriously
2022000	2024000	15 years old I know I think it's
2024000	2026000	great that someone still remembers it
2026000	2028000	she's showing me the pictures of the cat oh is that in chat room?
2028000	2030000	yeah the pictures of the cats
2030000	2032000	playing Pokemans and it says my Pokemans
2032000	2034000	let me show you them I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago
2034000	2036000	I'm saving it
2036000	2038000	alright Flaco Jones
2038000	2040000	how was your gaming week? it was pretty good
2040000	2042000	I got to play a lot of games this week or not a lot
2042000	2044000	of games but a lot of two games
2044000	2046000	and the first one was
2046000	2048000	Unfinished Swan I kind of
2048000	2050000	bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because
2050000	2052000	I played the demo which is basically
2052000	2054000	just the first level and really liked
2054000	2056000	it and my wife kept pestering me
2056000	2058000	she's like why don't you just buy this game
2058000	2060000	we love playing the demo but then we have to stop
2060000	2062000	and it's like okay I'll buy the game
2062000	2064000	then I was mad because I missed out it was on sale
2064000	2066000	and I missed the sale by like a day and I was like
2066000	2068000	well I could have saved five
2068000	2070000	dollars she's like just buy it who cares
2070000	2072000	that's really rough when your wife is sitting
2072000	2074000	there saying buy the damn game
2074000	2076000	Flaco buy the game
2076000	2078000	just buy it I don't care if it's not on sale
2078000	2080000	like what kind of bizarro world do you live in
2080000	2082000	well I'm really glad I bought it because it was
2082000	2084000	an awesome game and we
2084000	2086000	ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday
2086000	2088000	we'd go back and forth I'd watch a little game
2088000	2090000	we'd play some more of that I tweeted about that
2090000	2092000	and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer
2092000	2094000	of the game so I didn't hashtag
2094000	2096000	anything but I guess you can
2096000	2098000	get stuff come up
2098000	2100000	this tweet deck
2100000	2102000	I think allows you to run one feed for
2102000	2104000	your Twitter and so but you can also
2104000	2106000	run a search and it'll pop right up there
2106000	2108000	like okay do you remember
2108000	2110000	when we had Ronnie from Big Brother
2110000	2112000	Eleven on Horde House a couple weeks ago
2112000	2114000	yeah uh okay so we
2114000	2116000	got him uh this
2116000	2118000	was really Shane and X for his doing I can't take credit
2118000	2120000	we got him addicted to Frog Fractions
2120000	2122000	but I sent which is that Flash
2122000	2124000	game and if you haven't heard of it it's hilarious
2124000	2126000	but Shane and X for won't shut up about that game so they were talking
2126000	2128000	about it on the show so I sent Ronnie
2128000	2130000	the link and I said something like
2130000	2132000	here's Frog Fractions you're welcome
2132000	2134000	I've ruined your life or whatever or something like that
2134000	2136000	and the guy who wrote
2136000	2138000	Frog Fractions favorited it
2138000	2140000	like I didn't hashtag it
2140000	2142000	I didn't include him he just randomly
2142000	2144000	sees the tweet I guess so it's
2144000	2146000	just funny like and I'm assuming
2146000	2148000	Metacritic found my other thing this
2148000	2150000	week in a similar fashion yeah probably
2150000	2152000	if you mention anybody they'll have they have someone who's
2152000	2154000	watching the Twitters and will exactly watch
2154000	2156000	what you say on Twitter
2156000	2158000	so yeah so I played that
2158000	2160000	and mainly I had gotten all the trophies
2160000	2162000	except for we still needed
2162000	2164000	the hardest trophy to get in the game
2164000	2166000	was to do the first level
2166000	2168000	only using three paintballs
2168000	2170000	and the point of the game is you splatter paint around
2170000	2172000	at least the first part of the game
2172000	2174000	you splatter paint around to see where you're going
2174000	2176000	and it's kind of like a puzzler
2176000	2178000	it's kind of built like a shooter though
2178000	2180000	you know cause you just have like you're just shooting paintballs
2180000	2182000	all over the place can you make dirty noises while you're doing it
2182000	2184000	cause the way you describe it where you're like shooting paint everywhere
2184000	2186000	you could make these really disgusting noises like
2186000	2188000	then
2188000	2190000	not quite like that it just sounds like a
2190000	2192000	paintball gun
2192000	2194000	so uh
2194000	2196000	we did that my wife kind of
2196000	2198000	talked me through oh okay what next time you play
2198000	2200000	you should try it there was something in that game that did
2200000	2202000	make a dirty sound I can't remember it now though
2202000	2204000	especially with the wife around not the kids so much
2204000	2206000	but with the wife around see they're always around when we play
2206000	2208000	the game that's because they love it so much
2208000	2210000	but yeah so we we we did that my wife
2210000	2212000	talked me through it she found a guide
2212000	2214000	online and it's like walk backwards
2214000	2216000	until you hit a wall walk left until you
2216000	2218000	hit a wall walk straight you'll hear
2218000	2220000	leaves cracking under your feet cause you
2220000	2222000	pretty much do level blind everything's
2222000	2224000	completely whited out so I
2224000	2226000	we got that trophy and that was our 100% for that
2226000	2228000	so that was really cool and the other game
2228000	2230000	I played of course was Ni No Kuni
2230000	2232000	I passed the 31 hour mark
2232000	2234000	last night and I played a little bit more today
2234000	2236000	did it go downhill after 15 hours?
2236000	2238000	no I have no idea what that
2238000	2240000	was about I don't know maybe my hours are different
2240000	2242000	than other people's because I've been doing everything
2242000	2244000	so I guess you can't really get
2244000	2246000	I don't know can you hit a wall
2246000	2248000	if you're just doing everything? I don't think so
2248000	2250000	I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to
2250000	2252000	speed do it really fast and then you kind of
2252000	2254000	hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough
2254000	2256000	maybe you haven't gone out there cause it is pretty
2256000	2258000	grindy though I found it it's not
2258000	2260000	super grindy for me because if I do the quest
2260000	2262000	in the process of doing the quest I fight enough battles
2262000	2264000	that I level up and it's not
2264000	2266000	really felt grindy to me but I
2266000	2268000	could see how people would think it's
2268000	2270000	too grindy but I don't mind that
2270000	2272000	I mean Secret of Mana is really really
2272000	2274000	grindy and there's no quest in that you just have to go out and
2274000	2276000	grind grind grind to get your party up
2276000	2278000	old school Final Fantasy games were very very
2278000	2280000	very grindy so I mean compared to
2280000	2282000	what we used to play it's not
2282000	2284000	grindy at all it's a walk in the park
2284000	2286000	I felt a lot like playing WoW you know doing these
2286000	2288000	quests and going out and finding
2288000	2290000	rare pets and things like that that's what I've
2290000	2292000	really been getting hooked into is
2292000	2294000	finding all these familiars I look at some online
2294000	2296000	like what's the best one like oh I want to get that
2296000	2298000	so I go find one and I get it and
2298000	2300000	you have to fight a while because the taming is kind of random
2300000	2302000	you can't just tame it you just have to wait for it
2302000	2304000	to kind of fall into your lap
2304000	2306000	I've gotten very lucky apparently
2306000	2308000	I spent an hour
2308000	2310000	trying to get uh what is that town
2310000	2312000	Alma Moon the one with the milk right
2312000	2314000	yeah were you trying to get the babanas the big
2314000	2316000	uh banana guys
2316000	2318000	I had to search for the banana guys
2318000	2320000	for an hour
2320000	2322000	an hour and then finally
2322000	2324000	I trapped one and then here's the hilarious
2324000	2326000	part right because for that quest you have to get the banana
2326000	2328000	and the turban monkey right yeah so
2328000	2330000	I go and I'm like all excited so
2330000	2332000	I go to turn in the banana and he's like oh you
2332000	2334000	got the bananas but you didn't get the turban monkey
2334000	2336000	well what I didn't realize is that the turban
2336000	2338000	monkey had evolved
2338000	2340000	because I had him in my party so the
2340000	2342000	turban monkey evolved so I had to go get another
2342000	2344000	one they don't evolve unless you give him a
2344000	2346000	treat well he was in my party
2346000	2348000	I wanted him to evolve I didn't realize that was
2348000	2350000	so adorable I'm gonna feed you
2350000	2352000	he was so hungry I wanted him
2352000	2354000	I don't evolve very quickly don't feed him after midnight
2354000	2356000	yeah I fed him after midnight and that was my mistake
2356000	2358000	yeah well that's pretty bad
2358000	2360000	I could have screamed
2360000	2362000	I could have screamed that's why I haven't played in a
2362000	2364000	week and a half I'm still punishing the game
2364000	2366000	well see when I do those quests I usually go
2366000	2368000	out and just do that because I consider
2368000	2370000	that kind of one of my grind sessions because I know those
2370000	2372000	I think it's only come up
2372000	2374000	one at a time in a different town but
2374000	2376000	and then that's like the first thing I'll do I'm like oh this is a
2376000	2378000	good time to grind because this
2378000	2380000	one quest requires a lot of grinding so I'll go out
2380000	2382000	and I'll go tame the three pets
2382000	2384000	and then I'll bring them back and I bring them back
2384000	2386000	right away so I didn't realize
2386000	2388000	I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway
2388000	2390000	but I didn't know that was something
2390000	2392000	that would mess it up so now it's good to know
2392000	2394000	you don't ever evolve your
2394000	2396000	I have only evolved the main ones that I use
2396000	2398000	I don't evolve a lot of them
2398000	2400000	I evolve them all
2400000	2402000	well if you hold on to them a little bit their stats get better
2402000	2404000	and the stats carry over
2404000	2406000	I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability
2406000	2408000	like I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not gonna miss
2408000	2410000	anything by evolving them but then I'll evolve them
2410000	2412000	yeah that's usually a good point to do
2412000	2414000	some of them I hold out longer
2414000	2416000	because some of them are more like late bloomers and stuff
2416000	2418000	so you can actually stretch them out a little bit longer
2418000	2420000	have more stats carry over
2420000	2422000	it's not a big deal if you're just gonna play through the game and beat it
2422000	2424000	but there's some end game stuff in there
2424000	2426000	some post game that there's certain pets that are
2426000	2428000	really strong and so if you just
2428000	2430000	kinda keep them in your party just let them level
2430000	2432000	they'll be like really powerful by the end of the game
2432000	2434000	and you do the colosseum stuff
2434000	2436000	like I already did the first round of the colosseum
2436000	2438000	and I beat that and it was really hard
2438000	2440000	but I got through that
2440000	2442000	the fencer puppy is really good right?
2442000	2444000	or is it a kitty?
2444000	2446000	yeah I have that he's pretty good
2446000	2448000	I still like them on might and I look online and people say
2448000	2450000	oh the mighty might's not that good
2450000	2452000	but I don't know I really like him
2452000	2454000	he's got a shield he defends really well
2454000	2456000	he blocks out of attacks I use him I still use him as my main guys tank
2456000	2458000	so
2458000	2460000	yeah I don't know people complain about him though
2460000	2462000	I guess but the cat is getting better
2462000	2464000	the cat's lower too
2464000	2466000	but I've metamorphosized both those guys
2466000	2468000	I just kinda have two metamorphosized pets
2468000	2470000	and I always use my third slot just as like a leveling slot
2470000	2472000	and I did just get the new Nino Cooney one
2472000	2474000	the one that's free on the Playstation network
2474000	2476000	I was just gonna ask you to talk quickly about the downloads
2476000	2478000	cause there's a free like what gold one
2478000	2480000	or something?
2480000	2482000	it's a little well mine was a little red dragon
2482000	2484000	and I named it Little Strazza
2484000	2486000	a little WoW reference cause it looks like
2486000	2488000	it reminds me of Alex Strazza in the Red Dragons
2488000	2490000	like it looks just like a red whelpling from WoW
2490000	2492000	so I named it Little Strazza and uh
2492000	2494000	yeah and it's a little red dragon
2494000	2496000	and I've not even used it in combat yet
2496000	2498000	but it's
2498000	2500000	I've heard it's pretty good and I looked online
2500000	2502000	most of the dragons are really good
2502000	2504000	so I'm gonna work on that one
2504000	2506000	you reminded me about names have you really just sat there
2506000	2508000	and read some of the suggested names
2508000	2510000	cause every Pokemon that you can pick in the game
2510000	2512000	has like four suggested names
2512000	2514000	and some of them are so fucking funny
2514000	2516000	like the Turban Monkey thing
2516000	2518000	uh one of the suggested names was Turbanula
2518000	2520000	I died
2520000	2522000	I died some of them are so
2522000	2524000	funny I need to look at that now
2524000	2526000	I look at the first one and I always change it
2526000	2528000	always cycle through cause there's four for each one
2528000	2530000	well I named him Toad Bandit cause he looked kinda like
2530000	2532000	Toad but with a bandit mask on
2532000	2534000	so you're Toad Bandit
2534000	2536000	ok so though I have to ask this
2536000	2538000	cause this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones
2538000	2540000	is it when you rename them they keep that name
2540000	2542000	like forever through all of their evolutions
2542000	2544000	but does it still let you know what
2544000	2546000	they originally are? you know he's talking
2546000	2548000	Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon right?
2548000	2550000	I'm sorry I was thinking of Pokemon
2550000	2552000	it's really a lot
2552000	2554000	it's pretty much the same fucking thing
2554000	2556000	I never played Pokemon but now I'm kinda interested cause I'm like
2556000	2558000	this game's really fun maybe I would like Pokemon cause I like
2558000	2560000	getting my familiars I like feeding them
2560000	2562000	the combat is the totally different part
2562000	2564000	I'm sorry I had looked down for a moment
2564000	2566000	and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like
2566000	2568000	Pokemon?
2568000	2570000	to answer your question even though you didn't ask about this
2570000	2572000	you can rename them
2572000	2574000	but it will say what the name of their
2574000	2576000	kind of general familiar is
2576000	2578000	so if you need to look something up on that you can
2578000	2580000	for anyone else who's interested in that
2580000	2582000	and that was my gaming week
2582000	2584000	Ni No Kuni lots of it

2602000	2604000	should be fun
2604000	2606000	alright let's move into some gaming
2606000	2608000	news tonight and talk about what's
2608000	2610000	going on in the world of gaming some big news today right
2610000	2612000	Logie? Yeah so today Bungie
2612000	2614000	revealed Destiny
2614000	2616000	and they have like a little kind of behind
2616000	2618000	the scenes development video that showed
2618000	2620000	actual I'm pretty
2620000	2622000	sure no actual gameplay
2622000	2624000	or if there was it was so insignificant
2624000	2626000	that I didn't remember
2626000	2628000	but basically
2628000	2630000	Destiny is this
2630000	2632000	always on persistent
2632000	2634000	kind of first person
2634000	2636000	shooter adventure
2636000	2638000	I guess where you
2638000	2640000	take on these guardians
2640000	2642000	of kind of one of the last
2642000	2644000	civilizations
2644000	2646000	in the solar system
2646000	2648000	and you kind of venture out to
2648000	2650000	different planets and stuff like that and fight
2650000	2652000	aliens and
2652000	2654000	all sorts of stuff so it's kind of I think
2654000	2656000	what you know originally the description was
2656000	2658000	kind of like a single player co-op
2658000	2660000	and you know
2660000	2662000	multiplayer game all mixed together
2662000	2664000	all at once
2664000	2666000	it should be interesting
2666000	2668000	I'm not sure exactly how
2668000	2670000	how they're going to how you're going to
2670000	2672000	interact with their people it was going to be like kind of an emo
2672000	2674000	this reminded me it sounded a lot like
2674000	2676000	fantasy star I guess
2676000	2678000	you know where as that was
2678000	2680000	you know fantasy star online
2680000	2682000	that's a good way of putting it that is
2682000	2684000	kind of what it sounds like where it's like you have the
2684000	2686000	central hub type of thing but you can go out with
2686000	2688000	friends and I guess
2688000	2690000	they were showing I actually did watch one of
2690000	2692000	the four minute videos they put out where
2692000	2694000	they showed how the iPhone I'm assuming
2694000	2696000	Android as well would integrate with it where you could like
2696000	2698000	send messages like let's meet up on Venus
2698000	2700000	or something like that I don't know
2700000	2702000	and you can let's meet up on Uranus
2702000	2704000	hahaha
2704000	2706000	let's do some
2706000	2708000	grinding on Uranus dark side of Uranus
2708000	2710000	alright anyways
2710000	2712000	yeah so it
2712000	2714000	looks neat I mean definitely
2714000	2716000	a huge franchise
2716000	2718000	they've got like a ten year plan with it
2718000	2720000	and they're just gonna
2720000	2722000	wait wait wait ten year plan
2722000	2724000	the game announced for PlayStation
2724000	2726000	3 and Xbox 360 right?
2726000	2728000	I think it's going to be probably
2728000	2730000	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3
2730000	2732000	and then probably whatever next gen consoles also
2732000	2734000	so their ten year plan
2734000	2736000	is how to get you to buy it three times
2736000	2738000	is that really what the ten year plan consists of?
2738000	2740000	it's got to be right?
2740000	2742000	I'm not sure
2742000	2744000	yeah I think so because they're going to get you
2744000	2746000	on the PlayStation 3 and 360 where the game
2746000	2748000	comes out which it's assuming
2748000	2750000	the game comes out this holiday season
2750000	2752000	Destiny is going to be going up against
2752000	2754000	these new consoles which
2754000	2756000	if Destiny is as ambitious as they say
2756000	2758000	I mean go back to our last weeks show
2758000	2760000	about how
2760000	2762000	much these new consoles
2762000	2764000	really need to be here right now and if people
2764000	2766000	are going to adopt them
2766000	2768000	I would imagine there's versions of
2768000	2770000	Destiny in development for these
2770000	2772000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox
2772000	2774000	next to the world
2774000	2776000	but it's definitely not going to be just next gen
2776000	2778000	they can't
2778000	2780000	Activision is smart enough to know
2780000	2782000	we're not going to gamble on
2782000	2784000	next gen right away
2784000	2786000	they're going to do it like okay we're going to put out
2786000	2788000	the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen
2788000	2790000	stuff at the same time that way if you want the next gen
2790000	2792000	version of the game you will have it
2792000	2794000	if you want a current gen version of the game you can have that too
2794000	2796000	because they know that there's a huge
2796000	2798000	install base already why cut out
2798000	2800000	all that money?
2800000	2802000	and none for Wii U buy
2803000	2805000	that's hard to say with Activision
2805000	2807000	I mean because they've got
2807000	2809000	they have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit
2809000	2811000	and they even have a few games coming out although
2812000	2814000	I mean out in the hot excited I began
2814000	2816000	about like re-releasing
2816000	2818000	the amazing Spiderman
2818000	2820000	that was the Xbox 360 version
2820000	2822000	now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that
2822000	2824000	they have Wii U version 4
2824000	2826000	The Walking Dead
2826000	2828000	and even though they did Call of Duty
2828000	2830000	and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U
2830000	2832000	they're still supporting the Wii U
2832000	2834000	actually Activision is a pretty strong supporter
2834000	2836000	of the Wii U right now
2836000	2838000	maybe followed up by
2838000	2840000	Ubisoft although
2840000	2842000	you know a lot of their games
2842000	2844000	aren't coming to the Wii U
2844000	2846000	I would say
2846000	2848000	I would see a Wii U version of this coming out
2848000	2850000	I mean especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version
2850000	2852000	why not they would work
2852000	2854000	did you find the lack of PC interesting?
2854000	2856000	because I sure did
2856000	2858000	yeah a little bit
2858000	2860000	I mean the PC is the thing that could
2860000	2862000	evolve over those 10 years
2862000	2864000	and the PC is the one thing that will still be here
2864000	2866000	you know us people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes
2866000	2868000	but this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it
2868000	2870000	I mean who's to say
2870000	2872000	that there's not going to be a PC version for it
2872000	2874000	this is just kind of like
2874000	2876000	hey we're announcing this thing
2876000	2878000	really say which consoles it's going to be on
2878000	2880000	so they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC
2880000	2882000	it's just
2882000	2884000	I don't know
2884000	2886000	what did you think about all this?
2886000	2888000	what do you think?
2888000	2890000	because I have an opinion that others might not agree with
2890000	2892000	but what do you think Loki?
2892000	2894000	but I don't know really much about it yet
2894000	2896000	I mean I'm not going to be like oh my god Bungie made it
2896000	2898000	I got to go buy it
2898000	2900000	I didn't really buy Halo
2900000	2902000	I bought Halo 3
2902000	2904000	that was the only Halo game I ever owned
2904000	2906000	and I was just kind of like okay this is hard
2906000	2908000	I mean it's just not like
2908000	2910000	I don't lose my shit over Bungie games
2910000	2912000	I'm going to be blunt
2912000	2914000	a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass
2914000	2916000	this whole video I watched
2916000	2918000	this whole pomp and circumstance
2918000	2920000	this is our big ambition
2920000	2922000	and I really felt like
2922000	2924000	half that video was like
2924000	2926000	well you know we made Halo
2926000	2928000	and we got to follow up to that and Halo was this
2928000	2930000	and we've poured all our company into this
2930000	2932000	since Halo and Halo Halo Halo Halo
2932000	2934000	like they had to name check Halo
2934000	2936000	but here's the thing that gets me about that
2936000	2938000	Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong
2938000	2940000	Halo 2, one of the greatest
2940000	2942000	video games ever made
2942000	2944000	and here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison
2944000	2946000	is that Halo 4
2946000	2948000	which Bungie didn't do
2948000	2950000	was better than Halo 3
2950000	2952000	yes
2952000	2954000	absolutely in many ways was better than Halo 3
2954000	2956000	better than Halo 2
2956000	2958000	I don't know
2958000	2960000	gaming was a lot different with all those years in between
2960000	2962000	and Halo 2 really pushed so many things
2962000	2964000	forward in a different way
2964000	2966000	but you know Halo 4 they didn't have anything to do with
2966000	2968000	and it was a better game than what they did
2968000	2970000	at the end of the run
2970000	2972000	I'm not the only one thinking it okay
2972000	2974000	so when they talk about all this
2974000	2976000	Destiny stuff and like you know how much
2976000	2978000	of their Halo influence and all this has to do
2978000	2980000	I'm kind of like
2980000	2982000	now are they saying that they had
2982000	2984000	one foot out the door when ODST
2984000	2986000	and all this stuff was being done and they were already
2986000	2988000	working on Destiny or what
2988000	2990000	what stock am I putting into this
2990000	2992000	because really I felt like all we heard
2992000	2994000	about today was an idea
2994000	2996000	and although some of it's interesting like the iPhone
2996000	2998000	integration and
2999000	3001000	you know what this felt like?
3001000	3003000	this felt like a Kickstarter video
3003000	3005000	like at the very end
3005000	3007000	at the very end they're gonna like
3007000	3009000	okay and now we need you to back this
3009000	3011000	pre-order it we need you to go pre-order it
3011000	3013000	and back the game yes
3013000	3015000	that is a great comparison
3015000	3017000	that is really what it felt like
3017000	3019000	it felt like somebody's Kickstarter video
3019000	3021000	and it's like
3021000	3023000	and there was very little gameplay in it
3023000	3025000	there was some gameplay
3025000	3027000	I sort of remember
3027000	3029000	the gameplay I saw was
3029000	3031000	nothing new
3031000	3033000	nothing new but granted it was three seconds
3033000	3035000	of gameplay but I looked at it and went
3035000	3037000	okay so you can co-op with your friends
3037000	3039000	and maybe they're gonna be putting like
3039000	3041000	a warlock type class and a hunter class
3041000	3043000	and a first person shooter
3043000	3045000	in more of a mass effect way than a
3045000	3047000	Diablo way but I'm still like
3047000	3049000	I mean I'm not convinced
3049000	3051000	that this is like the OMG
3051000	3053000	rule breaking
3053000	3055000	game that's gonna have a ten year cycle
3055000	3057000	well here's the thing I'm wondering though
3057000	3059000	cause if you have this coming out and this is supposed to be
3059000	3061000	like a first person shooter let's just say
3061000	3063000	where are they gonna put this as far as in
3063000	3065000	comparison to Call of Duty I mean if it's gonna
3065000	3067000	release with a next gen console
3067000	3069000	or something like that or around that time
3069000	3071000	I mean you're gonna
3071000	3073000	it's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter
3073000	3075000	you're gonna have Grand Theft Auto in September
3075000	3077000	you're gonna have some massive games in
3077000	3079000	November you're gonna have another Call of Duty
3079000	3081000	game you're gonna have
3081000	3083000	it's just
3083000	3085000	where are they gonna put a game of this
3085000	3087000	size I guess
3087000	3089000	I don't know it's Activision
3089000	3091000	it's gonna be weird to see them
3091000	3093000	splitting their resources as far
3093000	3095000	as marketing goes between Destiny
3095000	3097000	and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kinda like
3097000	3099000	well Call of Duty's just not quite
3099000	3101000	you know what it used to be we're just gonna
3101000	3103000	kinda back burner that
3103000	3105000	a little bit and just kinda release something
3105000	3107000	that's a slight upgrade and people will buy
3107000	3109000	it and then we'll focus all of our
3109000	3111000	money into this because this is our
3111000	3113000	10 year deal thing
3113000	3115000	I'm looking
3115000	3117000	at some comments in our chat room at
3117000	3119000	live.vognetwork.com code man says
3119000	3121000	this is the first I've heard of this game is that
3121000	3123000	bad?
3123000	3125000	No because when you really need to hear about
3125000	3127000	the game is you know just before the game comes out
3127000	3129000	those week one sales but this is
3129000	3131000	their efforts to get more people talking
3131000	3133000	about it success here we are and now you've
3133000	3135000	been educated on it so here's the thing too
3135000	3137000	why announce it now it's like a really weird
3137000	3139000	time to announce it I mean why not
3139000	3141000	it's an empty floor in Telly 3
3141000	3143000	why is Sony doing a big announcement next week
3143000	3145000	there's not a lot of other stuff
3145000	3147000	video game things for people to be writing about
3147000	3149000	Sony I think needs something you know because
3149000	3151000	right now you know they don't have any
3151000	3153000	Playstation I mean they kind of announced
3153000	3155000	their slate of Playstation 3 titles with
3155000	3157000	The Last of Us and
3157000	3159000	then they've got you know
3159000	3161000	a couple games that I don't think a lot of
3161000	3163000	people care about like Puppeteer
3163000	3165000	and was it the
3165000	3167000	Beyond
3167000	3169000	Beyond Two Souls which Beyond Two Souls
3169000	3171000	looks alright but I mean let's be honest that's not going to be
3171000	3173000	like this huge it's
3173000	3175000	it's still kind of niche I mean
3175000	3177000	the genre and
3177000	3179000	then their Puppeteer game which I got to be honest
3179000	3181000	their kind of
3181000	3183000	kids' titles aren't doing very well or the
3183000	3185000	children's titles I guess or younger
3185000	3187000	skewed titles
3187000	3189000	so I think they have to
3189000	3191000	really come out with you know
3191000	3193000	here's what our game plan is you guys
3193000	3195000	you know stick with us you know especially
3195000	3197000	with the Vita because holy crap
3197000	3199000	Vita there's nothing really announced other than
3199000	3201000	we know there's that new game from
3201000	3203000	Media Molecule there's going to be
3203000	3205000	the Killzone shooter game and
3205000	3207000	and what? There could
3207000	3209000	be some type of ace in the hole
3209000	3211000	with the next Playstation we don't know how
3211000	3213000	the next Playstation will interface with the Vita
3213000	3215000	could it do a Wii U type of thing
3215000	3217000	because that apparently now everybody feels like they have to call you
3217000	3219000	you know because I know
3219000	3221000	we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even
3221000	3223000	a little bit later in the show but like
3223000	3225000	my bar for the Playstation 4
3225000	3227000	right now is set so fucking low
3227000	3229000	that's good though that's a good place
3229000	3231000	for Sony to be in isn't it?
3231000	3233000	don't they want I mean if the bar is low that's
3233000	3235000	actually good news yeah
3235000	3237000	because they could really kick your ass
3237000	3239000	with these expectations
3239000	3241000	but here's the thing I'm setting the bar so low
3241000	3243000	because I don't think they're going to hit that even
3243000	3245000	I mean it's just I don't expect anything
3245000	3247000	from them I just I'm expecting to be
3247000	3249000	kind of like
3249000	3251000	huh okay cool
3251000	3253000	well here's the other thing too is
3253000	3255000	remember guys it's February
3255000	3257000	and the console won't be out until
3257000	3259000	November I'm sure is a safe bet if it's not
3259000	3261000	delayed right
3261000	3263000	so you know
3263000	3265000	don't expect them to say a lot
3265000	3267000	you know maybe we'll get some pictures
3267000	3269000	maybe we'll see a couple
3269000	3271000	of the games but don't expect
3271000	3273000	price don't expect release
3273000	3275000	date don't expect all the bells and whistles
3275000	3277000	expect an idea
3277000	3279000	of what Sony thinks the next
3279000	3281000	generation of gaming is please God
3281000	3283000	do not be Facebook
3283000	3285000	just don't I don't know
3285000	3287000	social game I really
3287000	3289000	just I'm going to get irritated
3289000	3291000	if I hear that word too much at the same time
3291000	3293000	hmm I kind of hope
3293000	3295000	I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need
3295000	3297000	some more memes seriously
3297000	3299000	we need more
3299000	3301000	well this is why it's a pre-recorded thing
3301000	3303000	Namco Namco
3303000	3305000	I bet I'm expecting a Ridge Racer
3305000	3307000	okay I'm expecting a Ridge Racer
3307000	3309000	game it's been a while okay
3309000	3311000	I need a new Ridge Racer game
3311000	3313000	alright I'm going to move on with news from a company
3313000	3315000	we always expect great things from
3315000	3317000	which had a surprising announcement this week
3317000	3319000	that they actually let some people go
3319000	3321000	it's Valve
3321000	3323000	yeah apparently up to 25
3323000	3325000	people were affected by these changes
3325000	3327000	now a lot of this is very vague
3327000	3329000	but some of this came from a tweet
3329000	3331000	hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet
3331000	3333000	that said yep got fired today time
3333000	3335000	for new exciting projects
3335000	3337000	so that was somebody
3337000	3339000	at Valve and was working on hardware
3339000	3341000	and the
3341000	3343000	internet did some more research and found out
3343000	3345000	that part of what she had been working on was living room
3345000	3347000	PC controllers
3347000	3349000	also affected
3349000	3351000	thanks to internet research
3351000	3353000	director of business development Jason
3353000	3355000	Holtman had left the company
3355000	3357000	some employee
3357000	3359000	pages on Valve's site actually changed
3359000	3361000	pretty significantly
3361000	3363000	very interesting
3363000	3365000	renewal did end up commenting on this to
3365000	3367000	Engadgett
3389000	3391000	so
3391000	3393000	it could have nothing to do with
3393000	3395000	layoffs maybe something
3395000	3397000	it could be a personnel issue although
3397000	3399000	that's a hell of a
3399000	3401000	speculation
3401000	3403000	let's just say that he was working on
3403000	3405000	controllers
3405000	3407000	I don't think they really need to
3407000	3409000	work on a controller because it's already
3409000	3411000	kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360
3411000	3413000	controller
3413000	3415000	why do we need another controller?
3415000	3417000	Steambox would come with its own controller
3417000	3419000	yeah but whatever
3419000	3421000	just use another third party controller
3421000	3423000	I don't think they really need to
3423000	3425000	make another controller
3425000	3427000	just use an existing controller
3427000	3429000	support any controller
3429000	3431000	here's the other thing
3431000	3433000	as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow
3433000	3435000	of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes
3435000	3437000	happen at really weird times for reasons
3437000	3439000	because the project is done
3439000	3441000	and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one
3441000	3443000	to another and it's not like the business is always
3443000	3445000	constant there's not projects that
3445000	3447000	go on forever unless
3447000	3449000	maybe Bungie is feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever
3449000	3451000	but if Destiny doesn't do very well
3451000	3453000	oh if that flops
3453000	3455000	that will hose the whole
3455000	3457000	company but anyway that's neither here nor there
3459000	3461000	projects start and projects end
3461000	3463000	and if there's not a new project to go to when
3463000	3465000	one project ends people are let go
3465000	3467000	it sucks but it happens that's the game
3467000	3469000	industry so
3469000	3471000	it's just weird to hear it coming from
3471000	3473000	Valve because it's like dude shouldn't he
3473000	3475000	be working on Half Life 3?
3476000	3478000	but who knows what they have up their sleeve
3478000	3480000	oh no there could be no Half Life 3
3480000	3482000	we will be waiting forever
3482000	3484000	I still if you want to sell
3484000	3486000	a million of those Steam Boxes
3486000	3488000	just announce two exclusives
3488000	3490000	announce one exclusive
3490000	3492000	anything that ends in 3
3492000	3494000	coming out of Valve I'm talking
3494000	3496000	Half Life 3, Portal 3
3496000	3498000	Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3
3498000	3500000	any of those gets the lead
3500000	3502000	on the Steam Box
3502000	3504000	Steam Box will sell more than we do
3505000	3507000	Half Life 2, Episode 3
3507000	3509000	Half Life 3, Portal 3
3509000	3511000	Team Fortress 3 and
3511000	3513000	you'll outsell Wii U in like a day
3513000	3515000	and maybe like
3515000	3517000	Garry's Mod X3 I don't know
3517000	3519000	alright let's move on
3519000	3521000	Dark Saga
3521000	3523000	how about something that's
3523000	3525000	a little less frustrating
3525000	3527000	as soon as I can get a stupid
3527000	3529000	iPad to work
3529000	3531000	ok so
3531000	3533000	there have been some leaks
3533000	3535000	and there's people are kind of
3535000	3537000	oh ok you know
3537000	3539000	taking it a little bit in stride
3539000	3541000	but there is a few issues
3541000	3543000	that are coming out with the
3543000	3545000	DualShock 4 release image
3545000	3547000	who all here has seen it
3547000	3549000	so I don't
3549000	3551000	ok
3551000	3553000	well the controller itself
3553000	3555000	and the photo by the way
3555000	3557000	also shows that that might be a dev kit
3557000	3559000	for the Orbis dev kit
3559000	3561000	but they're saying that
3561000	3563000	you know just on the
3563000	3565000	items pointed out on the controller
3565000	3567000	itself is that there's the two point multi
3567000	3569000	touch pad
3569000	3571000	the move tracking light on the controller
3571000	3573000	itself
3573000	3575000	the loudspeaker and a headphone
3575000	3577000	socket and then they're talking
3577000	3579000	about what they're seeing on the
3579000	3581000	what they're I'm guessing to be the
3581000	3583000	Orbis dev kit would be
3583000	3585000	a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive
3587000	3589000	two USB 3.0
3589000	3591000	slots and
3591000	3593000	just a number of other things
3593000	3595000	they're basically saying that
3595000	3597000	it's
3597000	3599000	going to be some pretty
3599000	3601000	hardcore material and they have
3601000	3603000	a lot of high hopes for the controller
3603000	3605000	now honestly I think that that might be
3605000	3607000	a little too much in the controller I'm actually wondering
3607000	3609000	how much it's going to weigh
3609000	3611000	and I don't think it's going to come out with
3611000	3613000	all of the things that they're trying to
3613000	3615000	pump into it but it's interesting
3615000	3617000	it does raise some questions
3617000	3619000	I think it's actually it's not multi
3619000	3621000	touch on that touch pad it's just
3621000	3623000	single and there's the rear touch pad
3623000	3625000	from the Vita isn't it?
3625000	3627000	the rear one is multi touch
3627000	3629000	you can pinch and stuff like that
3629000	3631000	but what's kind of different
3631000	3633000	about it though is they're saying that it's
3633000	3635000	basically going to be used for interfaces and basic
3635000	3637000	stuff I don't even know why you need it to be
3637000	3639000	honest and then
3639000	3641000	of course they are reshaping the
3641000	3643000	trigger buttons on there they say
3643000	3645000	they're supposed to be a little bit more springy like the
3645000	3647000	360 stuff
3647000	3649000	surely you've all seen the gif of where
3649000	3651000	the little move light is actually a
3651000	3653000	siren and then the little screen is flashing
3653000	3655000	used game, used game, used game
3655000	3657000	that's the purpose of the
3657000	3659000	screen
3659000	3661000	the little loud speaker
3661000	3663000	so Popo can come get you
3663000	3665000	it looks like the analog sticks they've got a little
3665000	3667000	difference on the top of it it's kind of
3667000	3669000	got a little bit of lip on the edge of
3669000	3671000	the actual sticks themselves
3671000	3673000	so that your thumbs don't fall off of them
3673000	3675000	like they do on the PS3 ones
3675000	3677000	the one thing that they're saying with this one
3677000	3679000	is actually that they were
3679000	3681000	saying that there wasn't a corresponding
3681000	3683000	touch on the
3683000	3685000	back this is on the front of the controller
3685000	3687000	is where the touch is showing
3687000	3689000	well that's good because the rear touch
3689000	3691000	on the Vita
3691000	3693000	especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller
3693000	3695000	that would just be irritating
3695000	3697000	and then the other things there's a
3697000	3699000	share button on there that was spotted
3699000	3701000	in the upper left
3701000	3703000	hand corner of the touch pad area
3703000	3705000	that actual speaker spot
3705000	3707000	they're saying might actually be a microphone
3707000	3709000	kind of similar
3709000	3711000	to what's on the Vita I guess
3711000	3713000	or could it maybe pick
3713000	3715000	finally it picks up your voice
3715000	3717000	like there's a built in cross voice chat
3717000	3719000	thing on Playstation like there should have been all along
3719000	3721000	it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it
3721000	3723000	had like a built in headset
3723000	3725000	in there where you could put your headphones plugged in
3725000	3727000	wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your
3727000	3729000	opponent?
3729000	3731000	I think it's one goldmine
3731000	3733000	that we use missing
3733000	3735000	we got this virtual console and all this stuff
3735000	3737000	why can't I play games online
3737000	3739000	with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?
3739000	3741000	the problem though is I don't think that would work
3741000	3743000	because if you think about it there's no camera
3743000	3745000	on the actual controller itself
3745000	3747000	that you can see
3747000	3749000	no I don't think there's actually a camera
3749000	3751000	you would see a camera on that
3751000	3753000	I mean I don't think
3753000	3755000	here's what I want to know
3755000	3757000	so they've got that little bar at the end that's basically
3757000	3759000	supposed to be like the move stuff
3759000	3761000	how the fuck are you supposed to do that
3761000	3763000	as like a move controller
3763000	3765000	I mean it doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable
3765000	3767000	at all
3767000	3769000	because I remember you can use the dual shock
3769000	3771000	3 for the kind of
3771000	3773000	nunchuck portion if you will
3773000	3775000	I bet there's a way you grip it sideways
3775000	3777000	you can probably grip it sideways
3777000	3779000	and like use your fist
3779000	3781000	I understand that you could probably grip it sideways
3781000	3783000	but your fingers would probably naturally
3783000	3785000	your fingers would want to go over that light
3785000	3787000	because you'd be holding on to the middle of it
3787000	3789000	and your hand's going to want to go over
3789000	3791000	that sensor in the middle
3791000	3793000	I just don't think that's a good design
3793000	3795000	either that or they're going to have a separate
3795000	3797000	move related something
3797000	3799000	and this is going to be more for just like
3799000	3801000	a gestural almost like the 6 axis
3801000	3803000	yeah I'm wondering if it's not
3803000	3805000	I think it's going to be more like that
3805000	3807000	because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move
3807000	3809000	so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve
3809000	3811000	6 axis in a way
3811000	3813000	maybe instead of
3813000	3815000	you need to remember very important
3815000	3817000	this is a prototype big word
3817000	3819000	there this will change
3819000	3821000	this is not what the controller is going to look like
3821000	3823000	so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that
3823000	3825000	maybe it could be grippy
3825000	3827000	I'm making shit up
3827000	3829000	there could be other things we don't see on it now
3829000	3831000	these things can and will change
3831000	3833000	they always always do so that's not
3833000	3835000	the final look of that controller
3835000	3837000	that'll be interesting I still don't understand what they're
3837000	3839000	going to use that touchpad for
3839000	3841000	the share button idea I guess that's kind of neat
3841000	3843000	but once again that also kind of scares me
3843000	3845000	because that gets in the whole social
3845000	3847000	gameplay stuff you know where
3847000	3849000	oh I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook
3849000	3851000	you guys can watch me
3851000	3853000	beat up this hooker
3853000	3855000	well you're getting the Ouya aren't you?
3855000	3857000	doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?
3857000	3859000	so maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works
3859000	3861000	the touchpad on the front of the Ouya I believe
3861000	3863000	is multi-touch and I think that's meant for playing
3863000	3865000	like other
3865000	3867000	Android games that would not use
3867000	3869000	the controller like you could actually use that
3869000	3871000	to play
3871000	3873000	Angry Birds or something like that
3873000	3875000	cause I'm like how do you
3875000	3877000	translate on a tiny little screen
3877000	3879000	what's going to happen on the
3879000	3881000	that is tough yeah cause you wouldn't
3881000	3883000	it's not as easy as looking at a touch screen
3883000	3885000	where okay I can see where my finger is
3885000	3887000	I know where I'm hitting but you know
3887000	3889000	having it translate
3889000	3891000	although you say that but then you know
3891000	3893000	we all use touchpads so
3893000	3895000	we seem to figure out a way around that
3895000	3897000	going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3897000	3899000	uh Black Wolf
3899000	3901000	host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show
3901000	3903000	name checks Uno in a comment to me
3903000	3905000	and I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking
3905000	3907000	about have a video camera so other people can watch
3907000	3909000	I mean Uno was a huge selling game
3909000	3911000	I don't know if it was because of the camera future
3911000	3913000	well but I mean cause the game's
3913000	3915000	years old it was a huge seller
3915000	3917000	no it was five bucks
3917000	3919000	five or ten yeah
3919000	3921000	you got the camera
3921000	3923000	the camera upgrade was free it didn't originally
3923000	3925000	support the camera cause the camera wasn't out yet
3925000	3927000	but then when the little vision cam came out
3927000	3929000	they did a free upgrade for it
3929000	3931000	let's see what else
3931000	3933000	there was a comment from whatupG
3933000	3935000	Sony just show what they want
3935000	3937000	the PS4 controller to be
3937000	3939000	and then change big time like the boomerang did
3939000	3941000	boomerang is an excellent example
3941000	3943000	of how things can and will change
3943000	3945000	or a perfect example
3945000	3947000	the zapper controller
3947000	3949000	that they showed at E3
3949000	3951000	for the Wii that looked fucking amazing
3951000	3953000	and then they put out a piece of plastic shit
3953000	3955000	so works in reverse too
3957000	3959000	it could
3959000	3961000	alright let's move on with more news
3961000	3963000	speaking of Nintendo
3963000	3965000	they had some announcements
3965000	3967000	and it's very exciting if you're
3967000	3969000	a 3DS owner
3969000	3971000	lots of news for you guys including game announcements
3971000	3973000	they announced a brand new Mario
3973000	3975000	and Luigi Dream Team
3975000	3977000	kind of a new game in that franchise
3977000	3979000	also
3979000	3981000	that's supposed to be coming out
3981000	3983000	for the 3DS
3983000	3985000	I don't think it was
3985000	3987000	they have a special deal now
3987000	3989000	if you haven't bought a 3DS
3989000	3991000	if you buy the 3DS
3991000	3993000	XL and Luigi's Mansion
3993000	3995000	or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
3995000	3997000	you get a free game
3997000	3999000	including Super Mario 3D Land
3999000	4001000	or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask
4001000	4003000	and Star Fox 64 3D
4003000	4005000	and some other games you probably don't want
4007000	4009000	Mario Golf
4009000	4011000	World T coming to the 3DS
4011000	4013000	this summer
4013000	4015000	so that's kind of exciting
4015000	4017000	there's a new Mario game
4017000	4019000	Mario and Donkey Kong game
4019000	4021000	more puzzle stuff, that's going to be coming to the 3DS
4021000	4023000	eShop as well as a new
4023000	4025000	Dylan's Rolling Western
4025000	4027000	The Last Ranger
4027000	4029000	that's going to be coming out on March 11th
4029000	4031000	which actually that's supposed to be
4031000	4033000	kind of a pretty cool game as well
4035000	4037000	The Harmony Knight
4037000	4039000	The Harmony Knight and Curseploosh
4039000	4041000	Curseploosh is a really weird premise
4041000	4043000	Have you ever wondered what it's like
4043000	4045000	to be a rock thrown down a well?
4045000	4047000	No
4047000	4049000	Well now you can
4049000	4051000	Doomplague in chat says was Fire Emblem on that list
4051000	4053000	No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem
4053000	4055000	at the Nintendo Direct
4055000	4057000	Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out
4057000	4059000	I think that just came out
4059000	4061000	Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D
4061000	4063000	for the 3DS
4063000	4065000	coming out
4065000	4067000	And last but not least, the most important news
4067000	4069000	June 9th, North America
4069000	4071000	June 14th in Europe
4071000	4073000	Animal Crossing New Leaf
4073000	4075000	coming out
4075000	4077000	The better question is
4077000	4079000	though, what did they have for the Wii U?
4079000	4081000	And
4081000	4083000	not a whole lot actually
4083000	4085000	The Wii U, couple announcements
4085000	4087000	One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of
4087000	4089000	DLC that's going to be coming out for
4089000	4091000	New Super Mario Brothers U
4091000	4093000	So that'll be coming out later on
4093000	4095000	Oh, I'm sorry
4095000	4097000	Yeah, it's alright, you're biting some of my stories
4097000	4099000	I do have other stuff on Wii U
4099000	4101000	Just one little thing
4101000	4103000	Honestly, I checked it out this week
4103000	4105000	and it's not really that big a deal
4105000	4107000	It's Wii Street U
4107000	4109000	which is the Google enhanced thing
4109000	4111000	It's basically Google Maps for your Wii U
4111000	4113000	You know what?
4113000	4115000	It's neat because it's something different
4115000	4117000	you can't really get anywhere else
4117000	4119000	and it is pretty smooth
4119000	4121000	It's a pretty smooth experience
4121000	4123000	How is Google Maps on the Vita?
4123000	4125000	Because of the whole fact it's got the gyroscope
4125000	4127000	and you can kind of look around
4127000	4129000	I'll have to show it on the Vita?
4129000	4131000	I think you just get the normal maps
4131000	4133000	I don't know if it does the whole sensor
4133000	4135000	Does it? Or even with phones
4135000	4137000	I think you can do that
4137000	4139000	Not on Google Earth on iPhone
4139000	4141000	No, this operates very differently
4141000	4143000	and it's all set up so that
4143000	4145000	there's places already bookmarked
4145000	4147000	to go take a look at and stuff
4147000	4149000	The interface is interesting
4149000	4151000	I mean, it's neat
4151000	4153000	It's the type of thing you would see as a demo
4153000	4155000	but it's not exactly
4155000	4157000	going to sell any systems or make people
4157000	4159000	feel like, ooh, there's all this new value in my system
4159000	4161000	I like how they said free for a limited amount
4161000	4163000	of time, like someone's really
4163000	4165000	going to buy this one
4165000	4167000	I don't know if I would have paid money for it
4167000	4169000	unless it was really, really cheap
4169000	4171000	So, I don't know
4171000	4173000	The Super Luigi DLC looks
4173000	4175000	interesting though because it sounds like they're talking about
4175000	4177000	basically just redoing the whole game almost
4177000	4179000	and they're going to redo all the levels and everything
4179000	4181000	Yeah, that's a perfect way of putting out another
4181000	4183000	new Super Mario Brothers game
4183000	4185000	without actually putting out another new Super Mario Brothers game
4185000	4187000	It's done with DLC
4187000	4189000	You know what though? I'm okay with that
4189000	4191000	because you're talking about $20 DLC versus $60 game
4191000	4193000	We don't know what the price is on that
4193000	4195000	Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more
4195000	4197000	I guess we'll see
4197000	4199000	You should be careful what I say
4199000	4201000	but I can't imagine it's going to be as much
4201000	4203000	as you think it is
4203000	4205000	Also, on the Wii U
4205000	4207000	a new Miiverse community
4207000	4209000	for Zelda
4209000	4211000	I actually
4211000	4213000	watched the Nintendo Direct and they did
4213000	4215000	kind of make a little bit of a deal about this
4215000	4217000	where they're like, it's the first Miiverse
4217000	4219000	community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk
4219000	4221000	about Zelda and you know it's just going to be
4221000	4223000	a bunch of people with a really creative artwork
4223000	4225000	and so forth
4225000	4227000	which I guess it's neat but it's weird to me
4227000	4229000	that this is a
4229000	4231000	big deal
4231000	4233000	Oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have
4233000	4235000	a game behind it, what a fucking concept
4235000	4237000	That's stupid, and the other thing too
4237000	4239000	is we love your amazing artwork
4239000	4241000	couldn't you think of an idea of
4241000	4243000	hey, how about we put some places
4243000	4245000	where you can showcase that artwork
4245000	4247000	we'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since
4247000	4249000	I'm pretty much going to guess
4249000	4251000	Well, Loki, it's showcased when you turn the system on
4251000	4253000	That's all built into the whole
4253000	4255000	I understand that, but I'm just saying
4255000	4257000	that this is basically the equivalent of a
4257000	4259000	forum, how hard is it to
4259000	4261000	create a sub-forum in a forum
4261000	4263000	Apparently really difficult for Nintendo
4263000	4265000	engineers Let's also not forget
4265000	4267000	though that this forum is coming to iPhones
4267000	4269000	which was a pretty big announcement of the last
4269000	4271000	Nintendo Direct, so they're kind of setting the stage
4271000	4273000	for that, but again
4273000	4277000	I like Miiverse
4277000	4279000	There's a lot about it I do like
4279000	4281000	and I've talked about that before when I talked about
4281000	4283000	the Wii U in general
4283000	4285000	but I don't think this is like a game changer
4285000	4287000	It's a logical next step
4287000	4289000	Here's my worry
4289000	4291000	Maybe theory or something
4291000	4293000	This whole thing
4293000	4295000	they're all like, oh there's a lot of news
4295000	4297000	that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans
4297000	4299000	and 3DS fans
4299000	4301000	This is so that
4301000	4303000	you guys know there's stuff coming
4303000	4305000	There wasn't really anything for the Wii U
4305000	4307000	though, it was all 3DS
4307000	4309000	so which makes me wonder
4309000	4311000	how far away are we from an announcement that
4311000	4313000	the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U
4313000	4315000	gamepad, because they have a ton of shit
4315000	4317000	coming out for the 3DS and
4317000	4319000	nothing coming out for the Wii U
4319000	4321000	It makes perfect sense to say, hey
4321000	4323000	2 birds 1 stone, there you go
4323000	4325000	They won't be in 3D, but no one uses
4325000	4327000	the 3D feature anyways, we'll just have
4327000	4329000	the top screen up on the TV
4329000	4331000	bottom screen up on your gamepad, done
4331000	4333000	eShop
4333000	4335000	What gets me is that
4335000	4337000	they did this whole thing about
4337000	4339000	it's the year of Luigi
4339000	4341000	and they really went all out
4341000	4343000	They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie
4343000	4345000	and every little shot of one of their talking heads
4345000	4347000	had a little Luigi doll back there
4347000	4349000	but I was like, okay the only Luigi
4349000	4351000	stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion
4351000	4353000	which we already knew that was a thing
4353000	4355000	and that was going to be coming, and then they say
4355000	4357000	Luigi's a character in the golf game
4357000	4359000	and then this Luigi DLC
4359000	4361000	which is cool, yes, but
4361000	4363000	to brand it all as the year of Luigi
4363000	4365000	I was kind of like
4365000	4367000	yay
4367000	4369000	You know what you need is a Waluigi vs. Luigi
4369000	4371000	game
4371000	4373000	Just, you know, I don't know
4373000	4375000	Just say we've got Luigi content
4375000	4377000	Whatever, whatever
4377000	4379000	Well that makes me wonder, when is this new
4379000	4381000	Super Luigi content coming out
4381000	4383000	If it's the year of Luigi, it's not going to be
4383000	4385000	first half of the year
4385000	4387000	So you could be waiting for this crap until
4387000	4389000	fourth quarter
4389000	4391000	I got it, a new Mario is missing
4391000	4393000	Did we say the year of Luigi? We meant the
4393000	4395000	decade of Luigi
4395000	4397000	I mean, I'm just
4397000	4399000	The eventually
4399000	4401000	Once again, I would have thought
4401000	4403000	Especially after all these announcements of delays
4403000	4405000	Even some delays by Nintendo
4405000	4407000	Like of their first party titles
4407000	4409000	That they would have said, hey, you know what
4409000	4411000	I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles
4411000	4413000	being delayed, here's what we have coming
4413000	4415000	So that, you know, but they had nothing
4415000	4417000	They had nothing to announce
4417000	4419000	Oh, Doom Plague mentions in our chat room
4419000	4421000	The part of the Luigi thing
4421000	4423000	was also a new Mario and Luigi game
4423000	4425000	Where you're inside Luigi's dream
4425000	4427000	Okay, yes, I forgot about that
4427000	4429000	But that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting
4429000	4431000	character to me. You are inside his dream
4431000	4433000	So... I don't want to be
4433000	4435000	inside Luigi How are you
4435000	4437000	Luigi inside Luigi? You're not
4437000	4439000	It's Luigi-ception
4439000	4441000	It's like Mario Innerspace
4441000	4443000	So again, it's not like
4443000	4445000	Okay, so it's just
4445000	4447000	These were all things that existed where like
4447000	4449000	Stretch people, we need a
4449000	4451000	theme, people
4451000	4453000	What's the theme, people?
4453000	4455000	I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street
4455000	4457000	Let's, you know, go inside the dream
4457000	4459000	The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard
4459000	4461000	The Pikmin versus
4461000	4463000	Garden Gnomes
4463000	4465000	Lego City Stories
4465000	4467000	Luigi
4467000	4469000	Scene Legos
4469000	4471000	Luigi likes Legos
4471000	4473000	Luigi likes Legos
4473000	4475000	Ah
4475000	4477000	Crap
4477000	4479000	Legend of Zelda Wind Waker
4479000	4481000	They're both green! Yes?
4481000	4483000	Yes? Green?
4483000	4485000	The Legend of Luigi
4485000	4487000	Alright, let's move on with more news
4487000	4489000	And then we'll get to release dates
4489000	4491000	Dark Sakura
4491000	4493000	Jeez, well
4493000	4495000	Back to the, and this is now we're getting into
4495000	4497000	depressing. The Wii U
4497000	4499000	has sold a few systems
4499000	4501000	A few, and by a few I mean
4501000	4503000	55,000 in January
4503000	4505000	And this is just US numbers
4505000	4507000	Do you know how many Xbox 360's
4507000	4509000	were sold?
4509000	4511000	281,000. So a system
4511000	4513000	that's already been out for a few years
4513000	4515000	is outselling the brand new
4515000	4517000	Wii U. And is cheaper and has more games
4517000	4519000	to be fair. But
4519000	4521000	still, you know
4521000	4523000	they, um
4523000	4525000	their goal was supposed to be
4525000	4527000	I think over 100,000
4527000	4529000	well, well over that really
4529000	4531000	but they've completely undersold
4531000	4533000	and so now, um
4533000	4535000	they're, uh
4535000	4537000	they had announced
4537000	4539000	that if it had sold
4539000	4541000	um, uh, if
4541000	4543000	that it sold
4543000	4545000	3.06 million
4545000	4547000	worldwide as of December
4547000	4549000	but
4549000	4551000	now, um, their forecast of
4551000	4553000	5.5 million has gone down to 4 million
4553000	4555000	worldwide. And I bet it's gonna go down again
4555000	4557000	at the end of this month. I don't see any more
4557000	4559000	systems, there's no games
4559000	4561000	there literally is no Wii U games coming
4561000	4563000	out this month. None.
4563000	4565000	I think that they're really
4565000	4567000	probably looking to the handheld market to
4567000	4569000	uphold their console market
4569000	4571000	It gets me though that everybody
4571000	4573000	is crying that it's the death of Nintendo
4573000	4575000	and now Nintendo will be forced to do
4575000	4577000	Mario games on the 360
4577000	4579000	Ha ha ha ha
4579000	4581000	This is the, the unfortunate thing
4581000	4583000	is that this is the exact same
4583000	4585000	fucking thing as the 3DS.
4585000	4587000	Exact same thing.
4587000	4589000	The 3DS launched
4589000	4591000	with a couple of good games, then
4591000	4593000	literally nothing. What, we got
4593000	4595000	Ping Pals was a big release
4595000	4597000	on the 3DS. That was not
4597000	4599000	on 3DS. Oh no, I was regular DS. I don't know
4599000	4601000	It's still, with a Spongebob
4601000	4603000	game. You had shit on the 3DS
4603000	4605000	for a long time and then finally
4605000	4607000	they dropped the price and like a couple
4607000	4609000	years later the 3DS is bomb.
4609000	4611000	And hopefully Nintendo can make
4611000	4613000	magic work twice. I think
4613000	4615000	the only danger part is that Nintendo
4615000	4617000	is gonna have to work that magic
4617000	4619000	twice and they may have to drop the price of the
4619000	4621000	Wii U in order to do it. Well maybe then I'd get
4621000	4623000	one. Yeah, I think that's awesome. But I still don't have a 3DS.
4623000	4625000	You know, so
4625000	4627000	Special year of Luigi
4627000	4629000	green Wii U
4629000	4631000	I don't wanna see
4631000	4633000	a green Wii U
4633000	4635000	I'm wondering what they're gonna
4635000	4637000	do with the price, especially when these new
4637000	4639000	consoles launch because it's gonna be
4639000	4641000	tough if they're having trouble
4641000	4643000	getting people to be interested in it now.
4643000	4645000	When you have all that buzz of
4645000	4647000	all these awesome Wii U's. Especially
4647000	4649000	if, god forbid, you know
4649000	4651000	that Destiny or something like that is not
4651000	4653000	on the Wii U.
4653000	4655000	Granted I was on the Wii U
4655000	4657000	Destiny's on the Wii U
4657000	4659000	Madden's not on the Wii U
4659000	4661000	People are gonna be like, well why do I need a Wii U?
4661000	4663000	Yeah but if Zelda's on the Wii U
4663000	4665000	It's Wind Waker though!
4665000	4667000	I'm not even talking about Wind Waker
4667000	4669000	I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.
4669000	4671000	Yeah, new Zelda games not coming out this year.
4671000	4673000	I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year
4673000	4675000	other than Wind Waker HD.
4675000	4677000	But that would be
4677000	4679000	enough for some people though.
4679000	4681000	Something else to think about though
4682000	4684000	All they would have to do
4684000	4686000	Wind Waker HD comes with one
4686000	4688000	playable HD Zelda level.
4688000	4690000	Flying off shelves
4690000	4692000	You won't be able to find that shit anywhere
4692000	4694000	Watch
4694000	4696000	It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders
4696000	4698000	had the Metal Gear
4698000	4700000	Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo
4700000	4702000	in it that actually wasn't bad
4702000	4704000	and got a sequel
4704000	4706000	Crackdown
4706000	4708000	Alundra, didn't it have
4708000	4710000	the Final Fantasy 7 demo?
4711000	4713000	I know I was saying Alundra
4713000	4715000	How many people bought that
4715000	4717000	and all the Dragon Ball fans?
4717000	4719000	Yeah that was it, it was the 8 demo.
4719000	4721000	But anyway
4721000	4723000	There's a lot of people who will go out
4723000	4725000	Oh shoot
4725000	4727000	Was it
4727000	4729000	one of the games had a Xenogears
4729000	4731000	demo with it too?
4731000	4733000	And there's people
4733000	4735000	who will just buy a game to get the demo
4735000	4737000	of something that they want more
4737000	4739000	Here's the thing honestly
4739000	4741000	I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now
4741000	4743000	Is because once these 3DS games
4743000	4745000	are out it is all hands on fucking
4745000	4747000	deck for the Wii U
4747000	4749000	Everybody at Nintendo first and second parties
4749000	4751000	are going to be cranking out shit for Wii U
4751000	4753000	It is Wii U's last stand and it's going to be
4753000	4755000	pretty fucking amazing to watch play out
4755000	4757000	I think that's why it's so
4757000	4759000	3DS heavy because I think the holiday is going to end up
4759000	4761000	pretty weak because I think
4761000	4763000	there's like rush projects happening
4763000	4765000	They're going to crank it out
4765000	4767000	for this holiday season, they have to
4769000	4771000	And if we're still sitting here
4771000	4773000	next January telling the same tale
4773000	4775000	then I'll
4775000	4777000	entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo
4777000	4779000	better be cooking up a Mario game
4779000	4781000	for the Playstation 4
4781000	4783000	And in the end as long as there are
4783000	4785000	people who have little kids they want to play
4785000	4787000	games, they're going
4787000	4789000	to go for a Nintendo system
4789000	4791000	Nintendo has that level of
4791000	4793000	brand recognition and the association
4793000	4795000	that they're working as a kid
4795000	4797000	friendly, family friendly system
4797000	4799000	until the kid
4799000	4801000	falls over and drops the tablet
4801000	4803000	and breaks it
4803000	4805000	I agree, they're owning the
4805000	4807000	handheld market but
4807000	4809000	they may just not be a console
4809000	4811000	But they weren't
4811000	4813000	But they may just not be a console
4813000	4815000	company anymore
4815000	4817000	Too early
4817000	4819000	I'm not, I don't want you
4819000	4821000	to say I'm Nintendo defending
4821000	4823000	and all this stuff, I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this
4823000	4825000	It is pretty shitty
4825000	4827000	This is having a worse month
4827000	4829000	These numbers are so
4829000	4831000	bad, it is worse than any month
4831000	4833000	like the 360
4833000	4835000	PlayStation 3
4835000	4837000	I wouldn't go that far
4837000	4839000	has on record
4839000	4841000	What were Dreamcast sales like
4841000	4843000	in their first couple months?
4843000	4845000	You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point
4845000	4847000	It's just a different culture now
4847000	4849000	There have been
4849000	4851000	people that were drawing comparisons
4851000	4853000	between Sega's last days
4853000	4855000	and Nintendo
4855000	4857000	Which is redonkulous
4857000	4859000	That whole Nei saying whatever
4859000	4861000	That's like the anti-fanboy
4861000	4863000	It's no better
4863000	4865000	How well did GameCube do?
4865000	4867000	It was third place and Nintendo did fine
4867000	4869000	As long as they're making enough money to keep
4869000	4871000	costs up in the company
4871000	4873000	As long as they're turning a profit
4873000	4875000	or at least breaking even
4875000	4877000	The handhelds
4877000	4879000	are going to do that for them just fine
4879000	4881000	They'll make it just fine
4881000	4883000	They'll be around
4883000	4885000	It's not going to be like Sega
4885000	4887000	Sega didn't have that handheld
4887000	4889000	Sega also had some stupid marketing
4889000	4891000	They also had
4891000	4893000	really bad piracy
4893000	4895000	That was the downfall of the Dreamcast
4895000	4897000	Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast
4897000	4899000	had an entire CD
4899000	4901000	spindle of burned games
4901000	4903000	Every single burned game
4903000	4905000	And then had their boot disk to play their imports
4905000	4907000	Yep
4907000	4909000	No comment
4909000	4911000	Some people had
4911000	4913000	Para Para on their Dreamcast Rob
4913000	4915000	I don't think that system is done
4915000	4917000	I just think that right now
4917000	4919000	They're not doing a lot
4919000	4921000	Basically the thing is they're not
4921000	4923000	doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy
4923000	4925000	a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U
4925000	4927000	that they should buy a Wii U
4927000	4929000	That's my thing
4929000	4931000	They need to have some sort of
4931000	4933000	here's what's coming out
4933000	4935000	soon
4935000	4937000	Yeah, working on Smash Bros. game
4937000	4939000	Yeah, you know what?
4939000	4941000	You could have just launched this system and not said anything
4941000	4943000	and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros. game
4943000	4945000	Hell fuck!
4945000	4947000	Just say, hey we're working on an F-Zero game
4947000	4949000	That would sell a few more systems
4949000	4951000	Rob would buy another system, there you go
4951000	4953000	Hell yeah
4953000	4955000	But I want to see the receipts
4955000	4957000	You already bought a system, Rob
4957000	4959000	I did buy a system, I'll buy another for F-Zero
4959000	4961000	I will, I need two gamepads
4961000	4963000	Two tablet controllers, yeah
4963000	4965000	Such a consumer war
4965000	4967000	To register participation
4967000	4969000	for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4969000	4971000	at vognetwork.com, use the
4971000	4973000	passphrase, package
4973000	4975000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release
4975000	4977000	dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U
4977000	4979000	That's true
4979000	4981000	This week we've got a couple big games
4981000	4983000	coming out, the first one being Crysis 3
4983000	4985000	on Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4985000	4987000	and PC
4987000	4989000	Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
4989000	4991000	on Playstation 3 and
4991000	4993000	Xbox 360
4993000	4995000	We've got a PSP title, yes, there's actually
4995000	4997000	a PSP game coming out still
4997000	4999000	Axis Games putting out
4999000	5001000	visual novels for some reason on the PSP
5003000	5005000	Hakuoki, Warriors of
5005000	5007000	Shinsengumi on
5007000	5009000	the PSP
5009000	5011000	I want to play that
5011000	5013000	And
5013000	5015000	Possibly at the end of this week
5015000	5017000	Although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2
5017000	5019000	the add-on content pack for Playstation 3 and
5019000	5021000	Xbox 360
5021000	5023000	You can buy the content stuff
5023000	5025000	or pre-order the game
5025000	5027000	Or your console isn't online
5027000	5029000	You'll also be missing out on the next
5029000	5031000	gen systems
5031000	5033000	I'm planning on picking one of these up because
5033000	5035000	it allows me to install them into multiple systems
5035000	5037000	and I've got two systems that we play on
5037000	5039000	Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?
5039000	5041000	Yes, I'm sure, it's all on disk
5041000	5043000	Alright, then I can move on to
5043000	5045000	Japan
5045000	5047000	On the Playstation 3 in Japan this week, some price
5047000	5049000	reductions, the best series for
5049000	5051000	Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z
5051000	5053000	Ultimate Blast, Naruto
5053000	5055000	Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
5055000	5057000	Ryuga Gotoku of the End
5057000	5059000	and Saint Seiya Senkai
5059000	5061000	As far as new games go, on February 21
5061000	5063000	Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
5063000	5065000	comes out in Japan
5065000	5067000	That's pretty awesome
5067000	5069000	Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?
5069000	5071000	Uh, yeah
5071000	5073000	Going into the beta, it's not new
5073000	5075000	Oh, it's a re-release, ok
5075000	5077000	Also, how did I miss this?
5077000	5079000	I'm on the PS3, also on a price reduction this week
5079000	5081000	in Japan. Don't you want to play Mass Effect
5081000	5083000	with all Japanese garris?
5083000	5085000	I don't know if they did the voiceovers again
5085000	5087000	if the subtitles are...
5087000	5089000	I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos
5089000	5091000	to see if the voice is nearly as hot
5091000	5093000	It might be subs, it might not be dubs
5093000	5095000	We don't know
5095000	5097000	Well, that just looks like the
5097000	5099000	US trailer
5099000	5101000	Yeah, it doesn't
5101000	5103000	So it's probably just subs
5103000	5105000	Oh well
5105000	5107000	Anyhow, let's look at other systems
5107000	5109000	How about anything on the Xbox 360?
5109000	5111000	Uh, price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon
5111000	5113000	You have that to look forward to on the 360
5113000	5115000	But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think that we
5115000	5117000	use bad here
5117000	5119000	Yeah, exactly
5119000	5121000	And that's another thing people tend to forget
5121000	5123000	is that, you know, oh well, forget it
5123000	5125000	On the Vita, yes
5125000	5127000	the Vita in Japan
5127000	5129000	CL No Surge
5129000	5131000	Ushina Ureta Hoshi Isasagushi
5131000	5133000	Reincarnation
5133000	5135000	Also, next rev
5135000	5137000	Shoushi Shiken comes out
5137000	5139000	both new games on the Vita this week
5139000	5141000	Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus
5141000	5143000	and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week
5143000	5145000	Did you know that?
5145000	5147000	I won't
5147000	5149000	On the Wii U in Japan this week
5149000	5151000	there is a game, Tank Tank Tank
5151000	5153000	but we've talked about how that game
5153000	5155000	Tank Tank Tank before
5155000	5157000	On the Nintendo 3DS this week
5157000	5159000	Magi Hajimari no Meikyu
5159000	5161000	comes out from Bandai Namco
5161000	5163000	Let's go to the UK
5163000	5165000	Dark Sakura
5165000	5167000	In the UK we have a few things
5167000	5169000	On the 21st we have
5169000	5171000	Metal Gear Solid Rising
5171000	5173000	And then on the 22nd
5173000	5175000	there is Crysis 3
5175000	5177000	and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC
5177000	5179000	And
5179000	5181000	I think that's it
5181000	5183000	Let me check my calendar
5183000	5185000	Because I completely forgot
5185000	5187000	the last day of the week is, yeah, that's it
5187000	5189000	That's it
5189000	5191000	We're done
5191000	5193000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys
5193000	5195000	and then the classic game of the week, Loki
5195000	5197000	So, we keep hearing a lot about
5197000	5199000	this Xbox Entertainment
5199000	5201000	and this TV
5201000	5203000	initiative that they're doing
5203000	5205000	Well, apparently what they're working on
5205000	5207000	is supposed to be this
5207000	5209000	interactive TV
5209000	5211000	and they're saying similar to how they have
5211000	5213000	the interactive presentations of the Grammys
5213000	5215000	or the Oscars or something like that
5215000	5217000	that it would be some sort of
5217000	5219000	interactive TV, I don't know if with Spark Glass
5219000	5221000	or if they're talking more along the lines of like the Sesame Street
5221000	5223000	stuff with Kinect
5223000	5225000	Throw the tomatoes at the people on stage
5225000	5227000	Yeah, wouldn't that be awesome if like
5227000	5229000	they did the Grammys through the Xbox or something
5229000	5231000	and then it's like, you know, while Justin Timberlake
5231000	5233000	is on stage, push A if you would like
5233000	5235000	to release the hounds
5235000	5237000	Like that whole time
5237000	5239000	I would pay for that feature
5239000	5241000	No, if it was like
5241000	5243000	Bieber
5243000	5245000	Throwing tomatoes
5245000	5247000	would be funny though, like
5247000	5249000	having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends
5251000	5253000	Release the B's on the Bieber
5253000	5255000	That's right
5257000	5259000	Push B for Beyonce
5259000	5261000	Or like
5261000	5263000	they could have eye tracking
5263000	5265000	or something like that
5265000	5267000	Who can stare at Katy Perry's
5267000	5269000	breasts the least?
5269000	5271000	Go!
5271000	5273000	Dammit! Lost!
5273000	5275000	Or like camera switching
5275000	5277000	Like, you know, during a football game
5277000	5279000	or something
5279000	5281000	Yeah, during the Grammys
5281000	5283000	there's one on the stage and one on
5283000	5285000	Chris Brown and Adele fighting
5285000	5287000	and then there's another one on Katy Perry's
5287000	5289000	breasts and you can just watch that
5289000	5291000	cam the whole time, every time she applauds
5291000	5293000	Yes
5293000	5295000	Rewind
5295000	5297000	Rewind
5297000	5299000	Push A if you want to release the Kraken
5299000	5301000	Amazing
5301000	5303000	How about just 1 versus 100
5303000	5305000	as a network?
5305000	5307000	Could that be the interactive TV?
5307000	5309000	Because that would be awesome
5309000	5311000	Game shows would rule
5311000	5313000	But I'm not going to hold my breath
5313000	5315000	because that's too good
5315000	5317000	You know, right now
5317000	5319000	I would just like to see whatever
5319000	5321000	it is that they're going to come out with
5321000	5323000	and actually have it functioning without
5323000	5325000	them saying, here's what we're going to do
5325000	5327000	As far as I'm aware, and I know the new season
5327000	5329000	hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit
5329000	5331000	working with goddamn Game of Thrones
5331000	5333000	so, you know, why am I supposed to believe
5333000	5335000	that, you know, any of this stuff is going to
5335000	5337000	actually work either
5337000	5339000	With smart glass? Yeah
5339000	5341000	And where's my
5341000	5343000	goddamn interactive map on
5343000	5345000	Android? How about that smart glass?
5345000	5347000	Smart glass is fucking useless
5347000	5349000	on Android, I can't like, do anything
5349000	5351000	with it
5351000	5353000	Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you
5353000	5355000	It doesn't do anything
5355000	5357000	Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?
5357000	5359000	No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3
5359000	5361000	Woohoo!
5361000	5363000	Smart glass is the
5363000	5365000	fucking future, everybody
5365000	5367000	That's what I have the problem with these console manufacturers
5367000	5369000	is coming up with stupid
5369000	5371000	fucking ideas to do the same
5371000	5373000	shit we've already been doing
5373000	5375000	Why do I need to have a new way to
5375000	5377000	swipe through menus? Why do I need a stupid touchpad
5377000	5379000	to swipe through menus when I can use the analog stick, the
5379000	5381000	shoulder buttons, the directional
5381000	5383000	pad? I've already got three fucking ways
5383000	5385000	or connect? Why do I need
5385000	5387000	another way? I'm sorry
5387000	5389000	You know what Microsoft is? Microsoft is the
5389000	5391000	Fox TV of gaming. I don't mean Fox News
5391000	5393000	I mean Fox TV because like
5393000	5395000	they announce this big feature and make a
5395000	5397000	pomp and circumstance of it and then they
5397000	5399000	cancel it after two episodes
5399000	5401000	Like seriously. They put it in the Friday death slot
5401000	5403000	Like XNA? Firefly
5403000	5405000	Right? Am I right?
5405000	5407000	One versus a hundred? Wonder
5407000	5409000	Falls
5409000	5411000	Am I right?
5411000	5413000	Game Room?
5415000	5417000	What other Fox shows got
5417000	5419000	The Cleveland show? Is that still on the air?
5419000	5421000	That is still on the air actually. The Game Room did
5421000	5423000	last a good year or so before they pulled the plug
5423000	5425000	Running Wild
5425000	5427000	What was the show about the town with the lake?
5427000	5429000	Eureka?
5429000	5431000	It was like two episodes or something
5431000	5433000	Eureka was on the lake
5433000	5435000	Eureka's on Syfy
5435000	5437000	Lake Town?
5437000	5439000	Well actually now it's NBC apparently
5439000	5441000	Would be the
5441000	5443000	network to compare it to
5443000	5445000	What was that show with the
5445000	5447000	spies and they had like a house
5447000	5449000	I remember that
5449000	5451000	I don't know
5451000	5453000	The Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a TV show?
5453000	5455000	No not Mr. and Mrs. Smith
5455000	5457000	Or where Jamie gets her
5457000	5459000	name. The Bionic Woman
5459000	5461000	Oh my gosh
5461000	5463000	Thank you Tigerclaw
5463000	5465000	Dollhouse
5465000	5467000	They gave that a second season
5467000	5469000	Shadow Next Gen
5469000	5471000	Game Room got 13
5471000	5473000	game packs and it had about
5473000	5475000	100 games well on its way to that
5475000	5477000	Thousands of games they promised
5477000	5479000	at CES
5479000	5481000	Thousands of games in my
5481000	5483000	imagination
5483000	5485000	Technist
5485000	5487000	Sarah Connor Chronicles
5487000	5489000	That was actually a decent show
5489000	5491000	What would it last like 3 seasons?
5491000	5493000	2 seasons?
5493000	5495000	That's better than, you know, we're talking
5495000	5497000	Fireflies level stuff
5497000	5499000	It has Shirley Manson in it
5499000	5501000	Yeah I was gonna say anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week
5505000	5507000	Like I'm gay and I still drool
5507000	5509000	over her, she's hot
5509000	5511000	Alright
5511000	5513000	One more story for you guys
5513000	5515000	I don't know how to transition into this story
5515000	5517000	Cause I'm not gay for GameStop that's for sure
5517000	5519000	How about a big burp?
5519000	5521000	GameStop
5521000	5523000	Power to the players
5523000	5525000	GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013
5525000	5527000	Supposedly even though they're closing
5527000	5529000	250 they're gonna open
5529000	5531000	60 to 70 more
5531000	5533000	But that's just, you know, location moving
5533000	5535000	As neighborhoods build up there'll be new ones
5535000	5537000	And purchased
5537000	5539000	40 are coming from UK retailer Game
5539000	5541000	So some of those GameStops will be in the UK
5541000	5543000	A quote from the CFO
5543000	5545000	Rob Lloyd if you care
5545000	5547000	During the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco
5547000	5549000	Quote
5549000	5551000	We've been successful at that for two years
5551000	5553000	And we'll continue that program in 2013
5553000	5555000	Yeah I think it's because a lot of these
5555000	5557000	They took over like, you know, the EB
5557000	5559000	Games and stuff like that and they're in the same mall
5559000	5561000	Yeah or like literally you have
5561000	5563000	Like a GameStop and then across the street
5563000	5565000	Another GameStop
5565000	5567000	They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while
5567000	5569000	Yeah
5569000	5571000	Yeah
5571000	5573000	Yeah
5573000	5575000	Yeah
5575000	5577000	Yeah
5577000	5579000	Yeah so
5579000	5581000	I mean
5581000	5583000	I think if, you know, again if you're in an unprofitable
5583000	5585000	Location or a redundant location
5585000	5587000	Then you're probably in trouble
5587000	5589000	But I imagine most stores will be okay
5589000	5591000	But you know then CNN
5591000	5593000	Or Fox News since I mentioned them earlier
5593000	5595000	Picks up a story like this and
5595000	5597000	Console gaming is dead y'all
5597000	5599000	Console gaming is dead GameStop
5599000	5601000	Is closing their doors
5601000	5603000	They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out
5603000	5605000	That their games that they sell are causing
5605000	5607000	People to become murderers
5607000	5609000	See it's proof right there
5609000	5611000	It's mobile phones, everybody wants to play Smurf Village
5611000	5613000	Haven't you heard?
5613000	5615000	Mobile phone, it's Temple Run, that's gaming
5615000	5617000	Smurf Village is just code for terrorism
5617000	5619000	Okay
5619000	5621000	See now I have
5621000	5623000	This is the mental image I'm seeing now
5623000	5625000	Is the ColecoVision Smurfs with
5625000	5627000	You know AKs
5627000	5629000	Shooting Gargamel in the face
5629000	5631000	My childhood has been raped
5631000	5633000	Well
5633000	5635000	All I have to say to this news is
5635000	5637000	LOL bye
5637000	5639000	Sorry to the people that work there
5639000	5641000	I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living
5641000	5643000	But the corporation itself is
5643000	5645000	Kinda terrible so I hope that
5645000	5647000	Where the ashes land
5647000	5649000	From old GameStops a new indie
5649000	5651000	Retailer will emerge one can at least dream
5651000	5653000	Hey Play'n Trade now is your chance
5653000	5655000	To actually become like GameStop
5655000	5657000	Since you think you are anyways
5659000	5661000	Don't they have like a very similar logo too?
5661000	5663000	They have
5663000	5665000	That's GameTrader
5665000	5667000	Yeah they actually think that they're like a GameStop
5667000	5669000	And they kinda try to
5669000	5671000	Push themselves away and they're like
5671000	5673000	Oh we got all these stores
5673000	5675000	Yeah it doesn't really
5675000	5677000	They don't they actually haven't expanded in like
5677000	5679000	A long time so
5679000	5681000	Alright let's take a step
5681000	5683000	Let's take a step back to a simpler time you guys
5683000	5685000	Let's go back to a time
5685000	5687000	Where GameStop actually had competition
5687000	5689000	Or back when GameStop
5689000	5691000	Wasn't even GameStop yet
5691000	5693000	Babbages, Funkoland
5693000	5695000	Software etc
5695000	5697000	Back before they were just all
5697000	5699000	Swallowed whole
5699000	5701000	By GameStop
5701000	5703000	It's the classic game of the week
5703000	5705000	Star Saga take us back to simpler times
5705000	5707000	The game of the week
5707000	5709000	Is Cinestar
5711000	5713000	Yeah
5713000	5715000	Cinestar came out by Williams in 1982
5715000	5717000	And um
5717000	5719000	It was uh
5719000	5721000	A pretty neat little game
5721000	5723000	Kind of though
5723000	5725000	For me I'm not very good at it
5725000	5727000	But I'll just keep going
5727000	5729000	Basically you are in a spacecraft and you have to create
5729000	5731000	Cinnabombs
5731000	5733000	Cinnabon? I love Cinnabon
5733000	5735000	I love Cinnabon
5735000	5737000	Oh my god
5737000	5739000	Show's cancelled we're going to Cinnabon bye bitches
5739000	5741000	I mean that's the good news is that
5741000	5743000	Even though GameStops are closing
5743000	5745000	Cinnabon next door will still be A-OK
5745000	5747000	It's not next door
5747000	5749000	That was where the software etc used to be
5749000	5751000	Now there's like a what a tinder shop there?
5751000	5753000	Lady don't take me literally OK
5753000	5755000	OK show's cancelled
5755000	5757000	Cinnabombs
5757000	5759000	You have to shoot
5759000	5761000	At planetoids
5761000	5763000	And get the crystals that are released
5763000	5765000	And you have to use the bombs
5765000	5767000	To defeat Cinestar
5767000	5769000	Who is this huge spacecraft
5769000	5771000	With a skull face
5771000	5773000	And um
5773000	5775000	You're constantly under construction as you're going through the game
5775000	5777000	So it's sort of like the Death Star
5777000	5779000	But without being the Death Star
5781000	5783000	Yeah beware I live
5785000	5787000	That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid
5789000	5791000	I hunger for Cinnabons
5795000	5797000	That's all pretty awesome
5797000	5799000	Wow
5799000	5801000	This guy wants his fucking Cinnabon
5801000	5803000	So is this like actually Cinestar
5803000	5805000	Or is this like you know
5805000	5807000	Recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live
5809000	5811000	This is the guy that goes to the airport
5811000	5813000	To get Cinnabon OK
5815000	5817000	OK can I get back to the review please
5817000	5819000	So once Cinestar is formed
5819000	5821000	As we heard the digitized voice
5821000	5823000	Pops up who's actually a radio personality
5823000	5825000	John Deramus
5825000	5827000	And it's played through an
5827000	5829000	HD55516 CVSD decoder
5829000	5831000	Ooh says
5831000	5833000	I hunger coward
5833000	5835000	And then it tells you run run run
5835000	5837000	But how would you run in space
5837000	5839000	Would it just be fly like a little bitch
5839000	5841000	I don't know
5841000	5843000	Anyway
5843000	5845000	So um
5845000	5847000	Basically it just eats you
5847000	5849000	All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinnabons
5849000	5851000	To satiate this Cinestar
5853000	5855000	He needs that cinnamon
5855000	5857000	Sugary goodness
5857000	5859000	So you move from zone to zone
5859000	5861000	And keep you know beating Cinestar
5861000	5863000	Because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker
5863000	5865000	Why don't we go kill
5865000	5867000	That asshole that keeps rebuilding
5867000	5869000	Exactly exactly They really weren't smart
5869000	5871000	In the early 80's
5871000	5873000	So you have to go through the worker zone
5873000	5875000	The warrior zone, planetoid zone and void zone
5875000	5877000	The void zone being
5877000	5879000	The difficult one because it has
5879000	5881000	Very few planetoids to blow up
5881000	5883000	Um
5883000	5885000	So also
5885000	5887000	You know of course
5887000	5889000	The Cinestar can be repaired
5889000	5891000	By its little drone fuckers
5891000	5893000	Unless you satiate him
5893000	5895000	With tasty Cinabons
5895000	5897000	So yeah
5897000	5899000	There were different ports
5899000	5901000	There was the Atari 2600
5901000	5903000	The 8 bit computers
5903000	5905000	They were almost done
5905000	5907000	But there was
5907000	5909000	The video game crash and they're like no
5909000	5911000	So we actually got it on
5911000	5913000	The Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for
5913000	5915000	Smash, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast
5915000	5917000	Playstation and PC
5917000	5919000	It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures
5919000	5921000	On Xbox, GameCube and PS2
5921000	5923000	And then on PC
5923000	5925000	And then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures
5925000	5927000	Extended Play for the PSP in 2005
5927000	5929000	It was one of the first
5929000	5931000	Games to use stereo
5931000	5933000	In the sit down version
5933000	5935000	And it had
5935000	5937000	Independent sound boards just for that
5937000	5939000	For purpose
5939000	5941000	And it used the 49 way
5941000	5943000	Joystick that Williams had produced
5943000	5945000	Specifically for that game
5945000	5947000	As far as
5947000	5949000	Other versions that have come out
5949000	5951000	There was a pseudo sequel
5951000	5953000	On the PC in 1999
5953000	5955000	Called Cinestar Unleashed
5955000	5957000	It had nothing to do with
5957000	5959000	The original creators
5959000	5961000	But it was supposed to be
5961000	5963000	A pretty neat little game
5963000	5965000	And then Cinestar got re-released
5965000	5967000	For the Midway's Greatest Arcade
5967000	5969000	Hits on the Game Boy
5969000	5971000	Advanced without
5971000	5973000	The cool features
5973000	5975000	There's also
5975000	5977000	A lot of other little
5977000	5979000	Cinestar is really just
5979000	5981000	You know
5981000	5983000	A big part of classic gaming
5983000	5985000	Like in
5985000	5987000	There was
5987000	5989000	I'm trying to see if I can find it
5989000	5991000	For Team Fortress 2
5991000	5993000	The heavy weapons guy says I live
5993000	5995000	I run cowards
5995000	5997000	And then
5997000	5999000	Cinestar is in one of the
5999000	6001000	Dresden Files books
6001000	6003000	There
6003000	6005000	A group of students at the College of William and Mary
6005000	6007000	Did a musical version
6007000	6009000	Called Cinestar the Musical
6009000	6011000	I have to find this now
6013000	6015000	And then
6015000	6017000	They used the voice of Cinestar
6017000	6019000	In an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!
6019000	6021000	The Abridged series
6021000	6023000	Which is a web series that
6023000	6025000	I've been introduced to
6025000	6027000	This sequel
6027000	6029000	When he wants Cinnabons he wants over
6029000	6031000	9000
6031000	6033000	Couldn't help myself
6033000	6035000	Let's listen to some of the
6035000	6037000	voice
6045000	6047000	You throw those Cinnabons at him
6047000	6049000	You go ship
6049000	6051000	There it is your classic game of the week
6051000	6053000	Beware I live
6053000	6055000	Cinestar
6055000	6057000	Available in arcades everywhere
6057000	6059000	If you can find him in business
6059000	6061000	If you live in 1982
6061000	6063000	So it's available in Bobby's arcade
6063000	6065000	Yes
6065000	6067000	You had to have caught
6067000	6069000	Bobby's show to get the reference
6069000	6071000	There it is your classic game of the week
6071000	6073000	And jeez Ron-Chan you're fast
6073000	6075000	On the posting
6075000	6077000	He's managing the tumblers
6077000	6079000	Shout out to the OLR tumbler
6079000	6081000	The OLR tumbler is
6081000	6083000	Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com
6083000	6085000	And while you're at it
6085000	6087000	Look at my Mass Effect one
6087000	6089000	Isn't your Mass Effect one
6089000	6091000	More popular than the Orange Lounge radio one?
6091000	6093000	Yes
6093000	6095000	So you don't need the help
6095000	6097000	I'll repost it
6097000	6099000	I'll show some promo love
6099000	6101000	You'll tumble it
6101000	6103000	When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game
6103000	6105000	That's not going to happen
6105000	6107000	Last episode
6107000	6109000	We're not going to have a last episode
6109000	6111000	We're going to do this until we're dead
6111000	6113000	Well then there would be a final episode
6113000	6115000	Yeah but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly
6115000	6117000	This is morbid
6117000	6119000	I don't like where this is going
6119000	6121000	Beware I die
6121000	6123000	Give me Cinnabons
6123000	6125000	Rob ate one too many Cinnabons
6125000	6127000	He dead
6127000	6129000	Let's remember with the theme
6129000	6131000	from Mass Effect
6131000	6133000	Alright
6133000	6135000	Well that does it for the classic game of the week
6135000	6137000	I've said that three times now
6137000	6139000	So I swear we're done with part A
6139000	6141000	But don't go anywhere because this show is so much fun
6141000	6143000	We've got plenty more coming in part B
6143000	6145000	Including the foogle question of the week
6145000	6147000	A very interesting patent name
6147000	6149000	Something that Sony did
6149000	6151000	Oh god somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news
6151000	6153000	There is news and yes it is legit
6153000	6155000	Information on Mass Effect

6185000	6187000	Where you can hear such live antics as
6187000	6189000	Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break
6189000	6191000	When some quiet music is playing
6191000	6193000	So people can hear what we're saying
6193000	6195000	Just barely though
6195000	6197000	Oops oh well
6197000	6199000	See at least we weren't talking any smack
6199000	6201000	It was just more Nino Cooney talk
6201000	6203000	It was Nino Cooney talk and Rob
6203000	6205000	Coffee
6205000	6207000	And birthday cake oreos that's really all you missed
6207000	6209000	Alright there you go
6209000	6211000	ActDeft says it's the Flaco Jones curse
6211000	6213000	taking its course
6213000	6215000	Well if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's gonna get
6215000	6217000	I guess I'll take it
6217000	6219000	That's not so bad
6219000	6221000	I was sitting here going like
6221000	6223000	Oh that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight
6223000	6225000	I can't even
6225000	6227000	Just kidding
6227000	6229000	Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week
6229000	6231000	I've played Aliens
6231000	6233000	Colonial Marines all his fault
6233000	6235000	He didn't warn me
6235000	6237000	Why Bobby?
6237000	6239000	Why?
6239000	6241000	Alright I would never
6241000	6243000	Alright anyhow
6243000	6245000	Let's get back into some gaming
6245000	6247000	news rapid fire news time
6247000	6249000	So Eain Zinga
6249000	6251000	settled their lawsuits over the
6251000	6253000	Ville which was ripping off
6253000	6255000	social and
6255000	6257000	of course we don't know any of the
6257000	6259000	details of what they settled for but it's settled
6259000	6261000	and that's over
6261000	6263000	I was hoping for a
6263000	6265000	long drawn out
6265000	6267000	fist fight
6267000	6269000	I wanted it to be Judge Judy
6269000	6271000	solved I wanted it to go to Judge
6271000	6273000	Judy
6273000	6275000	Don't sit there
6275000	6277000	and tell me you didn't know what you're doing
6277000	6279000	Um
6279000	6281000	Halo 2 on
6281000	6283000	PC the multiplayer support has been
6283000	6285000	extended thanks to
6285000	6287000	you know
6287000	6289000	begging from fans
6289000	6291000	Originally it was gonna be cutting
6291000	6293000	the servers off on
6293000	6295000	February 15th
6295000	6297000	but apparently now it's
6297000	6299000	been extended to June
6299000	6301000	and they're investigating further options
6301000	6303000	to support the fans
6303000	6305000	of the Halo 2 on PC so
6305000	6307000	that's good
6307000	6309000	That's good news for the dozens and dozens
6309000	6311000	of people still playing
6311000	6313000	Halo 2 on PC
6313000	6315000	Who do you think has more? More people playing
6315000	6317000	Halo 2 on PC or more people that
6317000	6319000	listens to OLR? What do you think?
6319000	6321000	OLR
6321000	6323000	Really? I was gonna go for Halo
6323000	6325000	Actually yeah I mean with all
6325000	6327000	you know all kidding aside
6327000	6329000	Halo 2 I mean it's the only place you can
6329000	6331000	play it since
6331000	6333000	you know they shut down the Xbox 360
6333000	6335000	or excuse me Xbox regular
6335000	6337000	one because of 360 infrastructure
6337000	6339000	that they never really
6339000	6341000	followed through on
6341000	6343000	Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than
6343000	6345000	100 people on our friends list?
6345000	6347000	Oops
6347000	6349000	Um and then finally
6349000	6351000	Sniper Elite has a brand new game
6351000	6353000	in their franchise and going the route of
6353000	6355000	most other game franchises out there
6355000	6357000	they've decided to add zombies
6357000	6359000	So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie
6359000	6361000	Army is gonna be coming out exclusively
6361000	6363000	on PC they're out on
6363000	6365000	Steam for $15
6365000	6367000	and that's at the end of this
6367000	6369000	month on the 28th
6369000	6371000	and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite
6371000	6373000	it's a World War 2 sniper game
6373000	6375000	and the second Sniper Elite game
6375000	6377000	you actually got to shoot the balls
6377000	6379000	off of Hitler if you wanted to
6379000	6381000	Hooray
6381000	6383000	They even have the cool like you know Mortal Combat
6383000	6385000	X-Ray mode thing where you can see the
6385000	6387000	testicles explode Oh that's so
6387000	6389000	lovely
6389000	6391000	Thank you for that
6391000	6393000	And in case you didn't get that game they actually are re-releasing
6393000	6395000	the uh Sniper Elite V2 with
6395000	6397000	the Kill Hitler
6397000	6399000	uh you know
6399000	6401000	DLC in there which it should really be teamed up
6401000	6403000	with Danger 5 you know cause
6403000	6405000	their mission is
6405000	6407000	to kill Hitler Orange Lounge Radio is apparently
6407000	6409000	the show this week where people can hear about
6409000	6411000	exploding Hitler's balls
6411000	6413000	I thought they only had one
6413000	6415000	Anyhow
6415000	6417000	Uh is that it?
6417000	6419000	Please be it That's it
6419000	6421000	Let's move on to something a lot less offensive
6421000	6423000	It is uh Bit.Trip
6423000	6425000	uh the Bit.Trip series
6425000	6427000	uh Bit.Trip soundtracks
6427000	6429000	for 20 bucks
6429000	6431000	and when you pre-order
6431000	6433000	with that 20 bucks the
6433000	6435000	Bit.Trip Runner 2 future
6435000	6437000	Legend of Rhythm Alien you will get
6437000	6439000	6 Bit.Trip soundtracks
6439000	6441000	for free although they're not really free cause you're paying
6441000	6443000	20 bucks for it but uh
6443000	6445000	pretty cool you know if you are a fan of
6445000	6447000	Bit.Trip Runner so in other words if you're not Bobby
6447000	6449000	I was gonna say is that like kind of how
6449000	6451000	they try to sell you two pieces of crap on
6451000	6453000	TV and really the whole
6453000	6455000	trick is just to get you to pay twice as much
6455000	6457000	for more than one that you need The trick is
6457000	6459000	to get you to pre-order Bit.Trip Runner 2
6459000	6461000	and boost its numbers
6461000	6463000	but the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good
6463000	6465000	like if you like the 8-bit music
6465000	6467000	and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff
6467000	6469000	you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks
6469000	6471000	In fact I imagine most of you have um
6471000	6473000	acquired the soundtracks if you're
6473000	6475000	a fan of the series but wouldn't it be nice
6475000	6477000	to get them legally and you can do
6477000	6479000	that here for 20 bucks
6479000	6481000	pre-order
6483000	6485000	uh let's see I also
6485000	6487000	I guess apparently uh you
6487000	6489000	can get some of the soundtracks for a dollar
6489000	6491000	and then 10 dollars you get the Runner 2
6491000	6493000	soundtrack as well well look at that
6493000	6495000	good times
6495000	6497000	uh there is a game
6497000	6499000	coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive
6499000	6501000	version of said game it's Need for Speed
6501000	6503000	Most Wanted uh this game
6503000	6505000	came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
6505000	6507000	last year
6507000	6509000	but it's coming out on the Wii
6509000	6511000	this year and
6511000	6513000	uh it's gonna have some new stuff in it such as
6513000	6515000	the whole uh you can actually
6515000	6517000	you know have the off TV mode on the gamepad
6517000	6519000	but then there's something about on the gamepad
6519000	6521000	you can actually help
6521000	6523000	somebody that's playing on the big
6523000	6525000	screen uh you can guide
6525000	6527000	them you can help them or you can either
6527000	6529000	hinder them they're calling it a co-driver
6529000	6531000	father and son mode is something
6531000	6533000	that they've called it amongst the criterion
6533000	6535000	developers you can literally have
6535000	6537000	a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your
6537000	6539000	shit up on that gamepad
6539000	6541000	that reminds me of what I do in Grand Theft Auto sometimes
6541000	6543000	I'll have a thing where I can spawn cars
6543000	6545000	in front of me actually on my phone I'll do that
6545000	6547000	and I'll put it in first person mode and let the cab driver
6547000	6549000	try to drive while I'm dropping boats in front
6549000	6551000	of him and he just like
6551000	6553000	dropping boats yes that's awesome
6553000	6555000	on the gamepad you can turn traffic on
6555000	6557000	and off you can change the environment between
6557000	6559000	night and day distract cops
6559000	6561000	get a map that shows you where the cops
6561000	6563000	are and the speed cameras and
6563000	6565000	you can just take control away of the car from the driver
6565000	6567000	awesome
6567000	6569000	doing it wrong I'll be taking over
6569000	6571000	into the wall
6571000	6573000	uh there you go so uh
6573000	6575000	let me see a quote from Alexander
6575000	6577000	Ward creative director quote
6577000	6579000	when we sat down to think about bringing Most Wanted
6579000	6581000	to Wii U we thought of this in a car game
6581000	6583000	what can the second player in the room do
6583000	6585000	we could have just released a vanilla version
6585000	6587000	of the game put it out and say hey it's Most Wanted
6587000	6589000	on the Wii U but really Nintendo's
6589000	6591000	challenge there is to allow others to interact
6591000	6593000	with the main player using the gamepad
6593000	6595000	you know when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted
6595000	6597000	on the Wii U I got the impression that you were gonna
6597000	6599000	have two people playing at the
6599000	6601000	same time one on the gamepad one on the
6601000	6603000	TV I think you can do that that sounded
6603000	6605000	a lot better I think you could do that too
6605000	6607000	I think there's just oh good this is
6607000	6609000	another mode they should really have it just
6609000	6611000	like passenger mode where you just
6611000	6613000	your gamepad is like the side window
6613000	6615000	you can roll it up and down and that's it
6615000	6617000	and the wind blows in your face and
6617000	6619000	that's all you can really do is just look out the window
6619000	6621000	and roll the window up and down I wonder if there will be
6621000	6623000	a dark soccer mode where a big button will pop
6623000	6625000	up and you push it and it goes Dan
6625000	6627000	coffee you are never
6627000	6629000	gonna let me live that down little Starbucks
6629000	6631000	shows up on your map
6633000	6635000	you know there's people listening who probably
6635000	6637000	have no idea where that came from
6637000	6639000	you wanna tell the story or should I
6639000	6641000	go ahead we were on a road
6641000	6643000	trip to Disneyland and I was trapped in
6643000	6645000	the back seat with Dan and dark soccer
6645000	6647000	in the front as they were having
6647000	6649000	heated discussions
6649000	6651000	through the trip down but
6651000	6653000	one of the things that you know would happen
6653000	6655000	for hundreds and hundreds of miles is that
6655000	6657000	dark soccer would be Dan
6657000	6659000	coffee and
6659000	6661000	every time we drove by a Starbucks which when
6661000	6663000	you're on highway 99 is all the time
6663000	6665000	five miles Dan
6665000	6667000	coffee
6667000	6669000	so Rob where's your phone
6669000	6671000	finally shut up
6671000	6673000	so finally finally we get to
6673000	6675000	a Starbucks like we're like halfway to Disneyland
6675000	6677000	we finally pull over to Starbucks and
6677000	6679000	she gets her coffee and I proceed to
6679000	6681000	leave my cell phone in the sandwich
6681000	6683000	shop except oh it was actually in my back
6683000	6685000	pocket the whole time
6685000	6687000	wah wah wah wah
6687000	6689000	now you know when knowing is
6689000	6691000	half the battle aren't you glad she
6691000	6693000	asked me to tell that story I didn't ask
6693000	6695000	you to tell the story it's so people don't get it
6695000	6697000	so I could delay this news
6697000	6699000	the 3DS has become the
6699000	6701000	best gaming machine out there
6701000	6703000	is a attention grabbing headline
6703000	6705000	that was run on Kotaku this week
6705000	6707000	why Kotaku an attention grabbing headline
6707000	6709000	that's unheard of
6709000	6711000	they don't stretch the truth at all
6711000	6713000	no
6713000	6715000	uh yeah so
6715000	6717000	how many articles did they write about hating
6717000	6719000	aliens colonial marines I can't remember
6719000	6721000	was it in the double digits because I think it was
6721000	6723000	uh
6723000	6725000	honestly I was
6725000	6727000	this story was something that was shared with us
6727000	6729000	in the show world thread by somebody
6729000	6731000	else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview
6731000	6733000	with somebody but no it actually
6733000	6735000	is just a whole story written about
6735000	6737000	hey the 3D remember when the
6737000	6739000	3DS was fucked and now
6739000	6741000	look at all this stuff oh my god it's just basically
6741000	6743000	regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News
6743000	6745000	that had already been run
6745000	6747000	but now under the guise of this is why the
6747000	6749000	3DS is the best
6749000	6751000	fucking game system
6751000	6753000	considering that there's like
6753000	6755000	you know
6755000	6757000	they're talking handheld game system
6757000	6759000	there's really only a couple to choose from
6759000	6761000	one of them being the 3DS and one of them being
6761000	6763000	the Vita no one's really gonna make the argument
6763000	6765000	that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system
6765000	6767000	out there
6767000	6769000	I'm tapping
6769000	6771000	my finger do I want to go there
6771000	6773000	do I want to go behind door number 4
6773000	6775000	a system is only as good as the
6775000	6777000	games that are on it
6777000	6779000	no I unless it has reach around
6779000	6781000	I have another rant brewing
6781000	6783000	do I want to go there
6783000	6785000	drama
6785000	6787000	this website is such shit
6787000	6789000	why does everybody keep reading it
6789000	6791000	and here I am talking about it
6791000	6793000	and it's gonna be more people checking it
6793000	6795000	I fucking can't
6795000	6797000	why do we keep bringing
6797000	6799000	this fucking shitty
6799000	6801000	website up all of the time
6801000	6803000	and why does their attention grabbing antics
6803000	6805000	work all of the time
6805000	6807000	I can't anymore
6807000	6809000	I do not want any stories
6809000	6811000	from this website ever again on our show
6811000	6813000	we are better than this
6813000	6815000	done, banned
6815000	6817000	I'm serious, do not link this
6817000	6819000	website ever again for a news story
6819000	6821000	there are better places on the internet to get your
6821000	6823000	gaming news done
6823000	6825000	they just grab all the stories from other people anyway
6825000	6827000	just go to the site, click the link that they got
6827000	6829000	and then use that one
6829000	6831000	I am taking a stand here, I am not
6831000	6833000	giving these fuckers hits anymore
6833000	6835000	it is ridiculous
6837000	6839000	Rob, yes, coffee
6839000	6841000	I think I might need
6841000	6843000	another cup
6843000	6845000	how about some more news stories DarkSakura
6845000	6847000	Sega
6847000	6849000	yay, I love you Sega
6849000	6851000	Sega has
6851000	6853000	a line of PCs
6853000	6855000	it's called the Sega Note PC laptop
6855000	6857000	and they have different styles, there's the generic
6857000	6859000	Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn
6859000	6861000	and the Dreamcast
6861000	6863000	and they're
6863000	6865000	anywhere between
6865000	6869000	$1,000 to $2,100
6869000	6871000	and
6871000	6873000	they'll come with the 64 bit version
6873000	6875000	of Windows 8
6875000	6877000	a 1920 by 1080 display
6877000	6879000	4 gigs of RAM and a 500 gigabyte
6879000	6881000	hard drive
6881000	6883000	and a Pentium 2020M processor
6883000	6885000	so yeah
6885000	6887000	and it will be obsolete in 5 seconds
6887000	6889000	moving on, how about some Square
6889000	6891000	Square
6891000	6893000	actually
6893000	6895000	registered
6895000	6897000	Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain
6897000	6899000	domains
6899000	6901000	so maybe we're gonna see some
6901000	6903000	re-releases or
6903000	6905000	reboots, but there's
6905000	6907000	wolfensteinspiel.com
6907000	6909000	and warfornasgoth.com
6909000	6911000	so
6911000	6913000	who knows
6913000	6915000	I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game, I hope it's done
6915000	6917000	in Wolfenstein 3D fashion
6917000	6919000	the 3D ones never were
6919000	6921000	I love the little
6921000	6923000	I love the little sound they make
6923000	6925000	like
6925000	6927000	with the digitized voices
6927000	6929000	what
6929000	6931000	I'm just American
6931000	6933000	you know that
6933000	6935000	actually when they did the re-releases
6935000	6937000	with that one, it's actually like banned in Switzerland
6937000	6939000	Tina Turner
6939000	6941000	cannot play Wolfenstein now
6941000	6943000	in her new home
6943000	6945000	country
6945000	6947000	I love that woman, I'm sure she's crushed
6947000	6949000	and then
6949000	6951000	last but not least
6951000	6953000	you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit
6953000	6955000	that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been
6955000	6957000	trying to ignore because Axl Rose
6957000	6959000	pretty much has been
6959000	6961000	well, yeah it got
6961000	6963000	thrown out of fraud court so
6963000	6965000	not a big deal anymore
6965000	6967000	Axl sucks
6967000	6969000	it's all good, he's attached to what
6969000	6971000	that new Band Fuse game that's coming out
6971000	6973000	and you know Band Fuse, the one that's gonna try to do the same
6973000	6975000	thing that what Power Gig tried to do
6975000	6977000	you remember Power Gig
6977000	6979000	right?
6979000	6981000	I do remember Power Gig
6981000	6983000	yes, so Band Fuse
6983000	6985000	the new Mastiff music game is gonna be coming out
6985000	6987000	it's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing
6987000	6989000	but I think the difference with this one
6989000	6991000	was that it's real guitar
6991000	6993000	and you can sing
6993000	6995000	that's really it
6995000	6997000	you know what, you could do that with
6997000	6999000	Beatles Rock Band
6999000	7001000	well that's not a real
7001000	7003000	guitar though
7003000	7005000	but no one cares
7005000	7007000	mostly more than Band Fuse
7011000	7013000	was that it?
7013000	7015000	I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit
7015000	7017000	jeez Rob, I was chatting with chatters
7017000	7019000	Rab! I was participating
7021000	7023000	think of another one
7023000	7025000	my extended hate boner was spewing
7025000	7027000	into the chat room, alright
7027000	7029000	your hate boner
7029000	7031000	tonight's show has been brought to you by the words
7031000	7033000	hate and boner
7033000	7035000	in other words hate boner used in tandem
7035000	7037000	be sure to make the special noise
7041000	7043000	let's go to a segment that never makes us
7043000	7045000	make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners
7045000	7047000	have to say in the Google Question of the Week
7053000	7055000	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
7055000	7057000	or our Google Plus community
7057000	7059000	you can participate with
7059000	7061000	a question we ask of our fan communities
7061000	7063000	each week on the program
7063000	7065000	starting off with this week's
7065000	7067000	question
7067000	7069000	it was announced today that the new game Destiny
7069000	7071000	will require a persistent internet connection
7071000	7073000	on previous episodes, OLR and Bobby
7073000	7075000	have talked about other games that require
7075000	7077000	an always online internet connection
7077000	7079000	such as Diablo 3 and the new
7079000	7081000	SimCity
7081000	7083000	how do you feel about games that require an always on
7083000	7085000	internet connection?
7085000	7087000	and where I was kind of going with this
7087000	7089000	you know, obviously listeners come to draw their own conclusions
7089000	7091000	and part of the reason we do this
7091000	7093000	was that we let some games
7093000	7095000	slip by and it's fine
7095000	7097000	it's accepted, like World of Warcraft
7097000	7099000	always online internet connection
7099000	7101000	new SimCity
7101000	7103000	we're not so forgiving
7103000	7105000	but Destiny kind of falls
7105000	7107000	in that weird kind of middle part where it's like
7107000	7109000	well, clearly online is a big
7109000	7111000	component of it, but you're going to have to
7111000	7113000	always be connected, so I was curious
7113000	7115000	if our listeners kind of
7115000	7117000	gave it a pass or no
7117000	7119000	we only had one response on Google Plus
7119000	7121000	so I'll read that, from Rentertainment
7121000	7123000	the one guy still using Google Plus
7125000	7127000	we need a high profile game with a
7127000	7129000	wide and vocal audience to have an always
7129000	7131000	on internet connection mandate
7131000	7133000	that way when some part of it fails
7133000	7135000	leaving people unable to play the game they paid
7135000	7137000	money for, the general public will rage
7137000	7139000	out about it, when the public rages out
7139000	7141000	about it, assuming these companies actually give
7141000	7143000	a shit about what the public wants, these
7143000	7145000	companies will finally see
7145000	7147000	how appropriate
7147000	7149000	these companies will finally see
7149000	7151000	what a mistake the always on
7151000	7153000	internet connection mandate is
7153000	7155000	Rentertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to
7155000	7157000	introduce you to a game called Diablo 3
7157000	7159000	this actually
7159000	7161000	happened, you couldn't log in
7161000	7163000	to Diablo 3 for like a week
7163000	7165000	or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off
7165000	7167000	after like an hour, and
7167000	7169000	speaking of hate boner, the internet
7169000	7171000	really had a big one for Diablo 3
7171000	7173000	because of the always online, because you might remember
7173000	7175000	Diablo 2, you could play
7175000	7177000	LAN, and you could play offline
7177000	7179000	there's actually a game
7179000	7181000	that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny
7181000	7183000	that's going to be similar to this
7183000	7185000	SimCity
7185000	7187000	I'm talking about more long lines of Destiny
7187000	7189000	like an online first person
7189000	7191000	shooter game that's
7191000	7193000	kind of like an MMO type thing
7193000	7195000	Defiance from Trion
7195000	7197000	games, that's going to be coming out
7197000	7199000	in April, and it's
7199000	7201000	online only
7201000	7203000	they are an MMO company
7203000	7205000	however, this is a game
7205000	7207000	it's buy to play type thing
7207000	7209000	and it's on consoles
7209000	7211000	on PC and PS3, Xbox 360
7211000	7213000	so this
7213000	7215000	is something similar to
7215000	7217000	that, obviously not
7217000	7219000	as grand as I guess
7219000	7221000	Destiny, but I see
7221000	7223000	this actually has an online port
7223000	7225000	once again, it was very vague on
7225000	7227000	everything, on why it needs
7227000	7229000	to be, why is it that
7229000	7231000	we need this
7231000	7233000	online world
7233000	7235000	are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth
7235000	7237000	we're going to have battles and stuff like that
7237000	7239000	is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into
7239000	7241000	or is it just like
7241000	7243000	oh, well I need to see my friend
7243000	7245000	he just cleared this spot
7245000	7247000	so now the enemies are easier here
7247000	7249000	I don't know, I don't really know what they're doing
7249000	7251000	but it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there
7251000	7253000	versus SimCity where
7253000	7255000	you just interact with your friends
7255000	7257000	cities that they make
7259000	7261000	Diablo 3, despite everybody
7261000	7263000	raging on it and everything
7263000	7265000	still sold, what, 11 million
7265000	7267000	that's
7267000	7269000	I don't think that's going to tell them
7269000	7271000	I got the message, no more always online
7271000	7273000	yeah, right, well, and if that were the case
7273000	7275000	we wouldn't be seeing it now like a
7275000	7277000	fucking trend, right, like Destiny
7277000	7279000	SimCity, you know
7279000	7281000	the game Loki just talked about and all these other
7281000	7283000	things, so
7283000	7285000	alright, I just got a
7285000	7287000	text message from the person that
7287000	7289000	linked me that story originally that I blew up
7289000	7291000	at, I'll just say it's Jason
7291000	7293000	he doesn't mind me saying that I'm sure, he says
7293000	7295000	in their defense it was
7295000	7297000	an opinion piece, not news, but
7297000	7299000	lol, I was the straw that broke the camel's back
7299000	7301000	this is like congratulations
7301000	7303000	you are the catalyst
7303000	7305000	let me just put it this way, this is
7305000	7307000	this is a website, Rob chose the red ending
7307000	7309000	no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not going back
7309000	7311000	down this road, no, close the door
7311000	7313000	lock it, done, alright
7313000	7315000	moving on, alright, what do you want to
7315000	7317000	I just want to say
7317000	7319000	Gawker figured out animated
7319000	7321000	gifs a couple months ago, and they've
7321000	7323000	been running with it ever since
7325000	7327000	you know the gif format has been on the internet
7327000	7329000	since like the early 90s, I understand that
7329000	7331000	but now they literally have posts
7331000	7333000	they're like, hey look at this, these are
7333000	7335000	some animated gifs I made based off of
7335000	7337000	this trailer that just came out
7337000	7339000	you know, I think it's funny that gif is still associated
7339000	7341000	with CompuServe, so they got a Tumblr
7341000	7343000	account, or started reading, oh no
7343000	7345000	they didn't, because those are the things I associate
7345000	7347000	with the animated gif, I get my best animated
7347000	7349000	gifs ever from OhNoTheyDidn't
7349000	7351000	which is a LiveJournal community and
7351000	7353000	pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal
7353000	7355000	that and Russian Meteorite sightings
7355000	7357000	so, anyhow
7357000	7359000	do they have like sightings like
7359000	7361000	I just saw the Russian Meteorite down Starbucks
7361000	7363000	down the street here, no, well you know LiveJournal
7363000	7365000	is huge in Russia, LiveJournal is like
7365000	7367000	I don't know if it's Facebook big in Russia, it got purchased
7367000	7369000	by a Russian company, yeah I mean, but not
7369000	7371000	that's not the reason it's big in Russia, it just
7371000	7373000	it is big in Russia, I just thought it might have been a meme
7373000	7375000	thing or something like that, where they, it's like
7375000	7377000	no, but like a lot of the YouTubes
7377000	7379000	were linked to people's Russian LiveJournals
7379000	7381000	alright, cool, you know, I'm glad LiveJournal
7381000	7383000	is still alive somewhere, anyhow
7383000	7385000	foogle, hello
7385000	7387000	always online connections and some
7387000	7389000	of our answers from Facebook, which really
7389000	7391000	had a lot of answers on it, so I can't
7391000	7393000	read them all, so please visit our
7393000	7395000	Facebook community and read them all in their entirety
7395000	7397000	facebook.com slash orange lounge
7397000	7399000	radio, Fabrice A
7399000	7401000	says very annoying and they are
7401000	7403000	punishing the wrong people, some people have a
7403000	7405000	crappy internet connection or even no internet
7405000	7407000	connection at all, so they can hardly play
7407000	7409000	people who bought the game legally and suffer
7409000	7411000	one of the previous problems can't play
7411000	7413000	people who play illegally don't
7413000	7415000	have any of those problems because the DRM
7415000	7417000	is absent
7417000	7419000	flaming toilet, god I love that name
7419000	7421000	says I would think that the fiasco with
7421000	7423000	PSN going down for two months a couple
7423000	7425000	years ago would have taught game makers that
7425000	7427000	requiring an always on internet connection
7427000	7429000	is a very bad idea
7429000	7431000	but they're always going to think it's never going to happen
7431000	7433000	to us, how many games were unplayable
7433000	7435000	or almost unplayable during that time
7435000	7437000	because there was no network to connect to
7437000	7439000	thank you flaming toilet for reminding us
7439000	7441000	never forget
7441000	7443000	playstation network fucking went down
7443000	7445000	like it ate shit
7445000	7447000	literal shit for two months
7449000	7451000	horrible
7451000	7453000	cell agent why not says
7453000	7455000	we're sorry, your game is not available at this
7455000	7457000	time, please hang up and try again
7457000	7459000	lolz
7459000	7461000	you remember that crap that actually happened with me in mass effect 3
7461000	7463000	when they were having the origin
7463000	7465000	issues, yes, and I couldn't
7465000	7467000	connect, but I also couldn't play
7467000	7469000	my single player game because it
7469000	7471000	wouldn't verify my DLC
7471000	7473000	yeah
7473000	7475000	Christopher K replies and says
7475000	7477000	the always on idea is such that
7477000	7479000	people won't exploit and mod the games
7479000	7481000	this enables companies to utilize
7481000	7483000	microtransactions and disable cheat
7483000	7485000	codes that allow players replayability
7485000	7487000	if they want to fully explore the game after
7487000	7489000	completion, it's a way for publishers
7489000	7491000	to siphon more than the games retail
7491000	7493000	price for those who want shortcuts
7493000	7495000	there are several countries that still do
7495000	7497000	cap bandwidth or spotty internet coverage
7497000	7499000	why shouldn't I be allowed to play a game
7499000	7501000	I paid for whenever, wherever I
7501000	7503000	like, I'm not too opposed to an
7503000	7505000	online activation of sorts, but let me
7505000	7507000	play offline when I'm traveling
7507000	7509000	you know a good point that this indirectly
7509000	7511000	brings up is that you know we've heard about
7511000	7513000	Destiny's 10 year plan and so forth
7513000	7515000	what happens after 10 years
7515000	7517000	what happens when
7517000	7519000	they want to pull the servers
7519000	7521000	and so forth, where's that
7521000	7523000	$60 investment in the game I made
7523000	7525000	and you know I heard
7525000	7527000	damn I wish I could remember where I heard about this
7527000	7529000	but I remember hearing about one
7529000	7531000	of the reasons why $60 games and people
7531000	7533000	are willing to pay that $60 price is the
7533000	7535000	equity that you're getting in those games
7535000	7537000	the fact that you can turn around and sell those games
7537000	7539000	for a value later, and when you
7539000	7541000	talk about
7541000	7543000	when you talk about robbing people
7543000	7545000	of the ability to sell used games
7545000	7547000	that there's now no
7547000	7549000	equity and there's nothing worth
7549000	7551000	investing $60 in
7551000	7553000	but if your game, you know if you were going to turn off
7553000	7555000	used games and then have it be $30
7555000	7557000	maybe that wouldn't feel like
7557000	7559000	such a blow because the games
7559000	7561000	overall are cheaper and this could actually be a
7561000	7563000	great thing for everybody if the games are really
7563000	7565000	cheap
7565000	7567000	I still think $30 or $40
7567000	7569000	might be too much
7569000	7571000	my point is though
7571000	7573000	I can still plug in an Atari 2600
7573000	7575000	and appreciate the games I grew up on
7575000	7577000	let's say
7577000	7579000	for whatever reason Destiny is a game
7579000	7581000	that Flacco gets his kids to start playing
7581000	7583000	which I doubt but
7583000	7585000	just humor me for a minute here
7585000	7587000	what if they want to revisit that game in their 30s
7587000	7589000	and they can't because the 10 years is up
7589000	7591000	the servers are down, the plug's been pulled
7591000	7593000	what now?
7593000	7595000	it's sad
7595000	7597000	there are games that are like that
7597000	7599000	a lot of these games that were online
7599000	7601000	only or something like that
7601000	7603000	they're just completely useless now
7603000	7605000	I don't know
7605000	7607000	I can't think of anything that you would have
7607000	7609000	but yeah
7609000	7611000	they pull servers all the time
7611000	7613000	so it's very possible
7613000	7615000	I'm sure there's some MMOs, especially some of these
7615000	7617000	Sony MMOs that
7617000	7619000	went offline
7619000	7621000	I know there's a few that we mentioned before
7621000	7623000	even like Playstation 2 games
7623000	7625000	and stuff like that
7625000	7627000	I don't know
7627000	7629000	even big MMOs go down to main
7629000	7631000	say if you bought a boxed copy
7631000	7633000	of The Matrix online or something like that
7633000	7635000	you can never play Tabula Rasa
7637000	7639000	you can never play it
7639000	7641000	Star Wars Galaxies
7641000	7643000	yeah that's right, you will never experience
7643000	7645000	the pre-New Galaxy
7645000	7647000	experience, or the post for that matter
7647000	7649000	ever again in your life
7649000	7651000	I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon
7651000	7653000	he's just gonna get killed
7653000	7655000	the WoW killer is coming out
7655000	7657000	Flaco
7657000	7659000	The WoW killer, Elder Scrolls Online
7659000	7661000	it's the WoW killer, Flaco
7661000	7663000	now Destiny's the WoW killer
7663000	7665000	I keep seeing that in the chat all night
7665000	7667000	they're both killing WoW
7667000	7669000	Miss Scarlet killed WoW
7669000	7671000	in the conservatory with the lead pipe
7671000	7673000	hate boner
7673000	7675000	back to Fugal
7675000	7677000	Burr replied and said
7677000	7679000	in the case of Destiny
7679000	7681000	I can be justified by what they're trying to do
7681000	7683000	with the gameplay, which at least makes me a little
7683000	7685000	more understanding about it
7685000	7687000	however, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?
7687000	7689000	get out of our head
7689000	7691000	I feel like always on DRM is a decision
7691000	7693000	made by focusing too much on the short term
7693000	7695000	if this trend continues
7695000	7697000	future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history
7697000	7699000	when servers inevitably retire
7699000	7701000	or entire publishers go bankrupt
7701000	7703000	I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant
7703000	7705000	fits right in, doesn't it?
7705000	7707000	Red The Haze says
7710000	7712000	not everyone has internet
7712000	7714000	and the US is far from number one
7714000	7716000	when it comes to internet
7716000	7718000	Gary B replies and says
7734000	7736000	I wanted to see if I could Facebook
7736000	7738000	stalk this guy and figure out where he lived
7738000	7741000	is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?
7768000	7770000	or else I'll get
7770000	7772000	behind in some sort of
7772000	7774000	quest or whatever the fuck is going on
7774000	7776000	it might also be something that
7776000	7778000	kind of turns me off to it because
7778000	7780000	I don't have the time to dedicate
7780000	7782000	to an MMO or something like that
7782000	7784000	Last comment
7784000	7786000	I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our
7786000	7788000	Facebook to read them all
7788000	7790000	jlinks says
7798000	7800000	Well I could play FPS's offline
7800000	7802000	in single player, I didn't make that
7802000	7804000	the main reason I bought the game
7804000	7806000	if the game's good and I have the methods available
7806000	7808000	to play it, I'll buy it, simple as that
7808000	7810000	That's our comments
7810000	7812000	from Facebook and Google Plus
7812000	7814000	thank you guys who all responded
7814000	7816000	sorry I didn't read everybody's
7816000	7818000	but it's only a three hour show
7818000	7820000	Let's get to a few more news stories
7820000	7822000	and pretty soon Skype calls
7822000	7824000	Loki
7824000	7826000	I swear to god that Sony is trolling us
7826000	7828000	because there is no way that like
7828000	7830000	I just
7830000	7832000	can't believe that they would actually
7832000	7834000	do this, but apparently
7834000	7836000	there is a patent that they have
7836000	7838000	and I know this is going to come
7838000	7840000	as a shock to you guys, they actually
7840000	7842000	have a tablet that they have patented
7842000	7844000	and I'm really
7844000	7846000	I need to check this out right now
7846000	7848000	to see what it's called, but they're calling
7848000	7850000	the iPad
7850000	7852000	like E-Y-E pad, there is no way that
7852000	7854000	that is called the iPad
7854000	7856000	that's a
7856000	7858000	European patent thing that they're
7858000	7860000	showing me here, it doesn't really help me very much
7860000	7862000	17 pages
7862000	7864000	let's see, 17 pages
7864000	7866000	I think it looks like it's made out of
7866000	7868000	particle board or something like that
7868000	7870000	it's just weird, but basically it's
7870000	7872000	a tablet device, looks thin
7872000	7874000	looks like a directional pad, you know
7874000	7876000	face buttons, possibly a speaker
7876000	7878000	and one analog stick, shame
7878000	7880000	on you Sony, have you not
7880000	7882000	learned from the PSP one analog
7882000	7884000	stick that's more than the iPad's
7884000	7886000	got, well still though
7886000	7888000	I like the big square sharp
7888000	7890000	corner design, reminds me of the NES
7890000	7892000	will I be able to install MAME on this?
7892000	7894000	I don't know
7894000	7896000	so they don't really
7896000	7898000	say, I want to make sure that
7898000	7900000	it's actually called the
7900000	7902000	iPad or
7902000	7904000	I had heard that name too
7904000	7906000	for what it's worth, now
7906000	7908000	I think that someone's making that up
7908000	7910000	I don't honestly think that they
7910000	7912000	would do that, oh my god
7912000	7914000	no, they actually have it
7914000	7916000	called the iPad
7916000	7918000	it makes sense, the Playstation 9
7918000	7920000	but again, take it with a jar of salt
7920000	7922000	a gallon of salt, no
7922000	7924000	it's in their patent information
7924000	7926000	they refer to it as the iPad
7926000	7928000	like E-Y-E pad
7928000	7930000	that's a patent law, that's a lawsuit
7930000	7932000	right there, holy fuck balls really
7932000	7934000	and honestly I think
7934000	7936000	this is something that you would see from a Chinese
7936000	7938000	knock off, you know, like iPad
7938000	7940000	thing that they would actually have it spelled out like that
7940000	7942000	so
7942000	7944000	yeah, so they have this thing
7944000	7946000	patented, who knows
7946000	7948000	there was the iToy
7948000	7950000	that's true
7950000	7952000	I understand why they're using the iPad
7952000	7954000	and the Playstation 9 and all that stuff
7954000	7956000	it makes sense to me, however
7956000	7958000	Apple's gonna go, no, fuck you
7958000	7960000	you can't call it the iPad
7960000	7962000	this really is a whole come at me bro
7962000	7964000	move at Apple
7964000	7966000	but again, huge
7966000	7968000	results, you know, I don't know
7968000	7970000	this seems, it seems unnecessary
7970000	7972000	to have both this and the
7972000	7974000	little thingy built into the controller
7974000	7976000	I don't understand
7976000	7978000	well, here's some of the stuff, let me just read some of the cool things
7978000	7980000	that they're saying that this thing has
7980000	7982000	they're saying that
7982000	7984000	it's gonna have stereoscopic
7984000	7986000	cameras on it, so you're gonna be able to
7986000	7988000	like, I guess, record 3D or
7988000	7990000	something like that, kind of like the 3DS
7992000	7994000	they're saying that there's some
7994000	7996000	sort of
7996000	7998000	weird prism thing going on
7998000	8000000	with their touchpad and stuff
8000000	8002000	it's gonna have 6-axis
8002000	8004000	built into it, at least that's what they're
8004000	8006000	everything has a 6-axis
8006000	8008000	built into it
8008000	8010000	so I guess, you know, we'll have to hear more about it
8010000	8012000	if this is gonna be part of the Playstation 4
8012000	8014000	is this a story coming from my favorite
8014000	8016000	website, because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit
8016000	8018000	no, it's a patent, it's actually a patent
8018000	8020000	this is, I'm reading this
8020000	8022000	you can understand why I'm asking though, right?
8022000	8024000	no, no, no, no, I'm reading all of this
8024000	8026000	yes, they did run this
8026000	8028000	they did run the story as did everyone else
8028000	8030000	but I'm just saying though, this is actually from
8030000	8032000	the patent, I'm reading straight out of the patent
8032000	8034000	description
8034000	8036000	maybe patent, we don't know if it's real
8036000	8038000	right? is it coming from the official patent
8038000	8040000	website, or is it
8040000	8042000	they have a link there or something?
8042000	8044000	well they've got it, it's from
8044000	8046000	it's actually linked from
8046000	8048000	or it's embedded from the European
8048000	8050000	patent applications
8050000	8052000	nah, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it
8052000	8054000	it's true, but
8054000	8056000	it also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games
8056000	8058000	I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily
8058000	8060000	a tie-in to the Playstation 4
8060000	8062000	let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit
8062000	8064000	so why would they not maybe want to come up
8064000	8066000	with a hybrid Playstation tablet
8066000	8068000	well, they're saying though, here's one of the things
8068000	8070000	is therefore, in addition to the convenient
8070000	8072000	joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis
8072000	8074000	controller provides the PS3
8074000	8076000	with data and all that stuff, now they're talking about
8076000	8078000	PS3 a little bit
8078000	8080000	uh
8080000	8082000	I don't know, we'll see
8082000	8084000	it's just
8084000	8086000	it seems a little weird, but
8086000	8088000	they could do it, I guess
8088000	8090000	I mean, they tried to put out some Playstation
8090000	8092000	or Playstation branded
8092000	8094000	tablets
8094000	8096000	that all looked really weird, but
8096000	8098000	who knows, we'll see
8098000	8100000	maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday
8100000	8102000	it's right around the corner
8104000	8106000	yeah, I think they're just covering their bases
8106000	8108000	like all these patent applications
8108000	8110000	iPad, I mean, really
8110000	8112000	just call it like the Playstation
8112000	8114000	tablet or something like that, you know
8114000	8116000	something, Sony Playstation
8116000	8118000	tablet, not iPad, I mean
8118000	8120000	calm down, it's the name in a patent, it's not the final
8120000	8122000	just call it a thingy and be done with it
8122000	8124000	that's right
8124000	8126000	anyhow, one other rumor going
8126000	8128000	around about new consoles that just won't
8128000	8130000	die, is the fact that used
8130000	8132000	games are not going to be playable on it
8132000	8134000	you can bet that Electronic
8134000	8136000	Arts EA is just cheering
8136000	8138000	about this, after all, they're the ones that started
8138000	8140000	the online pass shit, aren't they?
8140000	8142000	well, anyhow, the chief
8142000	8144000	financial officer, Blake Jorgensen
8144000	8146000	had a talk with Gamasutra
8146000	8148000	and Gamasutra asked him
8148000	8150000	about the whole used games and these rumors
8150000	8152000	in response, quote
8152000	8154000	it's one of those classic double-edged
8154000	8156000	swords, in one way
8156000	8158000	the used game business has been critical
8158000	8160000	for the health of the retail channel
8160000	8162000	and having a healthy retail channel
8162000	8164000	is an important thing for us
8164000	8166000	we would like to sell everything at full price
8166000	8168000	would we like to sell everything at full price
8168000	8170000	excuse me, and not have a used games market?
8170000	8172000	sure, but I think the used game market
8172000	8174000	is a little like any other kind of market
8174000	8176000	where it creates liquid
8176000	8178000	I hate this word
8178000	8180000	liquidity
8180000	8182000	the fact is that liquidity benefits
8182000	8184000	us in some fashion
8184000	8186000	so if someone goes in and trades a game
8186000	8188000	there's a good chance they're going to buy another one of our games
8188000	8190000	and so if there's a liquid market
8190000	8192000	I think that's not a bad thing at all
8192000	8194000	so it's
8194000	8196000	sort of like a half admission that
8196000	8198000	maybe used games aren't the worst thing in the world
8198000	8200000	could this be a sign
8200000	8202000	of things to come if EA is
8202000	8204000	openly, or at least one of their executives
8204000	8206000	is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad
8206000	8208000	thing, or are they just setting this up
8208000	8210000	for when the ban hammer comes down
8210000	8212000	on this pretty soon, with the used games
8212000	8214000	any thoughts on EA's comments?
8214000	8216000	Loki?
8216000	8218000	Do you have anything?
8218000	8220000	I think they're already making their money
8220000	8222000	on used games with the whole
8222000	8224000	online passes, I mean I think they were
8224000	8226000	touting before that they made a ton of money on
8226000	8228000	online passes, so to them that's
8228000	8230000	just money in their
8230000	8232000	pockets, I guess
8232000	8234000	I was actually going to say something along similar lines
8234000	8236000	they've found a way to keep making
8236000	8238000	a profit on it, and that is
8238000	8240000	a really, you know
8240000	8242000	with a lot of cases in the
8242000	8244000	used market, the people who
8244000	8246000	are getting rid of their used games are trying to get
8246000	8248000	the new next better, we've
8248000	8250000	even traded in some of our games, some of our
8250000	8252000	crappy ones, to get new games, so
8252000	8254000	it's, and I mean
8254000	8256000	especially it's even better for
8256000	8258000	EA as an example
8258000	8260000	if someone trades in one of their
8260000	8262000	competitor's games to get to one of theirs
8262000	8264000	so I mean, that
8264000	8266000	whole liquid market thing
8266000	8268000	is pretty, I'd say
8268000	8270000	pretty accurate. And also considering that EA
8270000	8272000	is also one of these companies that puts out yearly
8272000	8274000	releases of their sports games, and they probably
8274000	8276000	know that people aren't going to want to
8276000	8278000	hold onto their copy of Madden
8278000	8280000	13 or something like that, when Madden
8280000	8282000	25, the dumbest
8282000	8284000	new, what are they thinking
8284000	8286000	there? Okay we're going to go 13 to 25
8286000	8288000	and then next year it's going to be 15
8288000	8290000	and then in a few years we're going to have
8290000	8292000	25 again. If it's the 25th year
8292000	8294000	I get it, it's not
8294000	8296000	call it like Madden 25th anniversary
8296000	8298000	not Madden 25, it's stupid, anyways
8298000	8300000	that's not the point. The point is
8300000	8302000	that they release games
8302000	8304000	each year and that
8304000	8306000	they know that people are going to need to trade these
8306000	8308000	in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them
8308000	8310000	because they're essentially useless after
8310000	8312000	it comes out. And after
8312000	8314000	all, EA shuts off their servers in a couple years
8314000	8316000	anyways, so you kind of
8316000	8318000	want to trade that in. He is kind of
8318000	8320000	full of dicks right now. Well, here's
8320000	8322000	a further comment I want to, because they were
8322000	8324000	pushed a little further on the whole
8324000	8326000	used games and is that something that's happening
8326000	8328000	in the new consoles. Here was the
8328000	8330000	rest of the quote, quote, I can't really
8330000	8332000	comment on where the next generation boxes
8332000	8334000	are going to be relative to used games.
8334000	8336000	I will say that the trend in the business
8336000	8338000	is to have that always on
8338000	8340000	connectivity and connect with a customer
8340000	8342000	and to the extent that the software identifies
8342000	8344000	a certain customer is going to create
8344000	8346000	some issues going down the road in the used
8346000	8348000	game market. But I do believe that
8348000	8350000	the consumer likes it and it's been
8350000	8352000	good for the retail channel.
8352000	8354000	Um...
8354000	8356000	Um...
8356000	8358000	What? I do believe
8358000	8360000	the consumer likes it. Um...
8360000	8362000	Didn't I just read some
8362000	8364000	frugal answers that didn't seem to go that direction?
8364000	8366000	They like the always on connectivity?
8366000	8368000	And they've done some polls on
8368000	8370000	certain websites that
8370000	8372000	basically have said the same thing. In fact,
8372000	8374000	actually GameStop did a poll. Was it 60%?
8374000	8376000	Over 60% of, you know, people
8376000	8378000	that use GameStop or whatever don't
8378000	8380000	like not having used games.
8380000	8382000	This worries me when that sentence comes
8382000	8384000	out of a game maker's mouth. Is how
8384000	8386000	out of touch are you?
8386000	8388000	See, people in the boardroom
8388000	8390000	think they know what we want.
8390000	8392000	But clearly they don't.
8392000	8394000	But by telling us in an interview
8394000	8396000	this is what gamers want
8396000	8398000	then the more gullible will
8398000	8400000	run with it and, you know, the CNNs
8400000	8402000	will say, oh well, you know,
8402000	8404000	these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers
8404000	8406000	want according to electronics art.
8406000	8408000	Um, why don't you try talking to a
8408000	8410000	gamer? Well, and
8410000	8412000	see, that's the thing. They have a habit
8412000	8414000	of trying to manipulate the
8414000	8416000	data that they find to suit
8416000	8418000	their own purposes. That's, anything can
8418000	8420000	be changed. And they have
8420000	8422000	to get an unbiased source
8422000	8424000	if they're going to have accurate information. But all they want
8424000	8426000	is for people to tell them the same things
8426000	8428000	that's going to support the outcome that they
8428000	8430000	look for. Uh, the
8430000	8432000	legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
8432000	8434000	gives a Homer Simpson quote.
8434000	8436000	Facts are meaningless. You can create facts
8436000	8438000	for something that is remotely true.
8440000	8442000	Interesting note to end that
8442000	8444000	on. Let's move on, DarkSakura.
8444000	8446000	Well, how about, uh,
8446000	8448000	something else EA's managed to fuck up?
8448000	8450000	I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?
8450000	8452000	Okay, EA come close
8452000	8454000	to really royally fucking up. The Mass Effect
8454000	8456000	series.
8456000	8458000	And yes, we warned you, there is
8458000	8460000	Mass Effect news. BioWare
8460000	8462000	is basically saying don't call
8462000	8464000	it Mass Effect 4 because it's
8464000	8466000	implying that it is a
8466000	8468000	another addition to the trilogy.
8468000	8470000	Um, they're saying,
8470000	8472000	um, that basically the
8472000	8474000	trilogy's over. This is another game
8474000	8476000	in the universe. And, uh,
8476000	8478000	the comparison here is, and I'll read the
8478000	8480000	quote from, um, from Priestly.
8480000	8482000	It says, um,
8482000	8484000	if you have three games centered
8484000	8486000	around a group of key soldiers in the
8486000	8488000	US Army during World War I and then decided to make
8488000	8490000	a game about another group of people during the
8490000	8492000	Second World War, the games would have many points
8492000	8494000	in common and feel true to one another.
8494000	8496000	So basically it's saying, you know,
8496000	8498000	it's saying it's not necessarily going to be a
8498000	8500000	prequel or a sequel. It could be set
8500000	8502000	within the same time frame.
8502000	8504000	There could be other things going on, but
8504000	8506000	it's not going to be associated
8506000	8508000	with the Shepard story. So,
8508000	8510000	Mass Effect 4 Moderner Warfare?
8510000	8512000	I have no idea.
8512000	8514000	Um, but they are,
8514000	8516000	um, you know, talking about, uh,
8516000	8518000	it's, uh, being in development
8518000	8520000	with BioWare Montreal and
8520000	8522000	that, uh, that's the same, uh, office
8522000	8524000	that of course gave us this
8524000	8526000	superb multiplayer.
8526000	8528000	As I mentioned before, um,
8528000	8530000	and Mass Effect 2, which is The Crown,
8530000	8532000	it's not necessarily the popular opinion amongst
8532000	8534000	my Mass Effect loving friends, but
8534000	8536000	um, I'm okay with them going a completely
8536000	8538000	different direction and kind of starting over, if
8538000	8540000	you will, because, you know, they created
8540000	8542000	such a great universe the first time
8542000	8544000	that
8544000	8546000	why not get introduced to new people
8546000	8548000	that will be as compelling, if not more so
8548000	8550000	than the first group? That's okay, I think.
8550000	8552000	The only, the thing that would make me happy
8552000	8554000	about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them
8554000	8556000	a production timeline
8556000	8558000	and actually put out
8558000	8560000	a good quality product
8560000	8562000	with great writing, the way that
8562000	8564000	Mass Effect 2 was.
8564000	8566000	That would just completely
8566000	8568000	tickle me to no end. Of course I'm gonna
8568000	8570000	play it, I mean. Sadly that won't happen.
8570000	8572000	I know, right? That's so sad.
8572000	8574000	I mean, and this is the problem is that, yeah,
8574000	8576000	I'm an addict, I'll still play it. I love the universe.
8576000	8578000	You know, even with the,
8578000	8580000	the pieces
8580000	8582000	of shit that are involved in Mass Effect
8582000	8584000	3, I still
8584000	8586000	play the game on, I've probably played it more
8586000	8588000	than 2, just because I like how it
8588000	8590000	plays better. If it keeps using
8590000	8592000	the
8592000	8594000	newer incarnations of the
8594000	8596000	Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.
8596000	8598000	You know, as long as it's fun to play and
8598000	8600000	I get more lore, I'm happy.
8600000	8602000	The multiplayer is so good, too.
8602000	8604000	It is. We should play again, but you don't play on PC
8604000	8606000	anymore, and that makes me sad.
8606000	8608000	I kind of do a mix and match now.
8608000	8610000	Well, then come play online with me.
8611000	8613000	Meh.
8615000	8617000	So anyways, there's yet another
8617000	8619000	rumor going along with the PlayStation 4
8619000	8621000	Orvis, whatever you call it.
8621000	8623000	So that is
8623000	8625000	coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that
8625000	8627000	because they purchased Gaikai,
8627000	8629000	they're going to be using that
8629000	8631000	streaming service to
8631000	8633000	stream PlayStation 3 games to
8633000	8635000	the new PlayStation.
8635000	8637000	Basically saying that there's not
8637000	8639000	going to be really any backwards compatibility
8639000	8641000	with the old system, which makes sense.
8641000	8643000	I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility.
8643000	8645000	A lot of it
8645000	8647000	is being offered as
8647000	8649000	downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.
8649000	8651000	Basically
8651000	8653000	saying that this is also going to kind of coincide with
8653000	8655000	also physical releases for
8655000	8657000	PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.
8657000	8659000	I can see
8659000	8661000	this as kind of an evolution of
8661000	8663000	that whole
8663000	8665000	PlayStation Plus game library thing,
8665000	8667000	because right now you have to download and install
8667000	8669000	everything, which takes fucking forever.
8669000	8671000	Whereas this, you could be just like
8671000	8673000	okay, I want to play, uh,
8673000	8675000	Steam 302. Go.
8675000	8677000	And then just load it up and stream it.
8677000	8679000	And the hour-long game trials, too.
8679000	8681000	Like, you have to actually
8681000	8683000	download the entire game to play
8683000	8685000	for an hour and then just delete it.
8687000	8689000	So, once again, we'll see.
8691000	8693000	I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming
8693000	8695000	in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.
8695000	8697000	I spent so much money on that. Obviously, it's going to be
8697000	8699000	integrated somehow.
8699000	8701000	I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week, too.
8701000	8703000	That seems something obvious that they could
8703000	8705000	talk about. They could almost do that with
8705000	8707000	the PlayStation 3.
8707000	8709000	I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that
8709000	8711000	is PlayStation 4. I think that they could
8711000	8713000	do this, hey, you guys,
8713000	8715000	you know how you have that online game library
8715000	8717000	right now? Well, guess what?
8717000	8719000	We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff
8719000	8721000	instantly. It makes sense, because
8721000	8723000	part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so
8723000	8725000	expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2
8725000	8727000	inside of it as well, so it could run all the games.
8727000	8729000	And then when they started cutting that out
8729000	8731000	and getting the price down,
8731000	8733000	you know, that disappeared.
8733000	8735000	So maybe they're trying to not
8735000	8737000	wow us with a $599
8737000	8739000	US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4.
8739000	8741000	Probably more like
8741000	8743000	$499. But, you know,
8743000	8745000	don't expect it to be
8745000	8747000	that low. But this
8747000	8749000	is one way they'll be able to save some money on
8749000	8751000	the console and maybe not have it be so expensive
8751000	8753000	is that they're going to use the streaming technology
8753000	8755000	to emulate some of the
8755000	8757000	older games. I hope, though, that it's
8757000	8759000	just an option. That you can
8759000	8761000	also, like, okay, you can stream it, or you
8761000	8763000	can download it, because, once again,
8763000	8765000	if their service goes to shit,
8765000	8767000	then that's going to suck not being
8767000	8769000	able to play your game, because
8769000	8771000	you can't stream it anymore.
8771000	8773000	I would assume that you'd be able to
8773000	8775000	download it as well. I hope that you could
8775000	8777000	do that. Shadownextgen with a comment in our
8777000	8779000	chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
8779000	8781000	PlayStation Network is in no way good enough
8781000	8783000	to do streaming gameplay like that.
8783000	8785000	Even with Gaikai.
8785000	8787000	Is PlayStation Network ready for that
8787000	8789000	kind of bandwidth?
8789000	8791000	It's a fair question. Let's put it this way, though.
8791000	8793000	We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with, like, some
8793000	8795000	of the demos with, like, FIFA and stuff like that
8795000	8797000	through a web browser and stuff. I think they
8797000	8799000	could probably handle it.
8801000	8803000	Is it going to look good, though, coming through
8803000	8805000	your bandwidth? You know, like,
8805000	8807000	through your internet connections, again,
8807000	8809000	like, all fucking pixelated and shit?
8809000	8811000	I don't know.
8811000	8813000	That's...
8813000	8815000	We'll just have to see, I guess.
8815000	8817000	Alright.
8817000	8819000	Kind of a follow-up
8819000	8821000	story of sorts. You remember when
8821000	8823000	we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan
8823000	8825000	and how it's going to this free-to-play model
8825000	8827000	on the Wii U? That hasn't
8827000	8829000	arrived in America yet, but
8829000	8831000	guess what? It's going to happen in
8831000	8833000	Europe as well. Europe will be the next
8833000	8835000	region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.
8835000	8837000	The base download will have
8837000	8839000	Monster Battle, Free-for-All, and Team
8839000	8841000	Versus, and you can play them up to three times.
8841000	8843000	Woohoo.
8843000	8845000	The first add-on is MyKong,
8845000	8847000	which will cost
8847000	8849000	$1.99 in Euros
8849000	8851000	through February 28th.
8851000	8853000	Interesting.
8853000	8855000	I want to fight the bees!
8855000	8857000	I hear the game's not very good, but
8857000	8859000	I mean, it's a fun arcade game, but
8859000	8861000	I don't know.
8861000	8863000	As much as I love the game, I really don't see it
8863000	8865000	as well. Unless everyone has
8865000	8867000	the things. I think the free-to-play
8867000	8869000	model is certainly interesting.
8869000	8871000	Anybody
8871000	8873000	interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?
8873000	8875000	Do you think they will roll this out
8875000	8877000	to the States next? Anybody?
8877000	8879000	I'd have to, I think.
8879000	8881000	I think they'll eventually roll it out to the States.
8881000	8883000	I'd be interested to see
8883000	8885000	I guess I'm a little bit
8885000	8887000	I don't know. Namco's
8887000	8889000	tried doing this whole free-to-play
8889000	8891000	type approach for some of
8891000	8893000	their games. It didn't work out so well
8893000	8895000	with the Ridge Racer on the Vita.
8895000	8897000	Remember that? Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.
8897000	8899000	That was, pay $30, $40
8899000	8901000	and get nothing.
8901000	8903000	Get a demo, and then buy
8903000	8905000	extra crap for it.
8905000	8907000	So that kind of sucked, but
8907000	8909000	we'll see.
8909000	8911000	$2 is not that bad for an
8911000	8913000	add-on.
8915000	8917000	Let's go to the mailbag. Every week
8917000	8919000	you guys send us emails. Mailbag at
8919000	8921000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8921000	8923000	and we read them here on the show.
8931000	8933000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8933000	8935000	where you can send us emails every week.
8935000	8937000	We have one email this week and
8937000	8939000	I'll go ahead and read it. It just came in
8939000	8941000	like an hour ago. I'll go ahead and read it.
8941000	8943000	No biggie.
8943000	8945000	It's a gem of an email, so I want to
8945000	8947000	read this through. Alright.
8947000	8949000	Here we go.
8949000	8951000	Hey, OLR.
8951000	8953000	First off, it seems like you guys have
8953000	8955000	joined the rest of the media in spending
8955000	8957000	time on every next-gen rumor that
8957000	8959000	comes down the pike, no matter how
8959000	8961000	hilarious or ill-thought. It's
8961000	8963000	been proven that the mainstream games media
8963000	8965000	can be easily fooled into believing anything,
8965000	8967000	as has been shown by various
8967000	8969000	angry forumites and Tumblr people all
8969000	8971000	over the years. And while I know that the
8971000	8973000	blogs will go after anything that gets clicks,
8973000	8975000	why do you guys spend time on nonsense
8975000	8977000	rumors? That's a good
8977000	8979000	question. In what way does
8979000	8981000	panic-mongering help the show?
8981000	8983000	It's clearly not bringing in the page
8983000	8985000	hits. Clearly
8985000	8987000	it's not. How rude.
8987000	8989000	But you're here. That's what counts.
8989000	8991000	Have you guys ever thought
8991000	8993000	of vetting these rumors, trying to
8993000	8995000	sift the possibly legitimate things
8995000	8997000	from the blatant and senseless bullshit?
8997000	8999000	Well, I am glad
8999000	9001000	that you asked that question. Because
9001000	9003000	that is a great... We should
9003000	9005000	go vet those rumors. In fact, let me
9005000	9007000	place a call to Sony right now
9007000	9009000	and ask that question. I know, right?
9009000	9011000	Let me just, let me get them on the line and
9011000	9013000	see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4
9013000	9015000	rumors. Because you know, as you
9015000	9017000	mentioned before, it isn't going any
9017000	9019000	distance and getting us hits at all
9019000	9021000	that, you know, sites like
9021000	9023000	I don't know, the ESA, when measuring
9023000	9025000	E3, doesn't even want to take a second look
9025000	9027000	at independent podcasts and all that stuff.
9027000	9029000	Clearly, these guys are on my
9029000	9031000	speed dial, and I can vet
9031000	9033000	this shit till the cows come home.
9033000	9035000	I was just talking...
9035000	9037000	Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.
9037000	9039000	I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?
9039000	9041000	Oh yeah. Oh yeah, we were chillin'.
9041000	9043000	Absolutely. We'll get some fro-yo
9043000	9045000	afterwards. I got photos of my
9045000	9047000	Dan and Yu Suzuki, which is actually
9047000	9049000	true, I do. Let me put a little reminder
9049000	9051000	out there about what this show is all
9051000	9053000	about, alright? In case you forgot.
9053000	9055000	Uh, this
9055000	9057000	show started because we all played
9057000	9059000	DDR at the arcades, and after
9059000	9061000	DDR, we would go and we would go to the
9061000	9063000	restaurant that was down the street, and we would
9063000	9065000	sit around over, you know, food that was bad
9065000	9067000	for us, like mozzarella sticks and so
9067000	9069000	forth. Fried cheese. Oh god, they're so fucking
9069000	9071000	good, huh? And we would talk smack about
9071000	9073000	what's going on in games, and you know
9073000	9075000	what happens a lot of times when people are talking
9075000	9077000	smack? They're talking about the
9077000	9079000	rumors and things that go around in the
9079000	9081000	industry. You know, I can't think
9081000	9083000	of a time when we've said this stuff on
9083000	9085000	air and said, you know, this is fact,
9085000	9087000	people. Believe this, people. You know,
9087000	9089000	I think we like to bring these ideas
9089000	9091000	up and say, this is a rumor,
9091000	9093000	take it with a grain of salt, like I think
9093000	9095000	we just said about that iPad thing.
9095000	9097000	Or ask people what they think
9097000	9099000	about it. Exactly. What's wrong with
9099000	9101000	discussion? What is wrong with discussing
9101000	9103000	and talking about ideas? Because
9103000	9105000	some rumors do
9105000	9107000	pan out to be true. So
9107000	9109000	why not talk about
9109000	9111000	what goes through the heads
9111000	9113000	of these people that don't really
9113000	9115000	want to be so ready to talk about
9115000	9117000	these things? And I think that's what
9117000	9119000	we try to do with the community. So
9119000	9121000	if you have an opinion on these rumors
9121000	9123000	besides the fact that these rumors are
9123000	9125000	bullshit, well, why don't you share that opinion
9125000	9127000	with us? That's what the show is set up for, where
9127000	9129000	every gamer has a voice. So
9129000	9131000	tell us a little bit about what you think
9131000	9133000	these rumors could be good or
9133000	9135000	bad for the future. Such
9135000	9137000	as we just talked a little bit about destiny
9137000	9139000	and the fact that it requires an always
9139000	9141000	online connection. That is fact,
9141000	9143000	not rumor. They said that
9143000	9145000	today. But that's something that's going to impact
9145000	9147000	the game industry. The whole fact
9147000	9149000	about used games being banned on the new
9149000	9151000	consoles. That's a rumor, yes.
9151000	9153000	But I think all of us sit
9153000	9155000	here and go, do you think, can you
9155000	9157000	sit there and you honestly think to yourself
9157000	9159000	that in no boardroom ever
9159000	9161000	has it been said by a senior
9161000	9163000	executive, we should lock out
9163000	9165000	new games on the new console.
9165000	9167000	Use games. Is that what
9167000	9169000	I said? Lock out new games.
9169000	9171000	Lock out the new ones.
9171000	9173000	Then we have to do an even newer system and have to
9173000	9175000	charge them.
9175000	9177000	The online pass idea came
9177000	9179000	from somewhere.
9179000	9181000	Rumors are often
9181000	9183000	founded in fact.
9183000	9185000	I just don't think this was a very well thought
9185000	9187000	out email, honestly.
9187000	9189000	But
9189000	9191000	the biggest thing too is that
9191000	9193000	I actually like looking at the rumors
9193000	9195000	and the speculation and keeping
9195000	9197000	track of it so I can see what legitimately
9197000	9199000	happens when something comes out to see
9199000	9201000	who was right, who was on the right track.
9201000	9203000	Was our technology really
9203000	9205000	in the place where we had
9205000	9207000	this capability? For me
9207000	9209000	it's actually a gauge of how
9209000	9211000	ambitious consumer
9211000	9213000	level technology is.
9213000	9215000	I think it's neat.
9215000	9217000	Black Wolf
9217000	9219000	in Chat says, I'm not a journalist. I'm a
9219000	9221000	commentator. I don't actually have the resources
9221000	9223000	to be a real journalist.
9223000	9225000	Well, what is a real journalist anyway?
9225000	9227000	Because some things that get away with
9227000	9229000	being real journalism are a little
9229000	9231000	bit laughable. But anyway
9231000	9233000	I do like that comparison.
9233000	9235000	I'm not a games journalist either,
9235000	9237000	really. I actually think more than anything I'm a
9237000	9239000	games analyst.
9239000	9241000	I will analyze the shit out of your game. I say
9241000	9243000	that with a straight face too.
9243000	9245000	I'm a games analyst. A lot of you are games
9245000	9247000	analysts too. You really are.
9247000	9249000	Some people are just anal. We've been
9249000	9251000	sitting here talking about games for 11 years and
9251000	9253000	there's some other guys that go out there
9253000	9255000	in every story and being interviewed with
9255000	9257000	a games analyst title. But you know what?
9257000	9259000	They get about as much stuff right as we do.
9259000	9261000	And about as much wrong as we do. Because
9261000	9263000	one of those games analysts was out there this week,
9263000	9265000	a big one in fact, talking about how this is
9265000	9267000	the doom and gloom, the end all be all for Nintendo.
9267000	9269000	And that Nintendo is fucked. And I'm
9269000	9271000	thinking like, dude, what are you smoking?
9271000	9273000	It is way too fucking early to say anything
9273000	9275000	about that. I don't care what degree you have under your belt.
9275000	9277000	This is, this is just not
9277000	9279000	like
9279000	9281000	it's not, it is way too
9281000	9283000	early to say something like that.
9283000	9285000	A year from now, maybe. But this is Nintendo
9285000	9287000	we're talking about. Come on.
9287000	9289000	It's one thing to bring up rumor
9289000	9291000	without having anything to substantiate
9291000	9293000	it. It's completely
9293000	9295000	different if you actually have items
9295000	9297000	that are going to back it up. Like, okay, for example,
9297000	9299000	let's say that
9299000	9301000	it's a year from now and Nintendo
9301000	9303000	has continued to have dismal sales
9303000	9305000	and we're starting to see extreme
9305000	9307000	price reductions on the Wii U
9307000	9309000	and we're starting to see the
9309000	9311000	3DS
9311000	9313000	game sales drop, then
9313000	9315000	at that point it might be safe to speculate
9315000	9317000	that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.
9317000	9319000	But right now, like
9319000	9321000	you said, no. It's completely
9321000	9323000	different just to completely sensationalize
9323000	9325000	something and try to get
9325000	9327000	people to back you up by being
9327000	9329000	even more sensational about
9329000	9331000	it as opposed to stating
9331000	9333000	well, this is what's being said.
9333000	9335000	This is what we've seen. Make your
9335000	9337000	own decision. There's people out there
9337000	9339000	who will just read anything and believe it immediately.
9339000	9341000	It's just like, you'll see
9341000	9343000	commenters on news stories
9343000	9345000	where they're talking about a rumor and they're like
9345000	9347000	that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.
9347000	9349000	It's like, if that's
9349000	9351000	true, then I'm not buying an Xbox
9351000	9353000	or if that's
9353000	9355000	true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.
9355000	9357000	It's like, oh, this is absolute fact
9357000	9359000	because it's coming to me from
9359000	9361000	this gaming blog that I trust their
9361000	9363000	information, so therefore it is
9363000	9365000	I am not going to buy this
9365000	9367000	console. These are the people that are
9367000	9369000	fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind
9369000	9371000	eight times. These are the ones that
9371000	9373000	start a petition or join a group
9373000	9375000	that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game
9375000	9377000	and then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.
9377000	9379000	I mean, whatever.
9379000	9381000	But yeah, I think
9381000	9383000	I know for a fact that
9383000	9385000	and this comes from just my line of work
9385000	9387000	that I don't deal in guarantees.
9387000	9389000	I know that.
9389000	9391000	I'm always
9391000	9393000	leaving myself a way out
9393000	9395000	and there's no way that I'm saying anything
9395000	9397000	is absolute fact unless
9397000	9399000	I actually see it.
9399000	9401000	Now, rostielut is in chat right now and says
9401000	9403000	makes a note that I'm now hated.
9403000	9405000	I didn't say I hated you.
9405000	9407000	No one said we hated you.
9407000	9409000	But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys
9409000	9411000	spend time on nonsense rumors?
9411000	9413000	In what way does panic mongering help the show?
9413000	9415000	I just thought I would express
9415000	9417000	why we spend time on nonsense rumors.
9417000	9419000	I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme
9419000	9421000	of a viewpoint. It's not like we're sitting here going
9421000	9423000	AHHHHH!
9423000	9425000	So under Nintendo! Oh my god!
9425000	9427000	I could hear once.
9429000	9431000	Run!
9431000	9433000	Plus, if the site gets more hits
9433000	9435000	I might lose to bog the game.
9435000	9437000	That's what it's really
9437000	9439000	about, isn't it? That's what I care about.
9441000	9443000	Alright, let's get to the other half
9443000	9445000	of the email which is a question
9445000	9447000	I think is a little
9447000	9449000	a little more up our alley.
9449000	9451000	Secondly, Aliens Colonel
9451000	9453000	Marines has been released after seven years
9453000	9455000	development and the consensus seems to be that it's
9455000	9457000	a hot mess.
9457000	9459000	This is the type of email I like to get.
9459000	9461000	It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem
9461000	9463000	Forever, the game had a protracted
9463000	9465000	crap ton of development houses working
9465000	9467000	on it. My question here is this.
9467000	9469000	At what point are there too many hands
9469000	9471000	in the pot and when should a project
9471000	9473000	just be cancelled? In my view
9473000	9475000	anything past three years in two development
9475000	9477000	houses is asking for disaster.
9477000	9479000	It's all about contracts you sign.
9479000	9481000	Cooks in the soup.
9481000	9483000	And what you're going to be responsible
9483000	9485000	for if you don't come through with the product
9485000	9487000	you promised whoever paid you
9487000	9489000	money to come through with.
9489000	9491000	Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled
9491000	9493000	at one point, was it not? Like when the company
9493000	9495000	went out of business and Gearbox essentially just
9495000	9497000	bought what was left over from it.
9497000	9499000	Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.
9499000	9501000	But they kind of
9501000	9503000	picked up the ashes and released what
9503000	9505000	they did for better or for worse.
9505000	9507000	Right?
9511000	9513000	It's a
9513000	9515000	question with a lot of gray area because it's not like
9515000	9517000	you can draw a line and say
9517000	9519000	you did three years in two development houses.
9519000	9521000	Well that doesn't necessarily
9521000	9523000	take everything into effect because I think a game
9523000	9525000	like Smash Brothers
9525000	9527000	didn't the one on the Wii take more
9527000	9529000	than three years to develop? I think it did.
9529000	9531000	Didn't it take more like four?
9531000	9533000	You know and it came out okay.
9533000	9535000	The game was pretty good. It's one of the better Wii titles.
9535000	9537000	You know it worked out.
9537000	9539000	So you know I don't think
9539000	9541000	you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long.
9541000	9543000	How long has Bioshock Infinite been
9543000	9545000	in development?
9545000	9547000	Delayed by years.
9547000	9549000	Or
9549000	9551000	maybe how long has
9551000	9553000	Last Guardian been in development?
9553000	9555000	Well that's never going to come out.
9555000	9557000	How about Final Fantasy Versus
9557000	9559000	13? Yeah
9559000	9561000	there's a great example huh?
9561000	9563000	Yeah but the
9563000	9565000	Agito 13 came out at zero.
9565000	9567000	So anyway
9567000	9569000	I don't think there is a line you can
9569000	9571000	draw but I think there does come a point where
9571000	9573000	somebody has to assess it and this is what
9573000	9575000	happens once in a while and this is why games get cancelled.
9575000	9577000	Is that somebody walks in there every three months
9577000	9579000	and says I'm here representing the people
9579000	9581000	who put their money into this and is paying
9581000	9583000	all your paychecks right now. Show me what you
9583000	9585000	got. And if it doesn't live up to expectations
9585000	9587000	done. Cancelled. Money pulled.
9587000	9589000	That's what happens. That's part
9589000	9591000	of the ebb and flow of it. So you know if there's
9591000	9593000	enough development and things to show
9593000	9595000	every few months the game keeps
9595000	9597000	going but if it stops the game
9597000	9599000	is done.
9601000	9603000	I wonder if it's just one of those things where they just
9603000	9605000	they just they crapped out what they had
9605000	9607000	it sounds like they shoved it off to this other
9607000	9609000	company to finish it off what they'd started
9609000	9611000	and it was just kind of a mess
9611000	9613000	like it just sounds like maybe it was just like
9613000	9615000	mismanaged and I don't know but I haven't
9615000	9617000	played the game so I feel weird kind of sitting here
9617000	9619000	and giving all these opinions on a game I haven't played.
9619000	9621000	I can really only go off of what you know the internet
9621000	9623000	is saying about it.
9623000	9625000	And the bugs of the internet are talking about are
9625000	9627000	nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim
9627000	9629000	Red Dead Redemption Saints Bro
9629000	9631000	I mean that's
9631000	9633000	that's child's play.
9633000	9635000	Those games have bugs down to
9635000	9637000	a fine art. Anyway
9637000	9639000	have a good show guys.
9639000	9641000	We're having a great show.
9641000	9643000	It's great.
9643000	9645000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com
9645000	9647000	if you want to help us be a great show too.
9647000	9649000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9665000	9667000	Two
9667000	9669000	The self entitled wads of
9669000	9671000	fuck that drive in the parking lot
9671000	9673000	at Whole Foods.
9673000	9675000	I don't care how expensive
9675000	9677000	your damn car is
9677000	9679000	or how much gas it guzzles
9679000	9681000	or how organic you fucking eat.
9681000	9683000	Learn to fucking
9683000	9685000	drive.
9685000	9687000	I know.
9687000	9689000	You find assholes of all
9689000	9691000	varieties and not just inside
9691000	9693000	the shopping place.
9693000	9695000	Another one goes
9695000	9697000	to
9697000	9699000	oh yeah
9699000	9701000	goes to
9701000	9703000	Legend and the Mass Effect
9703000	9705000	3 update
9705000	9707000	that just happened because I want my
9707000	9709000	console back.
9709000	9711000	However
9711000	9713000	I once again got fly cam working.
9713000	9715000	And
9715000	9717000	I think being sick
9717000	9719000	because my son just drives
9719000	9721000	every single illness like a
9721000	9723000	like a fisherman's neck
9723000	9725000	for illness.
9725000	9727000	So that kind of sucks.
9727000	9729000	That's what children do. That's their revenge.
9729000	9731000	Discipline.
9731000	9733000	I don't know.
9733000	9735000	So
9735000	9737000	I guess FU to that and
9737000	9739000	FU to having to move my desk upstairs
9739000	9741000	because for some dumb
9741000	9743000	reason management thought it was a great idea
9743000	9745000	to fucking flip the building upside
9745000	9747000	down and so they have
9747000	9749000	you know everybody
9749000	9751000	from the third floor moving to the second floor and
9751000	9753000	everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit
9753000	9755000	I got to move because I store all sorts of weird
9755000	9757000	shit at my desk like arcade parts.
9757000	9759000	So you know
9759000	9761000	it's a little weird.
9761000	9763000	I have an MP5
9763000	9765000	and a System 573
9765000	9767000	board for Dance Maniac
9767000	9769000	Second Mix, a coin box
9769000	9771000	and a Neo Geo arcade board
9771000	9773000	at my desk among a bunch of
9773000	9775000	figurines. I have a Gundam
9775000	9777000	collection. I have anime
9777000	9779000	stuff up on my shelves.
9779000	9781000	And I have a what I consider
9781000	9783000	life size paper craft
9783000	9785000	model of a Koopa.
9785000	9787000	And I have a chicken
9787000	9789000	that has an Elibit riding on top
9789000	9791000	of it. That's right. I have a chicken
9791000	9793000	with an Elibit riding on top.
9793000	9795000	Does anyone fucking remember Elibits?
9795000	9797000	Hello? Konami?
9797000	9799000	Let's make another Elibits game.
9799000	9801000	Waco go ahead.
9801000	9803000	Uh
9803000	9805000	gosh I was talking about this with my wife
9805000	9807000	and I was like you know what FU
9807000	9809000	to the podcast app
9809000	9811000	on iPod, iPhone
9811000	9813000	which is pretty old but I finally updated
9813000	9815000	my iPod even though I heard it was
9815000	9817000	terrible and I was really mad
9817000	9819000	because I couldn't scan through
9819000	9821000	the show to find like every time I plug
9821000	9823000	it into my car it would reset back to the start and I
9823000	9825000	hated that. But before I could always just
9825000	9827000	you know like
9827000	9829000	kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at
9829000	9831000	but I couldn't do that and I couldn't figure it out. Well my wife
9831000	9833000	grabs it and two seconds later she finds
9833000	9835000	out how to do it. You swipe the little
9835000	9837000	logo for the show up and then there's a
9837000	9839000	deal up there and you shut all of that. I feel so
9839000	9841000	stupid but the podcast app is terrible.
9841000	9843000	Still terrible so still FU the
9843000	9845000	podcast app is terrible. Honestly use Stitcher
9845000	9847000	to listen to the show. Sorry but
9847000	9849000	you got to stream on Stitcher don't you? Yeah
9849000	9851000	yeah I got to download because I listen in the
9851000	9853000	car. Actually I think Stitcher
9853000	9855000	will now let you download. I want to say that's something
9855000	9857000	they added to because a lot of podcasters
9857000	9859000	were complaining about that. I think they
9859000	9861000	added that. I'll check that out. Yeah
9861000	9863000	I listen in the car so I can't stream.
9863000	9865000	Don't
9865000	9867000	don't
9867000	9869000	Alright my FU of the week goes to the fact that
9869000	9871000	I don't have tomorrow off unlike
9871000	9873000	a lot of yous. I don't either.
9873000	9875000	I'm unemployed.
9875000	9877000	I have tomorrow off. I'm going to
9877000	9879000	sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.
9879000	9881000	Bananas in pajamas.
9881000	9883000	So FU to that I don't get tomorrow off.
9883000	9885000	What's a President's Day?
9885000	9887000	Also FU to Shane.
9887000	9889000	Fucking bot Pokemon
9889000	9891000	games.
9891000	9893000	You can buy next the fucking
9893000	9895000	Power Rangers game. No.
9895000	9897000	We've had this discussion. I said that's one
9897000	9899000	that's one you're not going to get. Oh my god
9899000	9901000	isn't there a new Sentai series out? Shane
9901000	9903000	is there a new Sentai series out because I
9903000	9905000	want to watch it. Follow his Facebook. He says it's terrible.
9905000	9907000	They have that new
9907000	9909000	one now. It's a new movie that's coming out
9909000	9911000	that's
9911000	9913000	the pervert one.
9913000	9915000	The guy that wears the
9915000	9917000	panties over his face or something like that.
9917000	9919000	What? It's like a
9919000	9921000	hentai something.
9921000	9923000	I don't remember what it's called now.
9923000	9925000	It looks funny.
9925000	9927000	Because he does this weird penis spin
9927000	9929000	on some guy's face
9929000	9931000	or something.
9931000	9933000	He wears
9933000	9935000	he wears hentai not sentai.
9935000	9937000	Back away from Loki a little bit here.
9937000	9939000	Oh no I think Shane was talking about the new
9939000	9941000	American version is really
9941000	9943000	terrible or something.
9943000	9945000	Megaforce Rangers. And here we all are
9945000	9947000	entertaining this fucking
9947000	9949000	Power Rangers discussion. Knock it off.
9949000	9951000	Hey you hush.
9951000	9953000	I have like two laser discs.
9953000	9955000	One of them is Mega Ranger vs.
9955000	9957000	Car Ranger. And the other one is
9957000	9959000	like another I think Mega Ranger movie.
9959000	9961000	So shut up. It is
9961000	9963000	hentai common.
9963000	9965000	Hentai common. Hentai common.
9965000	9967000	Yes. They have a brand new
9967000	9969000	super hero
9969000	9971000	movie.
9971000	9973000	Alright let's go to a few more
9973000	9975000	topics for you guys and then we're going to get to the
9975000	9977000	Skype line at 1877 Game O
9977000	9979000	L R or our username on Skype.
9979000	9981000	Loki. So there's some
9981000	9983000	Kickstarter games that are actually getting
9983000	9985000	publishers which is kind of cool.
9985000	9987000	One of them is
9987000	9989000	this game called Take Down.
9989000	9991000	It's like a tactical shooter
9991000	9993000	game. They're seeing kind of like a
9993000	9995000	slow paced Tom Clancy's
9995000	9997000	Ghost Recon or something like that.
9997000	9999000	Sort of
9999000	10001000	like that sort of series
10001000	10003000	I guess. But
10003000	10005000	it's going to be coming out by five of five games
10005000	10007000	called Take Down Red Saber.
10007000	10009000	And I guess the guy that developed it was
10009000	10011000	Christian Allen. Oh I guess that's why it's similar to
10011000	10013000	Tom Grant. He was one of the creative
10013000	10015000	directors for the Ghost Recon series and
10015000	10017000	also I guess
10017000	10019000	SWAT and Rainbow Six.
10019000	10021000	So that's kind of cool.
10021000	10023000	So that's going to be coming out.
10023000	10025000	It doesn't say when though but sometime in
10025000	10027000	2013. And then
10027000	10029000	Wildman. Remember that was the one that
10029000	10031000	was being done by Gas Powered Games
10031000	10033000	kind of like as the last ditch
10033000	10035000	hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going
10035000	10037000	out of business thing. Well actually
10037000	10039000	they canceled their Kickstarter.
10039000	10041000	So
10041000	10043000	and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter
10043000	10045000	is because they got purchased by Wargaming.
10045000	10047000	Because I think World of Tanks.
10047000	10049000	So no word if they're going to still
10049000	10051000	be doing the Wildman game but
10051000	10053000	at least now they have some funding.
10057000	10059000	So that's good.
10061000	10063000	Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.
10063000	10065000	I got one here too. It's about a
10065000	10067000	90's arcade racer. Because there's just
10067000	10069000	not enough Daytona USA in your life.
10069000	10071000	And the like.
10071000	10073000	It looks awesome.
10077000	10079000	Nysalis. Is that how you say their name?
10079000	10081000	Nysalis. They are doing
10081000	10083000	this Kickstarter for what's called the 90's
10083000	10085000	arcade racer. It has already exceeded
10085000	10087000	the 10,000 pound gold
10087000	10089000	that they had set. Nysalis
10089000	10091000	made Cave Story.
10091000	10093000	And they are going to do this new racing game
10093000	10095000	for iOS, Android, and Wii U.
10095000	10097000	Well I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing
10097000	10099000	their, they picked it up. Oh that's the publisher.
10099000	10101000	Yeah they picked it up. Thank you. They are the
10101000	10103000	publisher. The
10103000	10105000	producer is Tyrone Rodriguez
10105000	10107000	is the
10107000	10109000	Nysalis producer who will be
10109000	10111000	producing and helping the game come to
10111000	10113000	the iOS, Android, and Wii U.
10113000	10115000	Which I think is interesting. Here's one that
10115000	10117000	now we're not talking about 360
10117000	10119000	or Playstation. It's Wii U. PC,
10119000	10121000	Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.
10121000	10123000	It looks cool.
10123000	10125000	Yeah. I almost backed it
10125000	10127000	but I'm poor.
10127000	10129000	But I'm poor.
10129000	10131000	Alright. That's it.
10131000	10133000	We're going to get to the Skype line.
10133000	10135000	1877 Game OLR. Or our user name
10135000	10137000	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
10137000	10139000	We will talk about
10139000	10141000	what's going on in games.
10141000	10143000	Whatever you want to talk about tonight.
10143000	10145000	We've had a lot of stuff tonight. I'm sure it's going to
10145000	10147000	elicit some sort of reaction. So the Skype line is open
10147000	10149000	now. While we wait for some calls
10149000	10151000	Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?
10151000	10153000	Um...
10153000	10155000	Nah. I didn't really have anything
10155000	10157000	I wanted to talk about other than
10157000	10159000	I wanted to go into a little bit more
10159000	10161000	detail with that whole iPad thing.
10161000	10163000	Because they had some cool notes
10163000	10165000	that I missed in there after I read through it.
10165000	10167000	Apparently those
10167000	10169000	cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant
10169000	10171000	for capturing objects that you
10171000	10173000	place on top of it. So basically
10173000	10175000	it would capture both sides of a 3D object
10175000	10177000	or they even may have
10177000	10179000	more than just a couple cameras on there.
10179000	10181000	And it would import the full
10181000	10183000	3D object into your game.
10183000	10185000	Which is kind of cool.
10185000	10187000	Of course, you know, they said
10187000	10189000	6 axis
10189000	10191000	They're supposed to have some sort of LED
10191000	10193000	strips on the side. I guess that part that looked
10193000	10195000	like the whole
10195000	10197000	what is it, a plywood thing.
10197000	10199000	Let me go to the phones because we're getting
10199000	10201000	calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10201000	10203000	Hey, can you guys hear me? Hi, we can hear you.
10203000	10205000	Alright. I just wanted to say
10205000	10207000	Hey, what's up guys?
10207000	10209000	Long time no talk to you. Who is this?
10209000	10211000	Introduce yourself.
10211000	10213000	It's Gamer Girl.
10213000	10215000	Gamer Girl! How you doing, Gamer Girl?
10217000	10219000	So
10219000	10221000	I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know
10221000	10223000	what to talk about.
10223000	10225000	I think she's also
10225000	10227000	Oh, I think you're listening to us
10227000	10229000	I hear a little bit of echo.
10229000	10231000	You might want to mute the radio in the background there.
10231000	10233000	Well, that's no problem.
10233000	10235000	You're just going through your head when you hit the dial button.
10235000	10237000	Is it still echoing?
10237000	10239000	Uh huh.
10239000	10241000	Um, hold on a second.
10241000	10243000	We'll hold. We'll wait.
10243000	10245000	There's nothing we got to do.
10245000	10247000	We don't got nothing better to do.
10247000	10249000	We'll make up another rumor and talk
10249000	10251000	about it. How's that sound?
10251000	10253000	Oh, what's up Gamer Girl?
10253000	10255000	What's on your mind tonight?
10257000	10259000	Okay, I don't know if I'm
10259000	10261000	still
10261000	10263000	We hear you honey. Keep talking.
10263000	10265000	Can I get a what what?
10265000	10267000	Um, shoot.
10267000	10269000	I don't think she can hear us.
10269000	10271000	Honey, try back later because I don't think you can hear us.
10271000	10273000	Sorry to say.
10273000	10275000	Aw, that's always depressing.
10275000	10277000	Yeah. Alright, let's go to the phones.
10277000	10279000	Ooh, anyone new?
10279000	10281000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
10281000	10283000	Okay, I don't know if I'm still
10283000	10285000	We hear you, honey.
10285000	10287000	Keep talking.
10287000	10289000	We're hearing ourselves.
10289000	10291000	Shoot.
10291000	10293000	God damn it. Alright, let's try it.
10295000	10297000	Flocko's fucking Hair Doll.
10297000	10299000	I knew this was going to come up.
10301000	10303000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
10303000	10305000	Hi, you guys. It's Porkchop. How's it going?
10305000	10307000	Wait, wait, wait. You can hear me?
10307000	10309000	And I can hear you? Yes.
10309000	10311000	Oh my god. It's a miracle.
10311000	10313000	I fixed the show.
10313000	10315000	Hi, guys.
10315000	10317000	It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.
10317000	10319000	I don't know what to believe anymore.
10319000	10321000	I'm starting to lose faith.
10321000	10323000	I know, and here we are. We're making all this shit up
10323000	10325000	and just rumour-mongering
10325000	10327000	and we just made the whole thing worse
10327000	10329000	in our desperate attempt to get
10329000	10331000	all the thousands of clicks that we get
10331000	10333000	every week here on the show.
10333000	10335000	I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.
10335000	10337000	Like, the guys were talking about, you know,
10337000	10339000	like, old games in chat
10339000	10341000	and especially games in development hell
10341000	10343000	and stuff like that.
10343000	10345000	I don't know.
10345000	10347000	And it was kind of sad to hear, like, you know,
10347000	10349000	the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2
10349000	10351000	and The Last Guardian. I was looking forward to those.
10351000	10353000	Like, why can't these companies
10353000	10355000	just, you know, wake the fuck up
10355000	10357000	and realise these games will sell
10357000	10359000	because they had a...
10359000	10361000	Well, I know The Last Guardian will anyway.
10361000	10363000	It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.
10363000	10365000	So, you know, get on that.
10365000	10367000	Stop bitching about fucking iPads
10367000	10369000	and all this bullshit.
10369000	10371000	Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?
10371000	10373000	Because sometimes, you know, big time
10373000	10375000	because sometimes, you know, big titles come out
10375000	10377000	and they don't sell.
10377000	10379000	And it makes developers nervous.
10379000	10381000	I guess there was, like, you know,
10381000	10383000	sometimes there is a lot of hype.
10383000	10385000	Hype is just the theme for this week.
10385000	10387000	Like, even, I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising
10387000	10389000	and I looked at the footage and I think,
10389000	10391000	OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games,
10391000	10393000	kind of real justice,
10393000	10395000	like Bayonetta, they did that.
10395000	10397000	But this game,
10397000	10399000	there's something I can't shake about it
10399000	10401000	as much as I love Metal Gear Solid
10401000	10403000	and writing himself his cool character.
10403000	10405000	I'm just getting a weird feeling off it
10405000	10407000	and I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.
10409000	10411000	What's going into your decision, ultimately?
10411000	10413000	What's going to help you get home weird, if anything?
10413000	10415000	I don't know.
10415000	10417000	It's the fact that,
10417000	10421000	you know, spin-off titles aren't always great, you know.
10421000	10425000	It's something that I'm a bit tentative about
10425000	10427000	and I'm watching it and I'm thinking,
10427000	10429000	like, even DMC, the New Devil May Cry game,
10429000	10431000	I'm very scared to buy that
10431000	10433000	because I really, really
10433000	10435000	loved the series before that
10435000	10437000	and now it's just turned on its head.
10437000	10439000	The game where you're not Dante?
10439000	10441000	Pardon? The game where you're not Dante?
10441000	10443000	The game where you're Dante Mark 2, yeah.
10443000	10445000	Yeah.
10445000	10447000	I've been scared of him for so long.
10447000	10449000	And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.
10449000	10451000	It's just like another doctor, it's OK.
10451000	10453000	Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.
10453000	10455000	Of course, yeah.
10455000	10457000	That's just Red Cannon in there.
10457000	10461000	No point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is it?
10461000	10464000	Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry,
10464000	10466000	is the other kind of thing about it,
10466000	10468000	is that this version in particular...
10468000	10469000	The Devil May Metro?
10469000	10472000	Kinda, yeah. Devil May Metro, a little bit.
10472000	10474000	I mean, that's a bad thing.
10474000	10477000	Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.
10477000	10479000	I've heard something like that.
10479000	10481000	Apparently, the spitting image of the guy
10481000	10483000	who developed the game, I'm like, what?
10483000	10485000	It could be worse. He could have the face of,
10485000	10488000	like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried, or...
10488000	10491000	Or one of the Jonas Brothers.
10491000	10493000	Oh, that would be...
10493000	10496000	I'm gonna make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.
10496000	10500000	Hey, no, it could be a Dante de Medna version.
10500000	10502000	I would know.
10502000	10504000	That's like DLC.
10504000	10506000	That's like, you know, guilty pleasures and stuff like that.
10506000	10508000	What is ultimately going to...
10508000	10510000	You know, this is...
10510000	10512000	The boardroom guys wanna get in your head as a gamer.
10512000	10515000	What is ultimately going to make that decision for you
10515000	10518000	if you're gonna pick up Devil May Cry or not?
10518000	10521000	If you just leave it alone,
10521000	10523000	you know, don't...
10523000	10525000	Don't twist it to think that you're...
10525000	10527000	No, this is a reboot.
10527000	10529000	And as far as I'm concerned, the game was fine
10529000	10531000	before they went and did all this,
10531000	10534000	I don't know, fucking lost city of demons
10534000	10537000	turning the fucking buildings upside down.
10537000	10539000	It was fine when he was the demon hunter
10539000	10541000	and he had white hair initially,
10541000	10544000	but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo...
10544000	10546000	I don't know what to make of him at all.
10546000	10548000	Okay, I'm gonna play...
10548000	10550000	Don't ruin it, that's all I can really say.
10550000	10552000	I'm gonna play boardroom guy for a second here.
10552000	10555000	This is how you get the female audience.
10555000	10557000	You go the Bayonetta route, okay?
10557000	10559000	You just have... You have his penis
10559000	10561000	basically act like her hair in that game,
10561000	10564000	so it's just flopping around, attacking things.
10564000	10566000	And there you go.
10566000	10568000	That would be frightening.
10568000	10570000	It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do,
10570000	10572000	but still.
10573000	10576000	I would love to actually have a main male character
10576000	10579000	who's just in completely oversexed positions.
10579000	10580000	Like...
10580000	10581000	We'll play Devil May Cry.
10581000	10583000	I know, I want the over-the-top,
10583000	10585000	like, you know, a comic book cover.
10585000	10587000	Done by Rob Liefeld.
10587000	10589000	You're like... You want the Hawkeye Initiative
10589000	10590000	to be a video game.
10590000	10592000	I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.
10592000	10593000	That's what she's talking about.
10593000	10594000	That would be hilarious.
10594000	10596000	You want a Hawkeye game.
10596000	10599000	Jeremy Renner stars as fucking the main character,
10599000	10600000	so that would be perfect.
10600000	10602000	I would just play Jeremy Renner's, you know,
10602000	10603000	butt the game.
10603000	10605000	With, you know, Wii Move.
10605000	10606000	Or Wii.
10606000	10607000	You're taking...
10607000	10609000	You all are taking this show to a very strange place.
10609000	10610000	Alright.
10610000	10611000	Uh...
10611000	10613000	Anyway, Porkchop, I got to wrap up,
10613000	10615000	so I can try to get another call,
10615000	10617000	but any other thoughts for us tonight?
10617000	10618000	Yes, thanks very much.
10618000	10619000	I want to thank you personally.
10619000	10621000	You put me on the Path of Exile.
10621000	10622000	It's very satisfying,
10622000	10624000	and I'm going to play more of it.
10624000	10625000	How about that?
10625000	10626000	Somebody just accused me,
10626000	10628000	I think it was on Hoard House this week,
10628000	10630000	saying I never shut up about that game, so...
10630000	10632000	Which, I've mentioned it twice,
10632000	10634000	and apparently I never shut up.
10635000	10638000	Says the person who mentions Mass Effect of Pokemon all the time.
10638000	10640000	I instilled fearmongering in people
10640000	10643000	if they didn't go play Path of Exile.
10643000	10644000	It's worth a shot.
10644000	10646000	For a five gig download,
10646000	10647000	this game really is worth a shot,
10647000	10649000	and you heard it here, so...
10649000	10650000	Like, honestly, didn't you play it,
10650000	10651000	and you were like,
10651000	10653000	oh my god, Diablo 3, finally.
10653000	10654000	Uh, well, it was Diablo,
10654000	10657000	but even so, just playing it and killing things,
10657000	10659000	it was, look, it was worth it.
10659000	10660000	Totally worth waiting,
10660000	10662000	and the internet was crap downloading,
10662000	10663000	took ages, it was worth it.
10663000	10664000	Go try it out, at least,
10664000	10665000	even if you're not a fan.
10665000	10666000	Try it out.
10667000	10669000	A ringing endorsement from overseas.
10669000	10670000	There you go.
10670000	10671000	Can't beat that.
10671000	10673000	Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.
10673000	10674000	Good girl.
10674000	10675000	All right, that's it, Porkchop.
10675000	10676000	Have a good one, buddy.
10677000	10678000	Take it easy, guys.
10678000	10679000	All right, bye-bye.
10680000	10682000	All right, I will try this call one more time,
10682000	10683000	because it's a new name, I think.
10683000	10684000	Hi, you're on Orange Country.
10684000	10685000	Who's this?
10685000	10686000	It was crap downloading, took ages.
10686000	10688000	Nope, you gotta call Echo 1-2-3.
10689000	10690000	That's it.
10690000	10691000	And turn off your speakers.
10691000	10693000	Yeah, well, yeah, that's the problem.
10693000	10694000	Use headphones.
10694000	10696000	You gotta stop the show when you're calling in, so.
10696000	10697000	Sorry.
10697000	10700000	Uh, we'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.
10700000	10701000	We have another one coming in.
10701000	10702000	Hi, you're on Orange Country.
10702000	10703000	Who's this?
10703000	10706000	You talk about Path of Exile way too much.
10706000	10708000	Oh, god, here we go.
10708000	10709000	Hi, Shane.
10709000	10710000	Hello.
10710000	10711000	How are you?
10711000	10712000	I'm good.
10712000	10713000	I'm playing Pokemon.
10713000	10714000	Why the hate boner,
10714000	10715000	since we've been using that term a lot tonight,
10715000	10717000	why the hate boner for Path of Exile?
10717000	10720000	Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.
10720000	10722000	Have you played Path of Exile?
10722000	10727000	I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer,
10727000	10729000	because it was crap.
10729000	10731000	I'm telling you, there's a difference.
10731000	10734000	And Torchlight 2, have you played Torchlight 2?
10734000	10736000	I played the first one, the demo of it,
10736000	10738000	and it was kind of boring.
10738000	10740000	You're the problem, Shane.
10740000	10741000	Shane.
10741000	10742000	Yes.
10742000	10744000	We have stuff to do.
10745000	10746000	Mm-hmm.
10746000	10750000	But I got to watch Kilryuger some more, because it's so funny.
10750000	10751000	I need to watch it now.
10751000	10752000	All right, why did you call in tonight?
10752000	10754000	Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile,
10754000	10756000	or did you have something else?
10756000	10758000	No, that's pretty much it.
10760000	10762000	And Ni No Kuni sucks there.
10762000	10763000	Hey!
10763000	10765000	Another game he hasn't played that he hates.
10765000	10767000	I have a Ni No Kuni.
10767000	10768000	You have it.
10768000	10769000	Yes, I have it.
10769000	10770000	It is not fun.
10770000	10771000	It is super boring.
10771000	10774000	The Pokémon aspect is cool, and the battles are fine.
10774000	10775000	I actually like the battles.
10775000	10776000	What else is wrong with it?
10776000	10777000	But the story is terrible.
10777000	10778000	Here's the thing.
10778000	10779000	Here's the thing.
10779000	10782000	A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane,
10782000	10784000	that I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.
10784000	10786000	I got into probably...
10786000	10787000	Are you playing Persona?
10787000	10788000	And they're right.
10788000	10789000	I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.
10789000	10790000	See?
10790000	10791000	See?
10791000	10792000	Everybody proof.
10792000	10795000	Mass Effect, and we have the Pokémon and...
10795000	10796000	Acornage.
10796000	10799000	Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway,
10799000	10800000	because it was in DDR.
10800000	10802000	Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance,
10802000	10804000	was largely in part to Shane.
10804000	10807000	But I do influence Shane sometimes,
10807000	10808000	and Ni No Kuni was one of them,
10808000	10810000	is that I convinced him to get Ni No Kuni, right Shane?
10810000	10811000	Yeah, but now he doesn't like it.
10811000	10812000	He's gonna give me his copy.
10812000	10813000	It was between that and Devil May Cry,
10813000	10815000	and I made the wrong choice.
10815000	10817000	It's like the Bizarro review, Ni No Kuni.
10817000	10818000	Every reviewer is like,
10818000	10820000	oh, the story's amazing, but, you know,
10820000	10825000	there's some problems with the gameplay and the battle system.
10825000	10827000	But Shane's like, battle system's great,
10827000	10828000	but story, oh, sucks.
10828000	10830000	Now this means Shane can give me his copy.
10830000	10831000	Of Ni No Kuni?
10831000	10832000	Yeah.
10832000	10835000	Now I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little
10835000	10837000	limited edition case I have with it,
10837000	10838000	because it goes for like 40 bucks,
10838000	10839000	just the case alone.
10839000	10840000	Damn it.
10840000	10842000	Did you get the book?
10842000	10844000	No, I did not get a book.
10844000	10846000	Oh, I want the book.
10846000	10847000	No.
10847000	10850000	Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.
10850000	10852000	Like, the story is so boring.
10852000	10854000	I don't care about any of the characters.
10854000	10856000	I care about, like, my little mighty,
10857000	10859000	mighty guy, and that's pretty much it.
10859000	10860000	I named him Fodder,
10860000	10862000	because I figured he wasn't gonna be worth anything,
10862000	10863000	but he's really good.
10863000	10864000	He is really good.
10864000	10865000	He actually lasts a long time,
10865000	10866000	but, though, if you read game facts,
10866000	10867000	they all say, oh, he's horrible.
10867000	10868000	He's got bad stats.
10868000	10870000	Okay, so, I just want to be clear here,
10870000	10872000	I just want to be clear.
10872000	10874000	You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.
10874000	10875000	No.
10875000	10877000	But you are current on every episode
10877000	10880000	of Power Rangers ever made, correct?
10880000	10882000	Um, not entirely.
10882000	10885000	There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.
10886000	10887000	I see, I see.
10887000	10888000	And how's the story in Pokemon?
10888000	10890000	You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?
10890000	10891000	Yes.
10891000	10892000	Okay, Shane, wait.
10892000	10893000	I have to ask you,
10893000	10895000	because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages,
10895000	10898000	what is your favorite Sentai series?
10898000	10899000	Sentai series?
10899000	10900000	Yeah.
10900000	10902000	Um, probably Gokaiger.
10902000	10903000	Really?
10903000	10904000	Yes, it cracks me up,
10904000	10907000	but Kyoryuja might take its place.
10907000	10908000	I still...
10908000	10909000	Oh, and Dekaranger.
10909000	10910000	Dekaranger.
10910000	10911000	Dekaranger's awesome.
10911000	10914000	I still say Mega Ranger was the best.
10914000	10915000	I don't know.
10915000	10916000	I haven't seen that one.
10916000	10918000	Most of the later ones.
10918000	10919000	Go watch Mega Ranger.
10919000	10920000	It's awesome.
10920000	10921000	Are you guys done?
10921000	10923000	No, are you done?
10923000	10924000	Yes.
10924000	10926000	Bye, have a good time.
10926000	10927000	Thanks for calling.
10927000	10928000	Mm-hmm.
10928000	10929000	Bye.
10929000	10930000	He's like, mm-hmm.
10930000	10935000	1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10935000	10937000	You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane
10937000	10940000	live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network
10940000	10943000	on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft.
10943000	10944000	And then some.
10944000	10946000	7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
10946000	10947000	Now live every week.
10947000	10950000	1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10950000	10953000	I got time for one more call.
10953000	10955000	Ain't nobody got time for that.
10955000	10960000	I got bronchitis.
10960000	10962000	That lady's making a killing.
10962000	10964000	But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?
10964000	10966000	She was on Tosh last year.
10966000	10969000	Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.
10969000	10972000	He was on Tosh, too.
10972000	10973000	It's tough to make a living.
10973000	10974000	I'm going to find out now.
10974000	10975000	Hold on.
10975000	10976000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10976000	10977000	Who's this?
10977000	10979000	That's the one and only Ronda from the East Coast.
10979000	10980000	Hey, Ronda from the East Coast.
10980000	10981000	How's it going?
10981000	10984000	Ah, pretty good, pretty good.
10984000	10987000	We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.
10987000	10989000	Yeah, I heard.
10989000	10990000	I got the memo.
10990000	10991000	Good job on that.
10991000	10993000	But congrats on your first live show.
10993000	10994000	Thanks, and we try.
10994000	10996000	Evidently, Winnamp didn't like a certain MP3
10996000	10999000	and decided to give me the middle finger.
10999000	11001000	It might do that with some of the foreign name titles,
11001000	11002000	just so you know.
11002000	11003000	I should have warned you about that.
11003000	11004000	That's worse.
11004000	11007000	These are things we learn through trial and error.
11007000	11008000	Mm-hmm.
11008000	11009000	Mm-hmm.
11009000	11011000	Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.
11011000	11012000	Thank you.
11012000	11015000	An anime jam session can also be heard live on VOG Network
11015000	11018000	Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.
11018000	11020000	VOG got two new live shows.
11020000	11023000	Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.
11023000	11025000	It's like we kind of doubled.
11025000	11026000	Not really.
11026000	11027000	I guess we went from three to five.
11027000	11028000	It's close.
11028000	11030000	So pretty cool.
11031000	11035000	So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winnamp?
11035000	11040000	Just making it through school.
11040000	11042000	Just chilling, just making it through school?
11042000	11043000	What are you studying?
11043000	11044000	Networking technology.
11044000	11046000	I guess you didn't get the notice on that.
11046000	11050000	I decided to go back to college.
11050000	11052000	I am quite proud of your achievement.
11052000	11053000	Thank you.
11053000	11055000	No, I did get the memo on it, but I don't assume
11055000	11057000	that the radio listeners all know the story about them.
11057000	11060000	So I sometimes ask rhetorical questions, but anyway.
11060000	11062000	Any cons going on lately?
11062000	11064000	Weren't you at a con this weekend?
11064000	11067000	No, that was Kat's a con, but we're going to be covering that
11067000	11070000	this week because there was so much drama and controversy
11070000	11071000	going on there.
11071000	11073000	Oh my God, you've got to tell our audience.
11073000	11076000	I know it's a video game show, but I saw it on Tumblr.
11076000	11077000	I saw it on Facebook.
11077000	11079000	I saw it on Twitter.
11079000	11080000	There was drama everywhere.
11080000	11081000	Give us a little bit.
11081000	11082000	Give us a little bit of the drama.
11082000	11083000	Give us a tease.
11083000	11084000	Sure.
11084000	11085000	Sure.
11085000	11089000	The main issue was cosplayers and con goers, a kind of piss
11089000	11093000	that a international Jewish organization took up a majority
11093000	11096000	of the conventions of the convention area and places
11096000	11098000	for taking photography.
11098000	11101000	And there was pretty much insults going between both sides
11101000	11103000	back and forth.
11103000	11104000	Really?
11104000	11107000	Yes, really.
11107000	11113000	Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?
11114000	11116000	I don't know enough about it.
11116000	11120000	And honestly, I just feel like asshole photographers.
11120000	11123000	You will talk later because believe you me, I have friends
11123000	11125000	that are also Jewish and cosplayers.
11125000	11128000	We're pissed at both sides as well, but we'll see that
11128000	11129000	for another time.
11129000	11132000	I just don't like when you get two groups of people together
11132000	11135000	who decide to act like name calling five year olds.
11135000	11139000	Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.
11139000	11144000	Also, update on Antoine Dodson released a single in 2012
11144000	11146000	called Lovesick Lullaby.
11146000	11147000	How did that sound?
11147000	11148000	I just downloaded it.
11148000	11149000	Oh, my God.
11149000	11151000	You're the problem.
11151000	11152000	Damn it, Uchon.
11152000	11153000	Look at your life.
11153000	11154000	Look at your choices.
11154000	11156000	Antoine Dodson songs?
11156000	11158000	Ain't nobody got time for that.
11158000	11161000	So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?
11161000	11162000	Yeah.
11162000	11163000	No, it's 2013.
11163000	11164000	It's a new year.
11164000	11165000	Ain't nobody got time for that.
11165000	11167000	The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested
11167000	11171000	for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.
11171000	11172000	No.
11172000	11173000	Back in Huntsville.
11173000	11174000	No.
11174000	11175000	Huntsville.
11175000	11176000	He smoked marijuana.
11176000	11179000	Get out.
11179000	11180000	Hide your bong.
11180000	11181000	Hide your roach.
11181000	11185000	Anyway, what else should I ask you about, Rama?
11185000	11186000	I don't know.
11186000	11188000	I just have a few things to say.
11188000	11189000	All right.
11189000	11191000	Quick, and I'll be on my way.
11191000	11194000	The convention that you went to is called Animation on Display,
11194000	11199000	and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Hebert, was there as a guest.
11199000	11200000	Neat.
11200000	11201000	Yes.
11201000	11205000	And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is
11205000	11207000	called Zuden Sentai Kuruja.
11207000	11211000	It's the third Sentai series based off of dinosaurs.
11211000	11215000	Fun, because what was the one?
11215000	11216000	Dioranger.
11216000	11217000	Dino Thunder?
11217000	11218000	No, Dioranger was...
11218000	11219000	Dinosaurs dress up and transform?
11219000	11220000	That's pretty awesome.
11220000	11221000	No, no.
11221000	11222000	Kuruja was the first one.
11222000	11223000	Yeah, Zooranger.
11223000	11224000	That was the first one.
11224000	11229000	Dioranger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old white ranger guy.
11229000	11230000	Mm-hmm.
11230000	11231000	Yeah.
11231000	11236000	Yeah, a little too many people know is that the white ranger was actually from a completely
11236000	11237000	different series.
11237000	11239000	They had better outfits, just saying.
11239000	11240000	They did.
11240000	11241000	Yes, they did.
11241000	11242000	They totally had better outfits.
11242000	11246000	Well, Rama, after this call, I feel like I learned something.
11246000	11252000	Two more things, I'm going to get out of here.
11252000	11253000	All right.
11253000	11255000	The whole Year of Luigi thing.
11255000	11259000	Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.
11259000	11264000	That's proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie
11264000	11267000	wearing my Luigi hat.
11267000	11268000	That's awesome.
11268000	11269000	Never wash that hat again.
11269000	11270000	Just kidding.
11270000	11273000	You should probably wash it once in a while.
11273000	11275000	No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.
11275000	11276000	Oh, okay.
11276000	11277000	All right.
11277000	11278000	That works.
11278000	11279000	That works.
11279000	11280000	Oh, my God.
11280000	11281000	I haven't seen this picture.
11281000	11282000	How did I miss this?
11282000	11283000	You have not seen it?
11283000	11284000	No.
11284000	11285000	That's hilarious.
11285000	11286000	That's pretty cool.
11286000	11287000	That's awesome.
11287000	11288000	Oh, God, I love it.
11288000	11289000	All right.
11289000	11291000	When are you going to get your ass back out here?
11291000	11293000	Can you put that on Tumblr or something?
11293000	11296000	Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.
11296000	11297000	I will.
11297000	11300000	I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money
11300000	11301000	and I'm done with college.
11301000	11302000	Okay.
11302000	11303000	Because I want to come back out there again.
11303000	11305000	I want to go out there and go to a club.
11305000	11307000	How about we crash New York?
11307000	11312000	Well, Chiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here
11312000	11316000	and me down there and Jovidea down here to do a big old party thing.
11316000	11317000	You know what I'm saying?
11317000	11318000	There you go.
11318000	11319000	We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.
11319000	11321000	Only if it's a sexy party.
11321000	11323000	They do have that.
11323000	11327000	It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.
11327000	11328000	Awesome.
11328000	11329000	Sounds like fun to me.
11329000	11331000	All right, Rama, I got to let you go to wrap up the show.
11331000	11332000	Fine.
11332000	11333000	Okay.
11333000	11334000	I'm out of here.
11334000	11335000	All right.
11335000	11336000	Have a good one, buddy.
11336000	11338000	Another A plus phone call from Rama.
11338000	11342000	Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.
11342000	11346000	Echo one, two, three in the future.
11346000	11347000	There we go.
11347000	11348000	That's it.
11348000	11350000	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us.
11350000	11352000	Mailbag at orangelandtrady.com or tweet us.
11352000	11354000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
11354000	11357000	Oh shit, I got to do the tweets.
11357000	11358000	Here I was ready to wrap up.
11358000	11359000	I have a last minute story.
11359000	11360000	All right, go for it.
11360000	11362000	I got to pull up the Twitters.
11362000	11365000	So there is a new world record for Qbert.
11365000	11376000	Apparently, George Layouts, I guess, he had been playing Qbert with a friend, Ed Hemskerk.
11376000	11381000	They've been playing the game for 30 years now, and they've been trying to go for this world record.
11381000	11392000	Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired, and this guy, George, actually went for 80 plus hours.
11392000	11401000	He actually beat the world record, I guess, at about over 84 hours and 36 million points.
11401000	11411000	So at least that's what the thought is right now, that he has broken the record for both the longest time playing on a single quarter and score.
11411000	11415000	He likes to score all night.
11415000	11419000	Here's a last minute story if I ever heard one.
11419000	11424000	Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's like on topic and legit.
11424000	11426000	Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.
11426000	11429000	All right, no, this is actually super important.
11429000	11435000	Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.
11435000	11437000	When's it happening?
11437000	11442000	Today, 5 p.m. Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m. Eastern.
11442000	11448000	So that means in about two more hours, we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita.
11448000	11455000	And it is ahead of the February 20th event, meaning, this is confirmed, the two events are about separate topics.
11455000	11463000	So the February 20th event is all about something new, because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week, or tonight.
11463000	11469000	So, Loki, upon hearing that, you just said earlier in the show, where's the information on the Vita?
11469000	11471000	Any reaction to this, hearing this?
11471000	11473000	I'm going to see what they say.
11473000	11478000	See, the problem is, when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games.
11478000	11481000	And it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.
11481000	11484000	And here's the other funny thing you want to see.
11484000	11490000	Because I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and game side.
11490000	11492000	And we do a lot of promotions with them.
11492000	11498000	In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now, because I probably can't go.
11498000	11506000	It's possibly to go on a red carpet premiere for This Is The End, with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.
11506000	11507000	It'll be fun.
11507000	11508000	My wife might not like that.
11508000	11509000	But here's the thing.
11509000	11510000	They've been...
11510000	11511000	I'll fucking go.
11511000	11512000	Our rep...
11512000	11513000	My name's Loki.
11513000	11520000	A rep in house has been asking me, she's all, okay, well, what's in the electronic device that Sony has?
11520000	11522000	You know, what's hot right now with Sony and stuff?
11522000	11526000	And I was like, oh yeah, well, there's the PlayStation 4, it's going to be coming out, and then there's the Vita.
11526000	11529000	I may actually get another Vita.
11529000	11531000	I'm not having to pay for it, of course, but...
11531000	11533000	You have a rough life.
11533000	11534000	Well, I...
11534000	11535000	I might have to go to a movie premiere.
11535000	11536000	Well, no, no.
11536000	11537000	Here's the thing, though.
11537000	11538000	I've got another Vita.
11538000	11542000	Right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.
11542000	11548000	They went to a winery one time, and then they went to Monterey.
11548000	11550000	I didn't get included in either of those trips.
11550000	11555000	I had to stay back and answer phones.
11555000	11556000	Thanks.
11556000	11557000	Good times.
11557000	11559000	All right, quickly, I've got to do some quick Twitter topics here.
11559000	11561000	Tigerclaw sent us a couple stories here.
11561000	11563000	I'm just going to do one because I'm pressed for time here.
11563000	11568000	A video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.
11568000	11569000	Oh, yeah.
11569000	11570000	Get out.
11570000	11571000	I didn't know that this was something they were doing.
11571000	11573000	That's been floating for a little bit.
11573000	11574000	Yeah, but there was...
11574000	11575000	I thought they had a Play...
11575000	11576000	There was the...
11576000	11577000	On PS1 they did, right?
11577000	11578000	Really?
11578000	11580000	There was the Masters of Terra something.
11580000	11583000	Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.
11583000	11586000	It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't,
11586000	11589000	you know, amount to anything.
11589000	11594000	Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct
11594000	11596000	is greater than Super Metroid.
11596000	11597000	Just saying.
11597000	11600000	Well, you know, Orange Lontre, who is the show where every gamer has a voice.
11600000	11601000	Except you.
11601000	11602000	No, no, no.
11602000	11603000	He has a voice, but...
11603000	11604000	He has a voice.
11604000	11606000	Just what's it like to have such a wrong voice?
11606000	11612000	I mean, there's no such thing as a wrong opinion, but that's really fucking close.
11613000	11617000	I've never said there's no such thing as a...
11617000	11619000	I've never said that there's a stupid question.
11619000	11620000	That's pushing it.
11620000	11626000	Since we are on the topic of, you know, Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars,
11626000	11635000	and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know
11635000	11642000	that in Disney, and obviously this is all very, very early, but they have greenlit Star
11642000	11644000	Wars figures for Disney Infinity.
11644000	11648000	Probably not coming out anytime soon, but it is in the works.
11648000	11652000	So don't be surprised next year if you see Star Wars figures.
11652000	11657000	What would be interesting is Star Wars figures with Marvel figures with Disney figures.
11657000	11660000	Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.
11660000	11661000	Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.
11661000	11662000	You know what?
11662000	11667000	Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game,
11667000	11672000	so I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet,
11672000	11675000	especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.
11677000	11680000	Alright, and lastly from SSJ100Matt,
11680000	11683000	with so much negativity stemming from video games lately,
11683000	11687000	someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.
11687000	11689000	Very interesting.
11689000	11691000	Let's see, I'm trying to scan through this real quick.
11691000	11694000	God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.
11694000	11698000	The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games,
11698000	11701000	and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.
11701000	11706000	It's a non-profit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.
11706000	11710000	Similar to an arcade in Massachusetts called Tokyo Game Action,
11710000	11713000	which was also non-profit, but they closed.
11713000	11716000	No game list available yet, but they're talking about driving games,
11716000	11719000	pinball machines, air hockey, Kinect, and many more.
11719000	11723000	So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?
11726000	11727000	Wah wah.
11727000	11729000	Womp womp womp.
11729000	11731000	Alright, that does it.
11731000	11732000	We gotta wrap up.
11732000	11734000	We're at midnight thirty eastern time here.
11734000	11737000	We're running a little late, so we gotta go around and wrap it up.
11737000	11739000	Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show
11739000	11741000	and staying with us for all three hours tonight.
11741000	11744000	Remember, we do this show for free.
11745000	11749000	We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that,
11749000	11751000	but we do it because we love you guys and we love the community.
11751000	11754000	Yes, even the nasty emailers too.
11754000	11756000	I love you so much.
11757000	11760000	You can help spread the word about our show by telling a friend.
11760000	11761000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
11761000	11764000	Leave us a nice review on whatever website you found the show on,
11764000	11767000	iTunes or Stitcher or wherever.
11767000	11768000	We really appreciate it.
11768000	11772000	Tumblr, you can tumbles about us and all that good stuff.
11772000	11773000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
11773000	11775000	Flaco, thank you very much for being here tonight.
11775000	11776000	I hope you had fun.
11776000	11777000	I did.
11777000	11778000	Alright, good times.
11778000	11779000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11779000	11781000	Just thanks for having me.
11781000	11782000	I got to talk about Ni No Kuni.
11782000	11785000	I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Ni No Kuni podcast,
11785000	11790000	just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard.
11790000	11792000	Are you going to call it Ni No Podcast?
11792000	11793000	Ni No Podcast.
11793000	11794000	Ni No Cast.
11794000	11800000	I think Ni No Podcast would be a great addition to the VOG network.
11800000	11801000	I'm sure Bobby would have no problem.
11801000	11802000	He would love it.
11802000	11803000	No problem at all.
11803000	11804000	Green light, green light.
11804000	11806000	I'm going to just offer you the spot right now.
11806000	11807000	We'll just call it Bobby Blackwolf Night.
11807000	11810000	We'll have Mass Effect Podcast and Ni No Kuni Podcast back to back.
11810000	11812000	And then the Brony show.
11812000	11814000	Oh yeah, the Brony show.
11814000	11815000	The Brony show.
11815000	11816000	Sounds great.
11816000	11817000	It'll be awesome.
11817000	11822000	Alright, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11822000	11825000	Hate boner.
11825000	11829000	My final thought tonight is sunflower seeds.
11829000	11831000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11831000	11835000	My final thought is, I don't know, I don't have anything.
11835000	11837000	I just don't want to move upstairs.
11837000	11839000	I hate moving my stuff.
11839000	11840000	Get a peon to do it for you.
11840000	11844000	I've been in that spot for a long time and I just don't like moving
11844000	11847000	because everyone's like, well, your desk is a mess anyways.
11847000	11849000	Actually, no, my desk is just spread out.
11849000	11850000	It's not a mess.
11850000	11851000	It's organized chaos.
11851000	11852000	It's not organized at all.
11852000	11856000	It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff.
11856000	11858000	It's got to be stored somewhere.
11858000	11862000	It's sure as hell not going to be at my house.
11862000	11863000	Alright, that's it.
11863000	11866000	Thanks a lot, guys, for tuning in and listening and staying with us
11866000	11867000	all night long.
11867000	11868000	Here, have a cookie.
