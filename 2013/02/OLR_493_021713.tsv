13610	26768	Tonight, February 17, 2013, Bungie reveals details on their next game, Nintendo unveils more 3DS titles than the new Nintendo Direct, and as the first glimpse of the PlayStation 4 leaked to the internet,
31400	36605	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36665	45372	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February the 17th, 2013.
45432	49075	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
49436	52859	First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
53099	53619	Blarg.
53780	55121	Blarg, yarg, how you doing?
56010	57852	I'm tired, actually.
58693	60795	Thank you for the coffee.
61715	64358	I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time, and then what came out?
64898	65499	The cafe.
66180	67821	You were just saying it, you know, with an accent.
67841	68402	The cafe.
68722	69443	I love coffee.
69963	71184	Yeah, I love coffee, too.
71224	74768	I'm drinking it, and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit, because...
75812	77334	I went to San Francisco yesterday.
78274	79055	How was San Francisco?
79636	80556	It was gay.
81037	82458	What did you do in San Francisco?
82498	83339	I'm sure the weather was great.
83379	84019	What did you do in San Francisco?
84039	84560	The weather was fantastic.
84600	90905	Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.
93248	101355	And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara, and well, there was beer involved, and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.
102390	103251	I have been there.
121412	126075	I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.
126815	130877	And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone was like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?
130897	135399	And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japantown.
136740	138260	I was like, I'm not here for the con.
138300	139361	I'm just wearing my jacket.
139401	140721	Did you do a deadpan just like that?
141021	141242	Yeah.
141422	141682	Awesome.
142722	144744	I love the random impromptu anime convention.
145405	146486	DarkSakura approaches.
146566	147426	Quick, throw an anime convention.
147446	152851	Well, I saw people putting on armor in the Japan town.
155113	157715	Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?
159545	162307	Okay, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.
162387	163588	I saw people putting on armor.
163608	169393	I was like, it's not the Cherry Blossom Festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.
169813	171875	Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?
172435	180141	Sure enough, I run into somebody wearing a blue trench coat and a button-up shirt, and I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?
180161	183764	He's like, yeah, and there's my doctor over there.
183784	185245	I was like, so is there a convention going on?
185285	186807	He's like, oh yeah, and it sucks.
188147	190728	I don't even remember what the convention was called.
190768	191129	Where was that?
191169	194970	Was it at the... It was at Miyako, over at the Kabuki Hotel.
195950	196331	Interesting.
196351	203313	You know, that's where they're going to be having the Gamer Expo, but they call it Gamer X now or something because they can't call it GamerCon because of legal stuff.
203613	204794	But that's where they're having that, so...
205940	209142	It seemed like a pretty good venue, but I mean, I want to go to that one.
210043	215748	But it was cosplay central all over Japantown and assholes with cameras.
215989	217470	That's the other thing I call them, assholes.
217990	220192	And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.
221540	226161	There's people who know how to behave, how to usher people aside when they're taking their photos.
226521	232423	This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband.
232503	233944	Looking for the girls with the biggest tatas.
233964	234824	I'm going to put this in my spank bank.
234864	239565	Backing up into... Techmaster Loki, everybody.
239625	242606	Backing up into people and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.
244307	249168	I ran into him again and I just said, look where you're going, ass face or something.
251036	251637	Thanks for watching!
261371	264373	I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.
265913	267594	I don't keep up with the con circuit anymore.
267634	268375	How do I know all this?
268835	271216	Say hello to Tech Master Loki, officially, everybody.
271436	271856	Hello.
271916	272477	How you doing?
272697	273317	I'm doing fine.
273337	275398	You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?
275758	276118	No.
276298	276579	Good.
276679	277199	Don't do that.
278039	278580	I can remember.
278600	279920	You had to think for a minute.
280300	281721	It's been a while since I've been to a con.
281981	282762	No, I don't think I have.
283202	284683	It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.
284703	286804	I don't even remember the last con I went to.
286824	287744	It was probably like ASAP.
287764	289245	I remember the last con job I pulled.
290395	291155	What's a con job?
291175	291775	It sounds hot.
293016	293416	Con?
294036	294636	Con artist?
295376	295816	Oh, okay.
296076	297957	It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.
298157	298437	Okay.
298717	299817	Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.
299877	302937	Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.
303518	304638	He's a familiar guy.
304918	310959	You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show or ever listened to Horde House and hear his emails and tweets and all that.
311339	314240	Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.
314660	316440	It is Flaco Jones, everybody!
316900	317741	Hello, everybody.
317961	318741	How are you doing?
318901	319422	I'm doing great.
319582	322264	As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.
322684	323405	Yeah, I love that.
323685	327267	It's just reminding me of Nino Cooney and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.
327307	328888	You're sticky and smell of caramel.
329269	329469	Yes.
329769	330469	Can I smell you?
331330	332671	It's all this English candy.
332971	335393	Yes, it's all the Sill candy, which much love to Sill.
335413	338335	I don't know if Sill listens to Orange Launch Radio, but I hope she won't mind.
338375	339816	I've been giving some of the candy away.
339836	342718	It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.
342918	343318	Sill, EJ, Raven, Rob
368116	384007	and still offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing so she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain like the Smarties over there which are like totally different than Smarties here and like Aero bars which we don't have here at all Jelly Babies which I'd never had which were pretty good
384227	385367	I can't eat jelly babies.
386187	388688	It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.
389688	396810	But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town, but she sent stuff that I've never seen there.
396830	398410	Like the Bubblies, I've never seen them there.
398490	399750	Yeah, yeah.
399870	400310	Pretty cool.
400450	407552	And oh my god, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.
408312	410173	She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs.
410633	411414	I had one yesterday.
411494	414395	Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.
414635	416536	So I have a return package.
416556	418577	I don't want to spoil just in case Syl is listening.
418677	420138	It might spoil by the time it gets there.
420238	425480	I do have a return package we're sending and all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.
425760	426481	So if you know Syl...
427821	429363	And we're sending her a token of our love.
429563	430023	That's right.
430824	436008	In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Syl that we're sending.
436048	438250	So we'll send that over there soon.
438811	439091	All right.
440092	441453	Flaco, what's new with you?
441473	442234	What have you been up to?
442254	444436	When was the last time you were on the show?
444456	445457	A couple months ago, right?
445497	446978	I was on the year-end show.
447018	447498	That's right.
447598	449220	So December 30th or something.
449240	450501	That's right, the last show of the year.
450881	453043	Because you ruined one of the shows in June.
453103	453263	Yes.
454624	455885	and hopefully tonight's show will be better
469312	470053	Thanks for watching!
487704	489445	I like that I have this reputation with this show.
489485	493348	I'm the number one fan of Horde House and the number one curse on OLR.
494048	495809	Exactly, exactly.
496250	499412	So you have two young ones at home.
501293	502454	How old is your little girl now?
502754	503535	She's almost one.
503555	504916	She turns a year next month.
505116	506797	So you have a less than a year old at home.
506957	507137	Yes.
507337	509039	How do you juggle that with game playing?
509959	526717	I play very late at night early in the morning and you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni something like that I can actually play when they're up they don't get bothered by it too much my son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon you know he doesn't like the battles he gets bored of that which I guess a lot of people do
527217	527978	Tree, Tree, Tree, Tree
556278	562070	yeah so we put we you know we load up that game when we start playing it and he just he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game
562751	583241	Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I'm using those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff, whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?
583861	588464	I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.
588844	591325	Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.
591485	596007	It's interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve.
596687	602689	And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.
602869	603409	I think they will.
603489	604630	It'll just be different.
604670	605710	They're holding back on it right now.
605730	606470	They just want to save it.
606570	607131	You think so?
607491	607691	Yeah.
608111	608671	Holding back on it.
608691	609291	They can do it now.
609532	613113	Or Oliver will be able to have the Illumaroom that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.
613253	613493	Yes.
613593	614433	Just in time for that phase.
614453	614994	Boobs everywhere.
615114	616114	Just in time for that phase.
618456	640271	I thought you just called the motorboat room Akuma JP in our chat room By the way, hi chatters We're always joined with the live chat room Because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network VOG Network.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Akuma JP in chat says Sky sounds old, ha ha ha
641431	643813	Well, jerk, keep this in mind.
644374	646956	OLR is on our 11th year this year.
648397	651940	So if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.
652060	655423	We didn't start this show when we were 18.
655523	658105	We were more like 23 or 24.
658226	658966	So you do the math.
659006	659487	You know what?
659847	662649	The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.
662809	663190	And what's that?
663210	664051	Because I'll be 37.
664611	664971	In a row?
667694	668454	I rest my case.
670537	670857	And I'll be 35.
671838	672898	So Jamie's the old one.
673039	673839	Come on, Akuma.
674359	676080	Redirect your jokes appropriately.
676440	677421	No, no, no, no, no, no.
678161	678641	Vintage.
680262	681523	This rack took years to grow.
681923	684424	And I'm two weeks older than Rob.
685425	685665	I know.
685725	686785	I feel like the young kid.
686846	690307	If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.
691528	693509	I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.
694369	695650	I guess I just hang out with youngins.
696210	697051	That's the deal.
697951	726723	AkumaJP in our chatroom says so you are old lol bonk you're only as old as you feel honestly and I will say this with all honesty we will talk about video games in a minute here but obviously I still play video games which a lot of people think is a youthful activity although I don't think so I think because we all grew up in a generation that was at least had Atari 2600 like video games has always been a part of our lives so like you know I can't imagine like not playing video games at this point right but
727083	729764	But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.
730625	730845	Really.
731105	732746	I have to agree with that for myself as well.
733326	736848	I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20-year-olds.
736868	737808	That's totally not the case.
737868	743891	But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time know that I was really sick when I was 29.
743971	747432	I missed two or three weeks of OLR because I'd been in the hospital.
747452	748693	I had to have surgery.
749073	755196	So it was one of those things where they had to screen me because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer.
755296	760420	I remember chatting with him when he graduated college That makes me feel old
782372	783232	Yeah, I know, right?
783572	786393	I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.
786453	788253	I'm like, my nieces can like drink.
788553	789033	It's weird.
789834	790834	I remember when they were born.
792834	794134	But now you can take them out drinking.
795055	800936	The other day, we got an email to the show that was like, I've been listening to you since I was 13.
801036	802676	I'm like, oh my God.
803836	804997	He's like, I'm in college now.
805197	805637	Oh my God.
805657	812038	Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?
812843	813323	Not many.
813383	816124	Gunsmoke, The Simpsons, Doctor Who.
816144	820226	There's only a few.
820726	821606	So we're awesome.
821786	827849	Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room and live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
827869	831190	I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.
831330	835351	Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.
835871	836992	What the hell was that?
837652	842955	Like, they say that that kind of stuff happens all the time, but like... It happened in San Francisco, right?
843876	844717	Like, later on.
844937	846418	Yeah, but it like totally wasn't the same thing.
846438	847919	It didn't like shatter windows and stuff.
847939	849419	It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.
849480	853122	It's just, you know, probably somebody's science project out there.
853142	855743	In Russia, meteors shatter you.
855943	861987	Yeah, yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook, little pictures in Soviet Russia.
862728	863788	I was busy being asleep.
864369	864609	Yeah.
865751	866851	Well, you don't live in Russia.
866911	870132	I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.
870272	871233	Well, no, no, no, no.
871333	875574	I mean, I actually didn't see the news until I got up like late today because I've been sick most of the day.
876414	877495	So I was like, meteor?
877935	878255	Fuck.
878635	878915	Sleep.
879495	882176	No, I just, I watching the videos online like blew my mind.
882236	887158	Like you can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass and of course the car alarms is always the best part.
887378	889359	Somebody get Bruce Willis' Armageddon.
890999	894820	I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia.
895140	896401	They have these dash cams going.
896441	899521	Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.
900062	903763	And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never phased by any of this.
903783	905543	There's no like, oh my god!
905623	906083	Right?
906163	906763	It's like, what?
909444	910845	You're just like, oh, that's weird.
911786	913087	Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die.
913207	913627	Oh, well.
913927	917350	Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in, I don't know, Philadelphia or something?
917390	918811	Yeah, and there's a camera going.
919311	920492	I can just imagine it right now.
920512	923614	Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said, and it was just a small thing.
924294	926476	The guy's driving on the freeway and he's like,
926596	928497	Curse Worfs, oh my god did you see that?
928878	929918	It's just like okay.
930218	932020	Oh my god thanks Obama.
933961	936162	I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.
936182	944728	I was driving home really late at night and there was a big green streak across the sky but it didn't explode like that one so obviously it wasn't even close to the size but I thought it was pretty cool.
944748	949951	I was like oh wow that thing just comes streaking across and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.
950092	952613	If it had been in my neck of the south it would be the fuck is that?
953053	953574	Hand me a beer.
955049	957650	Shit, that means we're going to get in another hurricane.
957710	961171	Porkchop in our chatroom says, I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.
962411	964331	I guess, I'm assuming they're in public cars.
964472	965792	Yeah, so I thought maybe it's a police car.
965992	972734	No, apparently they're really, from what I read, they're really into dash cams because, I guess, in traffic courts and stuff, they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.
972754	973894	They have to have physical evidence.
973914	974274	Holy moly.
974294	981356	And so, because of altercations like that, you know, any sort of car accident, they want to have something documented, so that's why they do it.
981556	984557	What did... Because, you know, Nelly was born in Russia.
984597	985877	Did she have anything to say about it?
986258	986438	No.
986458	986958	All the stuff?
987078	987258	No.
988278	989399	Thank God it didn't happen here.
990819	992120	It's probably... I'm glad it didn't hit.
992180	994340	She was born in the Ukraine, so it's... Oh, okay.
994380	995101	A little different.
995121	997021	A little different.
997641	998062	Interesting.
998842	1000222	Well, I don't know what that has to... Yeah, Rob.
1000302	1001823	Everything Slavic is not Russian.
1001923	1002283	Thank you.
1002717	1003337	Are you sure?
1003858	1005999	It was in the 80s.
1006079	1007280	I thought Canada was a state.
1008200	1008560	Anyhow.
1010401	1017045	I don't know what that had to do with video games, but as far as nerd news goes, it was one of those things where I watched it and I was like, oh my god.
1017125	1018606	You make a Burning Legion joke.
1019146	1020227	Yes, I saw that on Twitter.
1024904	1028286	Someone catched a Meteo.
1028346	1030248	Codeman in chat says it was Team Rocket.
1030748	1033930	Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.
1033950	1035751	There was a gif of the lights going out and the Team Rocket shows up.
1035771	1036412	I guess it was Goku.
1037433	1037813	All right.
1037833	1039194	That was a big Kamehameha.
1039938	1045120	Let's get into video games and the video games that you have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1045180	1046101	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1046121	1047421	I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar.
1047441	1048122	That was awesome.
1048262	1049843	Yeah, you inhaled that thing.
1050043	1051063	I love Mars bars.
1051103	1051583	It's good.
1052084	1053184	Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.
1055465	1057626	So I played, I beat Mass Effect 2 again.
1058927	1060988	And I started on Mass Effect 3 and got Flycam working.
1062329	1065110	But now, you know, we got that patch 1.5.
1065951	1067652	And none of my cheats work anymore.
1068252	1073115	So I just figured out how to put in keybinding commands using the Coalesced Editor.
1073695	1075956	And now all I have to do is hit 0 for God Mode.
1077677	1081099	But really, I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.
1083160	1084701	I played WoW for an hour.
1086969	1093772	I would actually log on and play more WoW, but I would like people to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to, you know, plug it.
1097913	1101454	Yes, I know that Mars bars are Milky Ways, but they're not the regular Milky Ways.
1101474	1102435	They taste better.
1103749	1104570	They're different-er.
1104650	1106071	They're actually from Mars.
1106512	1106992	They are.
1108374	1116221	You don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid, so having it say Mars with the packaging on it and everything makes me stupendously happy.
1117182	1120526	So, now if I can find whatchamacallits, I'd be even happier.
1122508	1123088	I played...
1125359	1126440	God, I played something else.
1127540	1128501	I don't remember what it was.
1129221	1148273	Oh yeah, Dan had a friend over and they played through Contra Hardcore and then played through Ghouls N' Ghosts, which was pretty fun because my friend and I left and then we came back and they were still playing Ghouls N' Ghosts like hours later.
1149213	1150454	So I'm like, what playthrough were you on?
1150534	1151875	Oh, just the beginning of the second playthrough.
1152775	1181203	really, so yeah and then I got now this isn't a game but it's related to a game, I found the Mass Effect Paragon Lost for like 16 bucks brand new so I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money, let's buy it it didn't suck the only thing that I really didn't like about it was how the kroken were drawn I did not care for the character design and it got me in the feels so I was like, damn you Bioware so yeah
1182580	1183301	Damn those feels.
1183661	1184341	Damn those feels.
1184882	1185722	Damn the battle tits.
1186543	1187103	Full speed ahead.
1188384	1188564	Okay.
1188884	1189224	All right.
1189364	1190205	Let's move on to Loki.
1190225	1191105	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1191906	1193127	I didn't play a whole ton this week.
1193367	1196489	I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim, I'm sure.
1196849	1205314	I started some of the kind of DLC stuff, or not DLC stuff, the mod quests, I guess, if you will.
1205354	1210698	There's one that's kind of extensive where you hire a boat and you can actually go to a bunch of different islands and stuff.
1211358	1212999	And it was neat, I guess.
1213259	1214560	I mean, it's pretty well done.
1215441	1222886	And they voice acted everything, so that's a little weird hearing people that don't sound like the five different NPCs that are in the game.
1223526	1226008	They have voice, all the characters, it's ridiculous.
1226988	1236691	Um, so I played a little bit of that, and then, um, a little bit of Borderlands, and, um, more Call of Duty.
1236731	1252797	We actually bought Map Pack 4, or Content Pack 4, so now we have a few more maps that I've already kind of gotten sick of, but we gotta do something because Grand Theft Auto V's not coming out in May like we had hoped it was, so, gotta have something to tide us over.
1253577	1253657	Um,
1255226	1260635	And then I just got done playing DDRX2 on my PC.
1261978	1263601	Even though, yes, that's an arcade game.
1264923	1267627	But it runs on a PC, so I played it anyways.
1269284	1271646	And it isn't the versus second mixing.
1271686	1272587	That's three, I guess.
1273168	1274109	But it's X2.
1275050	1275770	It's cool.
1275790	1278533	It looks like Step Mania, I guess.
1279554	1282717	It looked a lot to me like the PlayStation 3 version of the game.
1282737	1284058	Like they just adapted that engine.
1285079	1285980	Or the Wii.
1286000	1287061	DDR2 on the Wii.
1287081	1288903	I'm surprised they don't release like a PC version.
1289043	1290245	It runs on a PC.
1290305	1292186	There's no work to be done.
1293247	1294428	Literally, no work to be done.
1295108	1296449	Licensing would be the only thing.
1296629	1300131	I guess, but just put Konami Originals in there.
1300651	1300932	Done.
1301152	1301852	Put it on Steam.
1302052	1302513	There you go.
1303373	1303653	Money.
1304113	1304934	It's rolling in.
1307195	1307796	So there's that.
1307916	1313439	And then my wife has been taking over the Xbox because she's been playing Fable 3.
1315012	1315372	Really?
1315752	1316072	Yeah.
1316673	1318133	That's not even the best Fable game.
1318593	1322275	Well, she played Fable 2 all the way, and so she's playing Fable 3.
1323035	1327076	Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games, is getting into Fable, or is into Fable.
1327117	1327857	Yeah, she is into Fable.
1327937	1328137	Huh.
1328937	1330038	Does she play good or bad?
1330398	1330838	She's playing good.
1331158	1332338	Okay.
1332739	1333159	That game is...
1335660	1340022	It just makes me realize how much Peter Molyneux is full of crap.
1341123	1348106	He's just talking about all these different enhancements.
1348207	1353349	Oh, this is the first time ever in the game, and the dog is awesome, blah, blah, blah.
1353749	1355891	It's like, okay, you're so full of shit, it's not even funny.
1356211	1359372	By the way, folks, is anyone still curious about Curiosity?
1359412	1362334	Because I'm pretty sure everybody's fucking forgotten about this game.
1362774	1363174	Curiosity.
1363214	1365876	No, you know who hasn't forgotten about Curiosity is Alan.
1366196	1370619	Because I'll be sitting there on my iPad and then he'll walk into the room and he'll be like, have you checked on the cube, Rob?
1370639	1371380	Have you checked on the cube?
1371420	1372040	What's in the cube?
1372080	1373141	Did you find what's in the cube yet?
1373741	1374262	Touch, touch.
1374302	1374942	Break the cubes.
1375182	1376243	He does it just like that too.
1376303	1377103	Break the cubes, Rob.
1380165	1382687	I don't know what you would even, what that's going to be.
1382707	1388831	I think it's going to just be like whoever finally, the last person to give that game up is going to be the winner pretty much.
1389936	1398438	Well, I was going to ask you about this, because there was that new Alien game that came out this week from Gearbox, and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet, except for one site.
1398518	1400159	Apparently really liked it, but whatever.
1401039	1402759	And then I went on this Twitter thing.
1403400	1408441	Now, I don't know shit about this game, really, but I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's jock?
1408581	1410182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1434577	1435517	Well, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
1435557	1444581	Well, I'm like, and people are like, oh, we're going to sue, and I'm just like, well, game companies have been doing this shit for years, and you just brought up Peter Molyneux.
1444621	1446162	Like, he's the master of this shit.
1446502	1447823	He makes up shit all the time.
1447843	1448523	Exactly.
1449063	1450164	He's trying to sue him.
1450284	1457347	I know nothing, like, I mean, he's not really working, he's not really attached to any more Fable games or anything like that, as far as I'm aware.
1457947	1459388	There was Fable, it's not on rails.
1459928	1461490	I seriously don't even know the name of the game.
1461510	1462130	It's just Fable.
1462170	1463331	It's not on rights.
1463371	1463832	The Journey.
1463992	1464932	Fable, The Journey.
1466614	1469416	Fable, The Book, The Game, The Series, The Movie.
1469837	1470397	I don't know.
1470437	1474200	But yeah, even the whole Gearbox thing.
1474420	1475681	Well, there's two jokes I made about it.
1475701	1481486	First off, Gearbox, you've got Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox and Borderlands Gearbox.
1481506	1484609	Well, this is made by Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox.
1485870	1505204	And then the second thing is, yeah, just because they showed more fancy features and stuff like that, that may have been running on a PC version or something like that, that come time to actually implement that on a console, oh, we don't have the memory bandwidth to do all these fancy things, we've got to scale it back a bit.
1505764	1510067	or, oh, we don't have enough processing power or the frame rates, you know, shit or whatever.
1510667	1511968	And so maybe that's why.
1512028	1517552	But then again, why wouldn't they just allow that to kind of run, you know, unleashed on the PC?
1517732	1519573	Probably because it's a console port.
1519673	1520034	I don't know.
1522415	1522855	Who cares?
1523636	1524697	Bad games happen all the time.
1524737	1528579	Are you really surprised that, like, a movie-tying game is bad?
1529140	1529360	Really?
1529620	1533502	I mean, everybody's shocked that this movie-tying game is bad?
1533723	1534023	I mean...
1535856	1536737	It doesn't really matter.
1536918	1542946	It's just... Yeah, we all really kind of hope that the games are good as Borderlands.
1542966	1547513	Hell, I thought, you know, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be awesome because it's done by the guys at Borderlands.
1548594	1548715	No.
1549396	1551519	No, it's the team that did Duke Nukem Forever, clearly.
1551819	1551959	Yeah.
1554253	1564481	Ross Steel UT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Differences is great, but when there's literally one that looks shady, even with a game that doesn't get well received, there's always at least a group of people who like the game.
1564882	1573048	Well, yeah, I mean, you know, one guy liked the game, but I can think of other games where there's been that one voice that passionately defends it.
1573068	1575470	Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as what they...
1576471	1578733	I can't believe I am the one defending a big name site
1600991	1602412	I'm usually the first one to criticize that stuff
1622505	1626708	There was more evidence and there was stuff that came out about that and all the shady dealings.
1626728	1634172	And the guy himself basically said, yeah, there was some stuff going on where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff.
1634652	1636033	I mean, I don't know.
1636854	1639195	I just think the internet should just get over it.
1639415	1641877	Okay, there was one person that said it was good.
1642737	1643398	Well, you know what?
1643458	1645399	Somebody out there probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2.
1646059	1647640	Somebody out there probably liked Yaris.
1648301	1648801	It was free.
1649321	1651184	I like Silent Hill Revelations, the movie.
1651785	1652646	Nobody else likes that.
1652666	1653207	I want it.
1653587	1654308	I need to see it.
1654328	1655970	You and Osfer, actually.
1656091	1657713	Osfer would defend that.
1657733	1658334	So there you go.
1658374	1661177	It's something about being high on the leaderboards on VOG.
1661278	1662499	Actdeft would probably like it, too.
1663501	1664282	He did like it, I think.
1664842	1665363	Oh, my God.
1667064	1679327	If you're going to mark games down just because of glitches and stuff like that, then Earth Defense Force 2017 should have gotten a 1 out of 10 because that thing is glitchy as hell.
1679427	1685128	There is no physics, no physics whatsoever, or at least no realistic physics.
1686749	1687609	It's just crap.
1687629	1689269	The AI is completely retarded.
1690509	1692510	So yeah, it happens.
1694418	1716540	Ross Deal UT in chat says and it wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with the game it took seven fucking years to make and had eight devs on it Lincoln just came out a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think 18 years to make that's why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd because she was cast in it like 10 years ago and you know had to defend the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated for an Oscar
1717240	1719021	Sometimes things get trapped in development hell.
1719081	1720582	It doesn't necessarily mean they turn out bad.
1720622	1721422	Like Duke Nukem Forever.
1721883	1725264	Well, but that's not helping my case, actually.
1725405	1725505	L.A.
1725525	1727045	Noire, I think, was in development hell.
1727125	1727526	Thank you.
1727806	1728646	That's a better one.
1728686	1729347	I got good reviews.
1729367	1729667	Thank you.
1729707	1731268	Grand Theft Auto V just got delayed.
1731708	1736270	Yeah, but that hasn't been announced very long.
1736310	1739152	I mean, it's not like Grand Theft Auto V coming out in 2001.
1739272	1740973	It's like, wait a second.
1743114	1744155	We're missing some numbers here.
1745015	1747337	All right, let's move on with Gaming Week, so we're going to be here for an hour.
1747637	1749599	I'll talk about my Gaming Week real quick, and then we'll go to Flacco.
1750580	1757085	I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week because I've been having long hours at work, and when I come home, I'm like, I have to raid and wow or something.
1757526	1765592	But I did play one new game, and it was something where it went on sale this weekend, and so I get a text message from Shane.
1765913	1766093	Hey.
1766113	1766173	Hey.
1766953	1767974	You should get Pokemon Black 2.
1769254	1773356	Black 2 has the sassier Pokemon and it's on sale right now at Best Buy.
1773436	1774496	So you should get it.
1774857	1775817	I get a text an hour later.
1775837	1776417	Did you get it yet?
1776757	1777538	Text an hour later.
1777838	1778938	You know you can order it online.
1778958	1780879	You can just go pick it up after work before it sells out.
1781259	1783920	And it's like, you know, he keeps texting me like, did you buy the Pokemon yet?
1783960	1784841	Why haven't you bought Pokemon?
1784861	1785701	Why won't you take a good deal?
1785741	1786942	You can talk about it on OLR.
1787282	1788702	So finally it's like, shut up!
1788783	1789823	Alright, I'll buy the game!
1789983	1792464	So Jamie, are you going to get in the Pokemon now pretty soon?
1792484	1794405	Because you guys are all fucking like
1794665	1797772	Gateway, Game Addicts or something.
1798434	1799837	Yeah, okay, say that now.
1800278	1800719	Let me see it.
1800979	1802041	You want to see it?
1802302	1803144	No, I want to see the box.
1803184	1804246	It's actually super cute.
1804407	1804888	I don't care.
1806636	1807576	Alright, so here's the thing.
1807996	1808897	It's on the DS.
1808957	1810777	Not the 3DS, but the DS.
1810957	1813138	Well, then I could play it, but I don't care.
1813438	1814638	I've been having fun with it.
1814698	1815038	You know what?
1815458	1816859	Here's what I like compared to Pearl.
1817219	1818279	It moves at a faster pace.
1818639	1823480	It gives you all this shit up front, and you don't have to go forever and grind more.
1823840	1827741	And I feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon at the beginning than there was in Pearl.
1828402	1831522	And it's just kind of little quality of life improvements.
1831943	1832683	Here's where the game...
1833763	1837724	Kind of, like, goes crazy, though, is that there's all these, like, online things.
1837744	1840125	Like, I can't figure out half this shit with the online.
1840165	1843786	Like, some of it's in the manual, and some of it I tried to go online.
1843806	1846847	I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me, but it's just, it's so weird.
1847187	1860312	Like, you can use your little online gear to put your Pokemon to sleep, and then you go on the website, and you register for the website, and then you link your DS to the website, and then you can...
1861272	1880286	Do that Pokemon that you just put to sleep you can have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville but you can also play these little online games so your Pokemon can send you things back in the regular game once you tell your Pokemon to wake up and then you launch your game again and you hit the button to tell it to wake up and go find where it was.
1880326	1883828	Like it's like oh my god, it's like an 18 step process.
1884128	1887030	My brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment you said put them to sleep.
1887311	1887731	Laughter
1891280	1892161	Sorry, Pikachu.
1907347	1912212	The fact that there's just all these bells and whistles that are buried like five menus deep is just, I don't know.
1912572	1915155	I feel like Pokemon kind of needs a better interface.
1915975	1918918	Like it would be better if they could streamline a lot of that.
1919559	1924304	Maybe the new 3DS version X and Y will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks good.
1925084	1926706	So it'll be cool to see that.
1928103	1953344	but yeah, I mean, don't let my little rant get you wrong especially for the core game about finding the new Pokemon and challenging the gym leaders and all that it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace than the other games do so you'll get pretty immediate rewards out of it there's a medal system in the game since Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did their own little thing with medals and you can have your little title when you go online you know what?
1954245	1955326	I found my copy of Pearl
1955865	1957065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1980350	1981090	Thanks for watching!
1998015	1998876	Oh, I should say this, too.
1998976	2002738	I'm playing Pokemon Black 2, and I didn't play Black 1, and I'm doing just fine.
2003098	2004939	So, like, the sequel thing, not an issue.
2005260	2007541	And I can appreciate that.
2007861	2011824	They always reference, like, all the people that you talk to are like, two years ago, this happened.
2012084	2013225	Two years ago, this happened.
2013305	2015246	So I guess that's kind of its way of catching you up.
2015746	2017848	So that's kind of cool, I guess.
2018708	2019609	What is this that you're showing me?
2020069	2022691	That internet meme is seriously 15 years old.
2023011	2026112	I know, I think it's great that someone still remembers it.
2026173	2027393	She's showing me the pictures of the cats.
2027433	2028154	Oh, is that in chat room?
2028874	2031215	Yeah, the pictures of the cats playing Pokemans.
2031275	2032736	It says, my Pokemans, let me show you them.
2032796	2033937	I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago.
2033957	2034717	I'm saving it.
2036338	2036599	All right.
2037199	2038661	Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?
2039421	2039962	It was pretty good.
2040002	2041203	I got to play a lot of games this week.
2041443	2044106	Or not a lot of games, but a lot of two games.
2044446	2046969	And the first one was Unfinished Swan.
2047709	2054376	I kind of bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because I played the demo, which is basically just the first level, and really liked it.
2055036	2056117	And my wife kept pestering me.
2056137	2057499	She's like, why don't you just buy this game?
2057839	2060221	We love playing the demo, but then we have to stop.
2060301	2060382	And
2060902	2061923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2083523	2085724	And we ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday.
2085744	2086604	We'd go back and forth.
2086644	2087764	I'd watch a little of the game.
2087784	2088765	We'd play some more of that.
2089145	2092866	I tweeted about that, and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer of the game.
2092886	2097007	So I didn't hashtag anything, but I guess you can have stuff come up.
2098087	2106130	This tweet deck, I think, allows you to run one feed for your Twitter, but you can also run a search, and it'll pop right up there.
2106510	2106690	Yeah.
2107210	2112033	Okay, do you remember when we had Ronnie from Big Brother 11 on Horde House a couple weeks ago?
2112273	2112814	Yeah.
2112874	2118017	Okay, so we got him, this was really Shane and X4's doing, I can't take credit.
2118057	2123861	We got him addicted to Frog Fractions, which is that Flash game, and if you haven't heard of it, it's hilarious.
2123901	2126723	But Shane and X4 won't shut up about that game, so they were talking about it on the show.
2127103	2133788	So I sent Ronnie the link, and I said something like, here's Frog Fractions, you're welcome, I've ruined your life or whatever, something like that.
2137190	2139192	DarkSakura.com
2156252	2168260	So yeah, so I played that, and mainly, I'd gotten all the trophies, except for, we still needed the, the hardest trophy to get in the game was to do the first level only using three paintballs.
2168320	2180328	And the point of the game is you splatter paint around, at least the first part of the game, you splatter paint around to see where you're going, and it's kind of like a puzzler, it's kind of built like a shooter though, you know, because you just have like, you're just shooting paintballs all over the place.
2180348	2181929	Can you make dirty noises while you're doing it?
2181949	2186032	Because the way you describe it, where you're like shooting paint everywhere, you can make these really disgusting noises, like,
2186912	2187912	Thanks for watching!
2208257	2209738	But yeah, so we did that.
2209798	2210838	My wife talked me through it.
2211218	2215000	She found a guide online, and it's like, walk backwards until you hit a wall.
2215260	2216641	Walk left until you hit a wall.
2217001	2217661	Walk straight.
2217681	2219202	You'll hear leaves cracking under your feet.
2219222	2221043	Because you're pretty much a due-level blind.
2221083	2222983	Everything's completely whited out.
2223504	2226085	So we got that trophy, and that was our 100% for that.
2226165	2226945	So that was really cool.
2227485	2229426	And the other game I played, of course, was Ni No Kuni.
2229886	2233848	I passed the 31-hour mark last night, and I played a little bit more today.
2234168	2235609	Did it go downhill after 15 hours?
2236906	2238607	No, I have no idea what that was about.
2238667	2242270	I don't know, maybe my hours are different than other people's because I've been doing everything.
2242871	2247274	So I guess you can't really get... Can you hit a wall if you're just doing everything?
2247394	2247874	I don't think so.
2247894	2254779	I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to speed through it really fast, and then you kind of hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough, maybe you haven't gone out there.
2254980	2263326	Because it is pretty grindy, though I found it's not super grindy for me because if I do the quests, in the process of doing the quests, I fight enough battles that I level up and...
2263806	2268653	It's not really felt grindy to me, but I could see how people would think it's too grindy.
2268914	2269995	But I don't mind that.
2270035	2275723	I mean, Secret of Mana is really, really grindy, and there's no question that you just have to go out and grind, grind, grind to get your party up.
2276306	2278546	Old school Final Fantasy games were very, very grindy.
2306292	2309653	I spent an hour trying to get... What is that town?
2309733	2310233	Alma Moon?
2310253	2311793	The one with the milk, right?
2311833	2312113	Yeah.
2312154	2313254	Were you trying to get the babanas?
2313394	2315314	The big banana guys?
2315594	2318675	I had to search for the banana guys for an hour.
2319395	2320316	An hour!
2320856	2322936	And then finally, I trapped one.
2323016	2324517	And then here's the hilarious part, right?
2324537	2327137	Because for that quest, you have to get the banana and the turban monkey, right?
2327317	2327477	Yeah.
2327657	2329598	So I go, and I'm like all excited.
2329878	2333739	So I go to turn in the banana, and he's like, Oh, you got the bananas, but you didn't get the turban monkey.
2334199	2336721	Well, what I didn't realize is that the Turban Monkey had evolved.
2337942	2338162	Really?
2338182	2339423	Because I had him in my party.
2339783	2340984	So the Turban Monkey evolved.
2341224	2342205	So I had to go get another one.
2342405	2344426	They don't evolve unless you give them a treat.
2344686	2345987	Well, he was in my party.
2346047	2346868	I wanted him to evolve.
2346888	2348209	I didn't realize that would fuck up the whole thing.
2348229	2348869	That's so adorable.
2348949	2350030	I'm going to feed you.
2350070	2350991	He was so hungry.
2351091	2351551	I wanted him.
2351731	2352832	I don't evolve very quickly.
2352852	2353953	Don't feed him after midnight.
2354513	2356495	Yeah, I fed him after midnight, and that was my mistake.
2356715	2357876	Yeah, well, that's pretty bad.
2358116	2359477	I could have screamed.
2360257	2361118	I could have screamed.
2361138	2362519	That's why I haven't played in a week and a half.
2362539	2363960	I'm still punishing the game.
2364060	2367062	Well, see, when I do those quests, I usually go out and just do that.
2367262	2369263	Because I consider that kind of one of my grind sessions.
2369283	2373406	Because I know those... I think it's only come up one at a time in a different town.
2373746	2375307	And that's the first thing I'll do.
2375327	2376688	I'm like, oh, this is a good time to grind.
2377008	2379250	Because this one quest requires a lot of grinding.
2379290	2381691	So I'll go out and I'll go tame the three pets.
2382092	2382952	And then I'll bring them back.
2383052	2384433	And I bring them back right away.
2384533	2385334	So I didn't realize...
2385934	2390696	I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway, but I didn't know that was something that would mess it up.
2390736	2391577	So now it's good to know.
2391637	2396379	You don't ever evolve your... I have only evolved the main ones that I use.
2396419	2397379	I don't evolve a lot of them.
2397519	2398500	I evolve them all.
2399260	2402802	Well, if you hold on to them a little bit, their stats get better and the stats carry over.
2403022	2405783	I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability.
2406063	2409385	I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not going to miss anything by evolving them, but then I'll...
2409565	2410125	All of all of them.
2433181	2434582	and you do the Coliseum stuff.
2434642	2436863	I already did the first round of the Coliseum and I beat that.
2437263	2438863	It was really hard, but I got through that.
2439023	2440604	The Fencer puppy is really good, right?
2440824	2441344	Little Fencer?
2441484	2442025	Or is it a kitty?
2442085	2442745	Fencer kitty?
2442805	2443385	The kitty, yeah.
2443485	2443925	I have that.
2443965	2444546	He's pretty good.
2445126	2446126	I still like my Might.
2446527	2448807	I look online and people say, oh, the Mighty Might's not that good.
2449528	2450208	But I don't know.
2450248	2450948	I really like him.
2451008	2451769	He's got a shield.
2452089	2452949	He defends really well.
2452989	2453890	He blocks a lot of attacks.
2453990	2456010	I still use him as my main guy's tank.
2456491	2456751	So...
2457651	2458071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2482709	2483550	I've heard it's pretty good.
2483590	2485793	And I looked online, most of the dragons are really good.
2486013	2487354	So I'm going to work on that one.
2503251	2522465	you reminded me about names have you really just sat there and read some of the suggested names because every Pokemon that you can pick in the game has like four suggested names and some of them are so fucking funny like the Turban Monkey thing one of the suggested names was Turbangela I died I died some of them are so funny
2522805	2523546	I need to look at that now.
2523606	2525747	I look at the first one and I always change it.
2525827	2528128	No, always cycle through because there's four for each one.
2528389	2532031	I named him Toad Bandit because he looked kind of like Toad, but with a bandit mask on.
2532051	2533131	So you're Toad Bandit.
2533552	2537814	Okay, so though, I have to ask this because this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones.
2538235	2541877	Is it when you rename them, they keep that name like forever through all of their evolutions?
2542337	2545139	But does it still let you know what they originally are?
2545399	2547880	You know he's talking Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon, right?
2547980	2548460	I'm sorry.
2548580	2550141	I was thinking of Pokemon.
2550661	2551641	It's really a lot.
2551741	2553082	It's pretty much the same fucking thing.
2553102	2556243	I've never played Pokemon, but now I'm kind of interested because I'm like, this game's really fun.
2556263	2558744	Maybe I would like Pokemon because I like getting my familiars.
2558764	2559484	I like feeding them.
2559504	2561365	The combat is the totally different part.
2561425	2561865	I'm sorry.
2562545	2566347	I look down for a moment and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like, Pokemon?
2567077	2576200	To answer your question, even though you didn't ask about this, you can rename them, but it will say what the name of their kind of general familiar is.
2576520	2578200	So if you need to look something up on that, you can.
2579140	2581461	For anyone else who's interested in that.
2581481	2582301	And that was my gaming week.
2582481	2583422	Nino Cooney, lots of it.
2583542	2583962	There you go.
2584742	2585522	Nino, lots of Cooney.
2585602	2585862	All right.
2586943	2589003	Housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR.
2589023	2593064	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and on Google Plus as well.
2593124	2594905	Please consider joining our fan communities.
2595325	2596046	and I'll see you next time.
2610635	2621411	Yeah, so today Bungie revealed Destiny and they had like a little kind of behind the scenes development video that showed actual, I'm pretty sure no actual gameplay.
2622153	2625998	Or if there was, it was so insignificant that I didn't remember.
2627680	2646816	but basically Destiny is this always on persistent kind of first person shooter adventure I guess where you take on these guardians of kind of one of the last civilizations in the solar system and you kind of
2647356	2652979	Venture out to different planets and stuff like that and fight aliens and all sorts of stuff.
2653279	2662803	I think originally the description was kind of like a single player co-op and multiplayer game all mixed together all at once.
2663644	2666245	It should be interesting.
2666285	2671888	I'm not sure exactly how you're going to interact with other people.
2672108	2676310	This reminded me, it sounded a lot like Phantasy Star, I guess.
2677133	2679674	You know, whereas that was, you know, Phantasy Star Online.
2680474	2681494	That's a good way of putting it.
2681554	2698978	That is kind of what it sounds like, where it's like you have this central hub type of thing, but you can go out with friends, and I guess they were showing... I actually did watch one of the four-minute videos they put out where they showed how the iPhone, and I'm assuming Android as well, would integrate with it, where you could, like, send messages, like, let's meet up on Venus or something like that.
2699398	2700398	I don't know.
2700438	2702178	Let's meet up on Uranus.
2702238	2703939	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2705540	2706961	Let's do some grinding on Uranus.
2706981	2711044	Dark side of Uranus.
2712145	2713066	It looks neat.
2713106	2716029	Definitely a huge franchise.
2716069	2718271	They've got a 10-year plan with it.
2718311	2718931	They're just going to...
2720368	2721348	Wait, wait, wait.
2721368	2721928	10-year plan?
2722228	2725989	The game announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, right?
2726910	2732051	I think it's going to be probably Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and then probably whatever next-gen consoles also.
2732351	2735552	So their 10-year plan is how to get you to buy it three times.
2735892	2738172	Is that really what the 10-year plan consists of?
2739252	2740193	It's got to be, right?
2741313	2741373	Uh...
2741573	2742834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2765692	2772741	I would imagine there's versions of Destiny in development for these PlayStation 4s and Xbox next to the one.
2772761	2776366	Yeah, I think that there will be, but it's definitely not going to be just next-gen.
2776747	2777167	They can't.
2777207	2783455	I mean, Activision's smart enough to know, hey, we're not going to gamble on next-gen right away.
2783495	2783816	We're going to...
2784136	2789118	They're going to do it like, okay, we're going to put out the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen stuff at the same time.
2789158	2791538	That way, if you want the next gen version of the game, you will have it.
2791739	2794099	If you want a current gen version of the game, you can have that too.
2794359	2797080	Because they know that there's a huge install base already.
2797140	2798601	Why cut out all that money?
2799081	2800241	And none for Wii U buy.
2803542	2805243	That's hard to say with Activision.
2805263	2810525	I mean, because they've got... They have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit and they even have a few games coming out.
2810585	2810905	Although...
2812378	2817239	I mean, I don't know how excited I'd be getting about re-releasing the amazing Spider-Man.
2818100	2819840	That was the Xbox 360 version.
2819900	2821640	Now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that.
2821700	2824601	They have a Wii U version for The Walking Dead.
2826222	2832023	And even though they did Call of Duty and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U, they're still supporting the Wii.
2832103	2834964	Actually, Activision is a pretty strong supporter of the Wii U right now.
2836824	2848090	Maybe followed up by Ubisoft, although a lot of their games aren't coming to the Wii U. I would see a Wii U version of this coming out.
2848150	2850891	Especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version, why not?
2850911	2851631	It would work.
2851831	2854233	Did you find the lack of PC interesting?
2854313	2855093	Because I sure did.
2856184	2857264	Yeah, a little bit.
2857284	2861026	Because the PC is the thing that could evolve over those 10 years.
2861046	2862887	And the PC is the one thing that will still be here.
2862907	2864547	As people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes.
2864567	2867709	But this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it.
2867949	2870770	Who's to say that there's not going to be a PC version for it?
2871150	2873971	This is just kind of like, hey, we're announcing this thing.
2874011	2875992	Really say which consoles it's going to be on.
2876092	2878093	So they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC.
2878233	2880654	It's just, I don't know.
2880919	2882399	What did you think about all this?
2882539	2887061	Like, when you watch the, you know, announcements and all that, now that it's kind of out there, what do you think?
2887081	2891022	Because I have an opinion that others might not agree with, but what do you think, Loki?
2891102	2893202	It looked neat, but I don't know really much about it yet.
2893223	2896283	I mean, I'm not going to be like, oh my god, Bungie made it, I gotta go buy it!
2896563	2900285	Because I didn't buy, I didn't really buy Halo, I bought Halo 3.
2900325	2902085	That was the only Halo game I ever owned.
2902925	2904746	And I was just kind of like, okay, this is hard.
2904966	2908907	I mean, it's just not like, I don't lose my shit over Bungie games.
2909491	2912593	I'm gonna be blunt, a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass.
2912993	2913733	Like, honestly.
2913833	2920636	Like, this whole, like, the video I watched and everything, this whole pomp and circumstance of, this is our big ambition, and da-da-da-da-da.
2920997	2932582	And, like, I really felt like half that video was like, well, you know, we made Halo, and, you know, we gotta follow up to that, and Halo was this, and we've poured all our company into this since Halo, and Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo.
2932602	2933543	Like, they had to name check Halo.
2933843	2935664	But here's the thing that gets me about that.
2936204	2948452	Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong Halo 2, one of the greatest video games ever made but here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison is that Halo 4, which Bungie didn't do was better than Halo 3 Yes
2951500	2952120	Absolutely.
2952200	2953601	In many ways it was better than Halo 3.
2953841	2954481	Better than Halo 2?
2954521	2957062	Eh, I don't know.
2957743	2963325	Gaming was a lot different with all those years in between and Halo 2 really pushed so many things forward in a different way.
2963665	2968647	But, you know, Halo 4, they didn't have anything to do with and it was a better game than what they did at the end of the run.
2968727	2969107	Sorry.
2970408	2971688	I'm not the only one thinking it, okay?
2972268	2978651	So, when they talk about all this Destiny stuff and how much of their Halo influence and all this has to do, I'm kind of like...
2980146	2987649	Now, are they saying that they had one foot out the door when ODST and all this stuff was being done and they were already working on Destiny or what?
2987749	2990070	What stock am I putting into this?
2990510	2993311	Because really, I felt like all we heard about today was an idea.
2993972	2997373	And although some of it's interesting, like the iPhone integration.
2997433	2998314	I don't think.
2999494	3000475	You know what this felt like?
3000635	3002316	This felt like a Kickstarter video.
3002537	3004538	Like at the very end... Oh my god, yes!
3004578	3005119	That's a great comparison.
3005139	3008602	At the very end, they're gonna like, okay, and now we need you to back this.
3008662	3009362	Go pre-order it.
3009422	3011404	We need you to go pre-order it and back the game.
3011524	3011884	Yes!
3014479	3015600	That is a great comparison.
3015700	3016821	That is really what it felt like.
3016861	3018362	It felt like somebody's Kickstarter video.
3018862	3022685	And it's like, you know, and there was very little gameplay in it.
3022725	3024986	There was some gameplay in the trailer that I saw.
3025306	3027568	I sort of remember it, but it was, you know.
3027728	3029769	The gameplay I saw was nothing new.
3030590	3031330	Nothing new.
3031551	3033412	But granted, it was three seconds of gameplay.
3033712	3034253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3055632	3064175	Well, here's the thing I'm wondering, though, because if you have this coming out, and this is supposed to be like a first-person shooter, let's just say, where are they going to put this as far as in comparison to Call of Duty?
3064215	3072937	I mean, if it's going to release with a next-gen console or something like that or around that time, I mean, you're going to... It's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter.
3072977	3074798	You're going to have Grand Theft Auto in September.
3074838	3077959	You're going to have some massive games in November.
3077979	3079519	You're going to have another Call of Duty game.
3080600	3084581	You're going to have... It's just, where are they going to put a game of this...
3086472	3112192	I guess I don't know it's Activision it's gonna be weird to see them splitting their resources as far as marketing goes between Destiny and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kind of like well Call of Duty is just not quite you know what it used to be we're just gonna kind of back burner that a little bit and just kind of release something that's a slight upgrade and people will buy it and then we'll focus all of our money into this because this is our 10-year deal thing
3114654	3118175	I'm looking at some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3118215	3120676	Codeman says, this is the first I've heard of this game.
3120736	3121336	Is that bad?
3122936	3127898	No, because when you really need to hear about the game is just before the game comes out, those week one sales.
3128278	3131359	But this is their efforts to get more people talking about it.
3131439	3133839	Success, here we are, and now you've been educated on it.
3134100	3134880	Well, and here's the thing, too.
3134900	3136000	It's like, why announce it now?
3136040	3137761	It's like a really weird time to announce it.
3137781	3138041	Why not?
3138061	3138441	Yeah.
3139601	3165255	why not it's an empty floor until E3 why is Sony doing a big announcement next week there's not a lot of other stuff video game things for people to be writing about Sony I think needs something you know because right now you know they don't have any PlayStation I mean they kind of announced their slate of PlayStation 3 titles with The Last of Us and then they've got you know a couple games that I don't think a lot of people care about like Puppeteer and uh was it the uh
3166997	3175623	Beyond Two Souls, which Beyond Two Souls looks alright, but let's be honest, that's not going to be this huge... It's still kind of niche, the genre.
3176904	3186250	And then their Puppeteer game, which I gotta be honest, their kids' titles aren't doing very well, or the children's titles, I guess, or younger skewed titles.
3186990	3204744	Um, so, I think they have to really come out with, you know, here's what our game plan is, you guys, you know, stick with us, you know, especially with the Vita, because, holy crap, Vita, there's nothing really announced other than, we know there's that new game from Media Molecule, there's gonna be the Killzone shooter game, and...
3206325	3210108	There could be some type of ace in the hole with the next PlayStation.
3210228	3213071	We don't know how the next PlayStation will interface with the Vita.
3213171	3215132	Could it do a Wii U type of thing?
3215152	3218775	Because apparently now everybody feels like they have to copy Nintendo.
3218835	3226781	I know we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even a little bit later in the show, but my bar for the PlayStation 4 right now is set so fucking low.
3227682	3228402	That's good, though.
3228422	3230404	That's a good place for Sony to be in, isn't it?
3231044	3234048	Don't they want... I mean, if the bar's low, that's actually good news.
3234529	3234729	Yeah.
3234769	3239776	Because they could really kick your ass with these... But I don't... Here's the thing.
3239896	3242480	I'm setting the bar so low because I don't think they're going to hit that even.
3242600	3245524	I mean, it's just... I don't expect anything from them.
3245564	3247707	I just... I'm expecting to be kind of like...
3249996	3250737	Okay, cool.
3251097	3258546	Well, here's the other thing too, is remember guys, it's February and the console won't be out until November, I'm sure is a safe bet.
3258606	3259406	If it's not delayed.
3260107	3260348	Right?
3261269	3264512	So, you know, don't expect them to say a lot.
3265782	3282176	maybe we'll get some pictures maybe we'll see a couple of the games but don't expect price don't expect release date don't expect all the bells and whistles expect an idea of what Sony thinks the next generation of gaming is please god do not be Facebook
3283016	3283657	Just don't.
3283877	3285299	I don't know.
3285379	3290345	Social game, I really just... I'm going to get irritated if I hear that word too much.
3290425	3295692	At the same time, I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need some more memes.
3296493	3296953	Seriously.
3297975	3298636	We need more memes.
3299476	3300997	Well, this is why it's a pre-recorded thing.
3301218	3301598	Namco?
3301938	3303959	Namco?
3304039	3305781	I'm expecting a Ridge Racer.
3305881	3307542	I'm expecting a Ridge Racer game.
3307702	3308663	It's been a while.
3309803	3311084	I need a new Ridge Racer game.
3311204	3318910	Alright, I'm going to move on with news from a company we always expect great things from, which had a surprising announcement this week that they actually let some people go.
3319330	3320091	It's Valve.
3321111	3325032	Yeah, apparently up to 25 people were affected by these changes.
3325752	3328973	Now, a lot of this is very vague, but some of this came from a tweet.
3329233	3332473	Hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet that said, Yep, got fired today.
3332853	3334554	Time for new exciting projects.
3335094	3338895	So, you know, that was somebody at Valve and was working on hardware.
3340515	3346096	And the Internet did some more research and found out that part of what she'd been working on was living room PC controllers.
3348257	3375428	Also affected thanks to internet research Director of Business Development Jason Holtman had left the company Some employee pages on Valve site actually changed pretty significantly Very interesting Gabe Newell did end up commenting on this to Engadget Quote, we don't usually talk about personnel matters for a number of reasons There seems to be an unusual amount of speculation about some recent changes here So I thought I'd take the unusual step of addressing them
3375868	3377649	No, we aren't canceling any projects.
3378070	3381052	No, we aren't changing any priorities or projects we've been discussing.
3381472	3384474	No, this isn't about Steam or Linux or hardware or whatever game.
3384894	3389077	We're not going to discuss why anyone in particular is or isn't working here.
3390258	3393700	So, it could have nothing to do with layoffs.
3393800	3399844	Maybe something, I mean, it could be a personnel issue, although, I mean, that's a hell of a speculation.
3400004	3405068	If, let's just say that he was working on, you know, controllers,
3405908	3411594	I don't think they really need to work on a controller because it's already kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller.
3412855	3414017	Why do we need another controller?
3414037	3414717	Well, this holds the Steam Box.
3414858	3416900	Steam Box would come with its own controller, obviously.
3417100	3417861	Yeah, but whatever.
3417881	3420844	I mean, just use another third-party controller.
3420904	3424508	I don't think they really need to make another controller.
3424608	3428572	Just use an existing controller or support any controller.
3428872	3457680	here's the other thing you know as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes happen at really weird times for reasons because the project is done and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one to another and it's not like the business is always constant there's not projects that go on forever unless I guess maybe Bungie's feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever but if Destiny doesn't do very well if that flops that's gonna be that will hose the whole company but anyway that's neither here nor there um
3459201	3460942	Projects start and projects end.
3461122	3465106	And if there's not a new project to go to when one project ends, people are let go.
3465306	3466507	It sucks, but it happens.
3466567	3467527	That's the game industry.
3468528	3473973	So it's just weird to hear it coming from Valve because it's like, dude, shouldn't you be working on Half-Life 3?
3476094	3477956	But who knows what they have up their sleeve.
3477976	3478476	I don't know.
3478876	3480137	There could be no Half-Life 3.
3480798	3481879	We will be waiting forever.
3483352	3488394	If you want to sell a million of those Steam boxes, just announce two exclusives.
3488654	3489855	Announce one exclusive.
3490655	3492756	Anything that ends in three coming out of Valve.
3493376	3498638	I'm talking Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3.
3499218	3503179	Any of those gets the lead on the Steam box, Steam box will sell more than we do.
3503219	3507461	Or just do the Orange Box 3, Half-Life 2, Episode 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3, and...
3511707	3513688	You'll outsell Wii U in like a day.
3514529	3516390	And maybe like Garry's Mod X3.
3516410	3516770	I don't know.
3517651	3517931	Alright.
3518331	3518871	Let's move on.
3518911	3519332	DarkSakura.
3520963	3528147	How about something that's a little less frustrating as soon as I can get a stupid iPad to work?
3528868	3532510	Okay, so there have been some leaks.
3533731	3538413	And people are kind of, oh, okay, you know, taking it a little bit in stride.
3538613	3545517	But there is a few issues that are coming out with the DualShock 4 release image.
3546558	3547879	Who all here has seen it?
3547919	3548379	So I don't.
3551553	3559217	Well, the controller itself, and the photo, by the way, also shows that that might be a dev kit for the Orbis dev kit.
3560258	3576208	But they're saying that, you know, just on the items pointed out on the controller itself is that there's the two-point multi-touch pad, the move tracking light on the controller itself, the loudspeaker, and a headphone socket.
3576488	3578209	And then they're talking about what they're seeing on the...
3579210	3592670	What I'm guessing to be the Orbis dev kit would be a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive, two USB 3.0 slots, and just a number of other things.
3592690	3594152	They're basically saying that...
3597117	3602439	It's going to be some pretty hardcore material and they have a lot of high hopes for the controller.
3603319	3606280	Now, honestly, I think that that might be a little too much in the controller.
3606320	3607981	I'm actually wondering how much it's going to weigh.
3608981	3613643	And I don't think it's going to come out with all of the things that they're trying to pump into it.
3613903	3614983	But it's interesting.
3615564	3616484	It does raise some questions.
3617977	3620338	I think it's actually not multi-touch on that touchpad.
3620378	3621379	It's just single.
3621840	3624622	It's the rear touchpad from the Vita, isn't it?
3624662	3627084	Sort of, yeah, because the rear one's multi-touch.
3627164	3628645	You can pinch and stuff like that.
3629465	3635510	But what's kind of different about it, though, is they're saying that it's basically going to be used for interfaces and basic stuff.
3635750	3638252	I don't even know why you need it, to be honest.
3638612	3642355	And then, of course, they are reshaping the trigger buttons on there.
3642736	3645157	They say they're supposed to be a little bit more springy, like the Xbox 360 stuff.
3647099	3654623	Surely you've all seen the gif of where the little move light is actually a siren and then the little screen is flashing used game, used game, used game.
3655083	3657545	That's the purpose of the screen.
3659166	3659926	The little loudspeaker.
3660586	3662287	So Popo can come get you.
3662307	3666270	It looks like the analog sticks, they've got a little difference on the top.
3666370	3675455	It's kind of got a little bit of lip on the edge of the actual sticks themselves so that your thumbs don't fall off of them like they do on the PS3 ones.
3675675	3683357	The one thing that they're saying with this one is actually that they were saying that there wasn't a corresponding touch on the back.
3683417	3686378	This is on the front of the controller is where the touch is showing.
3687438	3694440	Well, that's good because the rear touch on the Vita... Especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller, that would just be irritating.
3695461	3710575	and then the other things there's a share button on there that was spotted in the upper left hand corner of the touchpad area that actual speaker spot they're saying might actually be a microphone kind of similar to what's on the Vita I guess
3711656	3727505	or could it maybe pick finally it picks up your voice like there's a built-in cross voice chat thing on PlayStation like there should have been all along it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it had like a built-in you know headset in there where you put your um you know headphones wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your opponent
3729079	3729680	That's one thing.
3729960	3732301	I think it's one goldmine that Wii U is missing.
3732902	3734543	We've got this virtual console and all this stuff.
3734883	3738305	Why can't I play games online with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?
3738325	3738946	Well, here's the thing.
3739006	3744970	The problem, though, is I don't think that would work because if you think about it, there's no camera on the actual controller itself.
3745370	3746150	That you can see.
3747251	3749173	No, I don't think there's actually a camera on there.
3749193	3752837	You would see a camera on that.
3753318	3754059	Here's what I want to know.
3754839	3757923	They've got that little bar at the end that's basically supposed to be the move stuff.
3758023	3762187	How the fuck are you supposed to do that as a move controller?
3762728	3765170	It doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable at all.
3765991	3772633	I remember you can use the DualShock 3 for the nunchuck portion, if you will.
3772773	3774494	I bet there's a way you grip it sideways.
3775494	3778635	You can probably grip it sideways and use your fist.
3778935	3790318	I understand that you could probably grip it sideways, but your fingers would want to go over that light because you'd be holding onto the middle of it, and your hand's going to want to go over that sensor in the middle.
3790398	3791879	I just don't think that's a good design.
3792159	3810107	either that or they're going to have a separate move related something and this is going to be more for just like a gestural almost like the six axis was supposed to be I think it's going to be more like that because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve six axis in a way
3811387	3834059	um maybe instead of we need to remember very important you know this is a prototype big word there this will change this is not what the controller is going to look like so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that maybe it could be grippy I'm I'm making shit up there could be other things we don't see on it now these things can and will change they always always do so that's not the final look of that controller
3834959	3837921	I still don't understand what they're going to use that touchpad for.
3839042	3849669	The share button idea, I guess it's kind of neat, but once again, that also kind of scares me because that gets into the whole social gameplay stuff where, oh, I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook.
3850169	3852391	You guys can watch me beat up this hooker.
3852571	3853772	Well, you're getting the Ouya, aren't you?
3854432	3856214	Doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?
3856834	3856994	Yeah.
3857014	3859156	So maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works.
3859316	3867842	The touchpad on the front of the Ouya, I believe, is multi-touch, and I think that's meant for playing, like, other Android games that would not use the controller.
3868002	3872165	Like, you could actually use that to play Angry Birds or something like that.
3872225	3873065	Yeah, that just seems funky.
3873086	3877889	Even this seems funky to me, because I'm like, how do you translate on a tiny little screen what's going to happen on the...
3878269	3879630	That is tough, yeah.
3880131	3884654	It's not as easy as looking at a touch screen where, okay, I can see where my finger is.
3884694	3888177	I know where I'm hitting, but having it translate.
3888437	3894982	Although you say that, but then we all use touch pads, so we seem to figure out a way around that.
3895692	3902577	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Black Wolf, host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, name checks Uno in a comment to me.
3902877	3906940	And I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking about have a video camera so other people can watch.
3906960	3909182	I mean, Uno was a huge selling game.
3909262	3910863	I don't know if it was because of the camera feature.
3910883	3911063	Was.
3911523	3912083	What up, G?
3933817	3960194	Sony just show what they want the PS4 controller to be and then change big time like the Boomerang did Boomerang is an excellent example of how things can and will change or a perfect example the Zapper controller that they showed at E3 for the Wii that looked fucking amazing and then they put out a piece of plastic shit so works in reverse too it could alright let's move on with more news
3960874	3964715	Speaking of Nintendo, they had some announcements.
3965155	3968397	And it's very exciting if you're a 3DS owner.
3968817	3971417	Lots of news for you guys, including game announcements.
3971778	3974679	They announced a brand new Mario & Luigi Dream Team.
3975519	3977399	Kind of a new game in that franchise.
3978780	3982041	Also, that's supposed to be coming out for the 3DS.
3982121	3983561	I don't know if that was supposed to be an eShop title.
3983581	3984062	I don't think it was.
3984082	3985202	I think that's actually a retail title.
3985722	3988465	They have a special deal now if you haven't bought a 3DS.
3988525	4004461	If you buy the 3DS XL and Luigi's Mansion or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, you get a free game including Super Mario 3D Land or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask and Star Fox 64 3D and some other games you probably don't want.
4007623	4032588	Mario Golf World T coming to the 3DS this summer so that's kind of exciting there's a new Mario game Mario and Donkey Kong game more puzzle stuff that's going to be coming to the 3DS eShop as well as a new Dylan's Rolling Western The Last Ranger that's going to be coming out on March 11th which actually that's supposed to be kind of a pretty cool game as well
4034978	4036741	The Harmony Knight or whatever it was.
4036761	4038745	Yeah, Harmo Knight and Kersplush.
4039587	4041811	Kersplush is a really weird premise.
4042392	4045258	Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a rock thrown down a well?
4046670	4046890	No.
4046910	4048390	Well, now you can.
4048770	4051311	Doom Plague in chat says, was Fire Emblem on that list?
4051451	4054411	No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem at the Nintendo Direct.
4054431	4056732	Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out.
4057212	4058352	I think that just came out.
4058532	4060012	Yeah, it just came out.
4060473	4064413	Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS coming out.
4065073	4066794	And last but not least, the most important news.
4067954	4073215	June 9th, North America, June 14th in Europe, Animal Crossing New Leaf coming out.
4076276	4079317	The better question is though, what do they have for the Wii U?
4080598	4082218	And not a whole lot actually.
4082278	4084519	The Wii U, a couple announcements.
4084699	4089821	One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of DLC that's going to be coming out for New Super Mario Bros.
4089841	4093703	U. So that'll be coming out later on.
4094503	4095024	Oh, I'm sorry.
4112085	4112645	You know what?
4112945	4115247	It's neat because it's something different.
4115327	4117068	You can't really get anywhere else.
4117188	4118549	And it is pretty smooth.
4118569	4119209	Or on the Vita.
4119550	4120630	It's a pretty smooth experience.
4120650	4121691	Don't they have Google Maps on the Vita?
4121711	4122672	Oh, it's different.
4122752	4125814	Because the whole, like, fact it's got the gyroscope and that you can kind of look around.
4125834	4126694	That you can do it on the Vita?
4126795	4129096	I'll have to show it on the Vita.
4129256	4130597	I think you just get the normal maps.
4130637	4132038	I don't know if it does the whole sensor.
4132178	4133739	I know they have the gyroscope stuff.
4133819	4135420	Or even with phones, I think you can do that.
4136501	4139063	Not on, like, Google Earth on iPhone.
4139103	4140784	No, this operates very differently.
4141304	4168545	and it's all set up so that there's places already bookmarked to go take a look at and stuff the interface is interesting I mean it's neat it's the type of thing you would see as a demo but like you know it's not exactly going to sell any systems or make people feel like ooh there's all this new value in my system I like how they said free for a limited amount of time like someone's really going to buy this one I don't know if I would have paid money for it unless it was really really cheap
4171588	4172850	Super Luigi DLC DLC
4187664	4192968	I don't know what the price is on that.
4193849	4195490	Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more.
4195530	4196271	I guess we'll see.
4197392	4201915	Should be careful what I say, but I can't imagine it's going to be as much as you think it is.
4203617	4208622	Also on the Wii U, a new Miiverse community for Zelda!
4209403	4220053	I actually watched the Nintendo Direct and they did kind of make a little bit of a deal about this where they're like, it's the first Miiverse community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk about Zelda.
4220494	4223557	You know it's just going to be a bunch of people with their really creative artwork and so forth.
4224217	4229581	Um, which I guess it's neat, but it's weird to me that like, it's like, that this is a big deal.
4230221	4234024	Like, oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have a game behind it.
4234304	4235505	What a fucking concept.
4235525	4236105	That's stupid.
4236145	4239188	And the other thing too is like, Daryl, look at, oh, we love your amazing artwork.
4239208	4244751	Couldn't you think, you know, of an idea of, hey, how about we put some places where you can showcase that artwork?
4244771	4248774	We'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since I could, I'm pretty much going to guess this.
4248834	4251276	Well, Loki, it's, it's showcased when you turn the system on.
4252217	4253678	That's all built into the whole closet.
4253858	4257702	I understand that, but I'm just saying, though, that this is basically the equivalent of a forum.
4258263	4260845	How hard is it to create a sub-forum in a forum?
4261306	4263848	Apparently really difficult for Nintendo engineers.
4264109	4269794	Let's also not forget, though, that this forum is coming to iPhones, which was a pretty big announcement of the last Nintendo Direct.
4269854	4271656	So they're kind of setting the stage for that.
4272317	4273078	But, again...
4275356	4285609	I like Miiverse, and there's a lot about it I do like, and I've talked about that before when I talked about the Wii U in general, but I don't think this is a game changer.
4286189	4287992	It's a logical next step.
4288132	4290815	Here's my worry, or maybe theory or something...
4292316	4300059	This whole thing, they're all like, oh, there's a lot of news that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans and 3DS fans.
4300079	4302660	This is so that you guys know there's stuff coming.
4303320	4305741	There wasn't really anything for the Wii U, though.
4305821	4313644	It was all 3DS, which makes me wonder, how far away are we from an announcement that the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U gamepad?
4313704	4320306	Because they have a ton of shit coming out for the 3DS and nothing coming out for the Wii U. It makes perfect sense to say, hey,
4320922	4321824	Two birds, one stone.
4321844	4322304	There you go.
4323466	4326010	They won't be in 3D, but no one uses the 3D feature anyways.
4326051	4330237	We'll just have the top screen up on the TV, bottom screen up on your gamepad.
4330478	4330818	Done.
4331199	4331600	eShop.
4332785	4339511	What gets me is that they did this whole thing about it's the year of Luigi, and they really went all out.
4339751	4346997	They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie, and every little shot of one of their talking heads had a little Luigi doll back there.
4347057	4353582	But I was like, okay, the only Luigi stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion, which we already knew that was a thing, and that was going to be coming.
4353922	4360348	And then they say, oh, Luigi's a character in the golf game, and then this Luigi DLC, which is cool, yes, but...
4361388	4363410	to brand it all as the Year of Luigi.
4363951	4366252	I was kind of like, yay.
4366453	4369515	You know what you need is a Waluigi versus Luigi game.
4370596	4375160	Or just, you know, I don't know, just say we've got Luigi content.
4375320	4376060	Whatever, whatever.
4376080	4380984	Well, that makes me wonder then when is this new Super Luigi content coming out?
4381104	4384047	If it's the Year of Luigi, it's not going to be first half of the year.
4384487	4387790	So you could be waiting for this crap until fourth quarter.
4387810	4388070	I got it.
4388150	4389071	A new Mario is missing.
4390672	4392053	Did we say the year of Luigi?
4392173	4393694	We meant the decade of Luigi.
4395355	4397476	I mean, I'm just... The eventually.
4397837	4408803	Once again, it's just, you know, I would have thought that, especially after all these announcements of delays, even some delays by Nintendo, like of their first party titles, that they would have said, hey, you know what?
4408983	4411385	I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles being delayed.
4411705	4414807	Here's what we have coming so that, you know... But they had nothing.
4414847	4415668	They had nothing...
4417108	4424791	Doom Plague mentions in our chat room the part of the Luigi thing was also a new Mario and Luigi game where you're inside Luigi's dream.
4425351	4429572	Okay, yes, I forgot about that, but that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting character to me.
4429752	4431033	You are inside his dream.
4431573	4433794	I don't want to be inside Luigi.
4434154	4436515	How are you Luigi inside Luigi?
4436535	4436935	You're not.
4438218	4439418	Luigi-ception there.
4439678	4441039	It's like Mario Inner Space.
4441739	4449941	So again, it's not like, okay, so it's just, these were all things that existed where like, stretch people, we need a theme, people.
4451081	4452281	What's the theme, people?
4452781	4454381	I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street.
4454441	4456062	Let's, you know, go inside the dream.
4456742	4458742	The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard.
4460403	4461723	The Pikmin versus Garden Gnomes.
4463199	4468702	Lego City Stories, Luigi seen Legos.
4470203	4471683	Luigi likes Legos.
4471863	4473004	Luigi likes Legos.
4476086	4476606	Crap.
4477586	4478787	Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
4479147	4479907	They're both green.
4480508	4480768	Yes.
4481288	4481528	Yes.
4481948	4482249	Green.
4482689	4483229	We'll go with that.
4483309	4484310	The Legend of Luigi.
4485910	4486210	All right.
4486251	4487311	Let's move on with more news.
4487471	4488412	Then we'll get to release dates.
4488452	4488992	DarkSakura.
4490445	4493748	And is cheaper and has more games, to be fair.
4518541	4526130	But, still, you know, their goal was supposed to be, I think, over $100,000.
4526190	4528492	Well, well over that, really.
4528953	4530535	But they've completely undersold.
4531856	4534479	And so now, they're...
4536394	4547737	They had announced that it sold 3.06 million worldwide as of December.
4548597	4553519	But now their forecast of 5.5 million has gone down to 4 million worldwide.
4553839	4555539	And I bet it's going to go down again at the end of this month.
4555599	4558200	I don't see any more systems.
4558220	4558880	There's no games.
4559000	4561521	There literally is no Wii U games coming out this month.
4562081	4562221	None.
4563433	4576107	I think that they're really probably looking to the handheld market to uphold their console market it gets me though that everybody is crying that it's the death of Nintendo and now Nintendo will be forced to do Mario games on the 360 ha ha ha
4580171	4584615	The unfortunate thing is that this is the exact same fucking thing as the 3DS.
4584795	4587577	Exact same thing.
4587617	4592401	The 3DS launched with a couple of good games, then literally nothing.
4592441	4595703	We got Ping Pals was a big release on the 3DS.
4595723	4597445	That was not on 3DS.
4597605	4598586	No, that was regular DS.
4598646	4598906	I don't know.
4599726	4608470	Still, you had shit on the 3DS for a long time and then finally they dropped the price and like a couple years later, the 3DS is bomb.
4609050	4612212	And hopefully Nintendo can make magic work twice.
4612712	4620035	I think the only danger part is that Nintendo is going to have to work that magic twice and they may have to drop the price of the Wii U in order to do it.
4620275	4621236	Well, maybe then I'd get one.
4621496	4622296	Yeah, I think that's awesome.
4622316	4624217	Nevertheless, they don't have a 3DS, you know, so...
4626439	4651557	Special Year of Luigi Green Wii U I don't want to see a green Wii U I'm wondering what they're going to do with the price Especially when these new consoles launch Because it's going to be tough If they're having trouble getting people to be interested in it now When you have all that buzz of all these awesome games Especially if, God forbid, that Destiny or something like that is not on the Wii U
4654039	4660443	Grand Theft Auto is on the Wii U. Destiny is on the Wii U. Madden is on the Wii U. I mean, people are going to be like, well, why do I need a Wii U?
4660463	4663684	Yeah, but if Zelda is on the Wii U. I mean, that's all it took for the 3DS.
4663704	4664785	It's Wind Waker though.
4664925	4666766	I'm not even talking about Wind Waker.
4666806	4668167	I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.
4668187	4669728	Yeah, new Zelda game is not coming out this year.
4670729	4674111	I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year other than Wind Waker HD.
4675629	4678091	But that would be enough for some people, though.
4678291	4687459	Something else to think about, though, is that, well, yeah, what if, okay, all they would have to do, Wind Waker HD comes with one playable HD Zelda level.
4688620	4689741	Flying off shelves.
4690201	4690722	Fly it.
4690742	4692243	You won't be able to find that shit anywhere.
4692483	4692803	Watch.
4693968	4698291	It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders because it had the Metal Gear 2 thing.
4698431	4702274	Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo in it that actually wasn't bad and got a sequel.
4702855	4703395	I don't play Xbox.
4703415	4703896	Crackdown.
4704116	4704796	Crackdown, thank you.
4704816	4705377	Or what was it?
4705477	4706117	Alundra.
4706357	4709380	Didn't it have like the Final Fantasy 7 demo?
4709420	4710160	Tobal, number one.
4710180	4710881	Tobal, Tobal.
4711161	4712102	I know I was saying Alundra.
4712462	4713063	Yeah, Tobal.
4713223	4715725	How many people bought that and all the Dragon Ball fans?
4715745	4717246	I think Tobal had an 8 demo actually in
4717586	4718268	Yeah, that was it.
4718308	4719271	It was the eight demo.
4719692	4720134	But anyway.
4720354	4723965	But, I mean, there's a lot of people who will go out and... Or, um... Oh, shoot.
4724266	4724346	Um...
4726653	4731476	Was it one of the games had a Xenogears demo with it too?
4731916	4732116	Yeah.
4732617	4736059	And there's people who will just buy a game to get the demo of something that they want more.
4736079	4748907	Here's the thing, honestly, and one reason I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now is because once these 3DS games are out, it is all hands on fucking deck for the Wii U. Everybody at Nintendo, first and second parties...
4749207	4749868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4770035	4780340	If we're still sitting here next January telling the same tale, then I'll entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo better be cooking up a Mario game for the PlayStation 4.
4780800	4788524	In the end, as long as there are people who have little kids they want to play games, they're going to go for a Nintendo system.
4789044	4796928	Nintendo has that level of brand recognition and the association that they're working as a kid-friendly, family-friendly system.
4798208	4801650	until the kid falls over and drops the tablet and breaks it.
4801790	4803751	Yeah, I mean, I agree.
4804092	4809855	They are owning the handheld market, but they may just not be a console... But they weren't!
4809875	4810335	They weren't!
4810375	4813797	Yeah, they weren't, but they may just not be a console company anymore.
4814357	4816318	I mean... Too early.
4816618	4821961	I mean, I'm not... I don't want to say I'm Nintendo defending and all this stuff.
4821981	4823222	I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this.
4823722	4824683	It is pretty shitty...
4825043	4827023	that this is having a worse month.
4827043	4829304	I mean, these numbers are so bad.
4829704	4831764	It is worse than any month, like the 360.
4831924	4834185	I don't even think Sega's done that badly.
4834205	4834805	Or PlayStation 3.
4835225	4835965	I wouldn't go that far.
4836345	4838605	Or PlayStation 3 has on record.
4838825	4839586	I mean, it's bad.
4839866	4841806	What were Dreamcast sales like in their first couple months?
4841826	4845126	You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point, though.
4845166	4847007	I mean, it's just a different culture now.
4847927	4853588	But I mean, there have been people that were drawing comparisons between Sega's last days and Nintendo's.
4854108	4873900	which is redonkulous I'm sorry it's just that that whole like nay saying whatever like that's like the anti fanboy it's no better but what did game what how well did GameCube do it was third place and Nintendo did fine yeah as long as they're making enough money to keep costs up in the company as long as they're turning a profit or at least breaking even
4874961	4879042	Yeah, and the handhelds are going to do that for them just fine.
4879122	4880843	So they'll make it just fine.
4880863	4881683	They'll be around.
4882003	4883684	It's not going to be like Sega.
4883724	4884904	Sega didn't have that handheld.
4885705	4887825	Sega also had some stupid marketing.
4888145	4888426	Yeah.
4888866	4891607	They also had, especially for the Saturn.
4891707	4893407	Really, really bad piracy.
4893467	4894728	That was the downfall of the Dreamcast.
4894768	4901730	Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast had an entire CD, you know, spindle of every single burn game.
4902050	4904331	And then had their boot discs to play their imports.
4905117	4906323	yep yeah
4908133	4935928	no comment it's not even close to some people had Parapara on their Dreamcast Rob I don't think that system's done I just think that right now the way they're they're not doing a lot to basically the thing is they're not doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U that they should buy a Wii U that's my thing is that they need to have some sort of like here's what's coming out soon not yeah we're working on a Smash Bros.
4935968	4936148	game
4936888	4937789	Yeah, you know what?
4938629	4942351	You could have just launched this system and not said anything and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros.
4942391	4942611	game.
4943531	4943991	Hell, fuck!
4944371	4946332	Just say, hey, we're working on an F-Zero game.
4946512	4947933	That would sell a few more systems.
4948173	4949094	Rob would buy another system.
4949114	4949474	There you go.
4949494	4949934	Hell yeah.
4952455	4953436	But I want to see the receipts.
4954137	4955278	You already bought a system, Rob.
4955338	4956178	I did buy a system.
4956218	4957419	I'll buy another for F-Zero.
4958320	4958660	I will.
4958881	4959681	I need two gamepads.
4959701	4960562	Two tablet controllers, yeah.
4960582	4961503	That's right, one for each hand.
4961723	4962944	Such a consumer whore.
4963385	4963805	And how.
4965727	4972713	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, package.
4972933	4977197	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U.
4977737	4978177	That's true.
4978417	4978817	Loki.
4979318	4981358	This week we've got a couple big games coming out.
4981378	4985940	The first one being Crysis 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4986780	4992122	Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4993302	4994323	We've got a PSP title.
4994443	4996743	Yes, there's actually a PSP game coming out still.
4996883	5001065	Axis Games putting out visual novels for some reason on the PSP.
5002166	5007810	Um, Hakuoki, Warriors of Shinsengumi on the PSP.
5008751	5009291	I want to play that.
5012354	5019860	And possibly at the end of this week, although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2, the add-on content pack for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5020401	5024604	In case you didn't buy the content stuff or pre-order the game or
5025177	5029540	or your console isn't online which you'll also be missing out on the next gen systems.
5029680	5035765	I'm planning on picking one of these up because it allows me to install it in multiple systems and I've got two systems that we play on so it's a lot.
5035785	5038167	Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?
5038227	5038907	Yes, I'm sure.
5038947	5039808	It's all on disk.
5041409	5043450	Alright, then I can move on to Japan.
5044391	5047052	On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, some price reductions.
5047552	5058718	The best series for Ace Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z, Ultimate Blast, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Ryuga Gotoku of the End, and Saint Seiya Senkai.
5059298	5065382	As far as new games go, on February 21st, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance comes out in Japan.
5065422	5066102	That's pretty awesome.
5066702	5068043	Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?
5069475	5074639	Uh, yeah Going into the, it's not new Oh, it's a re-release, okay I was like, what?
5074920	5076581	Also, how did I miss this?
5076621	5082005	Mass Effect 3, also on a price reduction this week in Japan Don't you want to play Mass Effect with all Japanese Garrus?
5082946	5093995	I don't know if they did the voiceovers again, if the subtitles are I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos to see if the voice is nearly as hot It might be subs, it might not be dubs, we don't know
5094761	5097722	Well, that just looks like the US trailer.
5097742	5098903	Yeah, it doesn't.
5099843	5100944	So it's probably just subs.
5102425	5102825	Oh, well.
5104886	5106787	Anyhow, let's look at other systems.
5106807	5108608	How about anything on the Xbox 360?
5109388	5111329	Price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon.
5111429	5112589	You have that to look forward to on the 360.
5113270	5115611	But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think the Wii U's bad here.
5116691	5117372	Yeah, exactly.
5119099	5122920	And that's another thing people tend to forget, is that, you know... Oh, well, forget it.
5124381	5132903	On the Vita, yes, the Vita in Japan, CL No Surge, Ushina Waeta Hoshi Isasagoshi Reincarnation.
5133804	5136805	Also, Next Rev Shaoshi Shiken comes out.
5136865	5138625	Both new games on the Vita this week.
5138745	5143227	Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week.
5143267	5143787	Did you know that?
5144247	5145047	I want!
5146028	5146628	Right?
5147468	5154253	On the Wii U in Japan this week, there is a game, Tank, Tank, Tank, but we've talked about how that game Tank, Tank, Tank before.
5154833	5160977	On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Magi, Hajimari no Meikyuu comes out from Bandai Namco.
5162078	5163359	Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
5165043	5167104	In the UK we have a few things.
5167184	5170666	On the 21st we have Metal Gear Solid Rising.
5171446	5177249	And then on the 22nd there is Crisis 3 and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC.
5178789	5180530	And I think that's it.
5180630	5181650	Let me check my calendar.
5183191	5185812	Because I completely forgot what the last day of the week is.
5185852	5186353	Yeah, that's it.
5187413	5187953	That's it.
5188093	5188514	That's it.
5188854	5189354	We're done.
5191159	5215451	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki So, we keep hearing a lot about this Xbox Entertainment and this TV initiative that they're doing Well, apparently what they're working on is supposed to be this interactive TV and they're saying similar to how they had the interactive presentations of the Grammys or the Oscars or something like that that it would be some sort of
5216551	5217392	I would pay for that feature.
5217412	5217512	Right?
5217532	5218853	Well, not for... No, if it was like Bieber.
5244778	5246099	Throwing tomatoes would be funny, though.
5246279	5246520	It would.
5246640	5249002	And having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends.
5252144	5253545	Release the bees on the beaver.
5253565	5254266	That's right.
5257669	5259530	Push B for Beyonce.
5261252	5264294	Or they could have eye tracking or something like that.
5264975	5268198	Who can stare at Katy Perry's breasts the least?
5268218	5268518	What?
5271735	5271995	Go!
5272195	5272656	Damn it!
5272676	5273036	Lost!
5273156	5274957	Or like camera switching.
5275237	5277199	Like, you know, like during a football game or something.
5277259	5277719	Enhance!
5278119	5278679	Enhance!
5279140	5279560	Enhance!
5279740	5285344	Yeah, during the Grammys, there's one on the stage and one on, you know, like Chris Brown and Adele fighting.
5285644	5287705	And then there's another one on Katy Perry's breasts.
5288046	5290727	And you can just watch that cam the whole time, every time she applauds.
5292969	5293369	Yes.
5293689	5294069	Rewind.
5295170	5295630	Rewind.
5296331	5299173	Ragenator in chat says, Push A if you want to release the Kraken.
5300831	5301272	Amazing.
5301753	5304237	How about just one versus a hundred as a network?
5304498	5304999	A lot of shows.
5305920	5307263	Could that be the interactive TV?
5307343	5308224	Because that would be awesome.
5308445	5309887	Game shows would rule.
5311831	5313874	But I'm not going to hold my breath because that's too good.
5316690	5324035	Right now, I would just like to see whatever it is that they're going to come out with and actually have it functioning without them saying, here's what we're going to do.
5324115	5330700	Because as far as I'm aware, and I know the new season hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit working with goddamn Game of Thrones.
5330800	5335563	So why am I supposed to believe that any of this stuff is going to actually work?
5335583	5336483	With smart glass?
5336724	5336924	Yeah.
5340598	5343640	And where's my goddamn interactive map on Android?
5343680	5345181	How about that smart glass?
5345361	5345842	How about it?
5345862	5347643	Smart glass is fucking useless on Android.
5347663	5349344	I can't, like, do anything with it.
5350405	5350705	Guess what?
5350745	5353367	Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you install it on.
5353387	5354588	It doesn't do anything.
5354608	5356289	Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?
5356449	5358530	No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3.
5359411	5360352	Woohoo!
5361997	5364318	Smart Glass is the fucking future, everybody.
5380225	5409417	the directional pad I've already got three fucking ways or connect why do I need like another way I'm sorry you know what Microsoft is Microsoft is the Fox TV of gaming I don't mean Fox News I mean Fox TV because like they announce this big feature and make a pomp and circumstance of it and then they cancel it after two episodes like seriously they put it in the Friday death slot like XNA Firefly right am I right one versus a hundred Wonderfalls am I right
5411266	5416790	Game Room What other Fox shows?
5417110	5418931	The Cleveland show, is that still on the air?
5418951	5420312	That is still on the air, actually.
5420332	5423714	But Game Room did last a good year or so before they pulled the plug on it.
5423734	5424635	Running Wild.
5424695	5427357	What was the show about the town with the lake?
5428277	5428618	Eureka?
5430139	5431239	Two episodes or something.
5431740	5432580	Eureka was on sci-fi.
5432640	5434862	I only caught a little bit of that.
5434882	5435903	Actually, now it's NBC, apparently.
5440105	5442066	would be the network to compare it to.
5442086	5447207	What was that show with the spies and they had like a house or something?
5447227	5447767	I don't remember that.
5448167	5449568	It's like that stupid, I don't know.
5450108	5451848	The Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a TV show?
5451908	5452628	No, not Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
5452648	5453809	Yeah, NBC did that one.
5453969	5454289	Yeah.
5454869	5455769	That was another J.J.
5455989	5458190	Or where Jamie gets her name, the Bionic Woman.
5458210	5459190	That came in with.
5459210	5459830	Oh my gosh, yeah.
5459850	5460430	That was an NBC.
5460450	5461751	Hey, I love the Bionic Woman.
5461771	5463491	Thank you, Tiger Claw Dollhouse.
5463531	5464512	Game room is Dollhouse.
5464552	5464992	Dollhouse.
5465032	5465412	Hey, thank you.
5465432	5466112	Give that a second.
5466212	5466532	Season.
5466572	5467413	Shadow Next Gen.
5467433	5469774	They gave that too much.
5469814	5477540	Game Room got 13 game packs and it had about 100 games well on its way to that thousands of games they promised at CES.
5477900	5478941	Thousands of games.
5478961	5482003	Thousands of games in my imagination.
5484404	5486025	Technist Sarah Connor Chronicles.
5486066	5486626	You guys are good.
5487479	5489140	That was actually a decent show.
5489380	5491061	Would it last like, what, three seasons?
5491161	5492362	Two seasons?
5492482	5495924	That's better than, you know, we're talking Firefly level stuff.
5495944	5497145	It had Shirley Manson in it.
5497165	5499687	Yeah, I was going to say, anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week.
5505621	5507383	I'm gay and I still drool over her.
5507503	5509444	She's hot.
5511386	5512427	One more story for you guys.
5512507	5516850	I don't know how to transition into this story because I'm not gay for GameStop, that's for sure.
5516890	5519953	How about a big burp?
5520373	5521915	GameStop, power to the players.
5521955	5523616	GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013.
5523696	5527139	Supposedly, even though they're closing 250, they're going to open 60 to 70 more.
5530962	5534885	But that's just, you know, location moving and as neighborhoods build up, there'll be new ones.
5534905	5535485	And purchased.
5536486	5538728	40 are coming from UK retailer Game.
5539168	5541250	So some of those GameStops will be in the UK.
5541970	5560104	A quote from the CFO, Rob Lloyd, if you care, during the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco, quote, "...closing 250 stores enables us to deal with the very small percentage of stores that we have that are unprofitable, but also to close marginally profitable stores and actually make more money by moving customers to other nearby stores."
5560484	5563665	We've been successful at that for two years and we'll continue that program in 2013.
5563746	5570028	Yeah, I think it's because a lot of these they took over like, you know, the EB games and stuff like that in the same mall.
5570048	5574971	Yeah, or like literally you have like a GameStop and then across the street another GameStop.
5576131	5577832	They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while.
5578292	5588835	Ugh, yeah, so, I mean, I think if you, you know, again, if you're in an unprofitable location or a redundant location, then you're probably in trouble, but I imagine most stores will be okay.
5589135	5596898	But you know, then CNN, or Fox News, since I mentioned them earlier, picks up a story like this and, oh, console gaming is dead, y'all.
5597378	5598518	console gaming is dead.
5598538	5600239	GameStop is closing their doors.
5600259	5605881	They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out that their games that they sell are causing people to become murderers.
5606181	5606361	See?
5606662	5607522	It's proof right there.
5607602	5608882	No, it's mobile phones.
5609063	5610663	Everybody wants to play Smurf Village.
5611003	5611604	Haven't you heard?
5612104	5612704	Mobile phone.
5612744	5613484	It's Temple Run.
5613864	5614505	That's gaming.
5614625	5616926	Smurf Village is just code for terrorism, okay?
5620171	5621432	See, now I have... The terrorist of one.
5621452	5627559	Okay, this is the mental image I'm seeing now is the Clicovision Smurfs with, you know, AKs shooting Gargamel in the face.
5629983	5631183	My childhood has been raped.
5632144	5635605	Well, all I have to say to this news is LOL bye.
5636425	5638226	I'm sorry to the people that work there.
5638286	5643248	I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living, but the corporation itself is kind of terrible.
5643348	5649971	So I hope that where the ashes land from old GameStops, a new indie retailer will emerge.
5650151	5650971	One can at least dream.
5651231	5656353	Hey, playing trade, now is your chance to actually become like GameStop since you think you are anyways.
5658803	5661065	Don't they have a very similar logo, too?
5662085	5663907	That's GameTrader.
5664587	5670531	Yeah, they actually think that they're like a GameStop, and they kind of try to push themselves that way.
5670551	5672292	They're like, oh, we've got all these stores.
5674734	5678056	They actually haven't expanded in a long time.
5679237	5683260	All right, let's take a step back to a simpler time, you guys.
5684426	5687110	Let's go back to a time where GameStop actually had competition.
5687951	5690895	Or back when GameStop wasn't even GameStop yet.
5690936	5691757	Babbage's.
5691817	5694601	Funkoland, Software Etc.
5695722	5700529	Back before they were just all swallowed whole by GameStop.
5701716	5702977	It's the classic game of the week.
5703138	5705480	DarkSakura, take us back to simpler times.
5706141	5708923	The game of the week is Sinistar.
5712547	5720915	Sinistar came out by Williams in 1982 and it was a pretty neat little game.
5721756	5725140	Kind of, though, for me, I'm not very good at it, but I'll just keep going.
5725661	5729426	Basically, you are in a spacecraft and you have to create Cinnabons.
5730166	5730867	Cinnabon?
5731067	5731748	I love Cinnabon!
5731788	5732349	I love Cinnabon!
5735561	5735861	Cinebombs
5760023	5763625	You have to shoot at planetoids and get the crystals that are released.
5764145	5769987	And you have to use the bombs to defeat Sinistar, who is this huge spacecraft with a skull face.
5771348	5775069	And, um, it's constantly under construction as you're going through the game.
5775089	5779171	So it's sort of like the Death Star, but without being the Death Star.
5781992	5783693	Yeah, beware, I live.
5785654	5789115	That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid.
5790286	5792187	I hunger for Cinnabons!
5792228	5795890	That does sound pretty awesome.
5796971	5797331	Wow.
5798452	5800133	This guy wants his fuckin' Cinnabon.
5800733	5807918	Wow, so is this like actually CineStar or is this like, you know, recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live?
5809800	5813062	This is the guy that goes to the airport to get Cinnabon, okay?
5815893	5817414	Okay, can I get back to the review, please?
5818315	5824699	So once Sinistar is formed, as we heard, the digitized voice pops up, who's actually a radio personality, John Doremus.
5825580	5829343	And it's played through an HD 55516 CVSD decoder.
5829663	5830184	Ooh.
5830784	5832586	Says, I hunger coward.
5834133	5837216	And then it tells you run, run, run, but how would you run in space?
5837696	5839838	Would it just be fly like a little bitch?
5840638	5840999	I don't know.
5841559	5841839	Anyway.
5843040	5846663	So, um, if, uh, basically it just eats you.
5847264	5852968	All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinebombs to satiate the Sinistar.
5854209	5856371	He needs that cinnamon sugary goodness.
5857712	5863097	So you move from zone to zone and keep, you know, beating Sinistar because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker.
5886147	5894657	So also, you know, of course, the CineStar can be repaired by its little drone fuckers unless you satiate him with tasty CineBombs.
5896178	5898201	So yeah, there were different ports.
5898261	5899722	There was the Atari 2600, the 8-bit computers...
5904107	5909331	They were almost done, but there was the video game crash, and they're like, no.
5909912	5916638	So we actually got it on the Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for SNES, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC.
5917078	5926627	It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures on Xbox, GameCube, and PS2, and then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play for the PSP in 2005.
5926707	5926807	Okay.
5928328	5928768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5946725	5954631	As far as other versions that have come out, there was a pseudo-sequel on the PC in 1999 called Sinistar Unleashed.
5955732	5962297	It had nothing to do with the original creators, but it was supposed to be a pretty neat little game.
5962377	5967080	And then Sinistar got re-released for the Midway's Greatest Arcade.
5967400	5971764	Hits on the Game Boy Advance without the cool features.
5973685	5982030	There's also a lot of other little... Because, I mean, Sinistar is really just, you know, a big part of classic gaming.
5982350	5982751	Like in...
5984585	5988888	There was... I'm trying to see if I can find it.
5989408	5994852	Yeah, for Team Fortress 2, the heavy weapons guy says, I live and run, cowards.
5995893	6000016	And then Sinistar is in one of the Dresden Files books.
6001337	6008321	A group of students at the College of William and Mary did a musical version called Sinistar the Musical.
6009502	6010323	I have to find this now.
6013118	6018820	And then they used the voice of Sinistar in an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!
6018840	6020001	The Abridged Series.
6021141	6023642	Which is a web series that I've been introduced to.
6023662	6025203	So yeah, Sinistar.
6025223	6025983	This sequel.
6026284	6026964	Beware!
6026984	6028845	When he wants Cinnabons, he wants over 9,000!
6029145	6032906	Couldn't help myself.
6033427	6035407	Let's listen to some of the voice.
6035427	6036448	Let's listen to some pain.
6036528	6036568	Oh!
6036628	6036728	Oh!
6044759	6046160	You throw those Cinebombs at him.
6046980	6047641	You go ship.
6048561	6049382	I need to play this now.
6049402	6050022	This sounds awesome.
6050242	6051843	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6052124	6054105	Beware, I live.
6054165	6055005	Cinestar.
6056206	6057607	Available in arcades everywhere.
6059312	6060713	If you can find them in business.
6060833	6061574	If you live in 1982.
6062495	6063896	So it's available in Bobby's Arcade.
6064336	6064576	Yes.
6067218	6069540	You had to have caught Bobby's show to get the reference.
6069940	6071862	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6071942	6074584	And geez, Ranchan, you're fast on the posting.
6075764	6077065	He's managing the tumblers very well.
6077085	6078066	He's managing the tumbler quite well.
6078086	6079467	Do you want to give a shout out to the OLR Tumbler?
6079547	6086953	The OLR Tumbler is orangeloungeradio.tumbler.com And while you're at it, look at my Mass Effect one.
6089099	6091721	Isn't your Mass Effect one more popular than the Orange Lounge Radio one?
6092401	6092641	Yes.
6092922	6094403	So you don't need the help.
6095123	6095924	I'll repost it.
6096444	6097545	I'll show some promo love.
6097965	6098625	You'll tumble it?
6098765	6101307	When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game.
6102328	6103248	That's not going to happen.
6103268	6105170	I think for the last episode of OLR that'll happen.
6106150	6106931	Last episode.
6106971	6108172	We're not going to have a last episode.
6108192	6109553	We're going to do this until we're dead.
6110473	6112675	Well, then there would be a final episode, wouldn't there?
6112695	6115278	Yeah, but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly.
6115678	6116940	This is morbid.
6116980	6118141	I don't like where this is going.
6119222	6120003	Beware!
6120243	6121084	I die!
6121684	6122886	Give me Cinnabons!
6123406	6124707	Rob ate one too many Cinnabons.
6124728	6125028	Be dead.
6128403	6130144	Let's remember with the theme from Mass Effect.
6131605	6131966	All right.
6132766	6134427	That does it for the Classic Game of the Week.
6134467	6139991	I've said that three times now, so I swear we're done with Part A. Don't go anywhere, because this show is so much fun.
6140031	6149998	We've got plenty more coming in Part B, including the Fugle Question of the Week, a very interesting patent name, something that Sony did, and, oh God, somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news.
6150058	6152740	Yep, there is news, and yes, it is legit.
6153160	6154501	Information on Mass Effect.
6154821	6159540	Coming up after this break, more of Orange Lounge Radio up next.
6166542	6169383	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6169483	6173903	In progress, our 493rd episode, February the 17th of 2013.
6175564	6192147	And if you've never been to Orange Lounge Radio as we are live, you should join us sometime Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where you can hear such live antics as Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break when some quiet music is playing so people can hear what we're saying.
6192727	6193367	Just barely though.
6194748	6195028	Oops.
6195708	6195968	Oh well.
6196568	6198169	See, at least we weren't talking any smack.
6198409	6200129	Yeah, it was just more Nino Cooney talk.
6200149	6202810	Yeah, it was Nino Cooney talk and Rob, coffee.
6204371	6205511	And birthday cake Oreos.
6205871	6206751	That's really all you missed.
6206811	6207071	All right.
6207592	6208012	There you go.
6208492	6211413	Actdeft says, it's the Flacco Jones curse taking its course.
6211713	6214714	Well, if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's going to get, I guess I'll take it.
6214854	6215314	I'll take that.
6215794	6216494	That's not so bad.
6217035	6218895	Unless, like, I was talking smack or something.
6218935	6224037	Like, I was sitting here going, like, oh, that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight, I can't even.
6224617	6225037	Just kidding.
6225318	6227380	Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week.
6229521	6231383	I played Aliens Colonial Marines.
6231403	6232424	It's all his fault.
6233705	6234606	He didn't warn me.
6236127	6236788	Why, Bobby?
6236948	6237468	Why?
6239870	6240411	I would never.
6240471	6240871	I would never.
6241272	6241612	All right.
6242633	6245655	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
6246076	6246997	Rapid fire news time.
6247157	6247377	Loki.
6247397	6247477	Loki.
6248160	6259472	So EA and Zynga settled their lawsuits over the Ville, which was ripping off Sims Social, and of course we don't know any of the details of what they settled for, but it's settled and that's over.
6260873	6261474	Boo!
6261714	6267740	I was hoping for a long, drawn-out fist fight.
6267820	6269922	I wanted it to be Judge Judy solved.
6270083	6271464	I wanted it to go to Judge Judy.
6273251	6273611	I don't know.
6273992	6278855	Don't sit there and tell me you didn't know what you're doing.
6279896	6288481	Halo 2 on PC, the multiplayer support has been extended thanks to, you know, begging from fans.
6288862	6292984	Originally, it was going to be cutting the servers off on, was it a...
6293965	6304771	February 15th, but apparently now it's been extended to June and they're investigating further options to support the fans of the Halo 2 on PC.
6304871	6305951	So that's good.
6307612	6312415	That's good news for the dozens and dozens of people still playing Halo 2 on PC.
6312715	6314275	Hey, who do you think has more?
6314376	6317837	More people playing Halo 2 on PC or more people that listens to OLR?
6318538	6319078	What do you think?
6319658	6319978	OLR.
6320999	6321319	Really?
6321819	6322920	I was going to go for Halo.
6323303	6339931	Actually, yeah, I mean, with all, you know, all kidding aside, Halo 2, I mean, it's the only place you can play it since, you know, they shut down the Xbox 360, or excuse me, Xbox regular one because of 360 infrastructure that they never really followed through on.
6341112	6344273	Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than 100 people on our friends list?
6344533	6344734	Oops.
6345234	6345514	Oops.
6347881	6357211	And then finally, Sniper Elite has a brand new game in their franchise, and going the route of most other game franchises out there, they've decided to add zombies.
6357371	6362015	So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is going to be coming out exclusively on PC.
6362035	6367701	It'll be out on Steam for $15, and that's at the end of this month on the 28th.
6369022	6372524	and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite, it's a World War II sniper game.
6373104	6378687	In the second Sniper Elite game, you actually got to shoot the balls off of Hitler if you wanted to.
6380948	6386030	They even had the cool Mortal Kombat x-ray mode thing where you could see the testicles explode.
6386390	6387630	Oh, that's so lovely.
6389271	6390092	Thank you for that.
6390972	6397215	And in case you didn't get that game, they actually are re-releasing the Sniper Elite V2 with the Kill Hitler...
6398824	6405668	DLC in there, which it should really be teamed up with Danger 5, you know, because their mission is to kill Hitler.
6405908	6410910	Orange Lounge Radio is apparently the show this week where people can hear about exploding Hitler's balls.
6411491	6412411	I thought I only had one.
6415013	6415433	Anyhow.
6417054	6417394	Is that it?
6418054	6418374	Please be it.
6418394	6418634	That's it.
6418734	6419155	Okay, that's it.
6420315	6422257	Let's move on to something a lot less offensive.
6422717	6425919	It is Bit.Trip, the Bit.Trip series.
6427080	6428901	Bit.Trip soundtracks for $20.
6430602	6440209	And when you pre-order with that $20, the Bit.Trip Runner 2 Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, you will get six Bit.Trip soundtracks for free.
6440289	6442370	Although they're not really free because you're paying $20 for it.
6442851	6446153	But pretty cool, you know, if you are a fan of Bit.Trip Runner.
6446253	6447554	So in other words, if you're not Bobby...
6447802	6456749	I was going to say, is that like kind of how they try to sell you two pieces of crap on TV and really the whole trick is just to get you to pay twice as much for more than one that you need?
6456789	6460792	The trick is to get you to pre-order a bit, trip around or two and boost its numbers.
6461263	6463384	But the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good.
6463424	6468926	If you like the 8-bit music and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff, you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks.
6469226	6473988	In fact, I imagine most of you have acquired the soundtracks if you're a fan of the series.
6474088	6476029	But wouldn't it be nice to get them legally?
6476629	6478130	And you can do that here for $20.
6478170	6478930	Pre-ordered.
6483614	6483954	Let's see.
6484694	6491836	Also, I guess apparently you can get some of the soundtracks for $1, and then $10 you get the Runner 2 soundtrack as well.
6492216	6492776	Well, look at that.
6494556	6495056	Good times.
6496296	6500317	There is a game coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive version of said game.
6500357	6502158	It's Need for Speed Most Wanted.
6502818	6509879	This game came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 last year, but it's coming out on the Wii this year.
6510819	6538523	and it's going to have some new stuff in it such as the whole you can actually have the off TV mode on the gamepad but then there's something about on the gamepad you can actually help somebody that's playing on the big screen you can guide them you can help them or you can either hinder them they're calling it a co-driver father and son mode is something that they've called it amongst the Criterion developers you can literally have a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your shit up on that gamepad
6538919	6539339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6567180	6569042	I'll be taking over.
6570103	6571824	Into the wall.
6571884	6572424	There you go.
6572485	6576428	So let me see a quote from Alexander Ward, creative director.

6593001	6599745	You know, when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Wii U, I got the impression that you were going to have two people playing at the same time.
6599965	6601526	One on the gamepad, one on the TV.
6601827	6602487	I think you can do that.
6602507	6603748	That sounded a lot better.
6604128	6604928	I think you can do that, too.
6604948	6605189	Oh, good.
6605489	6607650	I think this is another mode.
6607990	6620278	They should really have it just like passenger mode, where your gamepad is like the side window, and you can roll it up and down, and that's it, and the wind blows in your face, and that's all you can really do, is just look out the window and roll the window up and down.

6626542	6628804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6656164	6657705	Dan, coffee!
6658765	6665888	And every time we drove by a Starbucks, which when you're on Highway 99 is every five miles, Dan, coffee!
6667909	6668769	So Rob, where's your phone?
6668789	6669929	Finally, shut up.
6671210	6673811	So finally, finally we get to a Starbucks.
6673831	6675091	We're like halfway to Disneyland.
6675131	6683935	We finally pull over at a Starbucks and she gets her coffee and I proceed to leave my cell phone in the sandwich shop except, oh, it was actually in my back pocket the whole time.
6685622	6689685	Now you know when knowing is half the battle.
6689986	6692027	Aren't you glad she asked me to tell that story?
6692408	6693629	I didn't ask you to tell the story.
6693689	6694930	It's just that people don't get it.
6695130	6696832	So I could delay this news.
6697512	6704058	The 3DS has become the best gaming machine out there is a attention-grabbing headline that was run on Kotaku this week.
6704859	6707102	Wait, how many articles do they write about hating Aliens Colonial Marines?
6707142	6707983	I can't remember.
6708003	6709545	Was it in the double digits?
6709565	6710607	Because I think it was.
6723005	6750363	I honestly I was this story was something that was shared with us in the show role thread by somebody else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview with somebody but no it actually is just a whole story written about hey the 3D remember when the 3DS was fucked and now look at all this stuff it's just basically regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News that had already been run but now under the guise of this is why the 3DS is the best fucking game system
6752182	6761677	Considering that they're talking handheld game system, there's really only a couple to choose from, one of them being the 3DS and one of them being the Vita.
6761957	6765403	No one's really going to make the argument that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system out there.
6768843	6769604	I'm tapping my finger.
6769644	6770644	Do I want to go there?
6770945	6773126	Do I want to go behind door number four on OLR?
6773146	6776209	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
6777210	6777390	No.
6777830	6779912	Unless it has reach around, then it's shit.
6780132	6781253	I have another rant brewing.
6781313	6782394	Do I want to go there?
6782434	6782934	Do it, Rob.
6782954	6783134	Do it.
6783154	6783495	Do it.
6783535	6783875	Drama.
6783895	6784355	Let's go there.
6784996	6786797	This website is such shit.
6787198	6789119	Why does everybody keep reading it?
6789480	6792322	Here I am talking about it, and it's going to be more people checking it.
6792982	6821583	I fucking can't why do we keep bringing this fucking shitty website up all of the time and why does their attention grabbing antics work all of the time I can't anymore I do not want any stories from this website ever again on our show we are better than this done banned I'm serious do not link this website ever again for a new story there are better places on the internet to get your gaming news
6822043	6824465	They just grab all the stories from other people anyway.
6824525	6827947	Just go to the site, click the link that they got, and then use that one.
6828807	6830188	I am taking a stand here.
6830348	6832890	I am not giving these fuckers hits anymore.
6833370	6834471	It is ridiculous.
6837393	6837613	Rob.
6837893	6838193	Yes.
6838654	6838934	Coffee.
6840395	6841676	I think I might need another cup.
6843437	6845198	How about some more news stories, DarkSakura?
6846391	6846892	Sega!
6847593	6848715	Yay, I love you, Sega.
6849696	6852640	Sega has a line of PCs.
6852700	6854583	It's called the Sega Note PC Laptop.
6855104	6856366	And they have different styles.
6856406	6859831	There's the generic Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn, and the Dreamcast.
6861269	6864450	And they're anywhere between $1,000 to $2,100.
6864730	6872271	And they'll come with the 64-bit version of Windows 8, a 1920x1080 display, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and a Pentium 2020M processor.
6884034	6887757	So, yeah, and it will be obsolete in five seconds.
6888077	6888618	Moving on.
6888658	6889519	How about some Square?
6890379	6897685	Square actually registered Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain domains.
6898506	6911757	So maybe we're going to see some re-releases or reboots, but there's Wolfensteinspiel.com and WarFornosGoth.com So, who knows?
6912139	6913720	I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game.
6913840	6916382	I hope it's done in Wolfenstein 3D fashion.
6917923	6919404	The 3D ones never were very good.
6921325	6922586	I love the little sound they make.
6924427	6926089	Like, with the digitized voices.
6928630	6928870	What?
6928890	6930411	I'm just remembering.
6932513	6936956	You know that that game, actually, when they did the re-releases with that one, it's actually, like, banned in Switzerland.
6938323	6943488	Tina Turner cannot play Wolfenstein now in her new home country.
6944929	6945950	I love that woman.
6945990	6947011	I'm sure she's crushed.
6948332	6957760	And then, last but not least, you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been trying to ignore because Axl Rose pretty much has been?
6958640	6964425	Well, yeah, it got thrown out of fraud court, so not a big deal anymore.
6965066	6966007	Axl sucks.
6966567	6967047	It's all good.
6967107	6968389	He's attached to what?
6968429	6970590	That new BandFuse game that's coming out.
6970630	6974874	You know, BandFuse, the one that's going to try to do the same thing that what PowerGig tried to do.
6976255	6978497	You remember PowerGig, right?
6978617	6980758	I do remember PowerGig.
6980778	6981559	Yes, yes.
6981699	6984842	So BandFuse, the new Mastiff music game is going to be coming out.
6984962	6987204	It's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing.
6987464	6992388	But I think the difference with this one was it's real guitar and you can sing.
6994082	6995443	That's really it.
6996144	6996605	You know what?
6996645	6997886	You could do that with Beatles Rock Band.
7000128	7001750	Well, that's not a real guitar, though.
7002010	7003291	No, but no one cares.
7003351	7006274	But it's also probably going to sell immensely more than band fees.
7010678	7011099	Was that it?
7011559	7011859	That was...
7013126	7014727	I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit.
7015568	7017269	I was chatting with chatter.
7017689	7018890	I was participating.
7020931	7022012	Think of another one.
7022192	7025914	My extended hate boner was spewing into the chat room.
7026314	7027155	Your hate boner.
7028556	7031718	Tonight's show has been brought to you by the words hate and boner.
7032418	7037001	When you hear the words hate boner used in tandem, be sure to make a special noise.
7040721	7046452	Let's go to a segment that never makes us make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners have to say in the Google Question of the Week.
7052782	7057563	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus community.
7057663	7062484	You can participate with a question that we ask of our fan communities each week on the program.
7063264	7065604	Starting off with this week's question.
7066305	7070905	It was announced today that the new game Destiny will require a persistent internet connection.
7071325	7079487	On previous episodes, OLR and Bobby have talked about other games that require an always online internet connection, such as Diablo 3 and the new SimCity.
7079907	7080267	It's the MMO!
7100786	7103669	New SimCity, we're not so forgiving though.
7103729	7112035	But Destiny kind of falls in that weird kind of middle part where it's like, well, clearly online is a big component of it, but you're going to have to always be connected.
7112155	7116419	So I was curious if our listeners kind of gave it a pass or no.
7117200	7119842	We only had one response on Google+, so I'll read that.
7120222	7123244	From Redertainment, the one guy still using Google+.
7125206	7130450	We need a high-profile game with a wide and vocal audience to have an always-on internet connection mandate.
7130870	7137716	That way, when some part of it fails, leaving people unable to play the game they paid money for, the general public will rage out about it.
7138036	7145982	When the public rages out about it, assuming these companies actually give a shit about what the public wants, these companies will finally see... Ooh, now it's going into FU music.
7146022	7146603	How appropriate.
7147484	7152368	These companies will finally see what a mistake the always-on internet connection mandate is.
7152989	7156453	Redertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to introduce you to a game called Diablo 3.
7156513	7159616	This actually happened.
7160076	7162659	You couldn't log in to Diablo 3 for like a week.
7163139	7166363	Or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off after like an hour and...
7166983	7172407	Speaking of hate boner, the internet really had a big one for Diablo 3 because of the always online.
7172427	7176550	Because you might remember Diablo 2, you could play LAN and you could play offline.
7176570	7182134	There's actually a game that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny that's going to be similar to this.
7182714	7183115	SimCity.
7183835	7184876	Well, yeah, SimCity.
7184916	7186557	I'm talking about more along the lines of Destiny.
7186597	7192262	Like if an online first-person shooter game that's kind of like an MMO type thing.
7192622	7195484	Defiance from Trion Games.
7195945	7199828	That's going to be coming out in April and it's online only.
7199868	7201229	Isn't Trion an MMO company?
7201489	7203291	They are an MMO company.
7203371	7206493	However, this is a game that it's buy-to-play type thing.
7207594	7208615	And it's on consoles.
7208635	7210557	It's on PC and PS3, Xbox 360.
7210597	7210637	So...
7212818	7219561	This is something similar to that, obviously not as grand as Destiny.
7219581	7223063	But I see this actually has an online port.
7223143	7225504	Once again, it was very vague on everything.
7225524	7226865	Why is it that we need this port?
7231707	7232708	Online world and stuff.
7232768	7234889	Are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth?
7234909	7236691	Are we going to have battles and stuff like that?
7236731	7238772	Is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into?
7238852	7246678	Or is it just like, oh, well, I need to see my friend just cleared this spot so now the enemies are easier here or something.
7246718	7247038	I don't know.
7247258	7248479	I don't really know what they're doing.
7248559	7256965	But it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there versus SimCity where you just interact with your friend's towns or cities that they make.
7259319	7264625	Diablo 3, despite everybody raging on it and everything, still sold, what, 11 million?
7267087	7271111	I don't think that's going to tell them, oh, I got the message, no more Always Online.
7271131	7271792	Yeah, right?
7271892	7276036	Well, and if that were the case, we wouldn't be seeing it now like a fucking trend, right?
7276076	7281522	Like Destiny, SimCity, the game Loki just talked about and all these other things.
7282123	7282363	Yeah.
7283669	7283969	All right.
7284449	7289331	I just got a text message from the person that linked me that story originally that I blew up at.
7290172	7291032	I'll just say it's Jason.
7291052	7292093	He doesn't mind me saying that, I'm sure.
7292493	7296695	He says, in their defense, it was an opinion piece, not news.
7296835	7299236	But LOL, I was the straw that broke the camel's back.
7299256	7300916	I was just like, congratulations.
7301276	7302117	You are the catalyst.
7303467	7304327	Let me just put it this way.
7304368	7305868	This is a website.
7305888	7306869	Rob chose the red ending.
7307009	7308270	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7308310	7309630	We're not going back down this road.
7309730	7309890	No.
7309970	7310591	Close the door.
7310991	7311391	Lock it.
7311631	7311911	Done.
7312652	7312952	All right.
7313312	7314053	Moving on.
7314413	7314613	All right.
7314633	7315693	What do you want to do?
7315793	7316174	One sentence.
7316194	7322317	I just want to say Gawker figured out animated GIFs a couple months ago, and they've been running with it ever since.
7325330	7328212	You know the GIF format has been on the internet since like the early 90s, right?
7328232	7330994	I understand that, but now they literally have posts.
7331234	7332155	They're like, hey, look at this.
7332515	7336458	These are some animated GIFs I made based off of, you know, this trailer just came out.
7336858	7339820	You know, I think it's funny that GIF is still associated with CompuSurf.
7339880	7345684	So they got a Tumblr account or started reading Oh No They Didn't because those are the things I associate with the animated GIF.
7345965	7352949	I get my best animated GIFs ever from Oh No They Didn't, which is a LiveJournal community and pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal.
7353210	7354891	That and Russian Meteorite sightings.
7356612	7356832	Anyhow.
7384281	7397811	Fugl, hello, always online connections, and some of our answers from Facebook, which really had a lot of answers on it, so I can't read them all, so please visit our Facebook community and read them all in their entirety, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
7397871	7401913	Fabrice A. says, very annoying, and they are punishing the wrong people.
7402254	7406777	Some people have a crappy internet connection, or even no internet connection at all, so they can hardly play.
7407177	7411140	People who bought the game legally and suffer one of the previous problems can't play, and
7411440	7416783	People who play illegally don't have any of those problems because the DRM is absent.
7416883	7428449	FlamingToilet says, I would think that the fiasco with PSN going down for two months a couple years ago would have taught game makers that requiring an always-on internet connection is a very bad idea.
7428869	7431590	But they're always going to think it's never going to happen to us.
7431870	7436773	How many games were unplayable or almost unplayable during that time because there was no network to connect to?
7437318	7449791	thank you Flaming Toilet for reminding us never forget PlayStation Network fucking went down like it ate shit literal shit for two months horrible
7451111	7455395	Cell Agent Why Not says, we're sorry, your game is not available at this time.
7455455	7456716	Please hang up and try again.
7456937	7457257	Lulz.
7458358	7460900	You remember that crap that actually happened with me in Mass Effect 3?
7461941	7463563	When they were having the origin issues?
7463663	7464063	Yes.
7464483	7470229	And I couldn't connect, but I also couldn't play my single player game because it wouldn't verify my DLC.
7470249	7470489	Right.
7473409	7475191	Christopher K. replies and says...
7491650	7491990	DarkSakura.com
7507707	7513171	A good point that this indirectly brings up is that we've heard about Destiny's 10-year plan and so forth.
7513612	7514953	What happens after 10 years?
7515753	7519876	What happens when they want to pull the servers and so forth?
7520256	7523219	Where's that $60 investment in the game I made?
7523559	7523879	And I heard...
7525140	7535064	Damn, I wish I could remember where I heard about this, but I remember hearing about one of the reasons why $60 games and people are willing to pay that $60 price is the equity that you're getting in those games.
7535124	7538225	The fact that you can turn around and sell those games for a value later.
7538625	7545148	And when you talk about robbing people of the ability to sell used games...
7546148	7550510	There's now no equity and there's nothing worth investing $60 in.
7550930	7560033	But if you were going to turn off used games and then have it be $30, maybe that wouldn't feel like such a blow because the games overall are cheaper.
7560053	7563475	And this could actually be a great thing for everybody if the games are really cheap.
7564755	7567998	I still think $30 or $40 might be too much.
7568558	7575263	My point is, though, I can still plug in an Atari 2600 and appreciate the games I grew up on.
7575983	7584109	Let's say, for whatever reason, Destiny is a game that Flacco gets his kids to start playing, which I doubt, but just humor me for a minute here.
7584530	7590154	What if they want to revisit that game in their 30s and they can't because the 10 years is up, the servers are down, the plug's been pulled?
7591014	7591395	What now?
7591795	7592375	That's really sad.
7592796	7593156	It's sad.
7593176	7593336	It's sad.
7595051	7624567	well and a lot of there are games that are like that a lot of these games that were online only or something like that I mean they're just completely useless now like I don't know I can't think of anything that you would have but yeah I mean they pull servers all the time so it's very possible I mean I'm sure there's some MMOs especially some of these Sony MMOs that went offline I'm not I know there's a few that we mentioned before like even like PlayStation 2 games and stuff like that but
7626568	7629293	and even big MMOs go down.
7629854	7633060	Say if you bought a boxed copy of The Matrix Online or something like that.
7633200	7634883	You can never play Tabula Rasa.
7635492	7635672	Yeah?
7637273	7638174	You can never play it.
7639475	7640415	Star Wars Galaxies.
7641096	7641897	Yeah, that's right.
7642097	7648281	You will never experience the pre-New Galaxy experience, or the post, for that matter, ever again in your life.
7648661	7650382	I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon.
7651383	7651683	Right?
7651824	7652984	Because it's gonna get killed, right?
7654065	7655846	The WoW killer is coming out, Flaco.
7656447	7657187	The WoW killer.
7657548	7659969	Elder Scrolls Online, it's the WoW killer, Flaco.
7660650	7661650	Now Destiny's the WoW killer.
7661670	7663692	I keep seeing that in the chat all night.
7663712	7664913	They're both killing WoW.
7666829	7670798	Miss Scarlet killed Wow in the conservatory with a lead pipe.
7671740	7672161	Hate boner.
7674269	7687274	Back to Fugl Burr replied and said In the case of Destiny, it appears to be justified by what they're trying to do with the gameplay which at least makes me a little more understanding about it However, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?
7687354	7703381	Get out of our head I feel like always on DRM is a decision made by focusing too much on the short term If this trend continues, future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history when servers inevitably retire or entire publishers go bankrupt I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant but it fits right in, doesn't it?
7704481	7710642	RedTheHaze says, no problem with me if it's required by multiplayer, but if single player requires it, I might not get it.
7711022	7714883	Not everyone has internet, and the US is far from number one when it comes to internet.
7716103	7720184	Gary B replies and says, makes the decision about buying a game a no-brainer.
7720584	7722404	No offline mode, no purchase.
7722784	7728265	Where I live, I have two options for internet dial-up, which is slow and terrible, or satellite, which is expensive and terrible.
7728685	7732886	So whenever I hear that a game is always online, I just stop caring.
7734508	7738691	I wanted to see if I could Facebook stalk this guy and figure out where he lived, but he has his thing locked down.
7739291	7741552	Is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?
7742993	7749678	Let's be fair, even some of these always online games where it's a persistent world and stuff, here's the other thing that turns me off about that stuff.
7750618	7753520	I don't have a lot of time to play games sometimes.
7753680	7757823	Or I will go play an online game for a while and then not come back to it for a long time.
7758203	7762766	Like Final Fantasy XI, which I played all of twice when I bought it the last time.
7763526	7774093	Um, but the same thing is like, I don't know if this is going to be something like I got to keep logging in or else, you know, I'll get behind in some sort of quest or whatever the fuck is going on.
7774253	7782258	You know, it might also be something that kind of turns me off to it because like, you know, I don't have the time to dedicate to like an MMO or something like that.
7783528	7786890	Last comment I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our Facebook to read them all.
7786930	7788431	Facebook.com slash Orange Sounds Radio.
7788792	7795556	JLinks says, Being a connoisseur of mainly MMOs and FPSs, I'm used to games with required internet connections to play.
7796036	7798838	This falls more into a to-each-their-own niche to me.
7799178	7803741	While I could play FPSs offline in single player, I didn't make that the main reason I bought the game.
7803921	7807183	If the game's good and I have the methods available to play it, I'll buy it.
7807443	7808044	Simple as that.
7809298	7812359	That's our comments from Facebook and Google+.
7812399	7814079	Thank you guys who all responded.
7814419	7817740	Sorry I didn't read everybody's, but it's only a three-hour show.
7819940	7823781	Let's get to a few more news stories and pretty soon Skype calls.
7824281	7824541	Loki.
7824861	7832522	I swear to God that Sony is trolling us because there is no way that, like, I just can't believe that they would actually do this.
7832602	7836083	But apparently there is a patent that they have
7837103	7839144	And I know this is going to come as a shock to you guys.
7839384	7842385	They actually have a tablet that they have patented.
7843046	7847007	And I need to check this out right now to see what it's called.
7847087	7850989	But they're calling it the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.
7851029	7853410	There is no way that that is called the iPad.
7853430	7858652	That's a European patent thing that they're showing me here.
7858792	7859893	It doesn't really help me very much.
7859913	7861633	17 pages.
7863374	7864374	Let's see, 17 pages.
7864454	7867755	I think it looks like it's made out of, like, particle board or something like that.
7867775	7868435	This is weird.
7868815	7871215	But basically, it's a tablet device.
7871275	7871735	Looks thin.
7871795	7877636	It's got, looks like a directional pad, you know, face buttons, possibly a speaker, and one analog stick.
7877977	7879337	Shame on you, Sony.
7879537	7882557	Have you not learned from the PSP one analog stick?
7882657	7884458	That's more than the iPad's got.
7884558	7886018	Well, still, though, I mean.
7886038	7889379	I like how the big square sharp corner design reminds me of the NES.
7889699	7891239	Will I be able to install MAME on this?
7893120	7894521	I don't know.
7894862	7902849	So they don't really say... I want to make sure that it's actually called the iPad or not.
7902930	7905532	I had heard that name too, for what it's worth.
7906533	7908115	I think that someone's making that up.
7908895	7910937	I don't honestly think that they would do that.
7911818	7915081	Oh my god, no, they actually have it called the iPad.
7915942	7919745	It makes sense, the PlayStation 9, but again, take it with a jar of salt.
7919865	7920585	It was the iToy.
7920625	7921186	A gallon of salt.
7921246	7923968	No, no, it's in their patent information.
7924048	7927130	They refer to it as the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.
7928330	7930372	That's a patent, that's a lawsuit right there.
7930392	7931853	Holy fuckballs, really?
7932393	7932533	I-Toy
7947674	7948175	That's true.
7949697	7953202	I understand why they're using the iPad and the PlayStation 9 and all that stuff.
7953242	7954464	It makes sense to me.
7954544	7957348	However, Apple's going to go, no, fuck you.
7957648	7958790	You can't call it the iPad.
7959370	7963116	Apple, this really is a whole come at me, bro, move at Apple.
7963576	7966177	But again, huge salts.
7966197	7968718	You know, I don't know.
7969218	7973640	It seems unnecessary to have both this and the little thingy built into the controller.
7973880	7975181	I don't understand.
7975201	7976301	Well, here's some of the stuff.
7976461	7979862	Let me just read some of the cool things that they're saying that this thing has.
7980022	7984644	They're saying that it's going to have stereoscopic cameras on it.
7984964	7988546	So you're going to be able to, I guess, record 3D or something like that.
7988906	7990106	Kind of like the 3DS.
7990126	7991327	Yeah.
7993171	7999335	They're saying that there's some sort of weird prism thing going on with their touchpad and stuff.
8001116	8003158	It's going to have six axis built into it.
8003298	8006580	At least that's what they're... I mean, everything has six axis built into it.
8007741	8012584	So I guess we'll have to hear more about it if this is going to be part of the PlayStation 4.
8012624	8014685	Is this story coming from my favorite website?
8014705	8016446	Because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit.
8016466	8016807	No, it's a
8017327	8017848	The Maybe Patent
8035100	8036301	We don't know if it's real, right?
8036801	8038682	Is it coming from the official patent website?
8038802	8041083	Or is it... Do they have a link there or something?
8041103	8049088	Well, they've got it from... It's actually linked from... Or it's embedded from the European patent applications.
8050149	8052250	Eh, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it.
8052850	8056152	It's true, but... It also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games.
8056493	8059795	I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily a tie-in to the PlayStation 4.
8060095	8066380	Let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit, so why would they not maybe want to come up with a hybrid PlayStation tablet?
8066440	8075186	Well, they're saying, like, here's one of the things, is therefore, in addition to the convenient joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis controller provides the PS3 with data and all that stuff.
8075266	8080009	Now they're talking about PS3 a little bit.
8080670	8081050	I don't know.
8081150	8082091	We'll see.
8082191	8082491	It's just...
8084013	8087816	It seems a little weird, but they could do it, I guess.
8087997	8096324	I mean, they tried to put out some PlayStation-branded tablets that all looked really weird, but who knows?
8097185	8097505	We'll see.
8098506	8100087	Maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday.
8100107	8101669	It's right around the corner.
8104778	8108521	Yeah, I think they're just covering their bases, like all these patent applications.
8108541	8109462	iPad, I mean, really?
8109482	8110763	They're not really going to release it.
8110783	8113906	Just call it like the PlayStation tablet or something like that, you know?
8114387	8117630	Something, Sony PlayStation tablet, not iPad.
8117650	8120352	Calm down, it's the name and a patent, it's not the final name.
8120372	8121953	Just call it a thingy and be done with it.
8121993	8122514	That's right.
8124122	8131785	Anyhow, one other rumor going around about new consoles that just won't die is the fact that used games are not going to be playable on it.
8131825	8136686	And you can bet that Electronic Arts EA is just cheering about this.
8136786	8139648	After all, they're the ones that started the online pass shit, aren't they?
8140588	8150011	Well, anyhow, the chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen, had a talk with Gamasutra, and Gamasutra asked him about the whole used games and these rumors.
8150771	8151732	In response, quote,
8152592	8153152	I hate this word.
8153352	8153752	Liquidity.
8179722	8180342	Thanks for watching!
8199369	8206393	Could this be a sign of things to come if EA is openly, or at least one of their executives is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad thing?
8206974	8211597	Or are they just setting this up for when the banhammer comes down on this pretty soon with the used games?
8212217	8214078	Any thoughts on EA's comments, Loki?
8214098	8216860	DarkSakura, do you have anything?
8218706	8223408	I think they're already making their money on used games with the whole online passes.
8223468	8226409	I mean, I think they were touting before that they made a ton of money on online passes.
8226449	8230571	So to them, that's just money in their pockets, I guess.
8231732	8233532	I was actually going to say something along similar lines.
8233573	8236794	I mean, they've found a way to keep making a profit on it.
8237434	8239075	And that is a really, you know...
8240686	8247570	With a lot of cases in the used market, the people who are getting rid of their used games are trying to get the new mechs better.
8247870	8251852	We've even traded in some of our games, some of our crappy ones, to get new games.
8253873	8261858	Especially, it's even better for EA, as an example, if someone trades in one of their competitor's games to get one of theirs.
8263619	8266901	That whole liquid market thing is pretty...
8267762	8268542	That's pretty accurate.
8268702	8280487	And also considering that EA is also one of these companies that puts out yearly releases of their sports games, and they probably know that people aren't going to want to hold on to their copy of Madden 13 or something like that.
8280948	8284489	Madden 25, the dumbest new... What are they thinking there?
8284749	8290932	Okay, we're going to go 13 to 25, and then next year it's going to be 15, and then in a few years we're going to have 25 again.
8290952	8292873	If it's the 25th year, I get it.
8293033	8293533	It's not...
8294153	8297035	Call it like Madden 25th anniversary, not Madden 25.
8297095	8297455	It's stupid.
8297475	8299016	Anyways, that's not the point.
8299516	8309722	The point is that they release games each year and that they know that people are going to need to trade these in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them because they're essentially useless after...
8310382	8310422	E.A.
8310482	8312063	is kind of full of dicks right now
8327333	8328594	Here was the rest of the quote.
8355149	8356390	Um, what?
8357271	8359353	I do believe the consumer likes it.
8359793	8364198	Um, didn't I just read some foogle answers that didn't seem to go that direction?
8364218	8366239	They like the always-on connectivity?
8366299	8371664	And they've done some polls on certain websites that basically have said the same thing.
8371704	8373146	In fact, actually, GameStop did a poll.
8373206	8378390	Was it over 60% of people that use GameStop or whatever don't like...
8379071	8379971	Not having to use games.
8380071	8385113	This worries me when that sentence comes out of a game maker's mouth, is how out of touch are you?
8386394	8392055	See, people in the boardroom think they know what we want, but clearly they don't.
8392095	8405780	But by telling us in an interview, this is what gamers want, then the more gullible will run with it and the CNNs will say, oh, well, these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers want, according to Electronics Art.
8407121	8408421	Why don't you try talking to a gamer?
8409744	8410804	Well, and see, that's the thing.
8411304	8416725	They have a habit of trying to manipulate the data that they find to suit their own purposes.
8416826	8418686	Anything can be changed.
8419606	8423227	And they have to get an unbiased source if they're going to have accurate information.
8423267	8428628	But all they want is for people to tell them the same things that's going to support the outcome that they look for.
8429908	8433809	The legend of Zaku in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com gives a Homer Simpson quote.
8434269	8435149	Facts are meaningless.
8435229	8437610	You can create facts for something that is remotely true.
8440635	8442236	Interesting note to end that on.
8442336	8443297	Let's move on, DarkSakura.
8444738	8447860	Well, how about something else EA's managed to fuck up?
8448260	8450101	I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?
8450681	8454524	Okay, EA come close to really royally fucking up the Mass Effect series.
8456167	8458868	And yes, we warned you, there is Mass Effect news.
8459548	8467570	BioWare is basically saying don't call it Mass Effect 4 because it's implying that it is another addition to the trilogy.
8469050	8474932	They're saying that basically the trilogy is over, this is another game in the universe.
8475632	8479933	And the comparison here is, and I'll read the quote from Priestley.
8479953	8481334	It says...
8482674	8483335	Mass Effect 4 Modern Warfare
8510877	8511938	I have no idea.
8513099	8525548	But they are talking about it's being in development with Bioware Montreal and that's the same office that of course gave us this superb multiplayer.
8526486	8529808	And Mass Effect 2, which is the crown.
8550760	8563096	The thing that would make me happy about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them production timeline and actually put out a good quality product with great writing the way that Mass Effect 2 was.
8565171	8567752	That would just completely tickle me to no end.
8567872	8569192	Of course I'm going to play it.
8569372	8570272	Sadly, that won't happen.
8570492	8571133	I know, right?
8571553	8572733	That's so sad.
8573133	8574674	The problem is that, yeah, I'm an addict.
8574714	8575374	I'll still play it.
8575454	8576334	I love the universe.
8577674	8582656	Even with the pieces of shit that are involved in Mass Effect 3...
8583656	8585117	I still play the game.
8585157	8588659	I've probably played it more than two just because I like how it plays better.
8588719	8595743	If it keeps using the newer incarnations of the Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.
8596404	8599606	As long as it's fun to play and I get more lore, I'm happy.
8600326	8601927	The multiplayer is so good, too.
8602067	8602467	It is.
8602527	8605409	We should play again, but you don't play on PC anymore, and that makes me sad.
8605709	8607891	I kind of do mix and match now.
8608611	8610072	Well, then come play online with me.
8611733	8611933	Meh.
8615834	8621415	So anyways, there's yet another rumor going along with the PlayStation 4, Orbis, whatever you're going to call it.
8622116	8635119	So that is coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that because they purchased Gaikai, they're going to be using that streaming service to stream PlayStation 3 games to the new PlayStation.
8635799	8641260	Basically saying that there's not going to be really any backwards compatibility with the old system, which makes sense.
8641280	8643401	I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility and
8644461	8648903	A lot of it is being offered as downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.
8650804	8657028	Basically saying that this is also going to coincide with physical releases for PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.
8658708	8669614	I can see this as an evolution of that whole PlayStation Plus game library thing, because right now you have to download and install everything, which takes fucking forever.
8670074	8673156	Whereas this, you could be just like, okay, I want to play Saints Row 2.
8673556	8677301	Go and then just load it up and stream it.
8677641	8678963	The hour-long game trials too.
8679504	8684510	Like you have to actually download the entire game to play for an hour and then just delete it.
8687093	8688535	So once again, we'll see you.
8690854	8694615	I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.
8694655	8697755	They spent so much money on that, obviously it's going to be integrated somehow.
8698095	8701296	I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week too.
8701376	8703237	That seems something obvious that they could talk about.
8703257	8706277	They could almost do that with the PlayStation 3.
8706797	8710478	I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that is PlayStation 4.
8710538	8715659	I think that they could do this, hey, you guys, you know how you have that online game library right now?
8715719	8716339	Well, guess what?
8716919	8719940	We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff instantly.
8720200	8727384	It makes sense because part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2 inside of it as well so it could run all the games.
8727885	8732948	And then when they started cutting that out and getting the price down, that disappeared.
8733288	8740892	So maybe they're trying to not wow us with a $599 US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4, probably more like $499.
8742253	8771123	but uh you know it's not gonna be don't expect it to be that that low but uh this is one way they'll they'll be able to save some money on the console and maybe not have it be so expensive is that they're gonna use the streaming technology to emulate some of the older games I hope though that it's just an option that you can also like okay you can stream it or you can download it because once again if you know their service goes to shit then that's gonna suck not being able to play your game because you can't stream it anymore you know
8771845	8773827	I would assume that you'd be able to download it as well.
8774227	8775668	I hope that you could do that.
8775708	8782553	ShadowNextGen with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com PlayStation Network is in no way good enough to do streaming gameplay like that.
8782913	8787677	Even with Gaikai, is PlayStation Network ready for that kind of bandwidth?
8789078	8790138	It's a fair question.
8790158	8790979	Let's put it this way, though.
8790999	8796543	We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with some of the demos with FIFA and stuff like that through a web browser and stuff.
8796643	8797824	I think they could probably handle it.
8801224	8804088	Is it going to look good, though, coming through your bandwidth?
8804608	8806551	You know, like, through your internet connections?
8806571	8808493	Is it going to look all fucking pixelated and shit?
8809754	8810115	I don't know.
8811096	8814180	That's... We'll just have to see, I guess.
8816337	8819859	Alright, kind of a follow-up story of sorts.
8820439	8826402	You remember when we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan and how it's going to this free-to-play model on the Wii U?
8826702	8829604	That hasn't arrived in America yet, but guess what?
8830204	8832185	It's going to happen in Europe as well.
8832305	8835107	Europe will be the next region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.
8835567	8841090	The base download will have Monster Battle, Free For All, and Team Versus, and you can play them up to three times.
8842831	8850195	The first add-on is My Kong, which will cost €1.99 in Euros through February 28th.
8851836	8852357	Interesting.
8853197	8854478	I want to fight the bees.
8854718	8858060	I hear the game's not very good, but I mean, it's a fun arcade game.
8860402	8864244	As much as I love the game, I really don't see it translating well.
8864384	8865625	Everyone has the things.
8865985	8868046	I think the free-to-play model is certainly interesting.
8871167	8872928	Anybody interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?
8873008	8876049	Do you think they will roll this out to the States next?
8876449	8876729	Anybody?
8876750	8878630	They'd have to, I think.
8878970	8880751	I think that they'll eventually roll it out to the States.
8881451	8885093	I'd be interested to see the... I guess I'm a little bit...
8886771	8891394	Namco has tried doing this whole free-to-play type approach for some of their games.
8891975	8895057	It didn't work out so well with Ridge Racer on the Vita.
8896058	8897058	Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.
8897098	8900741	That was pay $30, $40 and get nothing.
8901081	8904864	Get a demo and then buy extra crap for it.
8904924	8907846	So that kind of sucked, but we'll see.
8909307	8911308	$2 is not that bad for an add-on.
8915253	8916274	Let's go to the mailbag.
8916795	8922422	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here on the show.
8931826	8935047	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com where you can send us emails every week.
8935088	8937869	We have one email this week and I'll go ahead and read it.
8937949	8939610	It just came in like an hour ago.
8940030	8940690	I'll go ahead and read it.
8940950	8942631	No biggie.
8942731	8945472	It's a gem of an email so I want to read this through.
8945732	8947673	Alright, it's from RawSteelUT.
8948514	8949054	Alright, here we go.
8949707	8950367	Hey, OLR!
8951147	8960290	First off, it seems like you guys have joined the rest of the media in spending time on every next-gen rumor that comes down the pike, no matter how hilarious or ill-thought.
8960870	8969672	It's been proven that the mainstream games media can be easily fooled into believing anything, as has been shown by various angry formites and Tumblr people all over the years.
8970112	8975534	And while I know that the blogs will go after anything that gets clicks, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?
8978395	8980656	In what way does panic-mongering help the show?
8981057	8983438	It's clearly not bringing in the page hits.
8984879	8985939	Clearly it's not.
8986360	8986880	How rude.
8987821	8988361	But you're here.
8988561	8989201	That's what counts.
8990202	8992383	Have you guys ever thought of vetting these rumors?
8992583	8997046	Trying to sift the possibly legitimate things from the blatant and senseless bullshit?
8997711	9004076	Well, I am glad that you asked that question because that is a great... We should go vet those rumors.
9004136	9008299	In fact, let me place a call to Sony right now and ask that question.
9008579	9009160	I know, right?
9009300	9014224	Let me just... Let me get them on the line and see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4 rumors because you know...
9014884	9026814	As you mentioned before, it isn't going any distance in getting us hits at all that, you know, sites like, I don't know, the ESA when measuring E3 doesn't even want to take a second look at independent podcasts and all that stuff.
9027154	9032459	Clearly, these guys are on my speed dial and I can vet this shit till the cows come home.
9034235	9036956	I was just talking... Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.
9036976	9038916	I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?
9039116	9039656	Oh, yeah.
9040057	9041057	Oh, yeah, we were chilling.
9041717	9042077	Absolutely.
9042097	9043898	We'll get some fro-yo afterward.
9043958	9046078	I got photos of my Dan and you, Suzuki.
9046578	9047418	Which is actually true, I do.
9047619	9051800	Let me put a little reminder out there about what this show is all about, alright?
9052060	9052980	In case you forgot.
9054877	9067246	This show started because we all played DDR at the arcades and after DDR we would go and we would go to the restaurant that was down the street and we would sit around over, you know, food that was bad for us like mozzarella sticks and so forth.
9067286	9067907	Fried cheese.
9068187	9069408	God, they're so fucking good, huh?
9069828	9072110	And we would talk smack about what's going on in games.
9072470	9075492	And you know what happens a lot of times when people are talking smack?
9075972	9079375	They're talking about the rumors and things that go around in the industry.
9080515	9085439	I can't think of a time when we've said this stuff on air and said, this is fact, people.
9085559	9086439	Believe this, people.
9087320	9091282	I think we like to bring these ideas up and say, this is a rumor.
9091583	9095065	Take it with a grain of salt, like I think we just said about that iPad thing.
9095405	9098206	or ask people what they think about it.
9098326	9099907	What's wrong with discussion?
9100047	9102829	What is wrong with discussing and talking about ideas?
9102909	9106390	Because some rumors do pan out to be true.
9107011	9115735	So why not talk about what goes through the heads of these people that don't really want to be so ready to talk about these things?
9116215	9116996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9134833	9139838	Such as we just talked a little bit about Destiny and the fact that it requires an always online connection.
9140159	9142021	That is fact, not rumor.
9142401	9143442	They said that today.
9143803	9146045	But that's something that's going to impact the game industry.
9146505	9151190	The whole fact about used games being banned on the new consoles, that's a rumor, yes.
9151751	9153613	But I think all of us sit here and go...
9154013	9164558	Do you think, can you sit there and you honestly think to yourself that in no boardroom ever has it been said by a senior executive we should lock out new games on the new console.
9165439	9165859	Use games.
9166799	9167299	Is that what I said?
9167500	9168560	He said lock out new games.
9170201	9175023	Lock out the new ones so then we have to do an even newer system and have to charge them.
9175804	9177664	The online pass idea came from somewhere.
9179926	9182707	Rumors are often founded in fact.
9183519	9186581	I just don't think this was a very well thought out email, honestly.
9188402	9200770	But the biggest thing too is that I actually like looking at the rumors and the speculation and keeping track of it so I can see what legitimately happens when something comes out to see who was right, who was on the right track.
9201271	9205853	Was our technology really in a place where we had this capability?
9206614	9212178	For me, it's actually a gauge of how ambitious consumer level technology is.
9213398	9214939	I think it's neat.
9216580	9218602	BlackWolfInChat says, I'm not a journalist.
9218762	9219542	I'm a commentator.
9219922	9222424	I don't actually have the resources to be a real journalist.
9223345	9225186	Well, what is a real journalist anyway?
9225246	9230289	Because some things that get away with being real journalism are a little bit laughable.
9230649	9232550	But anyway, I do like that comparison.
9233831	9235332	I'm not a games journalist either, really.
9235512	9237594	I actually think more than anything I'm a games analyst.
9239135	9240636	I will analyze the shit out of your game.
9240656	9242598	I say that with a straight face too.
9243038	9243959	I'm a games analyst.
9244259	9245660	A lot of you are games analysts too.
9245720	9246301	You really are.
9247522	9248482	Some people are just anal.
9248703	9255989	We've been sitting here talking about games for 11 years and there's some other guys that go out there and are in every story and being interviewed with the games analyst title.
9256289	9256869	But you know what?
9256929	9258691	They get about as much stuff right as we do.
9259130	9260311	and about as much wrong as we do.
9279689	9282311	It's way too early to say something like that.
9282911	9284152	A year from now, maybe.
9284272	9285652	But this is Nintendo we're talking about.
9285732	9286133	Come on.
9287353	9291375	It's one thing to bring up rumor without having anything to substantiate it.
9292516	9295918	It's completely different if you actually have items that are going to back it up.
9295958	9307084	Like, okay, for example, let's say that it's a year from now and Nintendo has continued to have dismal sales and we're starting to see extreme price reductions on the Wii U and
9307504	9316992	and we're starting to see the 3DS game sales drop, then at that point it might be safe to speculate that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.
9318053	9335588	But right now, like you said, no, it's completely different just to completely sensationalize something and try to get people to back you up by being even more sensational about it as opposed to stating, well, this is what's being said, this is what we've seen, make your own decision.
9336018	9339100	There's people out there that will just read anything and believe it immediately.
9339160	9346465	It's just like, you know, you'll see commenters on news stories where they're talking about a rumor like, that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.
9347126	9351229	It's like, if that's true, then I'm not buying an Xbox.
9351389	9355131	Or, you know, if that's true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.
9355272	9358334	It's like, oh, this is absolute fact because it's coming to me from...
9358894	9365497	You know, this gaming blog that I trust their information, so therefore it is, you know, I am not going to buy this console.
9365877	9369479	These are the people that are fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind eight times.
9369499	9375002	These are the ones that, you know, fucking start a petition or, you know, join a group that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game.
9375022	9377003	And then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.
9377063	9377243	I mean...
9378700	9379000	Whatever.
9379400	9387622	But, yeah, I think I know for a fact that, and this comes from just my line of work, that I don't deal in guarantees.
9388702	9390442	I know that.
9391122	9397963	I'm always leaving myself a way out, and there's no way that I'm saying anything is absolute fact unless I actually see it.
9398924	9403084	Now, RossDLUT is in chat right now and says, makes a note that I'm now hated.
9403685	9404725	I didn't say I hated you.
9404745	9405945	No one said we hated you.
9405965	9406005	No.
9406565	9410508	But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?
9410688	9412889	In what way does panic mongering help the show?
9413670	9416471	I just thought I would express why we spend time on nonsense rumors.
9416872	9419653	I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme of a viewpoint.
9419693	9421955	It's not like we're sitting here going, Ah!
9422315	9423656	Soldier Nintendo!
9424016	9425057	Oh my god!
9426017	9427018	I could hear once.
9431598	9434679	Plus, if the site gets more hits, I might lose VOG the game.
9436320	9437700	That's what it's really about, isn't it?
9437720	9438980	That's what I care about.
9441841	9448964	All right, let's get to the other half of the email, which is a question I think is a little more up our alley.
9449664	9455506	Secondly, Aliens Colonel Marines has been released after seven years development, and the consensus seems to be that it's a hot mess.
9456806	9458267	Now this is the type of email I like to get.
9458807	9465291	It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem Forever, the game had a protracted crap ton of development houses working on it.
9465751	9466992	My question here is this.
9467432	9471835	At what point are there too many hands in the pot and when should a project just be cancelled?
9472255	9477198	In my view, anything past three years and two development houses is asking for disaster.
9477992	9479573	It's all about contracts you sign.
9479893	9480594	Cooks in the soup.
9481374	9488638	And what you're going to be responsible for if you don't come through with the product you promised whoever paid you money to come through with.
9489699	9492321	Duke Nukem Forever was canceled at one point, was it not?
9492381	9496683	Like when the company went out of business and Gearbox essentially just bought what was left over from it.
9496943	9499265	Like Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.
9499525	9505248	But they kind of, you know, picked up the ashes and released what they did for better or for worse, right?
9505909	9506069	Mm-hmm.
9506932	9511976	So, hmm.
9512897	9518822	It's a question with a lot of gray area, because it's not like you can draw a line and say, you know, like you did three years and two development houses.
9518862	9527830	Well, that doesn't necessarily take everything into effect, because I think a game like Smash Bros., I think had more... Didn't the one on the Wii take more than three years to develop?
9527870	9528371	I think it did.
9528571	9528951	Didn't it take...
9530212	9547362	more like four you know and it came out okay the game was pretty good it's one of the better Wii titles you know it worked out yeah so you know I don't think you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long how long has Bioshock Infinite been right right delayed by years
9548899	9552841	or maybe, you know, how long has The Last Guardian been in the film?
9553101	9555422	Well, that's never going to come out.
9555462	9557822	How about Final Fantasy Versus XIII?
9558603	9560784	Yeah, there's a great example, huh?
9560804	9564385	Yeah, but the Agito XIII came out as zero.
9566457	9567678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9585791	9597551	done, cancelled, money pulled that's what happens, that's part of the ebb and flow of it, so, you know, if there's enough development and things to show every few months, the game keeps going but if it stops, the game is done
9601132	9601653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9622914	9628957	And the bugs that the internet are talking about are nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Saints Row.
9629017	9632339	I mean, that's child's play.
9633579	9635720	Those games have bugs down to a fine art.
9636521	9637961	Anyway, have a good show, guys.
9638302	9639142	Ross Steel, UT.
9639202	9640162	We're having a great show.
9641283	9641883	It's great.
9643284	9647446	Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com if you want to help us be a great show, too.
9648306	9649447	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9665356	9672485	The self-entitled wads of fuck that drive in the parking lot at Whole Foods.
9673846	9681216	I don't care how expensive your damn car is or how much gas it guzzles or how organic you fucking eat.
9681876	9683879	Learn to fucking drive!
9684261	9713489	what a great place to find assholes I know you find assholes of all varieties and not just inside the shopping place another one goes to god I forgot what it was oh yeah, goes to Origin and the Mass Effect 3 update that just happened because I want my console back bitches, however I once again got Flycam working and
9715868	9723672	I think being sick, because my son just drives home every single illness like a fisherman's net for illness.
9724432	9725312	So that kind of sucks.
9725332	9726653	Don't you think that's what children do?
9726673	9727473	That's their revenge?
9728574	9729374	Revenge for what?
9729554	9730014	Discipline.
9732426	9734327	I don't know.
9734827	9757317	So I guess F you to that and F you to having to move my desk upstairs because for some dumb reason management thought it was a great idea to fucking flip the building upside down and so they have everybody from the third floor moving to the second floor and everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit I gotta move because I store all sorts of weird shit at my desk like arcade parts.
9761079	9771888	I have an MP5 and a System 573 board for Dance Maniac's second mix, a coin box, and a Neo Geo arcade board at my desk.
9772288	9784438	Among a bunch of figurines, I have a Gundam collection, I have anime stuff up on my shelves, and I have a what I consider life-size papercraft model of a Koopa.
9785908	9789392	and I have a chicken that has an Elebit riding on top of it.
9789432	9789892	That's right.
9790152	9792214	I have a chicken with an Elebit riding on top.
9792635	9794156	Does anyone fucking remember Elebits?
9794857	9795258	Hello?
9795678	9796098	Konami?
9796899	9798000	Let's make another Elebits game.
9799702	9800283	Wako, go ahead.
9802218	9815527	Uh, gosh, I was talking about this with my wife, and I was like, you know what, F you to the podcast app on iPod, iPhone, which is pretty old, but I finally updated my iPod, even though I heard that it was terrible.
9816108	9823412	And I was really mad because I couldn't scan through the show to find, like, every time I plug it into my car, it would reset back at the start, and I hated that.
9823733	9828796	But before, I could always just, uh, you know, like, kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at.
9829176	9830597	But I couldn't do that, and I couldn't figure it out.
9831998	9833579	and two seconds later she finds out how to do it.
9833599	9838603	You swipe the little logo for the show up and then there's a deal in there and you shuttle it out.
9838643	9840865	I feel so stupid, but... The podcast app is terrible.
9840965	9843667	It's still terrible, so still F you the podcast app.
9843747	9845869	Honestly, you Stitcher to listen to the show.
9846229	9848391	Sorry, but it's... You gotta stream Stitcher, don't you?
9848471	9849351	Yeah, yeah.
9849411	9851233	I gotta download because I listen to the card.
9851413	9854295	Actually, I think Stitcher will now let you download.
9854315	9858458	I want to say that's something they added to because a lot of podcasters were complaining about that.
9858538	9859519	I think they added that.
9859719	9860440	I'll check that out.
9860460	9862563	Yeah, I listen in the car, so I can't stream.
9862644	9863565	I have to.
9863585	9864406	Nope.
9864667	9864907	Nope.
9865167	9865408	Nope.
9866970	9867270	All right.
9867771	9871817	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't have tomorrow off, unlike a lot of yous.
9872458	9872919	I don't either.
9874488	9875249	I'm unemployed.
9876771	9878973	I'm going to sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.
9878993	9880615	Bananas in pajamas.
9881296	9882077	So F you to that.
9882137	9883338	I don't get tomorrow off.
9884099	9885140	What's a president's day?
9885521	9886842	Also F you to Shane.
9888044	9890807	Fucking bought Pokemon games for Shane.
9891127	9891267	What?
9891327	9891987	It's like a hen...
9919998	9920779	Hentai something.
9920819	9921979	I don't remember what it was called now.
9922219	9924180	It looked funny.
9925101	9929563	Because he does this weird penis spin on some guy's face or something.
9929583	9934265	That's Hentai, not Sentai.
9934425	9935946	Back away from Loki a little bit here.
9937702	9941683	Oh no, I think she was talking about the new American version is really terrible or something.
9942703	9943823	Megaforce, Rangers.
9943863	9948044	And here we all are entertaining this fucking Power Rangers discussion.
9948244	9948764	Knock it off.
9949364	9952765	Hey, you hush, because I have like two Laserdiscs.
9953365	9958946	One of them is Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger, and the other one is like another, I think, Mega Ranger movie.
9959406	9960126	So, shut up.
9960447	9961987	It is hentai common.
9962267	9962527	It is.
9962987	9963808	Hentai Kamen.
9963868	9964610	Hentai Kamen.
9965070	9965290	Yes.
9965731	9970558	They have a brand new superhero movie.
9971319	9971679	All right.
9971759	9973962	Let's go to a few more topics for you guys.
9973983	9979931	Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange On Radio, Loki.
9980359	9985026	So there's some Kickstarter games that are actually getting publishers, which is kind of cool.
9985827	9989011	One of them is this game called Takedown.
9989331	9991374	It's like a tactical shooter game.
9992055	9996521	They're seeing kind of like a slow-paced Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or something like that.
9997562	10024957	um sort of like that sort of series I guess um but it's gonna be coming out by 5 of 5 games uh called uh was it Takedown Red Saber and I guess the guy that developed it was uh was it Christian Allen oh I guess that's why it's similar to Tom Grant he was uh one of the creative directors for the Ghost Recon series and also I guess um SWAT and Rainbow Six so that's kind of cool um so that's gonna be coming out uh it doesn't say when though but uh sometime in 2013 um
10026217	10052318	and then uh Wildman we remember that was the one that was being done by Gas Powered Games kind of like as the last ditch hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going out of business thing well actually they canceled their Kickstarter um so and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter is because it got purchased by Wargaming it was I think World of Tanks so no word if they're going to still be doing the Wildman game but uh at least now they have some funding
10057090	10057510	So that's good.
10060853	10062215	Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.
10062855	10063756	I got one here too.
10064257	10070102	It's about a 90s arcade racer because there's just not enough Daytona USA in your life and the like.
10071707	10072407	It looks awesome.
10091336	10097879	And they are going to do this new racing game for iOS, Android, and Wii U. I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing... They picked it up.
10097899	10098599	That's the publisher.
10098639	10098940	I'm sorry.
10098960	10099660	Yeah, they picked it up.
10099920	10100240	Thank you.
10100580	10101521	They are the publisher.
10102601	10113706	The producer is Tyrone Rodriguez, is the Nysalis producer who will be producing and helping the game come to the iOS, Android, and Wii U, which I think is interesting.
10113886	10114647	Here's one that...
10115667	10117669	Now we're not talking about 360 or PlayStation.
10117729	10121091	It's Wii U. PC, Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.
10122873	10123293	It looks cool.
10123473	10123754	Yeah.
10124194	10126035	I almost backed it, but I'm poor.
10126976	10127517	But I'm poor.
10128945	10130606	Alright, that's it.
10130866	10132727	We're going to get to the Skype line.
10132747	10137108	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10137649	10141370	We will talk about what's going on in games.
10141770	10142831	Whatever you want to talk about tonight.
10142851	10143811	We've had a lot of stuff tonight.
10143871	10145852	I'm sure it's going to elicit some sort of reaction.
10145912	10147413	So the Skype line is open now.
10147953	10150734	While we wait for some calls, Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?
10154279	10165185	I didn't really have anything I wanted to talk about other than I wanted to go into a little bit more detail with that whole iPad thing because they had some cool notes that I missed in there after I read through it.
10165785	10171989	Apparently those cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant for capturing objects that you place on top of it.
10172089	10178512	So basically it would capture both sides of a 3D object or they even may have more than just a couple cameras on there.
10179172	10184257	and it would import the full 3D object into your game, which is kind of cool.
10185498	10187940	Of course, they said 6-axis.
10189581	10192023	They're supposed to have some sort of LED strips on the side.
10192043	10197107	I guess that part that looked like the whole plywood thing.
10197788	10199369	Let me go to the phones because we're getting calls.
10199409	10200350	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10200370	10200730	Who's this?
10201010	10201831	Hey, can you guys hear me?
10202071	10202752	Hi, we can hear you.
10203556	10206157	Alright, I just wanted to say, hey, what's up guys?
10206997	10207977	Long time no talk to you.
10208177	10208857	Who is this?
10210378	10211098	Introduce yourself.
10212358	10212939	It's Gamer Girl.
10213059	10214199	Gamer Girl!
10214279	10215139	How you doing, Gamer Girl?
10217940	10222021	So, I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know what to talk about.
10222834	10225355	Oh, I think she's also lagged a little.
10225415	10226935	Oh, I think you're listening to us.
10227695	10228876	I hear a little bit of echo.
10228916	10230876	You might want to mute the radio in the background there.
10231336	10232817	Well, that's no problem.
10232837	10234677	What was going through your head when you hit the dial button?
10234757	10236378	Is it still echoing?
10237498	10237818	Uh-huh.
10237838	10240239	Hold on a second.
10242039	10242559	We'll hold.
10242639	10242940	We'll wait.
10242960	10243380	There's nothing.
10243700	10247261	We don't got nothing better to do.
10247281	10249541	We'll make up another rumor and talk about it.
10249581	10250161	How's that sound?
10250181	10250602	Oh, shoot.
10250902	10251862	Oh, what's up, gamer girl?
10254246	10255146	What's on your mind tonight?
10257447	10261628	Okay, I don't know if I'm still... We hear you, honey.
10262308	10262908	Keep talking.
10263309	10264469	Can I get a what what?
10265789	10266970	Um, shoot.
10267270	10268050	I don't think she can hear us.
10268770	10270891	Honey, try back later, because I don't think you can hear us.
10271371	10271911	Sorry to say.
10273471	10274672	Aw, that's always depressing.
10275212	10275592	Yeah.
10275812	10276932	Alright, let's go to the phones.
10276952	10277933	We'll try to get a phone.
10278693	10279533	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10279553	10279873	Who's this?
10280473	10282814	Okay, I don't know if I'm still...
10283911	10284652	We hear you, honey.
10285312	10286173	Keep talking.
10287154	10288254	We're hearing ourselves.
10288775	10290696	All aboard the mail train.
10290736	10292558	I knew this was going to come up.
10292578	10292978	Hi, you guys.
10292998	10295660	It's Porkchop.
10295700	10296220	How's it going?
10296240	10299123	Wait, you can hear me and I can hear you?
10299143	10299203	Yes.
10309642	10311063	Oh my god, it's a miracle.
10311784	10312645	I fixed the show.
10312705	10313386	See, I fixed it.
10313666	10314126	Hi, guys.
10315007	10316669	It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.
10316729	10317590	I'm sure you'll agree.
10318390	10323115	Yeah, all this, you know, the rumors about the PS4, this whole used games thing.
10324236	10324316	Um...
10325023	10326243	I don't know what to believe anymore.
10326283	10327664	I'm starting to lose faith.
10327684	10328644	I know, and here we are.
10328664	10338327	We're making all this shit up and just rumor-mongering, and we just make the whole thing worse in our desperate attempt to get all the thousands of clicks that we get every week here on the show.
10339407	10341228	I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.
10341348	10347369	The guys were talking about old games and chat rooms, especially games in development hell and stuff like that.
10348209	10352651	And it was kind of sad to hear the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and The Last Guardian.
10352691	10353731	I was looking forward to those.
10354620	10361322	Why can't these companies just wake the fuck up and realize these games will sell?
10361342	10362903	I know The Last Guardian will anyway.
10363283	10365324	It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.
10365344	10366784	So get on that.
10366885	10370326	Stop bitching about fucking iPads and all this bullshit.
10370866	10372787	Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?
10373767	10378989	Because sometimes big titles come out and they don't sell, and it makes developers nervous.
10379693	10382855	I guess there was like, you know, sometimes there is a lot of hype.
10382955	10385157	Hype is just the theme for this week.
10385217	10393903	Like even I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising and I looked at the footage and I think, OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games kind of real justice like Bayonetta.
10394183	10394683	They did that.
10395223	10401708	But this game, there's something I can't shake about it as much as I love Metal Gear Solid and Raiden himself.
10401748	10402528	He's a cool character.
10403429	10404930	I'm just getting a weird feeling off it.
10405050	10406311	I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.
10408624	10410365	What's going into your decision ultimately?
10411126	10413588	What's going to help you get un-weird, if anything?
10414388	10414869	I don't know.
10415409	10419732	It's the fact that spin-off titles aren't always great.
10421674	10424936	It's something that I'm a bit tentative about.
10425256	10436525	I'm watching it and I'm thinking, even DMC, the new Devil May Cry game, I'm very scared to buy that because I really, really loved the series before that and now it's just turned on its head.
10436545	10437946	The game where you're not Dante?
10439610	10440631	The Game Where You're Not Dante?
10441291	10443412	The Game Where You're Dante Mark 2, yeah.
10443933	10447455	And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.
10448495	10450176	It's just like another doctor, it's okay.
10450837	10453058	Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.
10453938	10454599	Of course, yeah.
10454739	10456340	That's just retconned in there.
10456360	10460062	There's no point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is there?
10461462	10467924	Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry is the other kind of thing about it, is that this version in particular, I don't know if that's Bayonetta's fault.
10467944	10468724	The Devil May Metro?
10469124	10469985	Kinda, yeah.
10470045	10471445	Devil May Metro, a little bit.
10471985	10473586	I mean, not a bad thing.
10473826	10477247	Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.
10477267	10478587	I've heard something like that.
10478687	10481928	Apparently, the spitting image of the guy who developed the game.
10481968	10482668	I'm like, what?
10482908	10483429	It could be worse.
10483489	10491091	He could have the face of, like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried or... Or one of the Jonas Brothers.
10491611	10496316	Oh, that would be... I'm going to make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.
10497056	10499438	No, it could be a Dante de Medna version.
10502341	10503722	That's like DLC.
10503863	10506465	That's like for guilty pleasures and stuff like that.
10506565	10512170	What is ultimately going to... The boardroom guys want to get in your head as a gamer.
10512230	10517295	What is ultimately going to make that decision for you if you are going to pick up Devil May Cry or not?
10518994	10546982	if you just leave it alone you know don't don't don't don't twist it to think that you know this is a reboot and as far as I'm concerned the game was fine before they went and did all this I don't know fucking lost city of demons turning the fucking buildings upside down it was fine when he was the demon hunter and he was hot and he had white hair initially but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo I don't know what to make of him at all okay I'm just
10547625	10548285	Don't ruin it.
10548325	10549385	That's all I can really say.
10549405	10551826	I'm going to play boardroom guy for a second here.
10552586	10554487	This is how you get the female audience.
10554947	10557408	You go the bayonet route.
10557888	10561369	You have his penis basically act like her hair in that game.
10561469	10563609	So it's just flopping around, attacking things.
10564729	10566170	That would be frightening.
10567710	10570591	It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do, but still.
10573291	10578574	I would love to actually have a main male character who's just in completely oversexed positions.
10579375	10580996	Go play Devil May Cry.
10581016	10584538	I know, I want the over-the-top, like, you know, a comic book cover.
10585458	10586539	Done by Rob Liefeld.
10587239	10589641	You're like, you want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.
10589661	10591542	I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.
10591562	10592562	That's what she's talking about.
10592662	10593683	That would be hilarious.
10594203	10595184	You want a Hawkeye game.
10595802	10598743	Jeremy Renner stars as the main character.
10598763	10599564	That would be perfect.
10599764	10604706	I would just play Jeremy Renner's butt the game with a Wii move.
10607207	10609067	You all are taking this show to a very strange place.
10611208	10614489	Anyway, Porkchop, I've got to wrap up so I can try to get another call.
10615150	10616190	Any other thoughts for us tonight?
10616830	10618071	Yes, thanks very much.
10618091	10619171	I want to thank you personally.
10619591	10620932	You put me on the path of exile.
10621312	10623273	It's very satisfying and I'm going to play more of it.
10624602	10625122	Diablo 3, finally.
10653463	10659287	Well, it was Diablo, but even so, just playing it and killing things, it was worth it.
10659647	10661889	Totally worth waiting, and the internet was crap downloading.
10661909	10662449	Took ages.
10662689	10663209	It was worth it.
10663329	10665571	Go try it out, at least, even if you're not a fan.
10665631	10666111	Try it out.
10667952	10669674	A ringing endorsement from overseas.
10669694	10670054	There you go.
10670294	10670854	Can't beat that.
10671054	10673076	Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.
10673696	10674116	Good girl.
10674256	10674517	All right.
10675197	10675797	That's it, Porkchop.
10675857	10676478	Have a good one, buddy.
10677258	10677939	Take it easy, guys.
10678039	10678279	All right.
10678319	10678679	Bye-bye.
10678739	10679059	You too.
10679079	10679300	Bye.
10680826	10683288	I will try this call one more time because it's a new name, I think.
10683368	10684329	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10684349	10684729	Who's this?
10686530	10687811	Nope, you gotta call Echo 123.
10689232	10689692	That's it.
10689712	10690833	And turn off your speakers.
10691293	10693315	Use headphones.
10693395	10695076	You gotta stop the show when you're calling in.
10695436	10696777	Sorry.
10698158	10700239	We'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.
10700279	10701140	We have another one coming in.
10701460	10702401	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10702421	10702781	Who's this?
10703782	10706403	You talk about Path of Exile way too much.
10706904	10707444	Oh, God.
10707504	10707984	Here we go.
10708064	10708785	Hi, Shane.
10709517	10709857	Hello.
10710137	10710637	How are you?
10711418	10711718	I'm good.
10711738	10712658	I'm playing Pokemon.
10712918	10716840	Why the hate boner, since we've been using that term a lot tonight, why the hate boner for Path of Exile?
10717220	10719721	Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.
10720761	10722642	Have you played Path of Exile?
10722902	10728464	I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer, because it was crap.
10730164	10731545	I'm telling you, there's a difference.
10731765	10732565	And Torchlight 2.
10732605	10733485	Have you played Torchlight 2?
10734246	10737267	I played the first one, the demo of it, and it was kind of boring.
10737607	10737707	Ugh.
10739403	10741244	You're the problem, Shane.
10741804	10742064	Yes.
10743465	10744345	We have stuff to do.
10746086	10749728	But I gotta watch Kyoryuger some more because it's so funny.
10750148	10751069	I need to watch it now.
10751209	10752329	Alright, why did you call in tonight?
10752349	10754971	Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile or did you have something else?
10756851	10757892	No, that's pretty much it.
10760623	10762084	and Nino Cooney sucks there.
10762204	10762685	Hey!
10764166	10765527	Another game he hasn't played that he hates.
10765867	10766928	I have Nino Cooney.
10767128	10768550	You have it.
10768590	10769430	Yes, I have it.
10769550	10770351	It is not fun.
10770411	10771572	It is super boring.
10771932	10774414	The Pokemon aspect is cool and the battles are fine.
10774454	10775495	I actually like the battles.
10775515	10777657	But the story is terrible.
10777857	10778358	Here's the thing.
10778558	10782961	A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane.
10783001	10784703	Like, you know, I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.
10785083	10787845	I got into probably... Are you playing Persona?
10788105	10789926	I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.
10789946	10790047	See?
10790067	10790127	See?
10790167	10790827	Everybody proof.
10791668	10796351	Mass Effect, and we have the Pokemon, and... Echo Image.
10797292	10799353	Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway.
10799893	10800814	Because it was in DDR.
10801715	10805137	Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance, was largely in part to Shane.
10805497	10805797	But...
10806858	10831361	I do influence Shane sometimes and Nino Cooney was one of them is that I convinced him to get Nino Cooney right now he doesn't like it he's gonna give me his copy I made the wrong choice it's just it's like the bizarre review Nino Cooney every reviewer is like no the story's amazing but you know there's some problems with the with the gameplay and the battle system battle system's great but story oh sucks now this means Shane can give me his copy
10832375	10833116	of Ni No Kuni.
10833196	10833476	Yeah.
10833897	10840884	I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little limited edition case I have with it because it goes for like 40 bucks just the case alone.
10841084	10841765	Damn it.
10842866	10843627	Did you get the book?
10844848	10845969	No, I did not get a book.
10845989	10846870	Oh, I want that book.
10847831	10847991	No.
10849733	10851734	Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.
10851774	10853595	The story is so boring.
10853635	10855195	I don't care about any of the characters.
10855316	10859438	I care about my little Mighty Might guy, and that's pretty much it.
10859538	10862659	I named him Fodder because I figured he wasn't going to be worth anything, but he's really good.
10862900	10863520	He is really good.
10863580	10867462	He actually lasts a long time, but if you read game facts, they all say, Oh, he's horrible.
10867522	10868362	He's got bad stats.
10868382	10871244	Okay, so I just want to be clear here, Chad.
10871284	10872044	I just want to be clear.
10872725	10874746	You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.
10875327	10875507	No.
10875688	10880134	But you are current on every episode of Power Rangers ever made, correct?
10881376	10883439	Um, not entirely.
10883519	10885743	There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.
10886043	10886844	I see, I see.
10886925	10888447	And how's the story in Pokemon?
10888467	10889789	You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?
10890205	10897368	Yes Okay, Shane, wait I have to ask you, because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages What is your favorite Sentai series?
10898209	10899189	Sentai series?
10899329	10903031	Yeah Probably Gokaiger Really?
10903671	10919138	Yes, it cracks me up, but Kyoryuger might take its place I still Oh, and Dekaranger I still say Megaranger was the best I don't know, I haven't seen that one Most of the later ones Go watch Megaranger, it's awesome
10919537	10920260	Are you guys done?
10921484	10922387	No, are you done?
10922527	10922828	Yes.
10923631	10924554	Bye, have a good time.
10926104	10926785	Thanks for calling.
10927805	10928146	Bye.
10928766	10931969	He's like, mm-hmm.
10931989	10934731	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10935051	10942598	You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft.
10943058	10944920	And then some.
10944940	10946141	7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

10947021	10950784	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10950824	10951785	I got time for one more call.
10953607	10954608	Ain't nobody got time for that.
10955700	10957041	I got bronchitis!
10960444	10961725	That lady's making a killing.
10962365	10964087	But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?
10964127	10965688	She was on Tosh last year.
10965928	10968230	Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.
10969411	10970132	He was on Tosh too.
10972133	10973074	It's tough to make a living.
10973474	10974215	I'm gonna find out now.
10974255	10974575	Hold on.
10974755	10975676	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10975696	10976056	Who's this?
10976697	10978538	That's the one and only Ranma from the East Coast.
10978738	10979819	Hey, Ranma from the East Coast.
10979839	10980320	How's it going?
10981181	10982962	Oh, pretty good, pretty good.
10984282	10987244	We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.
10987684	10989124	Yeah, I heard.
10989144	10989785	I got the memo.
10989825	10990465	Good job on that.
10990845	10992346	But congrats on your first live show.
10992886	10994206	Thanks, and we try.
10994426	10997868	Evidently, Winamp didn't like a certain MP3 and decided to give me the middle finger.
10999031	11001913	It might do that with some of the foreign name titles, just so you know.
11001953	11002934	I should have warned you about that.
11003114	11006576	These are things we learn through trial and error.
11009158	11011099	Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.
11011760	11012220	Thank you.
11012380	11018444	And Anime Jam Session can also be heard live on VOG Network Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.
11019104	11020345	VOG got two new live shows.
11020365	11023247	Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.
11023307	11024688	It's like we kind of doubled.
11025289	11025629	Not really.
11025809	11026910	I guess we went from three to five.
11027050	11027470	It's close.
11029051	11029471	Pretty cool.
11031912	11034212	So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winamp?
11037293	11038714	Just making it through school.
11040614	11041954	Just chilling, just making it through school.
11041974	11042555	What are you studying?
11043635	11044795	Networking technology.
11044835	11046696	I guess you didn't get the notice on that.
11046756	11048096	I decided to go back to college.
11050763	11051203	Thank you.
11051263	11051564	Thank you.
11067590	11083743	Oh my god, you gotta tell our audience, I know it's a video game show, but like, I was reading, I saw it on Tumblr, I saw it on Facebook, I saw it on Twitter, like, there was drama everywhere, give us a little bit, give us a little bit of the drama, give us a tease.
11084483	11102435	Sure, the main issue was cosplayers in Congo was a kind of piss that an international Jewish organization took up a majority of the convention area and places for taking photography and there was pretty much insults going between both sides back and forth.
11103756	11104117	Really?
11104997	11105537	Yes, really.
11107979	11111902	Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?
11114502	11119085	I just don't like when you get two groups of people together who decide to act like name-calling five-year-olds.
11119145	11121826	Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.
11139580	11141542	Also, update on Antoine Dodson.
11142223	11145025	Released a single in 2012 called Lovesick Lullaby.
11145726	11146767	And how did that sell?
11146847	11147688	I just downloaded it.
11148108	11148929	Oh my god.
11149830	11150731	You're the problem.
11151452	11152212	Damn it, Ooptron.
11152353	11153894	Look at your life, look at your choices.
11154875	11155976	Antoine Dodson songs?
11156276	11157337	Ain't nobody got time for that.
11158539	11160761	So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?
11160921	11162323	Yeah, no, it's 2013.
11162383	11162903	It's a new year.
11163444	11164425	Ain't nobody got time for that.
11164585	11171452	The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.
11171692	11172093	No.
11172313	11173114	Back in Huntsville.
11173554	11173774	No.
11173814	11174295	Huntsville.
11174455	11175556	He smoked marijuana.
11175576	11178179	Get out.
11178199	11178419	Anyway.
11184022	11185384	What else should I ask you about, Ranma?
11185444	11185804	I don't know.
11187405	11188666	I just have a few things to say.
11189527	11190448	Quick, and I'll be on my way.
11191649	11198134	The convention that you went to was called Animation on Display, and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Abare, was there as a guest.
11199335	11199595	Neat.
11200315	11200516	Yes.
11201356	11207781	And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is called Zuden Sentai Kyuruger.
11208062	11210744	It's the third Sentai series based off of Dinosaurs.
11210764	11210844	Okay.
11211718	11215320	Fun, because what was the one?
11215540	11216060	Dairanger.
11216080	11216660	Dino Thunder?
11216961	11217581	No, Dairanger.
11217601	11218741	Dinosaurs dress up and transform?
11218761	11219582	That's pretty awesome.
11219882	11221763	Zoo Ranger was the first one.
11222343	11224104	Yeah, Zoo Ranger, that was the first one.
11224164	11230627	Dairanger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old White Ranger guy.
11231668	11236310	Yeah, little do many people know is that the White Ranger was actually from a completely different series.
11237554	11238615	They had better outfits.
11238855	11239295	Just saying.
11239776	11240116	They did.
11240296	11240716	Yes, they did.
11240857	11241897	They totally had better outfits.
11242498	11245120	Well, Ranma, after this call, I feel like I learned something.
11250364	11251065	Two more things.
11251145	11252185	I'm going to get out of here.
11252386	11254727	A whole Year of Luigi thing.
11255088	11258911	Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.
11259351	11265636	As proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie wearing my Luigi hat.
11266909	11267529	That's awesome.
11267649	11268890	Never wash that hat again.
11270531	11270931	Just kidding.
11270951	11272071	You should probably wash it once in a while.
11273152	11275533	No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.
11275953	11276253	Oh, okay.
11276313	11277053	Alright, that works.
11278634	11280895	Oh my god, I haven't seen this picture.
11281035	11281575	How did I miss this?
11281595	11282575	You have not seen it?
11282756	11283756	No, that's hilarious.
11283776	11284296	That's pretty cool.
11287622	11288123	That's awesome.
11288463	11289304	Oh God, I love it.
11289424	11289745	All right.
11290085	11291687	When are you going to get your ass back out here?
11291707	11293269	Can you put that on Tumblr or something?
11293289	11295993	Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.
11296633	11301559	I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money and I'm done with college, okay?
11301740	11303222	Because I want to come back out there again.
11303542	11305504	I want to go out there and go to a con.
11305524	11306626	How about We Crash New York?
11307822	11317128	Well, Tiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here and me down there and Jovi Dea down here to do a big ol' party thing, you know what I'm saying?
11317228	11317708	There you go.
11317728	11319729	We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.
11319769	11321330	Only if it's a sexy party.
11321990	11323011	They do have that.
11323071	11327854	It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.
11328114	11328434	Awesome.
11328634	11329235	Sounds like fun to me.
11329275	11330876	Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show.
11331396	11331956	Fine, okay.
11332036	11332517	I'm outta here.
11332537	11333217	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
11333857	11334038	Later.
11334358	11334578	Later.
11335891	11337693	Another A-plus phone call from Ranma.
11338574	11341898	Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.
11342379	11343660	Echo 1, 2, 3 in the future.
11346223	11346643	There we go.
11347504	11347885	That's it.
11348686	11353672	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, or tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.
11354132	11355233	Oh, shit, I gotta do the tweets.
11357093	11358594	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
11381992	11409128	Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired and this guy was a George actually went for 80 plus hours and he actually finished or he beat the world record I guess at about over 84 hours and 36 million points so at least that's what the thought is right now that he has broken the record for both longest time playing on a
11413294	11414964	He likes to score all night.
11417370	11419172	Here's a last-minute story if I ever heard one.
11419512	11423716	Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's on topic and legit.
11423776	11426738	Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.
11426959	11428300	This is actually super important.
11429401	11434866	Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.
11435406	11436207	When's it happening?
11437108	11438569	Today, 5 p.m.
11438609	11441652	Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m.
11441792	11443093	Eastern, so that means in about...
11443753	11470787	two more hours we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita and it is ahead of the February 20th event meaning this is confirmed the two events are about separate topics so the February 20th event is all about something new because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week or tonight so Loki upon hearing that you just said earlier in the show where's the information on the Vita any reaction to this hearing this
11471687	11472508	I've got to see what they say.
11472748	11480618	See, the problem is when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games, and it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.
11481078	11485464	And here's the other funny thing you want to see.
11485484	11489629	I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and games side.
11490569	11492231	And we do a lot of promotions with them.
11492291	11497314	In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now because I probably can't go.
11497914	11505700	It's possibly to go on the red carpet premiere for This Is The End with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.
11505740	11507541	My wife might not like it.
11507701	11508202	But here's the thing.
11508822	11509943	I'll fucking go.
11510063	11510663	Our rep.
11511004	11511644	My name's Loki.
11511804	11514826	Our rep in house has been asking me.
11514866	11515847	She's all, okay, well, what...
11516207	11526859	what's in the electric or electronic device that Sony has that you know what's hot right now with Sony and stuff I was like oh yeah well you know there's the PlayStation 4 it's gonna be coming out and then there's the Vita so I may actually get another Vita
11529582	11532423	You're not having to pay for it, of course, but... You have a rough life.
11533023	11535363	Well, I... I might have to go to a movie premiere.
11535423	11535923	Well, no, no.
11536223	11537103	Here's the thing, though.
11537123	11537944	I've got another Vita.
11537964	11541824	No, right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.
11541844	11550246	They went to a winery one time, and then they went to... They went to Monterey, and I got... I didn't get included in either of those trips.
11550366	11553887	I had to stay back and answer phones.
11555327	11555607	Thanks.
11555667	11556187	Good times.
11556647	11558709	Alright, quickly, I gotta do some quick Twitter topics here.
11559050	11560692	TigerClaw sent us a couple stories here.
11560752	11562353	I'm just gonna do one because I'm pressed for time here.
11563495	11568220	Video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.
11568500	11568980	Oh, yeah.
11569141	11569741	Get out.
11569781	11571303	I didn't know that this was something they were doing.
11571383	11573085	That's been floating for a little bit.
11573525	11575488	I thought they had a play... On PS1 they did, right?
11575508	11575648	Really?
11577930	11580632	There was the Masters of Terra something.
11580732	11583554	Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.
11583574	11587818	It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't, you know, amount to anything.
11589739	11596004	Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct is greater than Super Metroid.
11596124	11596624	Just saying.
11597305	11600087	Well, you know Orange Laundry is the show where every gamer has a voice.
11600227	11600687	Except you.
11600707	11601148	Yeah.
11602350	11602931	Thanks for watching!
11614515	11619079	I've never said that there's a stupid question.
11619539	11620460	That's pushing it.
11620520	11635494	Since we are on the topic of Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars, and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know that
11636655	11638877	Star Wars figures with Disney figures.
11657987	11659970	Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.
11660110	11661291	Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.
11661412	11662233	You know what?
11662333	11667239	Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game.
11668020	11671845	So I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet.
11672026	11675230	Especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.
11677358	11677658	All right.
11678218	11687180	And lastly, from SSJ100, Matt, with so much negativity stemming from video games lately, someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.
11688260	11689060	Very interesting.
11690180	11690480	Let's see.
11690500	11692040	I'm trying to scan through this real quick.
11692080	11693861	God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.
11694961	11701722	The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games, and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.
11701802	11706643	It's a nonprofit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.
11707043	11708245	So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?
11726491	11727191	Wah, wah.
11727452	11729072	Womp, womp, womp.
11729773	11730093	All right.
11730893	11731314	That does it.
11731334	11731934	We got to wrap up.
11731954	11733995	We're at midnight 30 Eastern time here.
11734015	11734755	We're running a little late.
11734815	11737016	So we got to go around and wrap it up.

11779715	11780895	Just thanks for having me.
11780975	11782336	I got to talk about Nino Cooney.
11782356	11790438	I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Nino Cooney podcast, just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard.
11790738	11795139	Are you going to call it Nino Podcast?
11795339	11796080	Nino Podcast.
11796120	11796780	Nino Cast.
11796880	11800001	I think Nino Podcast would be a great addition to the VOG Network.
11800041	11801161	I'm sure Bobby would have no problem.
11801181	11801561	He would love it.
11801761	11828432	He would have no problem at all Green light, green light I'm going to just offer you the spot right now We'll just call it Bobby Blackwolf Night We'll have Massivek Podcast and Nino Cooney Podcast back to back And then the Brony Show that Actdeft keeps talking about The Brony Show, sounds great It'll be awesome Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight Hate boner My final thought tonight is Sunflower Seeds

11835730	11836911	I just don't want to move upstairs.
11837731	11838731	I hate moving my stuff.
11839411	11840471	Get a peon to do it for you.
11840491	11847833	I've been in that spot for a long time, and I just don't like moving because everyone's like, well, your desk is a mess anyways.
11847953	11849734	Actually, no, my desk is just spread out.
11849814	11850274	It's not a mess.
11850294	11851534	It's organized chaos.
11851634	11852714	It's not organized at all.
11852794	11855475	It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff.
11857096	11858057	Gotta be stored somewhere.
