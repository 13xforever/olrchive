00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:26,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 17, 2013, Bungie reveals details on their next game, Nintendo unveils more 3DS titles than the new Nintendo Direct, and as the first glimpse of the PlayStation 4 leaked to the internet,

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:45,372
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February the 17th, 2013.

4
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:49,075
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

5
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:52,859
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:53,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Blarg.

7
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Blarg, yarg, how you doing?

8
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tired, actually.

9
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the coffee.

10
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time, and then what came out?

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,499
[SPEAKER_10]: The cafe.

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,821
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just saying it, you know, with an accent.

13
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:08,402
[SPEAKER_10]: The cafe.

14
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:09,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I love coffee.

15
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:11,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I love coffee, too.

16
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm drinking it, and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit, because...

17
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to San Francisco yesterday.

18
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:19,055
[SPEAKER_03]: How was San Francisco?

19
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:20,556
[SPEAKER_03]: It was gay.

20
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,458
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do in San Francisco?

21
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure the weather was great.

22
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,019
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you do in San Francisco?

23
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,560
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather was fantastic.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.

25
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:41,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara, and well, there was beer involved, and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been there.

27
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:06,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.

28
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone was like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:15,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japantown.

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm not here for the con.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wearing my jacket.

32
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you do a deadpan just like that?

33
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:21,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

34
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:21,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

35
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the random impromptu anime convention.

36
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:26,486
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura approaches.

37
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:27,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick, throw an anime convention.

38
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:32,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw people putting on armor in the Japan town.

39
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?

40
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:42,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.

41
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw people putting on armor.

42
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:49,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's not the Cherry Blossom Festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.

43
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?

44
00:02:52,435 --> 00:03:00,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough, I run into somebody wearing a blue trench coat and a button-up shirt, and I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?

45
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,764
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, and there's my doctor over there.

46
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, so is there a convention going on?

47
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,807
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh yeah, and it sucks.

48
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what the convention was called.

49
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:11,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was that?

50
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:14,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it at the... It was at Miyako, over at the Kabuki Hotel.

51
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

52
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:23,313
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's where they're going to be having the Gamer Expo, but they call it Gamer X now or something because they can't call it GamerCon because of legal stuff.

53
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:24,794
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's where they're having that, so...

54
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like a pretty good venue, but I mean, I want to go to that one.

55
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:35,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was cosplay central all over Japantown and assholes with cameras.

56
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing I call them, assholes.

57
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,161
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who know how to behave, how to usher people aside when they're taking their photos.

59
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:52,423
[SPEAKER_03]: This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband.

60
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:53,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking for the girls with the biggest tatas.

61
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:54,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put this in my spank bank.

62
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:59,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Backing up into... Techmaster Loki, everybody.

63
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Backing up into people and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.

64
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:09,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran into him again and I just said, look where you're going, ass face or something.

65
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

66
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.

67
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't keep up with the con circuit anymore.

68
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,375
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I know all this?

69
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki, officially, everybody.

70
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:31,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

71
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:32,477
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

72
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:33,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing fine.

73
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:35,398
[SPEAKER_10]: You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?

74
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:36,118
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

75
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:36,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

76
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that.

77
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:38,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I can remember.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to think for a minute.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I've been to a con.

80
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,762
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think I have.

81
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:44,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.

82
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,804
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember the last con I went to.

83
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:47,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It was probably like ASAP.

84
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the last con job I pulled.

85
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,155
[SPEAKER_10]: What's a con job?

86
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:51,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds hot.

87
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:53,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Con?

88
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:54,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Con artist?

89
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:55,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

90
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.

91
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:58,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

92
00:04:58,717 --> 00:04:59,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.

93
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:02,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.

94
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:04,638
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a familiar guy.

95
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,959
[SPEAKER_10]: You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show or ever listened to Horde House and hear his emails and tweets and all that.

96
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,440
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Flaco Jones, everybody!

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, everybody.

99
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:18,741
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing?

100
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing great.

101
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,264
[SPEAKER_10]: As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.

102
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:23,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love that.

103
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:27,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just reminding me of Nino Cooney and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.

104
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sticky and smell of caramel.

105
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:29,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

106
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I smell you?

107
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,671
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all this English candy.

108
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's all the Sill candy, which much love to Sill.

109
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Sill listens to Orange Launch Radio, but I hope she won't mind.

110
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been giving some of the candy away.

111
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:42,718
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.

112
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Sill, EJ, Raven, Rob

113
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:24,007
[SPEAKER_10]: and still offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing so she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain like the Smarties over there which are like totally different than Smarties here and like Aero bars which we don't have here at all Jelly Babies which I'd never had which were pretty good

114
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:25,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't eat jelly babies.

115
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.

116
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:36,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town, but she sent stuff that I've never seen there.

117
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Bubblies, I've never seen them there.

118
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool.

120
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:47,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh my god, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.

121
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,173
[SPEAKER_10]: She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs.

122
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one yesterday.

123
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.

124
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have a return package.

125
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to spoil just in case Syl is listening.

126
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It might spoil by the time it gets there.

127
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:05,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have a return package we're sending and all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.

128
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you know Syl...

129
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sending her a token of our love.

130
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,023
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

131
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:16,008
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Syl that we're sending.

132
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,250
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll send that over there soon.

133
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:19,091
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

134
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Flaco, what's new with you?

135
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,234
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you been up to?

136
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,436
[SPEAKER_10]: When was the last time you were on the show?

137
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:25,457
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple months ago, right?

138
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:26,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on the year-end show.

139
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:27,498
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

140
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,220
[SPEAKER_10]: So December 30th or something.

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,501
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, the last show of the year.

142
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you ruined one of the shows in June.

143
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:33,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

144
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:35,885
[SPEAKER_10]: and hopefully tonight's show will be better

145
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

146
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that I have this reputation with this show.

147
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:13,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the number one fan of Horde House and the number one curse on OLR.

148
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:15,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, exactly.

149
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have two young ones at home.

150
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: How old is your little girl now?

151
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:23,535
[SPEAKER_11]: She's almost one.

152
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:24,916
[SPEAKER_10]: She turns a year next month.

153
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,797
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have a less than a year old at home.

154
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:27,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

155
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:29,039
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you juggle that with game playing?

156
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:46,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I play very late at night early in the morning and you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni something like that I can actually play when they're up they don't get bothered by it too much my son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon you know he doesn't like the battles he gets bored of that which I guess a lot of people do

157
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:47,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Tree, Tree, Tree, Tree

158
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:22,070
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah so we put we you know we load up that game when we start playing it and he just he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game

159
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:43,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I'm using those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff, whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?

160
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:48,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.

161
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:51,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.

162
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:56,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve.

163
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:02,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.

164
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they will.

165
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:04,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just be different.

166
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,710
[SPEAKER_11]: They're holding back on it right now.

167
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,470
[SPEAKER_11]: They just want to save it.

168
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,131
[SPEAKER_10]: You think so?

169
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:07,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

170
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:08,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Holding back on it.

171
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,291
[SPEAKER_10]: They can do it now.

172
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:13,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Oliver will be able to have the Illumaroom that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.

173
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:13,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

174
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:14,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in time for that phase.

175
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:14,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobs everywhere.

176
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in time for that phase.

177
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:40,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you just called the motorboat room Akuma JP in our chat room By the way, hi chatters We're always joined with the live chat room Because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network VOG Network.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Akuma JP in chat says Sky sounds old, ha ha ha

178
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, jerk, keep this in mind.

179
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:46,956
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR is on our 11th year this year.

180
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.

181
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,423
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't start this show when we were 18.

182
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,105
[SPEAKER_10]: We were more like 23 or 24.

183
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:58,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So you do the math.

184
00:10:59,006 --> 00:10:59,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

185
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:02,649
[SPEAKER_03]: The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.

186
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's that?

187
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll be 37.

188
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:04,971
[SPEAKER_10]: In a row?

189
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:08,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I rest my case.

190
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:10,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll be 35.

191
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jamie's the old one.

192
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, Akuma.

193
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:16,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Redirect your jokes appropriately.

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,421
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

195
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:18,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Vintage.

196
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,523
[SPEAKER_03]: This rack took years to grow.

197
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm two weeks older than Rob.

198
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:25,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

199
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:26,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like the young kid.

200
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:30,307
[SPEAKER_10]: If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.

201
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.

202
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I just hang out with youngins.

203
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,051
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the deal.

204
00:11:37,951 --> 00:12:06,723
[SPEAKER_10]: AkumaJP in our chatroom says so you are old lol bonk you're only as old as you feel honestly and I will say this with all honesty we will talk about video games in a minute here but obviously I still play video games which a lot of people think is a youthful activity although I don't think so I think because we all grew up in a generation that was at least had Atari 2600 like video games has always been a part of our lives so like you know I can't imagine like not playing video games at this point right but

205
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,764
[SPEAKER_10]: But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.

206
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:10,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Really.

207
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to agree with that for myself as well.

208
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20-year-olds.

209
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:17,808
[SPEAKER_10]: That's totally not the case.

210
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:23,891
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time know that I was really sick when I was 29.

211
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:27,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I missed two or three weeks of OLR because I'd been in the hospital.

212
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to have surgery.

213
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:35,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was one of those things where they had to screen me because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer.

214
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember chatting with him when he graduated college That makes me feel old

215
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know, right?

216
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:06,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.

217
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, my nieces can like drink.

218
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,033
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

219
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when they were born.

220
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,134
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you can take them out drinking.

221
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:20,936
[SPEAKER_10]: The other day, we got an email to the show that was like, I've been listening to you since I was 13.

222
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh my God.

223
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:24,997
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, I'm in college now.

224
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:25,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

225
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:32,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?

226
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:33,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Not many.

227
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:36,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Gunsmoke, The Simpsons, Doctor Who.

228
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:40,226
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only a few.

229
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:41,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're awesome.

230
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:47,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room and live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

231
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.

232
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.

233
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:56,992
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell was that?

234
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:02,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they say that that kind of stuff happens all the time, but like... It happened in San Francisco, right?

235
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, later on.

236
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:06,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it like totally wasn't the same thing.

237
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't like shatter windows and stuff.

238
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:09,419
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.

239
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, probably somebody's science project out there.

240
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: In Russia, meteors shatter you.

241
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:21,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook, little pictures in Soviet Russia.

242
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I was busy being asleep.

243
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:24,609
Yeah.

244
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:26,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you don't live in Russia.

245
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:30,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.

246
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no, no.

247
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I actually didn't see the news until I got up like late today because I've been sick most of the day.

248
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, meteor?

249
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.

250
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:38,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Sleep.

251
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:42,176
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I just, I watching the videos online like blew my mind.

252
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:47,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass and of course the car alarms is always the best part.

253
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody get Bruce Willis' Armageddon.

254
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:54,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia.

255
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,401
[SPEAKER_11]: They have these dash cams going.

256
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:59,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.

257
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:03,763
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never phased by any of this.

258
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,543
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no like, oh my god!

259
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:06,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

260
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:06,763
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, what?

261
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:10,845
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just like, oh, that's weird.

262
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die.

263
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:13,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

264
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:17,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in, I don't know, Philadelphia or something?

265
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and there's a camera going.

266
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I can just imagine it right now.

267
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said, and it was just a small thing.

268
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,476
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy's driving on the freeway and he's like,

269
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Curse Worfs, oh my god did you see that?

270
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:29,918
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like okay.

271
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:32,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god thanks Obama.

272
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.

273
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:44,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I was driving home really late at night and there was a big green streak across the sky but it didn't explode like that one so obviously it wasn't even close to the size but I thought it was pretty cool.

274
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:49,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like oh wow that thing just comes streaking across and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.

275
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,613
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had been in my neck of the south it would be the fuck is that?

276
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand me a beer.

277
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, that means we're going to get in another hurricane.

278
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Porkchop in our chatroom says, I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.

279
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, I'm assuming they're in public cars.

280
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:05,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I thought maybe it's a police car.

281
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:12,734
[SPEAKER_02]: No, apparently they're really, from what I read, they're really into dash cams because, I guess, in traffic courts and stuff, they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.

282
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have physical evidence.

283
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:14,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy moly.

284
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:21,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, because of altercations like that, you know, any sort of car accident, they want to have something documented, so that's why they do it.

285
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,557
[SPEAKER_10]: What did... Because, you know, Nelly was born in Russia.

286
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:25,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Did she have anything to say about it?

287
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

288
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:26,958
[SPEAKER_10]: All the stuff?

289
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:27,258
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

290
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God it didn't happen here.

291
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:32,120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably... I'm glad it didn't hit.

292
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,340
[SPEAKER_10]: She was born in the Ukraine, so it's... Oh, okay.

293
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,101
[SPEAKER_10]: A little different.

294
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:37,021
[SPEAKER_10]: A little different.

295
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

296
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know what that has to... Yeah, Rob.

297
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything Slavic is not Russian.

298
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:42,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

299
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:43,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure?

300
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in the 80s.

301
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Canada was a state.

302
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

303
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:57,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what that had to do with video games, but as far as nerd news goes, it was one of those things where I watched it and I was like, oh my god.

304
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,606
[SPEAKER_11]: You make a Burning Legion joke.

305
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I saw that on Twitter.

306
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:08,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone catched a Meteo.

307
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Codeman in chat says it was Team Rocket.

308
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:13,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.

309
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,751
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a gif of the lights going out and the Team Rocket shows up.

310
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was Goku.

311
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:17,813
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

312
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,194
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big Kamehameha.

313
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:25,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into video games and the video games that you have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

314
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,101
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

315
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar.

316
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,122
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

317
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:29,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you inhaled that thing.

318
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mars bars.

319
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:31,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

320
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.

321
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played, I beat Mass Effect 2 again.

322
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started on Mass Effect 3 and got Flycam working.

323
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, you know, we got that patch 1.5.

324
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of my cheats work anymore.

325
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:53,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just figured out how to put in keybinding commands using the Coalesced Editor.

326
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And now all I have to do is hit 0 for God Mode.

327
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:01,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.

328
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I played WoW for an hour.

329
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:13,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually log on and play more WoW, but I would like people to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to, you know, plug it.

330
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:21,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know that Mars bars are Milky Ways, but they're not the regular Milky Ways.

331
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,435
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste better.

332
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: They're different-er.

333
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,071
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually from Mars.

334
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

335
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:36,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid, so having it say Mars with the packaging on it and everything makes me stupendously happy.

336
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now if I can find whatchamacallits, I'd be even happier.

337
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I played...

338
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,440
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I played something else.

339
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was.

340
00:18:49,221 --> 00:19:08,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Dan had a friend over and they played through Contra Hardcore and then played through Ghouls N' Ghosts, which was pretty fun because my friend and I left and then we came back and they were still playing Ghouls N' Ghosts like hours later.

341
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:10,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, what playthrough were you on?

342
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, just the beginning of the second playthrough.

343
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:41,203
[SPEAKER_03]: really, so yeah and then I got now this isn't a game but it's related to a game, I found the Mass Effect Paragon Lost for like 16 bucks brand new so I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money, let's buy it it didn't suck the only thing that I really didn't like about it was how the kroken were drawn I did not care for the character design and it got me in the feels so I was like, damn you Bioware so yeah

344
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn those feels.

345
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:44,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn those feels.

346
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:45,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn the battle tits.

347
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:47,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Full speed ahead.

348
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:48,564
Okay.

349
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:49,224
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

350
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:50,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to Loki.

351
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:51,105
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

352
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play a whole ton this week.

353
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim, I'm sure.

354
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:05,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I started some of the kind of DLC stuff, or not DLC stuff, the mod quests, I guess, if you will.

355
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:10,698
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that's kind of extensive where you hire a boat and you can actually go to a bunch of different islands and stuff.

356
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:12,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was neat, I guess.

357
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty well done.

358
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:22,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And they voice acted everything, so that's a little weird hearing people that don't sound like the five different NPCs that are in the game.

359
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,008
[SPEAKER_02]: They have voice, all the characters, it's ridiculous.

360
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I played a little bit of that, and then, um, a little bit of Borderlands, and, um, more Call of Duty.

361
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:52,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually bought Map Pack 4, or Content Pack 4, so now we have a few more maps that I've already kind of gotten sick of, but we gotta do something because Grand Theft Auto V's not coming out in May like we had hoped it was, so, gotta have something to tide us over.

362
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

363
00:20:55,226 --> 00:21:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just got done playing DDRX2 on my PC.

364
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though, yes, that's an arcade game.

365
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:07,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But it runs on a PC, so I played it anyways.

366
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't the versus second mixing.

367
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:12,587
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three, I guess.

368
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's X2.

369
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

370
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Step Mania, I guess.

371
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:22,717
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked a lot to me like the PlayStation 3 version of the game.

372
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:24,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they just adapted that engine.

373
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the Wii.

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,061
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR2 on the Wii.

375
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised they don't release like a PC version.

376
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:30,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs on a PC.

377
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,186
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no work to be done.

378
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:34,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, no work to be done.

379
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing would be the only thing.

380
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, but just put Konami Originals in there.

381
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:40,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

382
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:41,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on Steam.

383
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:42,513
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

384
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Money.

385
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:44,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rolling in.

386
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

387
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my wife has been taking over the Xbox because she's been playing Fable 3.

388
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:55,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

389
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:56,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

390
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:58,133
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not even the best Fable game.

391
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:02,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she played Fable 2 all the way, and so she's playing Fable 3.

392
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:07,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games, is getting into Fable, or is into Fable.

393
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she is into Fable.

394
00:22:07,937 --> 00:22:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

395
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Does she play good or bad?

396
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:10,838
[SPEAKER_10]: She's playing good.

397
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:12,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

398
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:13,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is...

399
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes me realize how much Peter Molyneux is full of crap.

400
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:28,106
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just talking about all these different enhancements.

401
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:33,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the first time ever in the game, and the dog is awesome, blah, blah, blah.

402
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, you're so full of shit, it's not even funny.

403
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:39,372
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, folks, is anyone still curious about Curiosity?

404
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:42,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm pretty sure everybody's fucking forgotten about this game.

405
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:43,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Curiosity.

406
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,876
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you know who hasn't forgotten about Curiosity is Alan.

407
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:50,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'll be sitting there on my iPad and then he'll walk into the room and he'll be like, have you checked on the cube, Rob?

408
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you checked on the cube?

409
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,040
[SPEAKER_10]: What's in the cube?

410
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you find what's in the cube yet?

411
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:54,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Touch, touch.

412
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:54,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Break the cubes.

413
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:56,243
[SPEAKER_10]: He does it just like that too.

414
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Break the cubes, Rob.

415
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you would even, what that's going to be.

416
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:08,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to just be like whoever finally, the last person to give that game up is going to be the winner pretty much.

417
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:18,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was going to ask you about this, because there was that new Alien game that came out this week from Gearbox, and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet, except for one site.

418
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently really liked it, but whatever.

419
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I went on this Twitter thing.

420
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I don't know shit about this game, really, but I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's jock?

421
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,182
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

422
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:55,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

423
00:23:55,557 --> 00:24:04,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm like, and people are like, oh, we're going to sue, and I'm just like, well, game companies have been doing this shit for years, and you just brought up Peter Molyneux.

424
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:06,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, he's the master of this shit.

425
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:07,823
[SPEAKER_10]: He makes up shit all the time.

426
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:08,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

427
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:10,164
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to sue him.

428
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:17,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I know nothing, like, I mean, he's not really working, he's not really attached to any more Fable games or anything like that, as far as I'm aware.

429
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:19,388
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Fable, it's not on rails.

430
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously don't even know the name of the game.

431
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just Fable.

432
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,331
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not on rights.

433
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: The Journey.

434
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:24,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable, The Journey.

435
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:29,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable, The Book, The Game, The Series, The Movie.

436
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

437
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:34,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, even the whole Gearbox thing.

438
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's two jokes I made about it.

439
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:41,486
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Gearbox, you've got Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox and Borderlands Gearbox.

440
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:44,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is made by Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox.

441
00:24:45,870 --> 00:25:05,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second thing is, yeah, just because they showed more fancy features and stuff like that, that may have been running on a PC version or something like that, that come time to actually implement that on a console, oh, we don't have the memory bandwidth to do all these fancy things, we've got to scale it back a bit.

442
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:10,067
[SPEAKER_02]: or, oh, we don't have enough processing power or the frame rates, you know, shit or whatever.

443
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe that's why.

444
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, why wouldn't they just allow that to kind of run, you know, unleashed on the PC?

445
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:19,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because it's a console port.

446
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:20,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

447
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:22,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

448
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:24,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad games happen all the time.

449
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really surprised that, like, a movie-tying game is bad?

450
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

451
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody's shocked that this movie-tying game is bad?

452
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:34,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

453
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:36,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter.

454
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:42,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... Yeah, we all really kind of hope that the games are good as Borderlands.

455
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:47,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, I thought, you know, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be awesome because it's done by the guys at Borderlands.

456
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:48,715
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

457
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:51,519
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's the team that did Duke Nukem Forever, clearly.

458
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:51,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

459
00:25:54,253 --> 00:26:04,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Steel UT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Differences is great, but when there's literally one that looks shady, even with a game that doesn't get well received, there's always at least a group of people who like the game.

460
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:13,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, one guy liked the game, but I can think of other games where there's been that one voice that passionately defends it.

461
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:15,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as what they...

462
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I am the one defending a big name site

463
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:42,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm usually the first one to criticize that stuff

464
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:06,708
[SPEAKER_10]: There was more evidence and there was stuff that came out about that and all the shady dealings.

465
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:14,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy himself basically said, yeah, there was some stuff going on where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff.

466
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

467
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:19,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think the internet should just get over it.

468
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:21,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there was one person that said it was good.

469
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:23,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

470
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody out there probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2.

471
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:27,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody out there probably liked Yaris.

472
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:28,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It was free.

473
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:31,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Silent Hill Revelations, the movie.

474
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:32,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody else likes that.

475
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it.

476
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:34,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see it.

477
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:35,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You and Osfer, actually.

478
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Osfer would defend that.

479
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,334
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

480
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:41,177
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something about being high on the leaderboards on VOG.

481
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:42,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft would probably like it, too.

482
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,282
[SPEAKER_11]: He did like it, I think.

483
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:45,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

484
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:59,327
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to mark games down just because of glitches and stuff like that, then Earth Defense Force 2017 should have gotten a 1 out of 10 because that thing is glitchy as hell.

485
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no physics, no physics whatsoever, or at least no realistic physics.

486
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:07,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crap.

487
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:09,269
[SPEAKER_02]: The AI is completely retarded.

488
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it happens.

489
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:36,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Deal UT in chat says and it wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with the game it took seven fucking years to make and had eight devs on it Lincoln just came out a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think 18 years to make that's why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd because she was cast in it like 10 years ago and you know had to defend the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated for an Oscar

490
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes things get trapped in development hell.

491
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,582
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't necessarily mean they turn out bad.

492
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:41,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Duke Nukem Forever.

493
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:45,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but that's not helping my case, actually.

494
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:45,505
[SPEAKER_10]: L.A.

495
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire, I think, was in development hell.

496
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:47,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

497
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:48,646
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a better one.

498
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:49,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I got good reviews.

499
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:49,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

500
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:51,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto V just got delayed.

501
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:56,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that hasn't been announced very long.

502
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like Grand Theft Auto V coming out in 2001.

503
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:00,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wait a second.

504
00:29:03,114 --> 00:29:04,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We're missing some numbers here.

505
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:07,337
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on with Gaming Week, so we're going to be here for an hour.

506
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:09,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll talk about my Gaming Week real quick, and then we'll go to Flacco.

507
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:17,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week because I've been having long hours at work, and when I come home, I'm like, I have to raid and wow or something.

508
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did play one new game, and it was something where it went on sale this weekend, and so I get a text message from Shane.

509
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:26,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

510
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:26,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

511
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:27,974
[SPEAKER_10]: You should get Pokemon Black 2.

512
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:33,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Black 2 has the sassier Pokemon and it's on sale right now at Best Buy.

513
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:34,496
[SPEAKER_10]: So you should get it.

514
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:35,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a text an hour later.

515
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:36,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get it yet?

516
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:37,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Text an hour later.

517
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:38,938
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you can order it online.

518
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,879
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just go pick it up after work before it sells out.

519
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, you know, he keeps texting me like, did you buy the Pokemon yet?

520
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Why haven't you bought Pokemon?

521
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:45,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Why won't you take a good deal?

522
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:46,942
[SPEAKER_10]: You can talk about it on OLR.

523
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So finally it's like, shut up!

524
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:49,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'll buy the game!

525
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:52,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jamie, are you going to get in the Pokemon now pretty soon?

526
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you guys are all fucking like

527
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:57,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Gateway, Game Addicts or something.

528
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, say that now.

529
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:00,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see it.

530
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see it?

531
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,144
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I want to see the box.

532
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually super cute.

533
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:04,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

534
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:07,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so here's the thing.

535
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:08,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the DS.

536
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Not the 3DS, but the DS.

537
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:13,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I could play it, but I don't care.

538
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been having fun with it.

539
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:15,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

540
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I like compared to Pearl.

541
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:18,279
[SPEAKER_10]: It moves at a faster pace.

542
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:23,480
[SPEAKER_10]: It gives you all this shit up front, and you don't have to go forever and grind more.

543
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon at the beginning than there was in Pearl.

544
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:31,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just kind of little quality of life improvements.

545
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:32,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's where the game...

546
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:37,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of, like, goes crazy, though, is that there's all these, like, online things.

547
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I can't figure out half this shit with the online.

548
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:43,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, some of it's in the manual, and some of it I tried to go online.

549
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me, but it's just, it's so weird.

550
00:30:47,187 --> 00:31:00,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you can use your little online gear to put your Pokemon to sleep, and then you go on the website, and you register for the website, and then you link your DS to the website, and then you can...

551
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:20,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Do that Pokemon that you just put to sleep you can have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville but you can also play these little online games so your Pokemon can send you things back in the regular game once you tell your Pokemon to wake up and then you launch your game again and you hit the button to tell it to wake up and go find where it was.

552
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:23,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's like oh my god, it's like an 18 step process.

553
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment you said put them to sleep.

554
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:27,731
Laughter

555
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Pikachu.

556
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:52,212
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that there's just all these bells and whistles that are buried like five menus deep is just, I don't know.

557
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:55,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like Pokemon kind of needs a better interface.

558
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it would be better if they could streamline a lot of that.

559
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the new 3DS version X and Y will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks good.

560
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be cool to see that.

561
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:33,344
[SPEAKER_10]: but yeah, I mean, don't let my little rant get you wrong especially for the core game about finding the new Pokemon and challenging the gym leaders and all that it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace than the other games do so you'll get pretty immediate rewards out of it there's a medal system in the game since Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did their own little thing with medals and you can have your little title when you go online you know what?

562
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I found my copy of Pearl

563
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,065
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

564
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

565
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:18,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I should say this, too.

566
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:22,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm playing Pokemon Black 2, and I didn't play Black 1, and I'm doing just fine.

567
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:24,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, the sequel thing, not an issue.

568
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can appreciate that.

569
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:31,824
[SPEAKER_10]: They always reference, like, all the people that you talk to are like, two years ago, this happened.

570
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Two years ago, this happened.

571
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,246
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess that's kind of its way of catching you up.

572
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:37,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of cool, I guess.

573
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:39,609
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this that you're showing me?

574
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:42,691
[SPEAKER_10]: That internet meme is seriously 15 years old.

575
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:46,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I think it's great that someone still remembers it.

576
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:47,393
[SPEAKER_10]: She's showing me the pictures of the cats.

577
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, is that in chat room?

578
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:51,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the pictures of the cats playing Pokemans.

579
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:52,736
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, my Pokemans, let me show you them.

580
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:53,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago.

581
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:54,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saving it.

582
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:56,599
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

583
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?

584
00:33:59,421 --> 00:33:59,962
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty good.

585
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to play a lot of games this week.

586
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:04,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Or not a lot of games, but a lot of two games.

587
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:06,969
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first one was Unfinished Swan.

588
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:14,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because I played the demo, which is basically just the first level, and really liked it.

589
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,117
[SPEAKER_11]: And my wife kept pestering me.

590
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,499
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like, why don't you just buy this game?

591
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,221
[SPEAKER_11]: We love playing the demo, but then we have to stop.

592
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:20,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And

593
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:21,923
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:45,724
[SPEAKER_11]: And we ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday.

595
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:46,604
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd go back and forth.

596
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:47,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd watch a little of the game.

597
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:48,765
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd play some more of that.

598
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:52,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I tweeted about that, and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer of the game.

599
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:57,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't hashtag anything, but I guess you can have stuff come up.

600
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:06,130
[SPEAKER_10]: This tweet deck, I think, allows you to run one feed for your Twitter, but you can also run a search, and it'll pop right up there.

601
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:06,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

602
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, do you remember when we had Ronnie from Big Brother 11 on Horde House a couple weeks ago?

603
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:12,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

604
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:18,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we got him, this was really Shane and X4's doing, I can't take credit.

605
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:23,861
[SPEAKER_10]: We got him addicted to Frog Fractions, which is that Flash game, and if you haven't heard of it, it's hilarious.

606
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,723
[SPEAKER_10]: But Shane and X4 won't shut up about that game, so they were talking about it on the show.

607
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:33,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sent Ronnie the link, and I said something like, here's Frog Fractions, you're welcome, I've ruined your life or whatever, something like that.

608
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,192
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

609
00:35:56,252 --> 00:36:08,260
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, so I played that, and mainly, I'd gotten all the trophies, except for, we still needed the, the hardest trophy to get in the game was to do the first level only using three paintballs.

610
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:20,328
[SPEAKER_11]: And the point of the game is you splatter paint around, at least the first part of the game, you splatter paint around to see where you're going, and it's kind of like a puzzler, it's kind of built like a shooter though, you know, because you just have like, you're just shooting paintballs all over the place.

611
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:21,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you make dirty noises while you're doing it?

612
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:26,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the way you describe it, where you're like shooting paint everywhere, you can make these really disgusting noises, like,

613
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:27,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

614
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:49,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, so we did that.

615
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:50,838
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife talked me through it.

616
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:55,000
[SPEAKER_11]: She found a guide online, and it's like, walk backwards until you hit a wall.

617
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk left until you hit a wall.

618
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk straight.

619
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,202
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll hear leaves cracking under your feet.

620
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're pretty much a due-level blind.

621
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's completely whited out.

622
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So we got that trophy, and that was our 100% for that.

623
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:06,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was really cool.

624
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other game I played, of course, was Ni No Kuni.

625
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:13,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I passed the 31-hour mark last night, and I played a little bit more today.

626
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it go downhill after 15 hours?

627
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:18,607
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I have no idea what that was about.

628
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,270
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, maybe my hours are different than other people's because I've been doing everything.

629
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:27,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess you can't really get... Can you hit a wall if you're just doing everything?

630
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:27,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

631
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:34,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to speed through it really fast, and then you kind of hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough, maybe you haven't gone out there.

632
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:43,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it is pretty grindy, though I found it's not super grindy for me because if I do the quests, in the process of doing the quests, I fight enough battles that I level up and...

633
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:48,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really felt grindy to me, but I could see how people would think it's too grindy.

634
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:49,995
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't mind that.

635
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:55,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Secret of Mana is really, really grindy, and there's no question that you just have to go out and grind, grind, grind to get your party up.

636
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Old school Final Fantasy games were very, very grindy.

637
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I spent an hour trying to get... What is that town?

638
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:30,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Alma Moon?

639
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: The one with the milk, right?

640
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:32,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

641
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:33,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Were you trying to get the babanas?

642
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,314
[SPEAKER_11]: The big banana guys?

643
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:38,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to search for the banana guys for an hour.

644
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,316
[SPEAKER_10]: An hour!

645
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:42,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, I trapped one.

646
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And then here's the hilarious part, right?

647
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:47,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for that quest, you have to get the banana and the turban monkey, right?

648
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:47,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

649
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,598
[SPEAKER_10]: So I go, and I'm like all excited.

650
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:53,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So I go to turn in the banana, and he's like, Oh, you got the bananas, but you didn't get the turban monkey.

651
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what I didn't realize is that the Turban Monkey had evolved.

652
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:58,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

653
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I had him in my party.

654
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:00,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Turban Monkey evolved.

655
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:02,205
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to go get another one.

656
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,426
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't evolve unless you give them a treat.

657
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:05,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he was in my party.

658
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:06,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted him to evolve.

659
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize that would fuck up the whole thing.

660
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:08,869
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so adorable.

661
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to feed you.

662
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,991
[SPEAKER_10]: He was so hungry.

663
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:11,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted him.

664
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:12,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't evolve very quickly.

665
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:13,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't feed him after midnight.

666
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:16,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I fed him after midnight, and that was my mistake.

667
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:17,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, that's pretty bad.

668
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have screamed.

669
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have screamed.

670
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:22,519
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I haven't played in a week and a half.

671
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:23,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still punishing the game.

672
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, see, when I do those quests, I usually go out and just do that.

673
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:29,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I consider that kind of one of my grind sessions.

674
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know those... I think it's only come up one at a time in a different town.

675
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the first thing I'll do.

676
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:36,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, oh, this is a good time to grind.

677
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this one quest requires a lot of grinding.

678
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll go out and I'll go tame the three pets.

679
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:42,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'll bring them back.

680
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:44,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And I bring them back right away.

681
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:45,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't realize...

682
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:50,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway, but I didn't know that was something that would mess it up.

683
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:51,577
[SPEAKER_11]: So now it's good to know.

684
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:56,379
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't ever evolve your... I have only evolved the main ones that I use.

685
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:57,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't evolve a lot of them.

686
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I evolve them all.

687
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you hold on to them a little bit, their stats get better and the stats carry over.

688
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability.

689
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:09,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not going to miss anything by evolving them, but then I'll...

690
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:10,125
[SPEAKER_10]: All of all of them.

691
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,582
[SPEAKER_11]: and you do the Coliseum stuff.

692
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I already did the first round of the Coliseum and I beat that.

693
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:38,863
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really hard, but I got through that.

694
00:40:39,023 --> 00:40:40,604
[SPEAKER_10]: The Fencer puppy is really good, right?

695
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Little Fencer?

696
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it a kitty?

697
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:42,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Fencer kitty?

698
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:43,385
[SPEAKER_10]: The kitty, yeah.

699
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:43,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I have that.

700
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:44,546
[SPEAKER_11]: He's pretty good.

701
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I still like my Might.

702
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I look online and people say, oh, the Mighty Might's not that good.

703
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:50,208
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

704
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:50,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I really like him.

705
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:51,769
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a shield.

706
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:52,949
[SPEAKER_11]: He defends really well.

707
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:53,890
[SPEAKER_11]: He blocks a lot of attacks.

708
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I still use him as my main guy's tank.

709
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:56,751
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

710
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:58,071
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:23,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard it's pretty good.

712
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked online, most of the dragons are really good.

713
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:27,354
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to work on that one.

714
00:41:43,251 --> 00:42:02,465
[SPEAKER_10]: you reminded me about names have you really just sat there and read some of the suggested names because every Pokemon that you can pick in the game has like four suggested names and some of them are so fucking funny like the Turban Monkey thing one of the suggested names was Turbangela I died I died some of them are so funny

715
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:03,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to look at that now.

716
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I look at the first one and I always change it.

717
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:08,128
[SPEAKER_11]: No, always cycle through because there's four for each one.

718
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:12,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I named him Toad Bandit because he looked kind of like Toad, but with a bandit mask on.

719
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:13,131
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're Toad Bandit.

720
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:17,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so though, I have to ask this because this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones.

721
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it when you rename them, they keep that name like forever through all of their evolutions?

722
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:25,139
[SPEAKER_03]: But does it still let you know what they originally are?

723
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:27,880
[SPEAKER_10]: You know he's talking Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon, right?

724
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

725
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of Pokemon.

726
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:31,641
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really a lot.

727
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,082
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much the same fucking thing.

728
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:36,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never played Pokemon, but now I'm kind of interested because I'm like, this game's really fun.

729
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I would like Pokemon because I like getting my familiars.

730
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,484
[SPEAKER_11]: I like feeding them.

731
00:42:39,504 --> 00:42:41,365
[SPEAKER_11]: The combat is the totally different part.

732
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

733
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:46,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I look down for a moment and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like, Pokemon?

734
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:56,200
[SPEAKER_11]: To answer your question, even though you didn't ask about this, you can rename them, but it will say what the name of their kind of general familiar is.

735
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,200
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you need to look something up on that, you can.

736
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,461
[SPEAKER_11]: For anyone else who's interested in that.

737
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,301
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was my gaming week.

738
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:03,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Nino Cooney, lots of it.

739
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:03,962
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

740
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:05,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Nino, lots of Cooney.

741
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:05,862
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

742
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:09,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR.

743
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:13,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and on Google Plus as well.

744
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Please consider joining our fan communities.

745
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,046
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll see you next time.

746
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so today Bungie revealed Destiny and they had like a little kind of behind the scenes development video that showed actual, I'm pretty sure no actual gameplay.

747
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:45,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if there was, it was so insignificant that I didn't remember.

748
00:43:47,680 --> 00:44:06,816
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically Destiny is this always on persistent kind of first person shooter adventure I guess where you take on these guardians of kind of one of the last civilizations in the solar system and you kind of

749
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:12,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Venture out to different planets and stuff like that and fight aliens and all sorts of stuff.

750
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:22,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I think originally the description was kind of like a single player co-op and multiplayer game all mixed together all at once.

751
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be interesting.

752
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly how you're going to interact with other people.

753
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:36,310
[SPEAKER_02]: This reminded me, it sounded a lot like Phantasy Star, I guess.

754
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,674
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, whereas that was, you know, Phantasy Star Online.

755
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:41,494
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good way of putting it.

756
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:58,978
[SPEAKER_10]: That is kind of what it sounds like, where it's like you have this central hub type of thing, but you can go out with friends, and I guess they were showing... I actually did watch one of the four-minute videos they put out where they showed how the iPhone, and I'm assuming Android as well, would integrate with it, where you could, like, send messages, like, let's meet up on Venus or something like that.

757
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:00,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

758
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:02,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's meet up on Uranus.

759
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

760
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do some grinding on Uranus.

761
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:11,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark side of Uranus.

762
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:13,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks neat.

763
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:16,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a huge franchise.

764
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a 10-year plan with it.

765
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:18,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to...

766
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:21,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

767
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:21,928
[SPEAKER_10]: 10-year plan?

768
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:25,989
[SPEAKER_10]: The game announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, right?

769
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be probably Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and then probably whatever next-gen consoles also.

770
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:35,552
[SPEAKER_10]: So their 10-year plan is how to get you to buy it three times.

771
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:38,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that really what the 10-year plan consists of?

772
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:40,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to be, right?

773
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:41,373
Uh...

774
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,834
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

775
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:12,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I would imagine there's versions of Destiny in development for these PlayStation 4s and Xbox next to the one.

776
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:16,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that there will be, but it's definitely not going to be just next-gen.

777
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.

778
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Activision's smart enough to know, hey, we're not going to gamble on next-gen right away.

779
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:23,816
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to...

780
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do it like, okay, we're going to put out the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen stuff at the same time.

781
00:46:29,158 --> 00:46:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, if you want the next gen version of the game, you will have it.

782
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:34,099
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a current gen version of the game, you can have that too.

783
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they know that there's a huge install base already.

784
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Why cut out all that money?

785
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:40,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And none for Wii U buy.

786
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard to say with Activision.

787
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:50,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because they've got... They have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit and they even have a few games coming out.

788
00:46:50,585 --> 00:46:50,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Although...

789
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:57,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how excited I'd be getting about re-releasing the amazing Spider-Man.

790
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Xbox 360 version.

791
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that.

792
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Wii U version for The Walking Dead.

793
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:12,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though they did Call of Duty and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U, they're still supporting the Wii.

794
00:47:12,103 --> 00:47:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Activision is a pretty strong supporter of the Wii U right now.

795
00:47:16,824 --> 00:47:28,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe followed up by Ubisoft, although a lot of their games aren't coming to the Wii U. I would see a Wii U version of this coming out.

796
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version, why not?

797
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:31,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It would work.

798
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:34,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you find the lack of PC interesting?

799
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:35,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I sure did.

800
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:37,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little bit.

801
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:41,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the PC is the thing that could evolve over those 10 years.

802
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:42,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And the PC is the one thing that will still be here.

803
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,547
[SPEAKER_10]: As people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes.

804
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:47,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it.

805
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's to say that there's not going to be a PC version for it?

806
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,971
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just kind of like, hey, we're announcing this thing.

807
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:55,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Really say which consoles it's going to be on.

808
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC.

809
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know.

810
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,399
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think about all this?

811
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:07,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, when you watch the, you know, announcements and all that, now that it's kind of out there, what do you think?

812
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:11,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have an opinion that others might not agree with, but what do you think, Loki?

813
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:13,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked neat, but I don't know really much about it yet.

814
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not going to be like, oh my god, Bungie made it, I gotta go buy it!

815
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:20,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't buy, I didn't really buy Halo, I bought Halo 3.

816
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only Halo game I ever owned.

817
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just kind of like, okay, this is hard.

818
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just not like, I don't lose my shit over Bungie games.

819
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna be blunt, a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass.

820
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:33,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, honestly.

821
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:40,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, this whole, like, the video I watched and everything, this whole pomp and circumstance of, this is our big ambition, and da-da-da-da-da.

822
00:48:40,997 --> 00:48:52,582
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, I really felt like half that video was like, well, you know, we made Halo, and, you know, we gotta follow up to that, and Halo was this, and we've poured all our company into this since Halo, and Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo.

823
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:53,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they had to name check Halo.

824
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:55,664
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing that gets me about that.

825
00:48:56,204 --> 00:49:08,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong Halo 2, one of the greatest video games ever made but here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison is that Halo 4, which Bungie didn't do was better than Halo 3 Yes

826
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

827
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,601
[SPEAKER_10]: In many ways it was better than Halo 3.

828
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:14,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Better than Halo 2?

829
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:17,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh, I don't know.

830
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:23,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming was a lot different with all those years in between and Halo 2 really pushed so many things forward in a different way.

831
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:28,647
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, Halo 4, they didn't have anything to do with and it was a better game than what they did at the end of the run.

832
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:29,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

833
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:31,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the only one thinking it, okay?

834
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:38,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So, when they talk about all this Destiny stuff and how much of their Halo influence and all this has to do, I'm kind of like...

835
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:47,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, are they saying that they had one foot out the door when ODST and all this stuff was being done and they were already working on Destiny or what?

836
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,070
[SPEAKER_10]: What stock am I putting into this?

837
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Because really, I felt like all we heard about today was an idea.

838
00:49:53,972 --> 00:49:57,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And although some of it's interesting, like the iPhone integration.

839
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:58,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think.

840
00:49:59,494 --> 00:50:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what this felt like?

841
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:02,316
[SPEAKER_02]: This felt like a Kickstarter video.

842
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:04,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at the very end... Oh my god, yes!

843
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:05,119
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great comparison.

844
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: At the very end, they're gonna like, okay, and now we need you to back this.

845
00:50:08,662 --> 00:50:09,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Go pre-order it.

846
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:11,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We need you to go pre-order it and back the game.

847
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:11,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

848
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:15,600
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a great comparison.

849
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That is really what it felt like.

850
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:18,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It felt like somebody's Kickstarter video.

851
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:22,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, you know, and there was very little gameplay in it.

852
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:24,986
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some gameplay in the trailer that I saw.

853
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:27,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I sort of remember it, but it was, you know.

854
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:29,769
[SPEAKER_10]: The gameplay I saw was nothing new.

855
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing new.

856
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,412
[SPEAKER_10]: But granted, it was three seconds of gameplay.

857
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:34,253
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

858
00:50:55,632 --> 00:51:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing I'm wondering, though, because if you have this coming out, and this is supposed to be like a first-person shooter, let's just say, where are they going to put this as far as in comparison to Call of Duty?

859
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:12,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's going to release with a next-gen console or something like that or around that time, I mean, you're going to... It's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter.

860
00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have Grand Theft Auto in September.

861
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have some massive games in November.

862
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:19,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have another Call of Duty game.

863
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have... It's just, where are they going to put a game of this...

864
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:52,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I don't know it's Activision it's gonna be weird to see them splitting their resources as far as marketing goes between Destiny and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kind of like well Call of Duty is just not quite you know what it used to be we're just gonna kind of back burner that a little bit and just kind of release something that's a slight upgrade and people will buy it and then we'll focus all of our money into this because this is our 10-year deal thing

865
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:58,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

866
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Codeman says, this is the first I've heard of this game.

867
00:52:00,736 --> 00:52:01,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that bad?

868
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:07,898
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because when you really need to hear about the game is just before the game comes out, those week one sales.

869
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:11,359
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is their efforts to get more people talking about it.

870
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:13,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Success, here we are, and now you've been educated on it.

871
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and here's the thing, too.

872
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, why announce it now?

873
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a really weird time to announce it.

874
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:18,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

875
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:18,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

876
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: why not it's an empty floor until E3 why is Sony doing a big announcement next week there's not a lot of other stuff video game things for people to be writing about Sony I think needs something you know because right now you know they don't have any PlayStation I mean they kind of announced their slate of PlayStation 3 titles with The Last of Us and then they've got you know a couple games that I don't think a lot of people care about like Puppeteer and uh was it the uh

877
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:55,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond Two Souls, which Beyond Two Souls looks alright, but let's be honest, that's not going to be this huge... It's still kind of niche, the genre.

878
00:52:56,904 --> 00:53:06,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And then their Puppeteer game, which I gotta be honest, their kids' titles aren't doing very well, or the children's titles, I guess, or younger skewed titles.

879
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, I think they have to really come out with, you know, here's what our game plan is, you guys, you know, stick with us, you know, especially with the Vita, because, holy crap, Vita, there's nothing really announced other than, we know there's that new game from Media Molecule, there's gonna be the Killzone shooter game, and...

880
00:53:26,325 --> 00:53:30,108
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be some type of ace in the hole with the next PlayStation.

881
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:33,071
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know how the next PlayStation will interface with the Vita.

882
00:53:33,171 --> 00:53:35,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it do a Wii U type of thing?

883
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:38,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Because apparently now everybody feels like they have to copy Nintendo.

884
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even a little bit later in the show, but my bar for the PlayStation 4 right now is set so fucking low.

885
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good, though.

886
00:53:48,422 --> 00:53:50,404
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good place for Sony to be in, isn't it?

887
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:54,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they want... I mean, if the bar's low, that's actually good news.

888
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:54,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

889
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:59,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they could really kick your ass with these... But I don't... Here's the thing.

890
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm setting the bar so low because I don't think they're going to hit that even.

891
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just... I don't expect anything from them.

892
00:54:05,564 --> 00:54:07,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... I'm expecting to be kind of like...

893
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

894
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:18,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the other thing too, is remember guys, it's February and the console won't be out until November, I'm sure is a safe bet.

895
00:54:18,606 --> 00:54:19,406
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not delayed.

896
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:20,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

897
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, don't expect them to say a lot.

898
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:42,176
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe we'll get some pictures maybe we'll see a couple of the games but don't expect price don't expect release date don't expect all the bells and whistles expect an idea of what Sony thinks the next generation of gaming is please god do not be Facebook

899
00:54:43,016 --> 00:54:43,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Just don't.

900
00:54:43,877 --> 00:54:45,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

901
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:50,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Social game, I really just... I'm going to get irritated if I hear that word too much.

902
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:55,692
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need some more memes.

903
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:56,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

904
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:58,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more memes.

905
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:00,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is why it's a pre-recorded thing.

906
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco?

907
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:03,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco?

908
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting a Ridge Racer.

909
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting a Ridge Racer game.

910
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:08,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.

911
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a new Ridge Racer game.

912
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:18,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'm going to move on with news from a company we always expect great things from, which had a surprising announcement this week that they actually let some people go.

913
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Valve.

914
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:25,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, apparently up to 25 people were affected by these changes.

915
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:28,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, a lot of this is very vague, but some of this came from a tweet.

916
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:32,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet that said, Yep, got fired today.

917
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Time for new exciting projects.

918
00:55:35,094 --> 00:55:38,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, that was somebody at Valve and was working on hardware.

919
00:55:40,515 --> 00:55:46,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Internet did some more research and found out that part of what she'd been working on was living room PC controllers.

920
00:55:48,257 --> 00:56:15,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Also affected thanks to internet research Director of Business Development Jason Holtman had left the company Some employee pages on Valve site actually changed pretty significantly Very interesting Gabe Newell did end up commenting on this to Engadget Quote, we don't usually talk about personnel matters for a number of reasons There seems to be an unusual amount of speculation about some recent changes here So I thought I'd take the unusual step of addressing them

921
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,649
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we aren't canceling any projects.

922
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,052
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we aren't changing any priorities or projects we've been discussing.

923
00:56:21,472 --> 00:56:24,474
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this isn't about Steam or Linux or hardware or whatever game.

924
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:29,077
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to discuss why anyone in particular is or isn't working here.

925
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:33,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it could have nothing to do with layoffs.

926
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:39,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe something, I mean, it could be a personnel issue, although, I mean, that's a hell of a speculation.

927
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:45,068
[SPEAKER_02]: If, let's just say that he was working on, you know, controllers,

928
00:56:45,908 --> 00:56:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they really need to work on a controller because it's already kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller.

929
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:54,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need another controller?

930
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:54,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this holds the Steam Box.

931
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Steam Box would come with its own controller, obviously.

932
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but whatever.

933
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just use another third-party controller.

934
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:04,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they really need to make another controller.

935
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:08,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use an existing controller or support any controller.

936
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:37,680
[SPEAKER_10]: here's the other thing you know as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes happen at really weird times for reasons because the project is done and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one to another and it's not like the business is always constant there's not projects that go on forever unless I guess maybe Bungie's feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever but if Destiny doesn't do very well if that flops that's gonna be that will hose the whole company but anyway that's neither here nor there um

937
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:40,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Projects start and projects end.

938
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:45,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there's not a new project to go to when one project ends, people are let go.

939
00:57:45,306 --> 00:57:46,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucks, but it happens.

940
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,527
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the game industry.

941
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:53,973
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just weird to hear it coming from Valve because it's like, dude, shouldn't you be working on Half-Life 3?

942
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:57,956
[SPEAKER_10]: But who knows what they have up their sleeve.

943
00:57:57,976 --> 00:57:58,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

944
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:00,137
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be no Half-Life 3.

945
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:01,879
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be waiting forever.

946
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:08,394
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to sell a million of those Steam boxes, just announce two exclusives.

947
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:09,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Announce one exclusive.

948
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:12,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything that ends in three coming out of Valve.

949
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:18,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3.

950
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:23,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of those gets the lead on the Steam box, Steam box will sell more than we do.

951
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:27,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just do the Orange Box 3, Half-Life 2, Episode 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3, and...

952
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:33,688
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll outsell Wii U in like a day.

953
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe like Garry's Mod X3.

954
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:36,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

955
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

956
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:38,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

957
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:39,332
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

958
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:48,147
[SPEAKER_03]: How about something that's a little less frustrating as soon as I can get a stupid iPad to work?

959
00:58:48,868 --> 00:58:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there have been some leaks.

960
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:58,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are kind of, oh, okay, you know, taking it a little bit in stride.

961
00:58:58,613 --> 00:59:05,517
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a few issues that are coming out with the DualShock 4 release image.

962
00:59:06,558 --> 00:59:07,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Who all here has seen it?

963
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:08,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't.

964
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:19,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the controller itself, and the photo, by the way, also shows that that might be a dev kit for the Orbis dev kit.

965
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:36,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're saying that, you know, just on the items pointed out on the controller itself is that there's the two-point multi-touch pad, the move tracking light on the controller itself, the loudspeaker, and a headphone socket.

966
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're talking about what they're seeing on the...

967
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:52,670
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm guessing to be the Orbis dev kit would be a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive, two USB 3.0 slots, and just a number of other things.

968
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,152
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically saying that...

969
00:59:57,117 --> 01:00:02,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be some pretty hardcore material and they have a lot of high hopes for the controller.

970
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:06,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, honestly, I think that that might be a little too much in the controller.

971
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually wondering how much it's going to weigh.

972
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:13,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it's going to come out with all of the things that they're trying to pump into it.

973
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:14,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting.

974
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:16,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It does raise some questions.

975
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:20,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's actually not multi-touch on that touchpad.

976
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:21,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just single.

977
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the rear touchpad from the Vita, isn't it?

978
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, yeah, because the rear one's multi-touch.

979
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:28,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pinch and stuff like that.

980
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:35,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's kind of different about it, though, is they're saying that it's basically going to be used for interfaces and basic stuff.

981
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know why you need it, to be honest.

982
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:42,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, they are reshaping the trigger buttons on there.

983
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:45,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They say they're supposed to be a little bit more springy, like the Xbox 360 stuff.

984
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:54,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely you've all seen the gif of where the little move light is actually a siren and then the little screen is flashing used game, used game, used game.

985
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,545
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the purpose of the screen.

986
01:00:59,166 --> 01:00:59,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The little loudspeaker.

987
01:01:00,586 --> 01:01:02,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So Popo can come get you.

988
01:01:02,307 --> 01:01:06,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the analog sticks, they've got a little difference on the top.

989
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of got a little bit of lip on the edge of the actual sticks themselves so that your thumbs don't fall off of them like they do on the PS3 ones.

990
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:23,357
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that they're saying with this one is actually that they were saying that there wasn't a corresponding touch on the back.

991
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on the front of the controller is where the touch is showing.

992
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:34,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's good because the rear touch on the Vita... Especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller, that would just be irritating.

993
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:50,575
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the other things there's a share button on there that was spotted in the upper left hand corner of the touchpad area that actual speaker spot they're saying might actually be a microphone kind of similar to what's on the Vita I guess

994
01:01:51,656 --> 01:02:07,505
[SPEAKER_10]: or could it maybe pick finally it picks up your voice like there's a built-in cross voice chat thing on PlayStation like there should have been all along it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it had like a built-in you know headset in there where you put your um you know headphones wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your opponent

995
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:09,680
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing.

996
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one goldmine that Wii U is missing.

997
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:14,543
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got this virtual console and all this stuff.

998
01:02:14,883 --> 01:02:18,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't I play games online with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?

999
01:02:18,325 --> 01:02:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

1000
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem, though, is I don't think that would work because if you think about it, there's no camera on the actual controller itself.

1001
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That you can see.

1002
01:02:27,251 --> 01:02:29,173
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think there's actually a camera on there.

1003
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:32,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You would see a camera on that.

1004
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:34,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I want to know.

1005
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:37,923
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got that little bar at the end that's basically supposed to be the move stuff.

1006
01:02:38,023 --> 01:02:42,187
[SPEAKER_02]: How the fuck are you supposed to do that as a move controller?

1007
01:02:42,728 --> 01:02:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable at all.

1008
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:52,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you can use the DualShock 3 for the nunchuck portion, if you will.

1009
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:54,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet there's a way you grip it sideways.

1010
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:58,635
[SPEAKER_10]: You can probably grip it sideways and use your fist.

1011
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that you could probably grip it sideways, but your fingers would want to go over that light because you'd be holding onto the middle of it, and your hand's going to want to go over that sensor in the middle.

1012
01:03:10,398 --> 01:03:11,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think that's a good design.

1013
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: either that or they're going to have a separate move related something and this is going to be more for just like a gestural almost like the six axis was supposed to be I think it's going to be more like that because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve six axis in a way

1014
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:54,059
[SPEAKER_10]: um maybe instead of we need to remember very important you know this is a prototype big word there this will change this is not what the controller is going to look like so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that maybe it could be grippy I'm I'm making shit up there could be other things we don't see on it now these things can and will change they always always do so that's not the final look of that controller

1015
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:57,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't understand what they're going to use that touchpad for.

1016
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:09,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The share button idea, I guess it's kind of neat, but once again, that also kind of scares me because that gets into the whole social gameplay stuff where, oh, I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook.

1017
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:12,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can watch me beat up this hooker.

1018
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:13,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're getting the Ouya, aren't you?

1019
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:16,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?

1020
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:16,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1021
01:04:17,014 --> 01:04:19,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works.

1022
01:04:19,316 --> 01:04:27,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The touchpad on the front of the Ouya, I believe, is multi-touch, and I think that's meant for playing, like, other Android games that would not use the controller.

1023
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:32,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you could actually use that to play Angry Birds or something like that.

1024
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that just seems funky.

1025
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:37,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Even this seems funky to me, because I'm like, how do you translate on a tiny little screen what's going to happen on the...

1026
01:04:38,269 --> 01:04:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That is tough, yeah.

1027
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:44,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as looking at a touch screen where, okay, I can see where my finger is.

1028
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:48,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where I'm hitting, but having it translate.

1029
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:54,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you say that, but then we all use touch pads, so we seem to figure out a way around that.

1030
01:04:55,692 --> 01:05:02,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Black Wolf, host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, name checks Uno in a comment to me.

1031
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:06,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking about have a video camera so other people can watch.

1032
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Uno was a huge selling game.

1033
01:05:09,262 --> 01:05:10,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was because of the camera feature.

1034
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:11,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Was.

1035
01:05:11,523 --> 01:05:12,083
[SPEAKER_10]: What up, G?

1036
01:05:33,817 --> 01:06:00,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony just show what they want the PS4 controller to be and then change big time like the Boomerang did Boomerang is an excellent example of how things can and will change or a perfect example the Zapper controller that they showed at E3 for the Wii that looked fucking amazing and then they put out a piece of plastic shit so works in reverse too it could alright let's move on with more news

1037
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:04,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Nintendo, they had some announcements.

1038
01:06:05,155 --> 01:06:08,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very exciting if you're a 3DS owner.

1039
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:11,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of news for you guys, including game announcements.

1040
01:06:11,778 --> 01:06:14,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced a brand new Mario & Luigi Dream Team.

1041
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a new game in that franchise.

1042
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that's supposed to be coming out for the 3DS.

1043
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:23,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that was supposed to be an eShop title.

1044
01:06:23,581 --> 01:06:24,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was.

1045
01:06:24,082 --> 01:06:25,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's actually a retail title.

1046
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:28,465
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a special deal now if you haven't bought a 3DS.

1047
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:44,461
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy the 3DS XL and Luigi's Mansion or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, you get a free game including Super Mario 3D Land or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask and Star Fox 64 3D and some other games you probably don't want.

1048
01:06:47,623 --> 01:07:12,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Golf World T coming to the 3DS this summer so that's kind of exciting there's a new Mario game Mario and Donkey Kong game more puzzle stuff that's going to be coming to the 3DS eShop as well as a new Dylan's Rolling Western The Last Ranger that's going to be coming out on March 11th which actually that's supposed to be kind of a pretty cool game as well

1049
01:07:14,978 --> 01:07:16,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The Harmony Knight or whatever it was.

1050
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Harmo Knight and Kersplush.

1051
01:07:19,587 --> 01:07:21,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Kersplush is a really weird premise.

1052
01:07:22,392 --> 01:07:25,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a rock thrown down a well?

1053
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:26,890
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1054
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now you can.

1055
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Doom Plague in chat says, was Fire Emblem on that list?

1056
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,411
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem at the Nintendo Direct.

1057
01:07:34,431 --> 01:07:36,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out.

1058
01:07:37,212 --> 01:07:38,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just came out.

1059
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:40,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just came out.

1060
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:44,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS coming out.

1061
01:07:45,073 --> 01:07:46,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, the most important news.

1062
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:53,215
[SPEAKER_02]: June 9th, North America, June 14th in Europe, Animal Crossing New Leaf coming out.

1063
01:07:56,276 --> 01:07:59,317
[SPEAKER_02]: The better question is though, what do they have for the Wii U?

1064
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:02,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And not a whole lot actually.

1065
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,519
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii U, a couple announcements.

1066
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:09,821
[SPEAKER_02]: One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of DLC that's going to be coming out for New Super Mario Bros.

1067
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: U. So that'll be coming out later on.

1068
01:08:14,503 --> 01:08:15,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1069
01:08:32,085 --> 01:08:32,645
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1070
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:35,247
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat because it's something different.

1071
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:37,068
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't really get anywhere else.

1072
01:08:37,188 --> 01:08:38,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is pretty smooth.

1073
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Or on the Vita.

1074
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty smooth experience.

1075
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they have Google Maps on the Vita?

1076
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:42,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's different.

1077
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the whole, like, fact it's got the gyroscope and that you can kind of look around.

1078
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:46,694
[SPEAKER_10]: That you can do it on the Vita?

1079
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:49,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to show it on the Vita.

1080
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you just get the normal maps.

1081
01:08:50,637 --> 01:08:52,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it does the whole sensor.

1082
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:53,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they have the gyroscope stuff.

1083
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even with phones, I think you can do that.

1084
01:08:56,501 --> 01:08:59,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Not on, like, Google Earth on iPhone.

1085
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:00,784
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this operates very differently.

1086
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:28,545
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's all set up so that there's places already bookmarked to go take a look at and stuff the interface is interesting I mean it's neat it's the type of thing you would see as a demo but like you know it's not exactly going to sell any systems or make people feel like ooh there's all this new value in my system I like how they said free for a limited amount of time like someone's really going to buy this one I don't know if I would have paid money for it unless it was really really cheap

1087
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:32,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Luigi DLC DLC

1088
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:52,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the price is on that.

1089
01:09:53,849 --> 01:09:55,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more.

1090
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll see.

1091
01:09:57,392 --> 01:10:01,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Should be careful what I say, but I can't imagine it's going to be as much as you think it is.

1092
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:08,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Also on the Wii U, a new Miiverse community for Zelda!

1093
01:10:09,403 --> 01:10:20,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually watched the Nintendo Direct and they did kind of make a little bit of a deal about this where they're like, it's the first Miiverse community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk about Zelda.

1094
01:10:20,494 --> 01:10:23,557
[SPEAKER_10]: You know it's just going to be a bunch of people with their really creative artwork and so forth.

1095
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:29,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, which I guess it's neat, but it's weird to me that like, it's like, that this is a big deal.

1096
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:34,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have a game behind it.

1097
01:10:34,304 --> 01:10:35,505
[SPEAKER_10]: What a fucking concept.

1098
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

1099
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:39,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing too is like, Daryl, look at, oh, we love your amazing artwork.

1100
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:44,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't you think, you know, of an idea of, hey, how about we put some places where you can showcase that artwork?

1101
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since I could, I'm pretty much going to guess this.

1102
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:51,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Loki, it's, it's showcased when you turn the system on.

1103
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:53,678
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all built into the whole closet.

1104
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:57,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, but I'm just saying, though, that this is basically the equivalent of a forum.

1105
01:10:58,263 --> 01:11:00,845
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it to create a sub-forum in a forum?

1106
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently really difficult for Nintendo engineers.

1107
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:09,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's also not forget, though, that this forum is coming to iPhones, which was a pretty big announcement of the last Nintendo Direct.

1108
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're kind of setting the stage for that.

1109
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:13,078
[SPEAKER_10]: But, again...

1110
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Miiverse, and there's a lot about it I do like, and I've talked about that before when I talked about the Wii U in general, but I don't think this is a game changer.

1111
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:27,992
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a logical next step.

1112
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:30,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my worry, or maybe theory or something...

1113
01:11:32,316 --> 01:11:40,059
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole thing, they're all like, oh, there's a lot of news that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans and 3DS fans.

1114
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:42,660
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so that you guys know there's stuff coming.

1115
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,741
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't really anything for the Wii U, though.

1116
01:11:45,821 --> 01:11:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all 3DS, which makes me wonder, how far away are we from an announcement that the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U gamepad?

1117
01:11:53,704 --> 01:12:00,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have a ton of shit coming out for the 3DS and nothing coming out for the Wii U. It makes perfect sense to say, hey,

1118
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:01,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Two birds, one stone.

1119
01:12:01,844 --> 01:12:02,304
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1120
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:06,010
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't be in 3D, but no one uses the 3D feature anyways.

1121
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:10,237
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just have the top screen up on the TV, bottom screen up on your gamepad.

1122
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:10,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

1123
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:11,600
[SPEAKER_02]: eShop.

1124
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:19,511
[SPEAKER_10]: What gets me is that they did this whole thing about it's the year of Luigi, and they really went all out.

1125
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:26,997
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie, and every little shot of one of their talking heads had a little Luigi doll back there.

1126
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:33,582
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was like, okay, the only Luigi stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion, which we already knew that was a thing, and that was going to be coming.

1127
01:12:33,922 --> 01:12:40,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they say, oh, Luigi's a character in the golf game, and then this Luigi DLC, which is cool, yes, but...

1128
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:43,410
[SPEAKER_10]: to brand it all as the Year of Luigi.

1129
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I was kind of like, yay.

1130
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:49,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you need is a Waluigi versus Luigi game.

1131
01:12:50,596 --> 01:12:55,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just, you know, I don't know, just say we've got Luigi content.

1132
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, whatever.

1133
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes me wonder then when is this new Super Luigi content coming out?

1134
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the Year of Luigi, it's not going to be first half of the year.

1135
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:07,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could be waiting for this crap until fourth quarter.

1136
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

1137
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,071
[SPEAKER_03]: A new Mario is missing.

1138
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:12,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we say the year of Luigi?

1139
01:13:12,173 --> 01:13:13,694
[SPEAKER_10]: We meant the decade of Luigi.

1140
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm just... The eventually.

1141
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:28,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's just, you know, I would have thought that, especially after all these announcements of delays, even some delays by Nintendo, like of their first party titles, that they would have said, hey, you know what?

1142
01:13:28,983 --> 01:13:31,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles being delayed.

1143
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:34,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we have coming so that, you know... But they had nothing.

1144
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:35,668
[SPEAKER_02]: They had nothing...

1145
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:44,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Doom Plague mentions in our chat room the part of the Luigi thing was also a new Mario and Luigi game where you're inside Luigi's dream.

1146
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:49,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yes, I forgot about that, but that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting character to me.

1147
01:13:49,752 --> 01:13:51,033
[SPEAKER_10]: You are inside his dream.

1148
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:53,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be inside Luigi.

1149
01:13:54,154 --> 01:13:56,515
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you Luigi inside Luigi?

1150
01:13:56,535 --> 01:13:56,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not.

1151
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Luigi-ception there.

1152
01:13:59,678 --> 01:14:01,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Mario Inner Space.

1153
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:09,941
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, it's not like, okay, so it's just, these were all things that existed where like, stretch people, we need a theme, people.

1154
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:12,281
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the theme, people?

1155
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street.

1156
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, you know, go inside the dream.

1157
01:14:16,742 --> 01:14:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard.

1158
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:21,723
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pikmin versus Garden Gnomes.

1159
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:28,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego City Stories, Luigi seen Legos.

1160
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:31,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Luigi likes Legos.

1161
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:33,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Luigi likes Legos.

1162
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:36,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

1163
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:38,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

1164
01:14:39,147 --> 01:14:39,907
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both green.

1165
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:40,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1166
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:41,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1167
01:14:41,948 --> 01:14:42,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Green.

1168
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:43,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go with that.

1169
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:44,310
[SPEAKER_02]: The Legend of Luigi.

1170
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:46,210
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1171
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:47,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on with more news.

1172
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:48,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll get to release dates.

1173
01:14:48,452 --> 01:14:48,992
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1174
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And is cheaper and has more games, to be fair.

1175
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But, still, you know, their goal was supposed to be, I think, over $100,000.

1176
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well over that, really.

1177
01:15:28,953 --> 01:15:30,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've completely undersold.

1178
01:15:31,856 --> 01:15:34,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now, they're...

1179
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:47,737
[SPEAKER_03]: They had announced that it sold 3.06 million worldwide as of December.

1180
01:15:48,597 --> 01:15:53,519
[SPEAKER_03]: But now their forecast of 5.5 million has gone down to 4 million worldwide.

1181
01:15:53,839 --> 01:15:55,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet it's going to go down again at the end of this month.

1182
01:15:55,599 --> 01:15:58,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any more systems.

1183
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:58,880
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no games.

1184
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,521
[SPEAKER_02]: There literally is no Wii U games coming out this month.

1185
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:02,221
[SPEAKER_02]: None.

1186
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:16,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they're really probably looking to the handheld market to uphold their console market it gets me though that everybody is crying that it's the death of Nintendo and now Nintendo will be forced to do Mario games on the 360 ha ha ha

1187
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:24,615
[SPEAKER_10]: The unfortunate thing is that this is the exact same fucking thing as the 3DS.

1188
01:16:24,795 --> 01:16:27,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Exact same thing.

1189
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:32,401
[SPEAKER_10]: The 3DS launched with a couple of good games, then literally nothing.

1190
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:35,703
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Ping Pals was a big release on the 3DS.

1191
01:16:35,723 --> 01:16:37,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not on 3DS.

1192
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:38,586
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was regular DS.

1193
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:38,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1194
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Still, you had shit on the 3DS for a long time and then finally they dropped the price and like a couple years later, the 3DS is bomb.

1195
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:52,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully Nintendo can make magic work twice.

1196
01:16:52,712 --> 01:17:00,035
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only danger part is that Nintendo is going to have to work that magic twice and they may have to drop the price of the Wii U in order to do it.

1197
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:01,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe then I'd get one.

1198
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:02,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's awesome.

1199
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:04,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevertheless, they don't have a 3DS, you know, so...

1200
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:31,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Special Year of Luigi Green Wii U I don't want to see a green Wii U I'm wondering what they're going to do with the price Especially when these new consoles launch Because it's going to be tough If they're having trouble getting people to be interested in it now When you have all that buzz of all these awesome games Especially if, God forbid, that Destiny or something like that is not on the Wii U

1201
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:40,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto is on the Wii U. Destiny is on the Wii U. Madden is on the Wii U. I mean, people are going to be like, well, why do I need a Wii U?

1202
01:17:40,463 --> 01:17:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but if Zelda is on the Wii U. I mean, that's all it took for the 3DS.

1203
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:44,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Wind Waker though.

1204
01:17:44,925 --> 01:17:46,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even talking about Wind Waker.

1205
01:17:46,806 --> 01:17:48,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.

1206
01:17:48,187 --> 01:17:49,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, new Zelda game is not coming out this year.

1207
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:54,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year other than Wind Waker HD.

1208
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would be enough for some people, though.

1209
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:07,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Something else to think about, though, is that, well, yeah, what if, okay, all they would have to do, Wind Waker HD comes with one playable HD Zelda level.

1210
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Flying off shelves.

1211
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:10,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Fly it.

1212
01:18:10,742 --> 01:18:12,243
[SPEAKER_10]: You won't be able to find that shit anywhere.

1213
01:18:12,483 --> 01:18:12,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch.

1214
01:18:13,968 --> 01:18:18,291
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders because it had the Metal Gear 2 thing.

1215
01:18:18,431 --> 01:18:22,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo in it that actually wasn't bad and got a sequel.

1216
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:23,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't play Xbox.

1217
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:23,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Crackdown.

1218
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:24,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Crackdown, thank you.

1219
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:25,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what was it?

1220
01:18:25,477 --> 01:18:26,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Alundra.

1221
01:18:26,357 --> 01:18:29,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't it have like the Final Fantasy 7 demo?

1222
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Tobal, number one.

1223
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:30,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobal, Tobal.

1224
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I was saying Alundra.

1225
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Tobal.

1226
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:35,725
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people bought that and all the Dragon Ball fans?

1227
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Tobal had an 8 demo actually in

1228
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:38,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was it.

1229
01:18:38,308 --> 01:18:39,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the eight demo.

1230
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:40,134
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

1231
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:43,965
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, there's a lot of people who will go out and... Or, um... Oh, shoot.

1232
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:44,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1233
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:51,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it one of the games had a Xenogears demo with it too?

1234
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1235
01:18:52,617 --> 01:18:56,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's people who will just buy a game to get the demo of something that they want more.

1236
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:08,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, honestly, and one reason I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now is because once these 3DS games are out, it is all hands on fucking deck for the Wii U. Everybody at Nintendo, first and second parties...

1237
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:09,868
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1238
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:40,340
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're still sitting here next January telling the same tale, then I'll entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo better be cooking up a Mario game for the PlayStation 4.

1239
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:48,524
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, as long as there are people who have little kids they want to play games, they're going to go for a Nintendo system.

1240
01:19:49,044 --> 01:19:56,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has that level of brand recognition and the association that they're working as a kid-friendly, family-friendly system.

1241
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:01,650
[SPEAKER_03]: until the kid falls over and drops the tablet and breaks it.

1242
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

1243
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:09,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They are owning the handheld market, but they may just not be a console... But they weren't!

1244
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't!

1245
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:13,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they weren't, but they may just not be a console company anymore.

1246
01:20:14,357 --> 01:20:16,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean... Too early.

1247
01:20:16,618 --> 01:20:21,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not... I don't want to say I'm Nintendo defending and all this stuff.

1248
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:23,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this.

1249
01:20:23,722 --> 01:20:24,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It is pretty shitty...

1250
01:20:25,043 --> 01:20:27,023
[SPEAKER_10]: that this is having a worse month.

1251
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:29,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these numbers are so bad.

1252
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:31,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It is worse than any month, like the 360.

1253
01:20:31,924 --> 01:20:34,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even think Sega's done that badly.

1254
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:34,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Or PlayStation 3.

1255
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:35,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't go that far.

1256
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Or PlayStation 3 has on record.

1257
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:39,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's bad.

1258
01:20:39,866 --> 01:20:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: What were Dreamcast sales like in their first couple months?

1259
01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:45,126
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point, though.

1260
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a different culture now.

1261
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:53,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there have been people that were drawing comparisons between Sega's last days and Nintendo's.

1262
01:20:54,108 --> 01:21:13,900
[SPEAKER_10]: which is redonkulous I'm sorry it's just that that whole like nay saying whatever like that's like the anti fanboy it's no better but what did game what how well did GameCube do it was third place and Nintendo did fine yeah as long as they're making enough money to keep costs up in the company as long as they're turning a profit or at least breaking even

1263
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:19,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and the handhelds are going to do that for them just fine.

1264
01:21:19,122 --> 01:21:20,843
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll make it just fine.

1265
01:21:20,863 --> 01:21:21,683
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be around.

1266
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,684
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be like Sega.

1267
01:21:23,724 --> 01:21:24,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Sega didn't have that handheld.

1268
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:27,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega also had some stupid marketing.

1269
01:21:28,145 --> 01:21:28,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1270
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:31,607
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had, especially for the Saturn.

1271
01:21:31,707 --> 01:21:33,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, really bad piracy.

1272
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:34,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the downfall of the Dreamcast.

1273
01:21:34,768 --> 01:21:41,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast had an entire CD, you know, spindle of every single burn game.

1274
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And then had their boot discs to play their imports.

1275
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:46,323
[SPEAKER_11]: yep yeah

1276
01:21:48,133 --> 01:22:15,928
[SPEAKER_02]: no comment it's not even close to some people had Parapara on their Dreamcast Rob I don't think that system's done I just think that right now the way they're they're not doing a lot to basically the thing is they're not doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U that they should buy a Wii U that's my thing is that they need to have some sort of like here's what's coming out soon not yeah we're working on a Smash Bros.

1277
01:22:15,968 --> 01:22:16,148
[SPEAKER_02]: game

1278
01:22:16,888 --> 01:22:17,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?

1279
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:22,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have just launched this system and not said anything and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros.

1280
01:22:22,391 --> 01:22:22,611
[SPEAKER_02]: game.

1281
01:22:23,531 --> 01:22:23,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, fuck!

1282
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:26,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say, hey, we're working on an F-Zero game.

1283
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:27,933
[SPEAKER_02]: That would sell a few more systems.

1284
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob would buy another system.

1285
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:29,474
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1286
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:29,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.

1287
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:33,436
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to see the receipts.

1288
01:22:34,137 --> 01:22:35,278
[SPEAKER_10]: You already bought a system, Rob.

1289
01:22:35,338 --> 01:22:36,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I did buy a system.

1290
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:37,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll buy another for F-Zero.

1291
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:38,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I will.

1292
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:39,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I need two gamepads.

1293
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:40,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Two tablet controllers, yeah.

1294
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:41,503
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, one for each hand.

1295
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:42,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a consumer whore.

1296
01:22:43,385 --> 01:22:43,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And how.

1297
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:52,713
[SPEAKER_10]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, package.

1298
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:57,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U.

1299
01:22:57,737 --> 01:22:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1300
01:22:58,417 --> 01:22:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1301
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,358
[SPEAKER_02]: This week we've got a couple big games coming out.

1302
01:23:01,378 --> 01:23:05,940
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one being Crysis 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1303
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:12,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1304
01:23:13,302 --> 01:23:14,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a PSP title.

1305
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's actually a PSP game coming out still.

1306
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:21,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Axis Games putting out visual novels for some reason on the PSP.

1307
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:27,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Hakuoki, Warriors of Shinsengumi on the PSP.

1308
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:29,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play that.

1309
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:39,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And possibly at the end of this week, although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2, the add-on content pack for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1310
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:44,604
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you didn't buy the content stuff or pre-order the game or

1311
01:23:45,177 --> 01:23:49,540
[SPEAKER_10]: or your console isn't online which you'll also be missing out on the next gen systems.

1312
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:55,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm planning on picking one of these up because it allows me to install it in multiple systems and I've got two systems that we play on so it's a lot.

1313
01:23:55,785 --> 01:23:58,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?

1314
01:23:58,227 --> 01:23:58,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm sure.

1315
01:23:58,947 --> 01:23:59,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all on disk.

1316
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:03,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, then I can move on to Japan.

1317
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:07,052
[SPEAKER_10]: On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, some price reductions.

1318
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:18,718
[SPEAKER_10]: The best series for Ace Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z, Ultimate Blast, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Ryuga Gotoku of the End, and Saint Seiya Senkai.

1319
01:24:19,298 --> 01:24:25,382
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as new games go, on February 21st, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance comes out in Japan.

1320
01:24:25,422 --> 01:24:26,102
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome.

1321
01:24:26,702 --> 01:24:28,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?

1322
01:24:29,475 --> 01:24:34,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah Going into the, it's not new Oh, it's a re-release, okay I was like, what?

1323
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, how did I miss this?

1324
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:42,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect 3, also on a price reduction this week in Japan Don't you want to play Mass Effect with all Japanese Garrus?

1325
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:53,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they did the voiceovers again, if the subtitles are I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos to see if the voice is nearly as hot It might be subs, it might not be dubs, we don't know

1326
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:57,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that just looks like the US trailer.

1327
01:24:57,742 --> 01:24:58,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it doesn't.

1328
01:24:59,843 --> 01:25:00,944
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's probably just subs.

1329
01:25:02,425 --> 01:25:02,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

1330
01:25:04,886 --> 01:25:06,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's look at other systems.

1331
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:08,608
[SPEAKER_10]: How about anything on the Xbox 360?

1332
01:25:09,388 --> 01:25:11,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon.

1333
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:12,589
[SPEAKER_10]: You have that to look forward to on the 360.

1334
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:15,611
[SPEAKER_10]: But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think the Wii U's bad here.

1335
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:17,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1336
01:25:19,099 --> 01:25:22,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's another thing people tend to forget, is that, you know... Oh, well, forget it.

1337
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:32,903
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Vita, yes, the Vita in Japan, CL No Surge, Ushina Waeta Hoshi Isasagoshi Reincarnation.

1338
01:25:33,804 --> 01:25:36,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Next Rev Shaoshi Shiken comes out.

1339
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Both new games on the Vita this week.

1340
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:43,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week.

1341
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:43,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know that?

1342
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I want!

1343
01:25:46,028 --> 01:25:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1344
01:25:47,468 --> 01:25:54,253
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Wii U in Japan this week, there is a game, Tank, Tank, Tank, but we've talked about how that game Tank, Tank, Tank before.

1345
01:25:54,833 --> 01:26:00,977
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Magi, Hajimari no Meikyuu comes out from Bandai Namco.

1346
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:03,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.

1347
01:26:05,043 --> 01:26:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: In the UK we have a few things.

1348
01:26:07,184 --> 01:26:10,666
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 21st we have Metal Gear Solid Rising.

1349
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:17,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 22nd there is Crisis 3 and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC.

1350
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:20,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's it.

1351
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me check my calendar.

1352
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:25,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I completely forgot what the last day of the week is.

1353
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:26,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it.

1354
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:27,953
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1355
01:26:28,093 --> 01:26:28,514
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1356
01:26:28,854 --> 01:26:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We're done.

1357
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:55,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki So, we keep hearing a lot about this Xbox Entertainment and this TV initiative that they're doing Well, apparently what they're working on is supposed to be this interactive TV and they're saying similar to how they had the interactive presentations of the Grammys or the Oscars or something like that that it would be some sort of

1358
01:26:56,551 --> 01:26:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pay for that feature.

1359
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1360
01:26:57,532 --> 01:26:58,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not for... No, if it was like Bieber.

1361
01:27:24,778 --> 01:27:26,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing tomatoes would be funny, though.

1362
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:26,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It would.

1363
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends.

1364
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:33,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Release the bees on the beaver.

1365
01:27:33,565 --> 01:27:34,266
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1366
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Push B for Beyonce.

1367
01:27:41,252 --> 01:27:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they could have eye tracking or something like that.

1368
01:27:44,975 --> 01:27:48,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can stare at Katy Perry's breasts the least?

1369
01:27:48,218 --> 01:27:48,518
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1370
01:27:51,735 --> 01:27:51,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Go!

1371
01:27:52,195 --> 01:27:52,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it!

1372
01:27:52,676 --> 01:27:53,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost!

1373
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:54,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Or like camera switching.

1374
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, like during a football game or something.

1375
01:27:57,259 --> 01:27:57,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Enhance!

1376
01:27:58,119 --> 01:27:58,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Enhance!

1377
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Enhance!

1378
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:05,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, during the Grammys, there's one on the stage and one on, you know, like Chris Brown and Adele fighting.

1379
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:07,705
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's another one on Katy Perry's breasts.

1380
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:10,727
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can just watch that cam the whole time, every time she applauds.

1381
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:13,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1382
01:28:13,689 --> 01:28:14,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Rewind.

1383
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:15,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Rewind.

1384
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:19,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Ragenator in chat says, Push A if you want to release the Kraken.

1385
01:28:20,831 --> 01:28:21,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.

1386
01:28:21,753 --> 01:28:24,237
[SPEAKER_10]: How about just one versus a hundred as a network?

1387
01:28:24,498 --> 01:28:24,999
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of shows.

1388
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Could that be the interactive TV?

1389
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:28,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that would be awesome.

1390
01:28:28,445 --> 01:28:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Game shows would rule.

1391
01:28:31,831 --> 01:28:33,874
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not going to hold my breath because that's too good.

1392
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:44,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I would just like to see whatever it is that they're going to come out with and actually have it functioning without them saying, here's what we're going to do.

1393
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:50,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I'm aware, and I know the new season hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit working with goddamn Game of Thrones.

1394
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So why am I supposed to believe that any of this stuff is going to actually work?

1395
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:56,483
[SPEAKER_02]: With smart glass?

1396
01:28:56,724 --> 01:28:56,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1397
01:29:00,598 --> 01:29:03,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's my goddamn interactive map on Android?

1398
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,181
[SPEAKER_10]: How about that smart glass?

1399
01:29:05,361 --> 01:29:05,842
[SPEAKER_10]: How about it?

1400
01:29:05,862 --> 01:29:07,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart glass is fucking useless on Android.

1401
01:29:07,663 --> 01:29:09,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, like, do anything with it.

1402
01:29:10,405 --> 01:29:10,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

1403
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:13,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you install it on.

1404
01:29:13,387 --> 01:29:14,588
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't do anything.

1405
01:29:14,608 --> 01:29:16,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?

1406
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:18,530
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3.

1407
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:20,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1408
01:29:21,997 --> 01:29:24,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Smart Glass is the fucking future, everybody.

1409
01:29:40,225 --> 01:30:09,417
[SPEAKER_10]: the directional pad I've already got three fucking ways or connect why do I need like another way I'm sorry you know what Microsoft is Microsoft is the Fox TV of gaming I don't mean Fox News I mean Fox TV because like they announce this big feature and make a pomp and circumstance of it and then they cancel it after two episodes like seriously they put it in the Friday death slot like XNA Firefly right am I right one versus a hundred Wonderfalls am I right

1410
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:16,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Room What other Fox shows?

1411
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:18,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cleveland show, is that still on the air?

1412
01:30:18,951 --> 01:30:20,312
[SPEAKER_02]: That is still on the air, actually.

1413
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:23,714
[SPEAKER_10]: But Game Room did last a good year or so before they pulled the plug on it.

1414
01:30:23,734 --> 01:30:24,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Running Wild.

1415
01:30:24,695 --> 01:30:27,357
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the show about the town with the lake?

1416
01:30:28,277 --> 01:30:28,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Eureka?

1417
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:31,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Two episodes or something.

1418
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Eureka was on sci-fi.

1419
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I only caught a little bit of that.

1420
01:30:34,882 --> 01:30:35,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now it's NBC, apparently.

1421
01:30:40,105 --> 01:30:42,066
[SPEAKER_10]: would be the network to compare it to.

1422
01:30:42,086 --> 01:30:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that show with the spies and they had like a house or something?

1423
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that.

1424
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that stupid, I don't know.

1425
01:30:50,108 --> 01:30:51,848
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a TV show?

1426
01:30:51,908 --> 01:30:52,628
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

1427
01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:53,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, NBC did that one.

1428
01:30:53,969 --> 01:30:54,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1429
01:30:54,869 --> 01:30:55,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That was another J.J.

1430
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:58,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Or where Jamie gets her name, the Bionic Woman.

1431
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,190
[SPEAKER_10]: That came in with.

1432
01:30:59,210 --> 01:30:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh, yeah.

1433
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:00,430
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an NBC.

1434
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I love the Bionic Woman.

1435
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:03,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Tiger Claw Dollhouse.

1436
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:04,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Game room is Dollhouse.

1437
01:31:04,552 --> 01:31:04,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Dollhouse.

1438
01:31:05,032 --> 01:31:05,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, thank you.

1439
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:06,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Give that a second.

1440
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:06,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Season.

1441
01:31:06,572 --> 01:31:07,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Shadow Next Gen.

1442
01:31:07,433 --> 01:31:09,774
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave that too much.

1443
01:31:09,814 --> 01:31:17,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Room got 13 game packs and it had about 100 games well on its way to that thousands of games they promised at CES.

1444
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousands of games.

1445
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:22,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Thousands of games in my imagination.

1446
01:31:24,404 --> 01:31:26,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Technist Sarah Connor Chronicles.

1447
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:26,626
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are good.

1448
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually a decent show.

1449
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it last like, what, three seasons?

1450
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:32,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Two seasons?

1451
01:31:32,482 --> 01:31:35,924
[SPEAKER_10]: That's better than, you know, we're talking Firefly level stuff.

1452
01:31:35,944 --> 01:31:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It had Shirley Manson in it.

1453
01:31:37,165 --> 01:31:39,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say, anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week.

1454
01:31:45,621 --> 01:31:47,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gay and I still drool over her.

1455
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:49,444
[SPEAKER_10]: She's hot.

1456
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:52,427
[SPEAKER_10]: One more story for you guys.

1457
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how to transition into this story because I'm not gay for GameStop, that's for sure.

1458
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:59,953
[SPEAKER_10]: How about a big burp?

1459
01:32:00,373 --> 01:32:01,915
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop, power to the players.

1460
01:32:01,955 --> 01:32:03,616
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013.

1461
01:32:03,696 --> 01:32:07,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, even though they're closing 250, they're going to open 60 to 70 more.

1462
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:14,885
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just, you know, location moving and as neighborhoods build up, there'll be new ones.

1463
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And purchased.

1464
01:32:16,486 --> 01:32:18,728
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 are coming from UK retailer Game.

1465
01:32:19,168 --> 01:32:21,250
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of those GameStops will be in the UK.

1466
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:40,104
[SPEAKER_10]: A quote from the CFO, Rob Lloyd, if you care, during the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco, quote, "...closing 250 stores enables us to deal with the very small percentage of stores that we have that are unprofitable, but also to close marginally profitable stores and actually make more money by moving customers to other nearby stores."

1467
01:32:40,484 --> 01:32:43,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been successful at that for two years and we'll continue that program in 2013.

1468
01:32:43,746 --> 01:32:50,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's because a lot of these they took over like, you know, the EB games and stuff like that in the same mall.

1469
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:54,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, or like literally you have like a GameStop and then across the street another GameStop.

1470
01:32:56,131 --> 01:32:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while.

1471
01:32:58,292 --> 01:33:08,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh, yeah, so, I mean, I think if you, you know, again, if you're in an unprofitable location or a redundant location, then you're probably in trouble, but I imagine most stores will be okay.

1472
01:33:09,135 --> 01:33:16,898
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, then CNN, or Fox News, since I mentioned them earlier, picks up a story like this and, oh, console gaming is dead, y'all.

1473
01:33:17,378 --> 01:33:18,518
[SPEAKER_10]: console gaming is dead.

1474
01:33:18,538 --> 01:33:20,239
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop is closing their doors.

1475
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:25,881
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out that their games that they sell are causing people to become murderers.

1476
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1477
01:33:26,662 --> 01:33:27,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proof right there.

1478
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,882
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's mobile phones.

1479
01:33:29,063 --> 01:33:30,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody wants to play Smurf Village.

1480
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:31,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Haven't you heard?

1481
01:33:32,104 --> 01:33:32,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Mobile phone.

1482
01:33:32,744 --> 01:33:33,484
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Temple Run.

1483
01:33:33,864 --> 01:33:34,505
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gaming.

1484
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Smurf Village is just code for terrorism, okay?

1485
01:33:40,171 --> 01:33:41,432
[SPEAKER_03]: See, now I have... The terrorist of one.

1486
01:33:41,452 --> 01:33:47,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is the mental image I'm seeing now is the Clicovision Smurfs with, you know, AKs shooting Gargamel in the face.

1487
01:33:49,983 --> 01:33:51,183
[SPEAKER_03]: My childhood has been raped.

1488
01:33:52,144 --> 01:33:55,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, all I have to say to this news is LOL bye.

1489
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:58,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to the people that work there.

1490
01:33:58,286 --> 01:34:03,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living, but the corporation itself is kind of terrible.

1491
01:34:03,348 --> 01:34:09,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope that where the ashes land from old GameStops, a new indie retailer will emerge.

1492
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:10,971
[SPEAKER_10]: One can at least dream.

1493
01:34:11,231 --> 01:34:16,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, playing trade, now is your chance to actually become like GameStop since you think you are anyways.

1494
01:34:18,803 --> 01:34:21,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they have a very similar logo, too?

1495
01:34:22,085 --> 01:34:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That's GameTrader.

1496
01:34:24,587 --> 01:34:30,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they actually think that they're like a GameStop, and they kind of try to push themselves that way.

1497
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:32,292
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, we've got all these stores.

1498
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:38,056
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually haven't expanded in a long time.

1499
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:43,260
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's take a step back to a simpler time, you guys.

1500
01:34:44,426 --> 01:34:47,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go back to a time where GameStop actually had competition.

1501
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:50,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Or back when GameStop wasn't even GameStop yet.

1502
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:51,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Babbage's.

1503
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:54,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Funkoland, Software Etc.

1504
01:34:55,722 --> 01:35:00,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Back before they were just all swallowed whole by GameStop.

1505
01:35:01,716 --> 01:35:02,977
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the classic game of the week.

1506
01:35:03,138 --> 01:35:05,480
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, take us back to simpler times.

1507
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:08,923
[SPEAKER_03]: The game of the week is Sinistar.

1508
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:20,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinistar came out by Williams in 1982 and it was a pretty neat little game.

1509
01:35:21,756 --> 01:35:25,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of, though, for me, I'm not very good at it, but I'll just keep going.

1510
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:29,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you are in a spacecraft and you have to create Cinnabons.

1511
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinnabon?

1512
01:35:31,067 --> 01:35:31,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Cinnabon!

1513
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:32,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Cinnabon!

1514
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:35,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinebombs

1515
01:36:00,023 --> 01:36:03,625
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to shoot at planetoids and get the crystals that are released.

1516
01:36:04,145 --> 01:36:09,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to use the bombs to defeat Sinistar, who is this huge spacecraft with a skull face.

1517
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:15,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it's constantly under construction as you're going through the game.

1518
01:36:15,089 --> 01:36:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of like the Death Star, but without being the Death Star.

1519
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:23,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, beware, I live.

1520
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid.

1521
01:36:30,286 --> 01:36:32,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I hunger for Cinnabons!

1522
01:36:32,228 --> 01:36:35,890
[SPEAKER_09]: That does sound pretty awesome.

1523
01:36:36,971 --> 01:36:37,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1524
01:36:38,452 --> 01:36:40,133
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy wants his fuckin' Cinnabon.

1525
01:36:40,733 --> 01:36:47,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, so is this like actually CineStar or is this like, you know, recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live?

1526
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,062
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the guy that goes to the airport to get Cinnabon, okay?

1527
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:57,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can I get back to the review, please?

1528
01:36:58,315 --> 01:37:04,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So once Sinistar is formed, as we heard, the digitized voice pops up, who's actually a radio personality, John Doremus.

1529
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's played through an HD 55516 CVSD decoder.

1530
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:10,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1531
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:12,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Says, I hunger coward.

1532
01:37:14,133 --> 01:37:17,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it tells you run, run, run, but how would you run in space?

1533
01:37:17,696 --> 01:37:19,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it just be fly like a little bitch?

1534
01:37:20,638 --> 01:37:20,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1535
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:21,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1536
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, if, uh, basically it just eats you.

1537
01:37:27,264 --> 01:37:32,968
[SPEAKER_03]: All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinebombs to satiate the Sinistar.

1538
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:36,371
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs that cinnamon sugary goodness.

1539
01:37:37,712 --> 01:37:43,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So you move from zone to zone and keep, you know, beating Sinistar because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker.

1540
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:14,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So also, you know, of course, the CineStar can be repaired by its little drone fuckers unless you satiate him with tasty CineBombs.

1541
01:38:16,178 --> 01:38:18,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there were different ports.

1542
01:38:18,261 --> 01:38:19,722
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the Atari 2600, the 8-bit computers...

1543
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:29,331
[SPEAKER_03]: They were almost done, but there was the video game crash, and they're like, no.

1544
01:38:29,912 --> 01:38:36,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually got it on the Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for SNES, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC.

1545
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:46,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures on Xbox, GameCube, and PS2, and then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play for the PSP in 2005.

1546
01:38:46,707 --> 01:38:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1547
01:38:48,328 --> 01:38:48,768
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1548
01:39:06,725 --> 01:39:14,631
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as other versions that have come out, there was a pseudo-sequel on the PC in 1999 called Sinistar Unleashed.

1549
01:39:15,732 --> 01:39:22,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It had nothing to do with the original creators, but it was supposed to be a pretty neat little game.

1550
01:39:22,377 --> 01:39:27,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Sinistar got re-released for the Midway's Greatest Arcade.

1551
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Hits on the Game Boy Advance without the cool features.

1552
01:39:33,685 --> 01:39:42,030
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a lot of other little... Because, I mean, Sinistar is really just, you know, a big part of classic gaming.

1553
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:42,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in...

1554
01:39:44,585 --> 01:39:48,888
[SPEAKER_03]: There was... I'm trying to see if I can find it.

1555
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for Team Fortress 2, the heavy weapons guy says, I live and run, cowards.

1556
01:39:55,893 --> 01:40:00,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Sinistar is in one of the Dresden Files books.

1557
01:40:01,337 --> 01:40:08,321
[SPEAKER_03]: A group of students at the College of William and Mary did a musical version called Sinistar the Musical.

1558
01:40:09,502 --> 01:40:10,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to find this now.

1559
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they used the voice of Sinistar in an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!

1560
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,001
[SPEAKER_03]: The Abridged Series.

1561
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:23,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a web series that I've been introduced to.

1562
01:40:23,662 --> 01:40:25,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Sinistar.

1563
01:40:25,223 --> 01:40:25,983
[SPEAKER_03]: This sequel.

1564
01:40:26,284 --> 01:40:26,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Beware!

1565
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:28,845
[SPEAKER_10]: When he wants Cinnabons, he wants over 9,000!

1566
01:40:29,145 --> 01:40:32,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't help myself.

1567
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's listen to some of the voice.

1568
01:40:35,427 --> 01:40:36,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's listen to some pain.

1569
01:40:36,528 --> 01:40:36,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1570
01:40:36,628 --> 01:40:36,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1571
01:40:44,759 --> 01:40:46,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You throw those Cinebombs at him.

1572
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:47,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You go ship.

1573
01:40:48,561 --> 01:40:49,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to play this now.

1574
01:40:49,402 --> 01:40:50,022
[SPEAKER_11]: This sounds awesome.

1575
01:40:50,242 --> 01:40:51,843
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1576
01:40:52,124 --> 01:40:54,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Beware, I live.

1577
01:40:54,165 --> 01:40:55,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Cinestar.

1578
01:40:56,206 --> 01:40:57,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Available in arcades everywhere.

1579
01:40:59,312 --> 01:41:00,713
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can find them in business.

1580
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:01,574
[SPEAKER_10]: If you live in 1982.

1581
01:41:02,495 --> 01:41:03,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's available in Bobby's Arcade.

1582
01:41:04,336 --> 01:41:04,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1583
01:41:07,218 --> 01:41:09,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to have caught Bobby's show to get the reference.

1584
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,862
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1585
01:41:11,942 --> 01:41:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And geez, Ranchan, you're fast on the posting.

1586
01:41:15,764 --> 01:41:17,065
[SPEAKER_10]: He's managing the tumblers very well.

1587
01:41:17,085 --> 01:41:18,066
[SPEAKER_03]: He's managing the tumbler quite well.

1588
01:41:18,086 --> 01:41:19,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to give a shout out to the OLR Tumbler?

1589
01:41:19,547 --> 01:41:26,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The OLR Tumbler is orangeloungeradio.tumbler.com And while you're at it, look at my Mass Effect one.

1590
01:41:29,099 --> 01:41:31,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't your Mass Effect one more popular than the Orange Lounge Radio one?

1591
01:41:32,401 --> 01:41:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1592
01:41:32,922 --> 01:41:34,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So you don't need the help.

1593
01:41:35,123 --> 01:41:35,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll repost it.

1594
01:41:36,444 --> 01:41:37,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show some promo love.

1595
01:41:37,965 --> 01:41:38,625
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll tumble it?

1596
01:41:38,765 --> 01:41:41,307
[SPEAKER_03]: When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game.

1597
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:43,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to happen.

1598
01:41:43,268 --> 01:41:45,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for the last episode of OLR that'll happen.

1599
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Last episode.

1600
01:41:46,971 --> 01:41:48,172
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to have a last episode.

1601
01:41:48,192 --> 01:41:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this until we're dead.

1602
01:41:50,473 --> 01:41:52,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then there would be a final episode, wouldn't there?

1603
01:41:52,695 --> 01:41:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly.

1604
01:41:55,678 --> 01:41:56,940
[SPEAKER_10]: This is morbid.

1605
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like where this is going.

1606
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:00,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Beware!

1607
01:42:00,243 --> 01:42:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I die!

1608
01:42:01,684 --> 01:42:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me Cinnabons!

1609
01:42:03,406 --> 01:42:04,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob ate one too many Cinnabons.

1610
01:42:04,728 --> 01:42:05,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Be dead.

1611
01:42:08,403 --> 01:42:10,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's remember with the theme from Mass Effect.

1612
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:11,966
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1613
01:42:12,766 --> 01:42:14,427
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for the Classic Game of the Week.

1614
01:42:14,467 --> 01:42:19,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said that three times now, so I swear we're done with Part A. Don't go anywhere, because this show is so much fun.

1615
01:42:20,031 --> 01:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got plenty more coming in Part B, including the Fugle Question of the Week, a very interesting patent name, something that Sony did, and, oh God, somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news.

1616
01:42:30,058 --> 01:42:32,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, there is news, and yes, it is legit.

1617
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Information on Mass Effect.

1618
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:39,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming up after this break, more of Orange Lounge Radio up next.

1619
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:49,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1620
01:42:49,483 --> 01:42:53,903
[SPEAKER_10]: In progress, our 493rd episode, February the 17th of 2013.

1621
01:42:55,564 --> 01:43:12,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you've never been to Orange Lounge Radio as we are live, you should join us sometime Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where you can hear such live antics as Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break when some quiet music is playing so people can hear what we're saying.

1622
01:43:12,727 --> 01:43:13,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Just barely though.

1623
01:43:14,748 --> 01:43:15,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

1624
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:15,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

1625
01:43:16,568 --> 01:43:18,169
[SPEAKER_10]: See, at least we weren't talking any smack.

1626
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:20,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was just more Nino Cooney talk.

1627
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:22,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was Nino Cooney talk and Rob, coffee.

1628
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:25,511
[SPEAKER_10]: And birthday cake Oreos.

1629
01:43:25,871 --> 01:43:26,751
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really all you missed.

1630
01:43:26,811 --> 01:43:27,071
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1631
01:43:27,592 --> 01:43:28,012
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1632
01:43:28,492 --> 01:43:31,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, it's the Flacco Jones curse taking its course.

1633
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:34,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's going to get, I guess I'll take it.

1634
01:43:34,854 --> 01:43:35,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take that.

1635
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:36,494
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not so bad.

1636
01:43:37,035 --> 01:43:38,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless, like, I was talking smack or something.

1637
01:43:38,935 --> 01:43:44,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I was sitting here going, like, oh, that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight, I can't even.

1638
01:43:44,617 --> 01:43:45,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1639
01:43:45,318 --> 01:43:47,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week.

1640
01:43:49,521 --> 01:43:51,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Aliens Colonial Marines.

1641
01:43:51,403 --> 01:43:52,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all his fault.

1642
01:43:53,705 --> 01:43:54,606
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't warn me.

1643
01:43:56,127 --> 01:43:56,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, Bobby?

1644
01:43:56,948 --> 01:43:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1645
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:00,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never.

1646
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:00,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never.

1647
01:44:01,272 --> 01:44:01,612
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1648
01:44:02,633 --> 01:44:05,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

1649
01:44:06,076 --> 01:44:06,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Rapid fire news time.

1650
01:44:07,157 --> 01:44:07,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1651
01:44:07,397 --> 01:44:07,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1652
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:19,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So EA and Zynga settled their lawsuits over the Ville, which was ripping off Sims Social, and of course we don't know any of the details of what they settled for, but it's settled and that's over.

1653
01:44:20,873 --> 01:44:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

1654
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:27,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping for a long, drawn-out fist fight.

1655
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted it to be Judge Judy solved.

1656
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:31,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted it to go to Judge Judy.

1657
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:33,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1658
01:44:33,992 --> 01:44:38,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't sit there and tell me you didn't know what you're doing.

1659
01:44:39,896 --> 01:44:48,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2 on PC, the multiplayer support has been extended thanks to, you know, begging from fans.

1660
01:44:48,862 --> 01:44:52,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, it was going to be cutting the servers off on, was it a...

1661
01:44:53,965 --> 01:45:04,771
[SPEAKER_02]: February 15th, but apparently now it's been extended to June and they're investigating further options to support the fans of the Halo 2 on PC.

1662
01:45:04,871 --> 01:45:05,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

1663
01:45:07,612 --> 01:45:12,415
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good news for the dozens and dozens of people still playing Halo 2 on PC.

1664
01:45:12,715 --> 01:45:14,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, who do you think has more?

1665
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:17,837
[SPEAKER_10]: More people playing Halo 2 on PC or more people that listens to OLR?

1666
01:45:18,538 --> 01:45:19,078
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

1667
01:45:19,658 --> 01:45:19,978
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR.

1668
01:45:20,999 --> 01:45:21,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1669
01:45:21,819 --> 01:45:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to go for Halo.

1670
01:45:23,303 --> 01:45:39,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, yeah, I mean, with all, you know, all kidding aside, Halo 2, I mean, it's the only place you can play it since, you know, they shut down the Xbox 360, or excuse me, Xbox regular one because of 360 infrastructure that they never really followed through on.

1671
01:45:41,112 --> 01:45:44,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than 100 people on our friends list?

1672
01:45:44,533 --> 01:45:44,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

1673
01:45:45,234 --> 01:45:45,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

1674
01:45:47,881 --> 01:45:57,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, Sniper Elite has a brand new game in their franchise, and going the route of most other game franchises out there, they've decided to add zombies.

1675
01:45:57,371 --> 01:46:02,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is going to be coming out exclusively on PC.

1676
01:46:02,035 --> 01:46:07,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be out on Steam for $15, and that's at the end of this month on the 28th.

1677
01:46:09,022 --> 01:46:12,524
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite, it's a World War II sniper game.

1678
01:46:13,104 --> 01:46:18,687
[SPEAKER_02]: In the second Sniper Elite game, you actually got to shoot the balls off of Hitler if you wanted to.

1679
01:46:20,948 --> 01:46:26,030
[SPEAKER_02]: They even had the cool Mortal Kombat x-ray mode thing where you could see the testicles explode.

1680
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:27,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's so lovely.

1681
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:30,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.

1682
01:46:30,972 --> 01:46:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And in case you didn't get that game, they actually are re-releasing the Sniper Elite V2 with the Kill Hitler...

1683
01:46:38,824 --> 01:46:45,668
[SPEAKER_02]: DLC in there, which it should really be teamed up with Danger 5, you know, because their mission is to kill Hitler.

1684
01:46:45,908 --> 01:46:50,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is apparently the show this week where people can hear about exploding Hitler's balls.

1685
01:46:51,491 --> 01:46:52,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I only had one.

1686
01:46:55,013 --> 01:46:55,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1687
01:46:57,054 --> 01:46:57,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

1688
01:46:58,054 --> 01:46:58,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Please be it.

1689
01:46:58,394 --> 01:46:58,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1690
01:46:58,734 --> 01:46:59,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's it.

1691
01:47:00,315 --> 01:47:02,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to something a lot less offensive.

1692
01:47:02,717 --> 01:47:05,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Bit.Trip, the Bit.Trip series.

1693
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:08,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Bit.Trip soundtracks for $20.

1694
01:47:10,602 --> 01:47:20,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you pre-order with that $20, the Bit.Trip Runner 2 Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, you will get six Bit.Trip soundtracks for free.

1695
01:47:20,289 --> 01:47:22,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Although they're not really free because you're paying $20 for it.

1696
01:47:22,851 --> 01:47:26,153
[SPEAKER_10]: But pretty cool, you know, if you are a fan of Bit.Trip Runner.

1697
01:47:26,253 --> 01:47:27,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, if you're not Bobby...

1698
01:47:27,802 --> 01:47:36,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, is that like kind of how they try to sell you two pieces of crap on TV and really the whole trick is just to get you to pay twice as much for more than one that you need?

1699
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:40,792
[SPEAKER_10]: The trick is to get you to pre-order a bit, trip around or two and boost its numbers.

1700
01:47:41,263 --> 01:47:43,384
[SPEAKER_10]: But the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good.

1701
01:47:43,424 --> 01:47:48,926
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like the 8-bit music and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff, you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks.

1702
01:47:49,226 --> 01:47:53,988
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I imagine most of you have acquired the soundtracks if you're a fan of the series.

1703
01:47:54,088 --> 01:47:56,029
[SPEAKER_10]: But wouldn't it be nice to get them legally?

1704
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:58,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can do that here for $20.

1705
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:58,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Pre-ordered.

1706
01:48:03,614 --> 01:48:03,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1707
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:11,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I guess apparently you can get some of the soundtracks for $1, and then $10 you get the Runner 2 soundtrack as well.

1708
01:48:12,216 --> 01:48:12,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look at that.

1709
01:48:14,556 --> 01:48:15,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

1710
01:48:16,296 --> 01:48:20,317
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a game coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive version of said game.

1711
01:48:20,357 --> 01:48:22,158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Need for Speed Most Wanted.

1712
01:48:22,818 --> 01:48:29,879
[SPEAKER_10]: This game came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 last year, but it's coming out on the Wii this year.

1713
01:48:30,819 --> 01:48:58,523
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's going to have some new stuff in it such as the whole you can actually have the off TV mode on the gamepad but then there's something about on the gamepad you can actually help somebody that's playing on the big screen you can guide them you can help them or you can either hinder them they're calling it a co-driver father and son mode is something that they've called it amongst the Criterion developers you can literally have a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your shit up on that gamepad

1714
01:48:58,919 --> 01:48:59,339
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1715
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:29,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be taking over.

1716
01:49:30,103 --> 01:49:31,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Into the wall.

1717
01:49:31,884 --> 01:49:32,424
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1718
01:49:32,485 --> 01:49:36,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me see a quote from Alexander Ward, creative director.

1719
01:49:36,548 --> 01:49:36,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote,

1720
01:49:53,001 --> 01:49:59,745
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Wii U, I got the impression that you were going to have two people playing at the same time.

1721
01:49:59,965 --> 01:50:01,526
[SPEAKER_10]: One on the gamepad, one on the TV.

1722
01:50:01,827 --> 01:50:02,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you can do that.

1723
01:50:02,507 --> 01:50:03,748
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounded a lot better.

1724
01:50:04,128 --> 01:50:04,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can do that, too.

1725
01:50:04,948 --> 01:50:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.

1726
01:50:05,489 --> 01:50:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is another mode.

1727
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:20,278
[SPEAKER_02]: They should really have it just like passenger mode, where your gamepad is like the side window, and you can roll it up and down, and that's it, and the wind blows in your face, and that's all you can really do, is just look out the window and roll the window up and down.

1728
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:20,800
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1729
01:50:26,542 --> 01:50:28,804
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1730
01:50:56,164 --> 01:50:57,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, coffee!

1731
01:50:58,765 --> 01:51:05,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And every time we drove by a Starbucks, which when you're on Highway 99 is every five miles, Dan, coffee!

1732
01:51:07,909 --> 01:51:08,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So Rob, where's your phone?

1733
01:51:08,789 --> 01:51:09,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, shut up.

1734
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:13,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So finally, finally we get to a Starbucks.

1735
01:51:13,831 --> 01:51:15,091
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like halfway to Disneyland.

1736
01:51:15,131 --> 01:51:23,935
[SPEAKER_10]: We finally pull over at a Starbucks and she gets her coffee and I proceed to leave my cell phone in the sandwich shop except, oh, it was actually in my back pocket the whole time.

1737
01:51:25,622 --> 01:51:29,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know when knowing is half the battle.

1738
01:51:29,986 --> 01:51:32,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't you glad she asked me to tell that story?

1739
01:51:32,408 --> 01:51:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ask you to tell the story.

1740
01:51:33,689 --> 01:51:34,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that people don't get it.

1741
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:36,832
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could delay this news.

1742
01:51:37,512 --> 01:51:44,058
[SPEAKER_10]: The 3DS has become the best gaming machine out there is a attention-grabbing headline that was run on Kotaku this week.

1743
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:47,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, how many articles do they write about hating Aliens Colonial Marines?

1744
01:51:47,142 --> 01:51:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

1745
01:51:48,003 --> 01:51:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it in the double digits?

1746
01:51:49,565 --> 01:51:50,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it was.

1747
01:52:03,005 --> 01:52:30,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly I was this story was something that was shared with us in the show role thread by somebody else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview with somebody but no it actually is just a whole story written about hey the 3D remember when the 3DS was fucked and now look at all this stuff it's just basically regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News that had already been run but now under the guise of this is why the 3DS is the best fucking game system

1748
01:52:32,182 --> 01:52:41,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering that they're talking handheld game system, there's really only a couple to choose from, one of them being the 3DS and one of them being the Vita.

1749
01:52:41,957 --> 01:52:45,403
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's really going to make the argument that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system out there.

1750
01:52:48,843 --> 01:52:49,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tapping my finger.

1751
01:52:49,644 --> 01:52:50,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I want to go there?

1752
01:52:50,945 --> 01:52:53,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I want to go behind door number four on OLR?

1753
01:52:53,146 --> 01:52:56,209
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1754
01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:57,390
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1755
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:59,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it has reach around, then it's shit.

1756
01:53:00,132 --> 01:53:01,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I have another rant brewing.

1757
01:53:01,313 --> 01:53:02,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I want to go there?

1758
01:53:02,434 --> 01:53:02,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it, Rob.

1759
01:53:02,954 --> 01:53:03,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

1760
01:53:03,154 --> 01:53:03,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

1761
01:53:03,535 --> 01:53:03,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama.

1762
01:53:03,895 --> 01:53:04,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go there.

1763
01:53:04,996 --> 01:53:06,797
[SPEAKER_10]: This website is such shit.

1764
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:09,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does everybody keep reading it?

1765
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Here I am talking about it, and it's going to be more people checking it.

1766
01:53:12,982 --> 01:53:41,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking can't why do we keep bringing this fucking shitty website up all of the time and why does their attention grabbing antics work all of the time I can't anymore I do not want any stories from this website ever again on our show we are better than this done banned I'm serious do not link this website ever again for a new story there are better places on the internet to get your gaming news

1767
01:53:42,043 --> 01:53:44,465
[SPEAKER_11]: They just grab all the stories from other people anyway.

1768
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:47,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go to the site, click the link that they got, and then use that one.

1769
01:53:48,807 --> 01:53:50,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I am taking a stand here.

1770
01:53:50,348 --> 01:53:52,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not giving these fuckers hits anymore.

1771
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:54,471
[SPEAKER_10]: It is ridiculous.

1772
01:53:57,393 --> 01:53:57,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1773
01:53:57,893 --> 01:53:58,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1774
01:53:58,654 --> 01:53:58,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Coffee.

1775
01:54:00,395 --> 01:54:01,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I might need another cup.

1776
01:54:03,437 --> 01:54:05,198
[SPEAKER_10]: How about some more news stories, DarkSakura?

1777
01:54:06,391 --> 01:54:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega!

1778
01:54:07,593 --> 01:54:08,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, I love you, Sega.

1779
01:54:09,696 --> 01:54:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega has a line of PCs.

1780
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:14,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Sega Note PC Laptop.

1781
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:16,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have different styles.

1782
01:54:16,406 --> 01:54:19,831
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the generic Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn, and the Dreamcast.

1783
01:54:21,269 --> 01:54:24,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're anywhere between $1,000 to $2,100.

1784
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll come with the 64-bit version of Windows 8, a 1920x1080 display, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and a Pentium 2020M processor.

1785
01:54:44,034 --> 01:54:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, and it will be obsolete in five seconds.

1786
01:54:48,077 --> 01:54:48,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1787
01:54:48,658 --> 01:54:49,519
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some Square?

1788
01:54:50,379 --> 01:54:57,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Square actually registered Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain domains.

1789
01:54:58,506 --> 01:55:11,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we're going to see some re-releases or reboots, but there's Wolfensteinspiel.com and WarFornosGoth.com So, who knows?

1790
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:13,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game.

1791
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's done in Wolfenstein 3D fashion.

1792
01:55:17,923 --> 01:55:19,404
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3D ones never were very good.

1793
01:55:21,325 --> 01:55:22,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the little sound they make.

1794
01:55:24,427 --> 01:55:26,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, with the digitized voices.

1795
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:28,870
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1796
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:30,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just remembering.

1797
01:55:32,513 --> 01:55:36,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that that game, actually, when they did the re-releases with that one, it's actually, like, banned in Switzerland.

1798
01:55:38,323 --> 01:55:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina Turner cannot play Wolfenstein now in her new home country.

1799
01:55:44,929 --> 01:55:45,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that woman.

1800
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:47,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure she's crushed.

1801
01:55:48,332 --> 01:55:57,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, last but not least, you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been trying to ignore because Axl Rose pretty much has been?

1802
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:04,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it got thrown out of fraud court, so not a big deal anymore.

1803
01:56:05,066 --> 01:56:06,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl sucks.

1804
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:07,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

1805
01:56:07,107 --> 01:56:08,389
[SPEAKER_02]: He's attached to what?

1806
01:56:08,429 --> 01:56:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That new BandFuse game that's coming out.

1807
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:14,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, BandFuse, the one that's going to try to do the same thing that what PowerGig tried to do.

1808
01:56:16,255 --> 01:56:18,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember PowerGig, right?

1809
01:56:18,617 --> 01:56:20,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember PowerGig.

1810
01:56:20,778 --> 01:56:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

1811
01:56:21,699 --> 01:56:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So BandFuse, the new Mastiff music game is going to be coming out.

1812
01:56:24,962 --> 01:56:27,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing.

1813
01:56:27,464 --> 01:56:32,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the difference with this one was it's real guitar and you can sing.

1814
01:56:34,082 --> 01:56:35,443
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really it.

1815
01:56:36,144 --> 01:56:36,605
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1816
01:56:36,645 --> 01:56:37,886
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do that with Beatles Rock Band.

1817
01:56:40,128 --> 01:56:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not a real guitar, though.

1818
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:43,291
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but no one cares.

1819
01:56:43,351 --> 01:56:46,274
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also probably going to sell immensely more than band fees.

1820
01:56:50,678 --> 01:56:51,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that it?

1821
01:56:51,559 --> 01:56:51,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That was...

1822
01:56:53,126 --> 01:56:54,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit.

1823
01:56:55,568 --> 01:56:57,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I was chatting with chatter.

1824
01:56:57,689 --> 01:56:58,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I was participating.

1825
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:02,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of another one.

1826
01:57:02,192 --> 01:57:05,914
[SPEAKER_10]: My extended hate boner was spewing into the chat room.

1827
01:57:06,314 --> 01:57:07,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Your hate boner.

1828
01:57:08,556 --> 01:57:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's show has been brought to you by the words hate and boner.

1829
01:57:12,418 --> 01:57:17,001
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear the words hate boner used in tandem, be sure to make a special noise.

1830
01:57:20,721 --> 01:57:26,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to a segment that never makes us make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners have to say in the Google Question of the Week.

1831
01:57:32,782 --> 01:57:37,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus community.

1832
01:57:37,663 --> 01:57:42,484
[SPEAKER_10]: You can participate with a question that we ask of our fan communities each week on the program.

1833
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:45,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting off with this week's question.

1834
01:57:46,305 --> 01:57:50,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It was announced today that the new game Destiny will require a persistent internet connection.

1835
01:57:51,325 --> 01:57:59,487
[SPEAKER_10]: On previous episodes, OLR and Bobby have talked about other games that require an always online internet connection, such as Diablo 3 and the new SimCity.

1836
01:57:59,907 --> 01:58:00,267
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the MMO!

1837
01:58:20,786 --> 01:58:23,669
[SPEAKER_10]: New SimCity, we're not so forgiving though.

1838
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:32,035
[SPEAKER_10]: But Destiny kind of falls in that weird kind of middle part where it's like, well, clearly online is a big component of it, but you're going to have to always be connected.

1839
01:58:32,155 --> 01:58:36,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was curious if our listeners kind of gave it a pass or no.

1840
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,842
[SPEAKER_10]: We only had one response on Google+, so I'll read that.

1841
01:58:40,222 --> 01:58:43,244
[SPEAKER_10]: From Redertainment, the one guy still using Google+.

1842
01:58:45,206 --> 01:58:50,450
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a high-profile game with a wide and vocal audience to have an always-on internet connection mandate.

1843
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:57,716
[SPEAKER_10]: That way, when some part of it fails, leaving people unable to play the game they paid money for, the general public will rage out about it.

1844
01:58:58,036 --> 01:59:05,982
[SPEAKER_10]: When the public rages out about it, assuming these companies actually give a shit about what the public wants, these companies will finally see... Ooh, now it's going into FU music.

1845
01:59:06,022 --> 01:59:06,603
[SPEAKER_10]: How appropriate.

1846
01:59:07,484 --> 01:59:12,368
[SPEAKER_10]: These companies will finally see what a mistake the always-on internet connection mandate is.

1847
01:59:12,989 --> 01:59:16,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to introduce you to a game called Diablo 3.

1848
01:59:16,513 --> 01:59:19,616
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually happened.

1849
01:59:20,076 --> 01:59:22,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You couldn't log in to Diablo 3 for like a week.

1850
01:59:23,139 --> 01:59:26,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off after like an hour and...

1851
01:59:26,983 --> 01:59:32,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of hate boner, the internet really had a big one for Diablo 3 because of the always online.

1852
01:59:32,427 --> 01:59:36,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you might remember Diablo 2, you could play LAN and you could play offline.

1853
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:42,134
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a game that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny that's going to be similar to this.

1854
01:59:42,714 --> 01:59:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: SimCity.

1855
01:59:43,835 --> 01:59:44,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, SimCity.

1856
01:59:44,916 --> 01:59:46,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about more along the lines of Destiny.

1857
01:59:46,597 --> 01:59:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if an online first-person shooter game that's kind of like an MMO type thing.

1858
01:59:52,622 --> 01:59:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Defiance from Trion Games.

1859
01:59:55,945 --> 01:59:59,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming out in April and it's online only.

1860
01:59:59,868 --> 02:00:01,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't Trion an MMO company?

1861
02:00:01,489 --> 02:00:03,291
[SPEAKER_02]: They are an MMO company.

1862
02:00:03,371 --> 02:00:06,493
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is a game that it's buy-to-play type thing.

1863
02:00:07,594 --> 02:00:08,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's on consoles.

1864
02:00:08,635 --> 02:00:10,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on PC and PS3, Xbox 360.

1865
02:00:10,597 --> 02:00:10,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1866
02:00:12,818 --> 02:00:19,561
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something similar to that, obviously not as grand as Destiny.

1867
02:00:19,581 --> 02:00:23,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see this actually has an online port.

1868
02:00:23,143 --> 02:00:25,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it was very vague on everything.

1869
02:00:25,524 --> 02:00:26,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it that we need this port?

1870
02:00:31,707 --> 02:00:32,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Online world and stuff.

1871
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth?

1872
02:00:34,909 --> 02:00:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to have battles and stuff like that?

1873
02:00:36,731 --> 02:00:38,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into?

1874
02:00:38,852 --> 02:00:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just like, oh, well, I need to see my friend just cleared this spot so now the enemies are easier here or something.

1875
02:00:46,718 --> 02:00:47,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1876
02:00:47,258 --> 02:00:48,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what they're doing.

1877
02:00:48,559 --> 02:00:56,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there versus SimCity where you just interact with your friend's towns or cities that they make.

1878
02:00:59,319 --> 02:01:04,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Diablo 3, despite everybody raging on it and everything, still sold, what, 11 million?

1879
02:01:07,087 --> 02:01:11,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's going to tell them, oh, I got the message, no more Always Online.

1880
02:01:11,131 --> 02:01:11,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right?

1881
02:01:11,892 --> 02:01:16,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and if that were the case, we wouldn't be seeing it now like a fucking trend, right?

1882
02:01:16,076 --> 02:01:21,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Destiny, SimCity, the game Loki just talked about and all these other things.

1883
02:01:22,123 --> 02:01:22,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1884
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,969
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1885
02:01:24,449 --> 02:01:29,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got a text message from the person that linked me that story originally that I blew up at.

1886
02:01:30,172 --> 02:01:31,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just say it's Jason.

1887
02:01:31,052 --> 02:01:32,093
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't mind me saying that, I'm sure.

1888
02:01:32,493 --> 02:01:36,695
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, in their defense, it was an opinion piece, not news.

1889
02:01:36,835 --> 02:01:39,236
[SPEAKER_10]: But LOL, I was the straw that broke the camel's back.

1890
02:01:39,256 --> 02:01:40,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just like, congratulations.

1891
02:01:41,276 --> 02:01:42,117
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the catalyst.

1892
02:01:43,467 --> 02:01:44,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just put it this way.

1893
02:01:44,368 --> 02:01:45,868
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a website.

1894
02:01:45,888 --> 02:01:46,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob chose the red ending.

1895
02:01:47,009 --> 02:01:48,270
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1896
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:49,630
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going back down this road.

1897
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:49,890
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1898
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:50,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Close the door.

1899
02:01:50,991 --> 02:01:51,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Lock it.

1900
02:01:51,631 --> 02:01:51,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Done.

1901
02:01:52,652 --> 02:01:52,952
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1902
02:01:53,312 --> 02:01:54,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

1903
02:01:54,413 --> 02:01:54,613
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1904
02:01:54,633 --> 02:01:55,693
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to do?

1905
02:01:55,793 --> 02:01:56,174
[SPEAKER_02]: One sentence.

1906
02:01:56,194 --> 02:02:02,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say Gawker figured out animated GIFs a couple months ago, and they've been running with it ever since.

1907
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the GIF format has been on the internet since like the early 90s, right?

1908
02:02:08,232 --> 02:02:10,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, but now they literally have posts.

1909
02:02:11,234 --> 02:02:12,155
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, hey, look at this.

1910
02:02:12,515 --> 02:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some animated GIFs I made based off of, you know, this trailer just came out.

1911
02:02:16,858 --> 02:02:19,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it's funny that GIF is still associated with CompuSurf.

1912
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:25,684
[SPEAKER_10]: So they got a Tumblr account or started reading Oh No They Didn't because those are the things I associate with the animated GIF.

1913
02:02:25,965 --> 02:02:32,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I get my best animated GIFs ever from Oh No They Didn't, which is a LiveJournal community and pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal.

1914
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:34,891
[SPEAKER_10]: That and Russian Meteorite sightings.

1915
02:02:36,612 --> 02:02:36,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1916
02:03:04,281 --> 02:03:17,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Fugl, hello, always online connections, and some of our answers from Facebook, which really had a lot of answers on it, so I can't read them all, so please visit our Facebook community and read them all in their entirety, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1917
02:03:17,871 --> 02:03:21,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Fabrice A. says, very annoying, and they are punishing the wrong people.

1918
02:03:22,254 --> 02:03:26,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people have a crappy internet connection, or even no internet connection at all, so they can hardly play.

1919
02:03:27,177 --> 02:03:31,140
[SPEAKER_10]: People who bought the game legally and suffer one of the previous problems can't play, and

1920
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:36,783
[SPEAKER_10]: People who play illegally don't have any of those problems because the DRM is absent.

1921
02:03:36,883 --> 02:03:48,449
[SPEAKER_10]: FlamingToilet says, I would think that the fiasco with PSN going down for two months a couple years ago would have taught game makers that requiring an always-on internet connection is a very bad idea.

1922
02:03:48,869 --> 02:03:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're always going to think it's never going to happen to us.

1923
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:56,773
[SPEAKER_10]: How many games were unplayable or almost unplayable during that time because there was no network to connect to?

1924
02:03:57,318 --> 02:04:09,791
[SPEAKER_10]: thank you Flaming Toilet for reminding us never forget PlayStation Network fucking went down like it ate shit literal shit for two months horrible

1925
02:04:11,111 --> 02:04:15,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Cell Agent Why Not says, we're sorry, your game is not available at this time.

1926
02:04:15,455 --> 02:04:16,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Please hang up and try again.

1927
02:04:16,937 --> 02:04:17,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Lulz.

1928
02:04:18,358 --> 02:04:20,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember that crap that actually happened with me in Mass Effect 3?

1929
02:04:21,941 --> 02:04:23,563
[SPEAKER_03]: When they were having the origin issues?

1930
02:04:23,663 --> 02:04:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1931
02:04:24,483 --> 02:04:30,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't connect, but I also couldn't play my single player game because it wouldn't verify my DLC.

1932
02:04:30,249 --> 02:04:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1933
02:04:33,409 --> 02:04:35,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher K. replies and says...

1934
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:51,990
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1935
02:05:07,707 --> 02:05:13,171
[SPEAKER_10]: A good point that this indirectly brings up is that we've heard about Destiny's 10-year plan and so forth.

1936
02:05:13,612 --> 02:05:14,953
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens after 10 years?

1937
02:05:15,753 --> 02:05:19,876
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens when they want to pull the servers and so forth?

1938
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:23,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's that $60 investment in the game I made?

1939
02:05:23,559 --> 02:05:23,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And I heard...

1940
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:35,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, I wish I could remember where I heard about this, but I remember hearing about one of the reasons why $60 games and people are willing to pay that $60 price is the equity that you're getting in those games.

1941
02:05:35,124 --> 02:05:38,225
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that you can turn around and sell those games for a value later.

1942
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:45,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you talk about robbing people of the ability to sell used games...

1943
02:05:46,148 --> 02:05:50,510
[SPEAKER_10]: There's now no equity and there's nothing worth investing $60 in.

1944
02:05:50,930 --> 02:06:00,033
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you were going to turn off used games and then have it be $30, maybe that wouldn't feel like such a blow because the games overall are cheaper.

1945
02:06:00,053 --> 02:06:03,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And this could actually be a great thing for everybody if the games are really cheap.

1946
02:06:04,755 --> 02:06:07,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think $30 or $40 might be too much.

1947
02:06:08,558 --> 02:06:15,263
[SPEAKER_10]: My point is, though, I can still plug in an Atari 2600 and appreciate the games I grew up on.

1948
02:06:15,983 --> 02:06:24,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say, for whatever reason, Destiny is a game that Flacco gets his kids to start playing, which I doubt, but just humor me for a minute here.

1949
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:30,154
[SPEAKER_10]: What if they want to revisit that game in their 30s and they can't because the 10 years is up, the servers are down, the plug's been pulled?

1950
02:06:31,014 --> 02:06:31,395
[SPEAKER_10]: What now?

1951
02:06:31,795 --> 02:06:32,375
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really sad.

1952
02:06:32,796 --> 02:06:33,156
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad.

1953
02:06:33,176 --> 02:06:33,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad.

1954
02:06:35,051 --> 02:07:04,567
[SPEAKER_02]: well and a lot of there are games that are like that a lot of these games that were online only or something like that I mean they're just completely useless now like I don't know I can't think of anything that you would have but yeah I mean they pull servers all the time so it's very possible I mean I'm sure there's some MMOs especially some of these Sony MMOs that went offline I'm not I know there's a few that we mentioned before like even like PlayStation 2 games and stuff like that but

1955
02:07:06,568 --> 02:07:09,293
[SPEAKER_02]: and even big MMOs go down.

1956
02:07:09,854 --> 02:07:13,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Say if you bought a boxed copy of The Matrix Online or something like that.

1957
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You can never play Tabula Rasa.

1958
02:07:15,492 --> 02:07:15,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1959
02:07:17,273 --> 02:07:18,174
[SPEAKER_10]: You can never play it.

1960
02:07:19,475 --> 02:07:20,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars Galaxies.

1961
02:07:21,096 --> 02:07:21,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's right.

1962
02:07:22,097 --> 02:07:28,281
[SPEAKER_10]: You will never experience the pre-New Galaxy experience, or the post, for that matter, ever again in your life.

1963
02:07:28,661 --> 02:07:30,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon.

1964
02:07:31,383 --> 02:07:31,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1965
02:07:31,824 --> 02:07:32,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's gonna get killed, right?

1966
02:07:34,065 --> 02:07:35,846
[SPEAKER_10]: The WoW killer is coming out, Flaco.

1967
02:07:36,447 --> 02:07:37,187
[SPEAKER_10]: The WoW killer.

1968
02:07:37,548 --> 02:07:39,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Elder Scrolls Online, it's the WoW killer, Flaco.

1969
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:41,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Destiny's the WoW killer.

1970
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:43,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep seeing that in the chat all night.

1971
02:07:43,712 --> 02:07:44,913
[SPEAKER_10]: They're both killing WoW.

1972
02:07:46,829 --> 02:07:50,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Scarlet killed Wow in the conservatory with a lead pipe.

1973
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:52,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate boner.

1974
02:07:54,269 --> 02:08:07,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to Fugl Burr replied and said In the case of Destiny, it appears to be justified by what they're trying to do with the gameplay which at least makes me a little more understanding about it However, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?

1975
02:08:07,354 --> 02:08:23,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Get out of our head I feel like always on DRM is a decision made by focusing too much on the short term If this trend continues, future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history when servers inevitably retire or entire publishers go bankrupt I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant but it fits right in, doesn't it?

1976
02:08:24,481 --> 02:08:30,642
[SPEAKER_10]: RedTheHaze says, no problem with me if it's required by multiplayer, but if single player requires it, I might not get it.

1977
02:08:31,022 --> 02:08:34,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everyone has internet, and the US is far from number one when it comes to internet.

1978
02:08:36,103 --> 02:08:40,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary B replies and says, makes the decision about buying a game a no-brainer.

1979
02:08:40,584 --> 02:08:42,404
[SPEAKER_10]: No offline mode, no purchase.

1980
02:08:42,784 --> 02:08:48,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Where I live, I have two options for internet dial-up, which is slow and terrible, or satellite, which is expensive and terrible.

1981
02:08:48,685 --> 02:08:52,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So whenever I hear that a game is always online, I just stop caring.

1982
02:08:54,508 --> 02:08:58,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to see if I could Facebook stalk this guy and figure out where he lived, but he has his thing locked down.

1983
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:01,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?

1984
02:09:02,993 --> 02:09:09,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be fair, even some of these always online games where it's a persistent world and stuff, here's the other thing that turns me off about that stuff.

1985
02:09:10,618 --> 02:09:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot of time to play games sometimes.

1986
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:17,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I will go play an online game for a while and then not come back to it for a long time.

1987
02:09:18,203 --> 02:09:22,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Final Fantasy XI, which I played all of twice when I bought it the last time.

1988
02:09:23,526 --> 02:09:34,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the same thing is like, I don't know if this is going to be something like I got to keep logging in or else, you know, I'll get behind in some sort of quest or whatever the fuck is going on.

1989
02:09:34,253 --> 02:09:42,258
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it might also be something that kind of turns me off to it because like, you know, I don't have the time to dedicate to like an MMO or something like that.

1990
02:09:43,528 --> 02:09:46,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Last comment I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our Facebook to read them all.

1991
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:48,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook.com slash Orange Sounds Radio.

1992
02:09:48,792 --> 02:09:55,556
[SPEAKER_10]: JLinks says, Being a connoisseur of mainly MMOs and FPSs, I'm used to games with required internet connections to play.

1993
02:09:56,036 --> 02:09:58,838
[SPEAKER_10]: This falls more into a to-each-their-own niche to me.

1994
02:09:59,178 --> 02:10:03,741
[SPEAKER_10]: While I could play FPSs offline in single player, I didn't make that the main reason I bought the game.

1995
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:07,183
[SPEAKER_10]: If the game's good and I have the methods available to play it, I'll buy it.

1996
02:10:07,443 --> 02:10:08,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Simple as that.

1997
02:10:09,298 --> 02:10:12,359
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our comments from Facebook and Google+.

1998
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:14,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys who all responded.

1999
02:10:14,419 --> 02:10:17,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I didn't read everybody's, but it's only a three-hour show.

2000
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:23,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to a few more news stories and pretty soon Skype calls.

2001
02:10:24,281 --> 02:10:24,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

2002
02:10:24,861 --> 02:10:32,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God that Sony is trolling us because there is no way that, like, I just can't believe that they would actually do this.

2003
02:10:32,602 --> 02:10:36,083
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently there is a patent that they have

2004
02:10:37,103 --> 02:10:39,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is going to come as a shock to you guys.

2005
02:10:39,384 --> 02:10:42,385
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have a tablet that they have patented.

2006
02:10:43,046 --> 02:10:47,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to check this out right now to see what it's called.

2007
02:10:47,087 --> 02:10:50,989
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're calling it the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.

2008
02:10:51,029 --> 02:10:53,410
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no way that that is called the iPad.

2009
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:58,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a European patent thing that they're showing me here.

2010
02:10:58,792 --> 02:10:59,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really help me very much.

2011
02:10:59,913 --> 02:11:01,633
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 pages.

2012
02:11:03,374 --> 02:11:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, 17 pages.

2013
02:11:04,454 --> 02:11:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks like it's made out of, like, particle board or something like that.

2014
02:11:07,775 --> 02:11:08,435
[SPEAKER_02]: This is weird.

2015
02:11:08,815 --> 02:11:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, it's a tablet device.

2016
02:11:11,275 --> 02:11:11,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks thin.

2017
02:11:11,795 --> 02:11:17,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got, looks like a directional pad, you know, face buttons, possibly a speaker, and one analog stick.

2018
02:11:17,977 --> 02:11:19,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on you, Sony.

2019
02:11:19,537 --> 02:11:22,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you not learned from the PSP one analog stick?

2020
02:11:22,657 --> 02:11:24,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than the iPad's got.

2021
02:11:24,558 --> 02:11:26,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, still, though, I mean.

2022
02:11:26,038 --> 02:11:29,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how the big square sharp corner design reminds me of the NES.

2023
02:11:29,699 --> 02:11:31,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Will I be able to install MAME on this?

2024
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:34,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2025
02:11:34,862 --> 02:11:42,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't really say... I want to make sure that it's actually called the iPad or not.

2026
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:45,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard that name too, for what it's worth.

2027
02:11:46,533 --> 02:11:48,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that someone's making that up.

2028
02:11:48,895 --> 02:11:50,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't honestly think that they would do that.

2029
02:11:51,818 --> 02:11:55,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, no, they actually have it called the iPad.

2030
02:11:55,942 --> 02:11:59,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense, the PlayStation 9, but again, take it with a jar of salt.

2031
02:11:59,865 --> 02:12:00,585
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the iToy.

2032
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:01,186
[SPEAKER_02]: A gallon of salt.

2033
02:12:01,246 --> 02:12:03,968
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's in their patent information.

2034
02:12:04,048 --> 02:12:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: They refer to it as the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.

2035
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:10,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a patent, that's a lawsuit right there.

2036
02:12:10,392 --> 02:12:11,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy fuckballs, really?

2037
02:12:12,393 --> 02:12:12,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I-Toy

2038
02:12:27,674 --> 02:12:28,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2039
02:12:29,697 --> 02:12:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why they're using the iPad and the PlayStation 9 and all that stuff.

2040
02:12:33,242 --> 02:12:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense to me.

2041
02:12:34,544 --> 02:12:37,348
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Apple's going to go, no, fuck you.

2042
02:12:37,648 --> 02:12:38,790
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't call it the iPad.

2043
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:43,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Apple, this really is a whole come at me, bro, move at Apple.

2044
02:12:43,576 --> 02:12:46,177
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, huge salts.

2045
02:12:46,197 --> 02:12:48,718
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't know.

2046
02:12:49,218 --> 02:12:53,640
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems unnecessary to have both this and the little thingy built into the controller.

2047
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:55,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.

2048
02:12:55,201 --> 02:12:56,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's some of the stuff.

2049
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:59,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just read some of the cool things that they're saying that this thing has.

2050
02:13:00,022 --> 02:13:04,644
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that it's going to have stereoscopic cameras on it.

2051
02:13:04,964 --> 02:13:08,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to be able to, I guess, record 3D or something like that.

2052
02:13:08,906 --> 02:13:10,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the 3DS.

2053
02:13:10,126 --> 02:13:11,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2054
02:13:13,171 --> 02:13:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that there's some sort of weird prism thing going on with their touchpad and stuff.

2055
02:13:21,116 --> 02:13:23,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have six axis built into it.

2056
02:13:23,298 --> 02:13:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what they're... I mean, everything has six axis built into it.

2057
02:13:27,741 --> 02:13:32,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we'll have to hear more about it if this is going to be part of the PlayStation 4.

2058
02:13:32,624 --> 02:13:34,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this story coming from my favorite website?

2059
02:13:34,705 --> 02:13:36,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

2060
02:13:36,466 --> 02:13:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a

2061
02:13:37,327 --> 02:13:37,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The Maybe Patent

2062
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:56,301
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know if it's real, right?

2063
02:13:56,801 --> 02:13:58,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it coming from the official patent website?

2064
02:13:58,802 --> 02:14:01,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it... Do they have a link there or something?

2065
02:14:01,103 --> 02:14:09,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they've got it from... It's actually linked from... Or it's embedded from the European patent applications.

2066
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:12,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it.

2067
02:14:12,850 --> 02:14:16,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true, but... It also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games.

2068
02:14:16,493 --> 02:14:19,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily a tie-in to the PlayStation 4.

2069
02:14:20,095 --> 02:14:26,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit, so why would they not maybe want to come up with a hybrid PlayStation tablet?

2070
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:35,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're saying, like, here's one of the things, is therefore, in addition to the convenient joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis controller provides the PS3 with data and all that stuff.

2071
02:14:35,266 --> 02:14:40,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about PS3 a little bit.

2072
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:41,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2073
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2074
02:14:42,191 --> 02:14:42,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

2075
02:14:44,013 --> 02:14:47,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems a little weird, but they could do it, I guess.

2076
02:14:47,997 --> 02:14:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they tried to put out some PlayStation-branded tablets that all looked really weird, but who knows?

2077
02:14:57,185 --> 02:14:57,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2078
02:14:58,506 --> 02:15:00,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday.

2079
02:15:00,107 --> 02:15:01,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right around the corner.

2080
02:15:04,778 --> 02:15:08,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think they're just covering their bases, like all these patent applications.

2081
02:15:08,541 --> 02:15:09,462
[SPEAKER_02]: iPad, I mean, really?

2082
02:15:09,482 --> 02:15:10,763
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really going to release it.

2083
02:15:10,783 --> 02:15:13,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Just call it like the PlayStation tablet or something like that, you know?

2084
02:15:14,387 --> 02:15:17,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Something, Sony PlayStation tablet, not iPad.

2085
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:20,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Calm down, it's the name and a patent, it's not the final name.

2086
02:15:20,372 --> 02:15:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Just call it a thingy and be done with it.

2087
02:15:21,993 --> 02:15:22,514
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2088
02:15:24,122 --> 02:15:31,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, one other rumor going around about new consoles that just won't die is the fact that used games are not going to be playable on it.

2089
02:15:31,825 --> 02:15:36,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can bet that Electronic Arts EA is just cheering about this.

2090
02:15:36,786 --> 02:15:39,648
[SPEAKER_10]: After all, they're the ones that started the online pass shit, aren't they?

2091
02:15:40,588 --> 02:15:50,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyhow, the chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen, had a talk with Gamasutra, and Gamasutra asked him about the whole used games and these rumors.

2092
02:15:50,771 --> 02:15:51,732
[SPEAKER_10]: In response, quote,

2093
02:15:52,592 --> 02:15:53,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate this word.

2094
02:15:53,352 --> 02:15:53,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Liquidity.

2095
02:16:19,722 --> 02:16:20,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2096
02:16:39,369 --> 02:16:46,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Could this be a sign of things to come if EA is openly, or at least one of their executives is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad thing?

2097
02:16:46,974 --> 02:16:51,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are they just setting this up for when the banhammer comes down on this pretty soon with the used games?

2098
02:16:52,217 --> 02:16:54,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Any thoughts on EA's comments, Loki?

2099
02:16:54,098 --> 02:16:56,860
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, do you have anything?

2100
02:16:58,706 --> 02:17:03,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're already making their money on used games with the whole online passes.

2101
02:17:03,468 --> 02:17:06,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they were touting before that they made a ton of money on online passes.

2102
02:17:06,449 --> 02:17:10,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So to them, that's just money in their pockets, I guess.

2103
02:17:11,732 --> 02:17:13,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to say something along similar lines.

2104
02:17:13,573 --> 02:17:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've found a way to keep making a profit on it.

2105
02:17:17,434 --> 02:17:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a really, you know...

2106
02:17:20,686 --> 02:17:27,570
[SPEAKER_03]: With a lot of cases in the used market, the people who are getting rid of their used games are trying to get the new mechs better.

2107
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:31,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We've even traded in some of our games, some of our crappy ones, to get new games.

2108
02:17:33,873 --> 02:17:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, it's even better for EA, as an example, if someone trades in one of their competitor's games to get one of theirs.

2109
02:17:43,619 --> 02:17:46,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole liquid market thing is pretty...

2110
02:17:47,762 --> 02:17:48,542
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty accurate.

2111
02:17:48,702 --> 02:18:00,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And also considering that EA is also one of these companies that puts out yearly releases of their sports games, and they probably know that people aren't going to want to hold on to their copy of Madden 13 or something like that.

2112
02:18:00,948 --> 02:18:04,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden 25, the dumbest new... What are they thinking there?

2113
02:18:04,749 --> 02:18:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're going to go 13 to 25, and then next year it's going to be 15, and then in a few years we're going to have 25 again.

2114
02:18:10,952 --> 02:18:12,873
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's the 25th year, I get it.

2115
02:18:13,033 --> 02:18:13,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not...

2116
02:18:14,153 --> 02:18:17,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it like Madden 25th anniversary, not Madden 25.

2117
02:18:17,095 --> 02:18:17,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

2118
02:18:17,475 --> 02:18:19,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, that's not the point.

2119
02:18:19,516 --> 02:18:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is that they release games each year and that they know that people are going to need to trade these in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them because they're essentially useless after...

2120
02:18:30,382 --> 02:18:30,422
[SPEAKER_02]: E.A.

2121
02:18:30,482 --> 02:18:32,063
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of full of dicks right now

2122
02:18:47,333 --> 02:18:48,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Here was the rest of the quote.

2123
02:19:15,149 --> 02:19:16,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, what?

2124
02:19:17,271 --> 02:19:19,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe the consumer likes it.

2125
02:19:19,793 --> 02:19:24,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, didn't I just read some foogle answers that didn't seem to go that direction?

2126
02:19:24,218 --> 02:19:26,239
[SPEAKER_10]: They like the always-on connectivity?

2127
02:19:26,299 --> 02:19:31,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done some polls on certain websites that basically have said the same thing.

2128
02:19:31,704 --> 02:19:33,146
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, actually, GameStop did a poll.

2129
02:19:33,206 --> 02:19:38,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it over 60% of people that use GameStop or whatever don't like...

2130
02:19:39,071 --> 02:19:39,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Not having to use games.

2131
02:19:40,071 --> 02:19:45,113
[SPEAKER_10]: This worries me when that sentence comes out of a game maker's mouth, is how out of touch are you?

2132
02:19:46,394 --> 02:19:52,055
[SPEAKER_10]: See, people in the boardroom think they know what we want, but clearly they don't.

2133
02:19:52,095 --> 02:20:05,780
[SPEAKER_10]: But by telling us in an interview, this is what gamers want, then the more gullible will run with it and the CNNs will say, oh, well, these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers want, according to Electronics Art.

2134
02:20:07,121 --> 02:20:08,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you try talking to a gamer?

2135
02:20:09,744 --> 02:20:10,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and see, that's the thing.

2136
02:20:11,304 --> 02:20:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a habit of trying to manipulate the data that they find to suit their own purposes.

2137
02:20:16,826 --> 02:20:18,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything can be changed.

2138
02:20:19,606 --> 02:20:23,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to get an unbiased source if they're going to have accurate information.

2139
02:20:23,267 --> 02:20:28,628
[SPEAKER_03]: But all they want is for people to tell them the same things that's going to support the outcome that they look for.

2140
02:20:29,908 --> 02:20:33,809
[SPEAKER_10]: The legend of Zaku in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com gives a Homer Simpson quote.

2141
02:20:34,269 --> 02:20:35,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Facts are meaningless.

2142
02:20:35,229 --> 02:20:37,610
[SPEAKER_10]: You can create facts for something that is remotely true.

2143
02:20:40,635 --> 02:20:42,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting note to end that on.

2144
02:20:42,336 --> 02:20:43,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on, DarkSakura.

2145
02:20:44,738 --> 02:20:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about something else EA's managed to fuck up?

2146
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:50,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?

2147
02:20:50,681 --> 02:20:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, EA come close to really royally fucking up the Mass Effect series.

2148
02:20:56,167 --> 02:20:58,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, we warned you, there is Mass Effect news.

2149
02:20:59,548 --> 02:21:07,570
[SPEAKER_03]: BioWare is basically saying don't call it Mass Effect 4 because it's implying that it is another addition to the trilogy.

2150
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:14,932
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that basically the trilogy is over, this is another game in the universe.

2151
02:21:15,632 --> 02:21:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And the comparison here is, and I'll read the quote from Priestley.

2152
02:21:19,953 --> 02:21:21,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It says...

2153
02:21:22,674 --> 02:21:23,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 4 Modern Warfare

2154
02:21:50,877 --> 02:21:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

2155
02:21:53,099 --> 02:22:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are talking about it's being in development with Bioware Montreal and that's the same office that of course gave us this superb multiplayer.

2156
02:22:06,486 --> 02:22:09,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mass Effect 2, which is the crown.

2157
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:43,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that would make me happy about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them production timeline and actually put out a good quality product with great writing the way that Mass Effect 2 was.

2158
02:22:45,171 --> 02:22:47,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That would just completely tickle me to no end.

2159
02:22:47,872 --> 02:22:49,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I'm going to play it.

2160
02:22:49,372 --> 02:22:50,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, that won't happen.

2161
02:22:50,492 --> 02:22:51,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

2162
02:22:51,553 --> 02:22:52,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so sad.

2163
02:22:53,133 --> 02:22:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that, yeah, I'm an addict.

2164
02:22:54,714 --> 02:22:55,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll still play it.

2165
02:22:55,454 --> 02:22:56,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the universe.

2166
02:22:57,674 --> 02:23:02,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the pieces of shit that are involved in Mass Effect 3...

2167
02:23:03,656 --> 02:23:05,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I still play the game.

2168
02:23:05,157 --> 02:23:08,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I've probably played it more than two just because I like how it plays better.

2169
02:23:08,719 --> 02:23:15,743
[SPEAKER_03]: If it keeps using the newer incarnations of the Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.

2170
02:23:16,404 --> 02:23:19,606
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's fun to play and I get more lore, I'm happy.

2171
02:23:20,326 --> 02:23:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: The multiplayer is so good, too.

2172
02:23:22,067 --> 02:23:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

2173
02:23:22,527 --> 02:23:25,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We should play again, but you don't play on PC anymore, and that makes me sad.

2174
02:23:25,709 --> 02:23:27,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of do mix and match now.

2175
02:23:28,611 --> 02:23:30,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then come play online with me.

2176
02:23:31,733 --> 02:23:31,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Meh.

2177
02:23:35,834 --> 02:23:41,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, there's yet another rumor going along with the PlayStation 4, Orbis, whatever you're going to call it.

2178
02:23:42,116 --> 02:23:55,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that because they purchased Gaikai, they're going to be using that streaming service to stream PlayStation 3 games to the new PlayStation.

2179
02:23:55,799 --> 02:24:01,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying that there's not going to be really any backwards compatibility with the old system, which makes sense.

2180
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility and

2181
02:24:04,461 --> 02:24:08,903
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is being offered as downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.

2182
02:24:10,804 --> 02:24:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying that this is also going to coincide with physical releases for PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.

2183
02:24:18,708 --> 02:24:29,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see this as an evolution of that whole PlayStation Plus game library thing, because right now you have to download and install everything, which takes fucking forever.

2184
02:24:30,074 --> 02:24:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas this, you could be just like, okay, I want to play Saints Row 2.

2185
02:24:33,556 --> 02:24:37,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Go and then just load it up and stream it.

2186
02:24:37,641 --> 02:24:38,963
[SPEAKER_11]: The hour-long game trials too.

2187
02:24:39,504 --> 02:24:44,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you have to actually download the entire game to play for an hour and then just delete it.

2188
02:24:47,093 --> 02:24:48,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So once again, we'll see you.

2189
02:24:50,854 --> 02:24:54,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.

2190
02:24:54,655 --> 02:24:57,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They spent so much money on that, obviously it's going to be integrated somehow.

2191
02:24:58,095 --> 02:25:01,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week too.

2192
02:25:01,376 --> 02:25:03,237
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems something obvious that they could talk about.

2193
02:25:03,257 --> 02:25:06,277
[SPEAKER_02]: They could almost do that with the PlayStation 3.

2194
02:25:06,797 --> 02:25:10,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that is PlayStation 4.

2195
02:25:10,538 --> 02:25:15,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they could do this, hey, you guys, you know how you have that online game library right now?

2196
02:25:15,719 --> 02:25:16,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

2197
02:25:16,919 --> 02:25:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff instantly.

2198
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:27,384
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense because part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2 inside of it as well so it could run all the games.

2199
02:25:27,885 --> 02:25:32,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when they started cutting that out and getting the price down, that disappeared.

2200
02:25:33,288 --> 02:25:40,892
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe they're trying to not wow us with a $599 US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4, probably more like $499.

2201
02:25:42,253 --> 02:26:11,123
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh you know it's not gonna be don't expect it to be that that low but uh this is one way they'll they'll be able to save some money on the console and maybe not have it be so expensive is that they're gonna use the streaming technology to emulate some of the older games I hope though that it's just an option that you can also like okay you can stream it or you can download it because once again if you know their service goes to shit then that's gonna suck not being able to play your game because you can't stream it anymore you know

2202
02:26:11,845 --> 02:26:13,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume that you'd be able to download it as well.

2203
02:26:14,227 --> 02:26:15,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that you could do that.

2204
02:26:15,708 --> 02:26:22,553
[SPEAKER_10]: ShadowNextGen with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com PlayStation Network is in no way good enough to do streaming gameplay like that.

2205
02:26:22,913 --> 02:26:27,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Even with Gaikai, is PlayStation Network ready for that kind of bandwidth?

2206
02:26:29,078 --> 02:26:30,138
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fair question.

2207
02:26:30,158 --> 02:26:30,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it this way, though.

2208
02:26:30,999 --> 02:26:36,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with some of the demos with FIFA and stuff like that through a web browser and stuff.

2209
02:26:36,643 --> 02:26:37,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they could probably handle it.

2210
02:26:41,224 --> 02:26:44,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to look good, though, coming through your bandwidth?

2211
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:46,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, through your internet connections?

2212
02:26:46,571 --> 02:26:48,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to look all fucking pixelated and shit?

2213
02:26:49,754 --> 02:26:50,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2214
02:26:51,096 --> 02:26:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... We'll just have to see, I guess.

2215
02:26:56,337 --> 02:26:59,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, kind of a follow-up story of sorts.

2216
02:27:00,439 --> 02:27:06,402
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan and how it's going to this free-to-play model on the Wii U?

2217
02:27:06,702 --> 02:27:09,604
[SPEAKER_10]: That hasn't arrived in America yet, but guess what?

2218
02:27:10,204 --> 02:27:12,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to happen in Europe as well.

2219
02:27:12,305 --> 02:27:15,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Europe will be the next region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.

2220
02:27:15,567 --> 02:27:21,090
[SPEAKER_10]: The base download will have Monster Battle, Free For All, and Team Versus, and you can play them up to three times.

2221
02:27:22,831 --> 02:27:30,195
[SPEAKER_10]: The first add-on is My Kong, which will cost €1.99 in Euros through February 28th.

2222
02:27:31,836 --> 02:27:32,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

2223
02:27:33,197 --> 02:27:34,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to fight the bees.

2224
02:27:34,718 --> 02:27:38,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear the game's not very good, but I mean, it's a fun arcade game.

2225
02:27:40,402 --> 02:27:44,244
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I love the game, I really don't see it translating well.

2226
02:27:44,384 --> 02:27:45,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has the things.

2227
02:27:45,985 --> 02:27:48,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the free-to-play model is certainly interesting.

2228
02:27:51,167 --> 02:27:52,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?

2229
02:27:53,008 --> 02:27:56,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think they will roll this out to the States next?

2230
02:27:56,449 --> 02:27:56,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody?

2231
02:27:56,750 --> 02:27:58,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd have to, I think.

2232
02:27:58,970 --> 02:28:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they'll eventually roll it out to the States.

2233
02:28:01,451 --> 02:28:05,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to see the... I guess I'm a little bit...

2234
02:28:06,771 --> 02:28:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco has tried doing this whole free-to-play type approach for some of their games.

2235
02:28:11,975 --> 02:28:15,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't work out so well with Ridge Racer on the Vita.

2236
02:28:16,058 --> 02:28:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.

2237
02:28:17,098 --> 02:28:20,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pay $30, $40 and get nothing.

2238
02:28:21,081 --> 02:28:24,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a demo and then buy extra crap for it.

2239
02:28:24,924 --> 02:28:27,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of sucked, but we'll see.

2240
02:28:29,307 --> 02:28:31,308
[SPEAKER_02]: $2 is not that bad for an add-on.

2241
02:28:35,253 --> 02:28:36,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the mailbag.

2242
02:28:36,795 --> 02:28:42,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here on the show.

2243
02:28:51,826 --> 02:28:55,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com where you can send us emails every week.

2244
02:28:55,088 --> 02:28:57,869
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one email this week and I'll go ahead and read it.

2245
02:28:57,949 --> 02:28:59,610
[SPEAKER_10]: It just came in like an hour ago.

2246
02:29:00,030 --> 02:29:00,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go ahead and read it.

2247
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:02,631
[SPEAKER_10]: No biggie.

2248
02:29:02,731 --> 02:29:05,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a gem of an email so I want to read this through.

2249
02:29:05,732 --> 02:29:07,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, it's from RawSteelUT.

2250
02:29:08,514 --> 02:29:09,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

2251
02:29:09,707 --> 02:29:10,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OLR!

2252
02:29:11,147 --> 02:29:20,290
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, it seems like you guys have joined the rest of the media in spending time on every next-gen rumor that comes down the pike, no matter how hilarious or ill-thought.

2253
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:29,672
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been proven that the mainstream games media can be easily fooled into believing anything, as has been shown by various angry formites and Tumblr people all over the years.

2254
02:29:30,112 --> 02:29:35,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I know that the blogs will go after anything that gets clicks, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?

2255
02:29:38,395 --> 02:29:40,656
[SPEAKER_10]: In what way does panic-mongering help the show?

2256
02:29:41,057 --> 02:29:43,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It's clearly not bringing in the page hits.

2257
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:45,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly it's not.

2258
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:46,880
[SPEAKER_10]: How rude.

2259
02:29:47,821 --> 02:29:48,361
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're here.

2260
02:29:48,561 --> 02:29:49,201
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what counts.

2261
02:29:50,202 --> 02:29:52,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys ever thought of vetting these rumors?

2262
02:29:52,583 --> 02:29:57,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to sift the possibly legitimate things from the blatant and senseless bullshit?

2263
02:29:57,711 --> 02:30:04,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I am glad that you asked that question because that is a great... We should go vet those rumors.

2264
02:30:04,136 --> 02:30:08,299
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, let me place a call to Sony right now and ask that question.

2265
02:30:08,579 --> 02:30:09,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

2266
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just... Let me get them on the line and see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4 rumors because you know...

2267
02:30:14,884 --> 02:30:26,814
[SPEAKER_10]: As you mentioned before, it isn't going any distance in getting us hits at all that, you know, sites like, I don't know, the ESA when measuring E3 doesn't even want to take a second look at independent podcasts and all that stuff.

2268
02:30:27,154 --> 02:30:32,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly, these guys are on my speed dial and I can vet this shit till the cows come home.

2269
02:30:34,235 --> 02:30:36,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just talking... Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.

2270
02:30:36,976 --> 02:30:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?

2271
02:30:39,116 --> 02:30:39,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2272
02:30:40,057 --> 02:30:41,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, we were chilling.

2273
02:30:41,717 --> 02:30:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

2274
02:30:42,097 --> 02:30:43,898
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get some fro-yo afterward.

2275
02:30:43,958 --> 02:30:46,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I got photos of my Dan and you, Suzuki.

2276
02:30:46,578 --> 02:30:47,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually true, I do.

2277
02:30:47,619 --> 02:30:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me put a little reminder out there about what this show is all about, alright?

2278
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:52,980
[SPEAKER_10]: In case you forgot.

2279
02:30:54,877 --> 02:31:07,246
[SPEAKER_10]: This show started because we all played DDR at the arcades and after DDR we would go and we would go to the restaurant that was down the street and we would sit around over, you know, food that was bad for us like mozzarella sticks and so forth.

2280
02:31:07,286 --> 02:31:07,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Fried cheese.

2281
02:31:08,187 --> 02:31:09,408
[SPEAKER_10]: God, they're so fucking good, huh?

2282
02:31:09,828 --> 02:31:12,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And we would talk smack about what's going on in games.

2283
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:15,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what happens a lot of times when people are talking smack?

2284
02:31:15,972 --> 02:31:19,375
[SPEAKER_10]: They're talking about the rumors and things that go around in the industry.

2285
02:31:20,515 --> 02:31:25,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't think of a time when we've said this stuff on air and said, this is fact, people.

2286
02:31:25,559 --> 02:31:26,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe this, people.

2287
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:31,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we like to bring these ideas up and say, this is a rumor.

2288
02:31:31,583 --> 02:31:35,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it with a grain of salt, like I think we just said about that iPad thing.

2289
02:31:35,405 --> 02:31:38,206
[SPEAKER_03]: or ask people what they think about it.

2290
02:31:38,326 --> 02:31:39,907
[SPEAKER_10]: What's wrong with discussion?

2291
02:31:40,047 --> 02:31:42,829
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with discussing and talking about ideas?

2292
02:31:42,909 --> 02:31:46,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Because some rumors do pan out to be true.

2293
02:31:47,011 --> 02:31:55,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So why not talk about what goes through the heads of these people that don't really want to be so ready to talk about these things?

2294
02:31:56,215 --> 02:31:56,996
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2295
02:32:14,833 --> 02:32:19,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Such as we just talked a little bit about Destiny and the fact that it requires an always online connection.

2296
02:32:20,159 --> 02:32:22,021
[SPEAKER_10]: That is fact, not rumor.

2297
02:32:22,401 --> 02:32:23,442
[SPEAKER_10]: They said that today.

2298
02:32:23,803 --> 02:32:26,045
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's something that's going to impact the game industry.

2299
02:32:26,505 --> 02:32:31,190
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole fact about used games being banned on the new consoles, that's a rumor, yes.

2300
02:32:31,751 --> 02:32:33,613
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think all of us sit here and go...

2301
02:32:34,013 --> 02:32:44,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think, can you sit there and you honestly think to yourself that in no boardroom ever has it been said by a senior executive we should lock out new games on the new console.

2302
02:32:45,439 --> 02:32:45,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Use games.

2303
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:47,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what I said?

2304
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:48,560
[SPEAKER_10]: He said lock out new games.

2305
02:32:50,201 --> 02:32:55,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Lock out the new ones so then we have to do an even newer system and have to charge them.

2306
02:32:55,804 --> 02:32:57,664
[SPEAKER_10]: The online pass idea came from somewhere.

2307
02:32:59,926 --> 02:33:02,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Rumors are often founded in fact.

2308
02:33:03,519 --> 02:33:06,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think this was a very well thought out email, honestly.

2309
02:33:08,402 --> 02:33:20,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But the biggest thing too is that I actually like looking at the rumors and the speculation and keeping track of it so I can see what legitimately happens when something comes out to see who was right, who was on the right track.

2310
02:33:21,271 --> 02:33:25,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Was our technology really in a place where we had this capability?

2311
02:33:26,614 --> 02:33:32,178
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's actually a gauge of how ambitious consumer level technology is.

2312
02:33:33,398 --> 02:33:34,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's neat.

2313
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:38,602
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolfInChat says, I'm not a journalist.

2314
02:33:38,762 --> 02:33:39,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a commentator.

2315
02:33:39,922 --> 02:33:42,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't actually have the resources to be a real journalist.

2316
02:33:43,345 --> 02:33:45,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what is a real journalist anyway?

2317
02:33:45,246 --> 02:33:50,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Because some things that get away with being real journalism are a little bit laughable.

2318
02:33:50,649 --> 02:33:52,550
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, I do like that comparison.

2319
02:33:53,831 --> 02:33:55,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a games journalist either, really.

2320
02:33:55,512 --> 02:33:57,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually think more than anything I'm a games analyst.

2321
02:33:59,135 --> 02:34:00,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I will analyze the shit out of your game.

2322
02:34:00,656 --> 02:34:02,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I say that with a straight face too.

2323
02:34:03,038 --> 02:34:03,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a games analyst.

2324
02:34:04,259 --> 02:34:05,660
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of you are games analysts too.

2325
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:06,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You really are.

2326
02:34:07,522 --> 02:34:08,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are just anal.

2327
02:34:08,703 --> 02:34:15,989
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been sitting here talking about games for 11 years and there's some other guys that go out there and are in every story and being interviewed with the games analyst title.

2328
02:34:16,289 --> 02:34:16,869
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

2329
02:34:16,929 --> 02:34:18,691
[SPEAKER_10]: They get about as much stuff right as we do.

2330
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:20,311
[SPEAKER_10]: and about as much wrong as we do.

2331
02:34:39,689 --> 02:34:42,311
[SPEAKER_10]: It's way too early to say something like that.

2332
02:34:42,911 --> 02:34:44,152
[SPEAKER_10]: A year from now, maybe.

2333
02:34:44,272 --> 02:34:45,652
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is Nintendo we're talking about.

2334
02:34:45,732 --> 02:34:46,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

2335
02:34:47,353 --> 02:34:51,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing to bring up rumor without having anything to substantiate it.

2336
02:34:52,516 --> 02:34:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely different if you actually have items that are going to back it up.

2337
02:34:55,958 --> 02:35:07,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay, for example, let's say that it's a year from now and Nintendo has continued to have dismal sales and we're starting to see extreme price reductions on the Wii U and

2338
02:35:07,504 --> 02:35:16,992
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're starting to see the 3DS game sales drop, then at that point it might be safe to speculate that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.

2339
02:35:18,053 --> 02:35:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, like you said, no, it's completely different just to completely sensationalize something and try to get people to back you up by being even more sensational about it as opposed to stating, well, this is what's being said, this is what we've seen, make your own decision.

2340
02:35:36,018 --> 02:35:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people out there that will just read anything and believe it immediately.

2341
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, you'll see commenters on news stories where they're talking about a rumor like, that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.

2342
02:35:47,126 --> 02:35:51,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if that's true, then I'm not buying an Xbox.

2343
02:35:51,389 --> 02:35:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, if that's true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.

2344
02:35:55,272 --> 02:35:58,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, this is absolute fact because it's coming to me from...

2345
02:35:58,894 --> 02:36:05,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this gaming blog that I trust their information, so therefore it is, you know, I am not going to buy this console.

2346
02:36:05,877 --> 02:36:09,479
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the people that are fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind eight times.

2347
02:36:09,499 --> 02:36:15,002
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the ones that, you know, fucking start a petition or, you know, join a group that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game.

2348
02:36:15,022 --> 02:36:17,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.

2349
02:36:17,063 --> 02:36:17,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

2350
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:19,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

2351
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:27,622
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I think I know for a fact that, and this comes from just my line of work, that I don't deal in guarantees.

2352
02:36:28,702 --> 02:36:30,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that.

2353
02:36:31,122 --> 02:36:37,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always leaving myself a way out, and there's no way that I'm saying anything is absolute fact unless I actually see it.

2354
02:36:38,924 --> 02:36:43,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, RossDLUT is in chat right now and says, makes a note that I'm now hated.

2355
02:36:43,685 --> 02:36:44,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say I hated you.

2356
02:36:44,745 --> 02:36:45,945
[SPEAKER_03]: No one said we hated you.

2357
02:36:45,965 --> 02:36:46,005
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2358
02:36:46,565 --> 02:36:50,508
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?

2359
02:36:50,688 --> 02:36:52,889
[SPEAKER_10]: In what way does panic mongering help the show?

2360
02:36:53,670 --> 02:36:56,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I would express why we spend time on nonsense rumors.

2361
02:36:56,872 --> 02:36:59,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme of a viewpoint.

2362
02:36:59,693 --> 02:37:01,955
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like we're sitting here going, Ah!

2363
02:37:02,315 --> 02:37:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Soldier Nintendo!

2364
02:37:04,016 --> 02:37:05,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

2365
02:37:06,017 --> 02:37:07,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I could hear once.

2366
02:37:11,598 --> 02:37:14,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, if the site gets more hits, I might lose VOG the game.

2367
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,700
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it's really about, isn't it?

2368
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:18,980
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I care about.

2369
02:37:21,841 --> 02:37:28,964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to the other half of the email, which is a question I think is a little more up our alley.

2370
02:37:29,664 --> 02:37:35,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, Aliens Colonel Marines has been released after seven years development, and the consensus seems to be that it's a hot mess.

2371
02:37:36,806 --> 02:37:38,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Now this is the type of email I like to get.

2372
02:37:38,807 --> 02:37:45,291
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem Forever, the game had a protracted crap ton of development houses working on it.

2373
02:37:45,751 --> 02:37:46,992
[SPEAKER_10]: My question here is this.

2374
02:37:47,432 --> 02:37:51,835
[SPEAKER_10]: At what point are there too many hands in the pot and when should a project just be cancelled?

2375
02:37:52,255 --> 02:37:57,198
[SPEAKER_10]: In my view, anything past three years and two development houses is asking for disaster.

2376
02:37:57,992 --> 02:37:59,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about contracts you sign.

2377
02:37:59,893 --> 02:38:00,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Cooks in the soup.

2378
02:38:01,374 --> 02:38:08,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're going to be responsible for if you don't come through with the product you promised whoever paid you money to come through with.

2379
02:38:09,699 --> 02:38:12,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem Forever was canceled at one point, was it not?

2380
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:16,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Like when the company went out of business and Gearbox essentially just bought what was left over from it.

2381
02:38:16,943 --> 02:38:19,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.

2382
02:38:19,525 --> 02:38:25,248
[SPEAKER_10]: But they kind of, you know, picked up the ashes and released what they did for better or for worse, right?

2383
02:38:25,909 --> 02:38:26,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

2384
02:38:26,932 --> 02:38:31,976
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hmm.

2385
02:38:32,897 --> 02:38:38,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a question with a lot of gray area, because it's not like you can draw a line and say, you know, like you did three years and two development houses.

2386
02:38:38,862 --> 02:38:47,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that doesn't necessarily take everything into effect, because I think a game like Smash Bros., I think had more... Didn't the one on the Wii take more than three years to develop?

2387
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:48,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it did.

2388
02:38:48,571 --> 02:38:48,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't it take...

2389
02:38:50,212 --> 02:39:07,362
[SPEAKER_10]: more like four you know and it came out okay the game was pretty good it's one of the better Wii titles you know it worked out yeah so you know I don't think you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long how long has Bioshock Infinite been right right delayed by years

2390
02:39:08,899 --> 02:39:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe, you know, how long has The Last Guardian been in the film?

2391
02:39:13,101 --> 02:39:15,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's never going to come out.

2392
02:39:15,462 --> 02:39:17,822
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Final Fantasy Versus XIII?

2393
02:39:18,603 --> 02:39:20,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a great example, huh?

2394
02:39:20,804 --> 02:39:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Agito XIII came out as zero.

2395
02:39:26,457 --> 02:39:27,678
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2396
02:39:45,791 --> 02:39:57,551
[SPEAKER_10]: done, cancelled, money pulled that's what happens, that's part of the ebb and flow of it, so, you know, if there's enough development and things to show every few months, the game keeps going but if it stops, the game is done

2397
02:40:01,132 --> 02:40:01,653
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2398
02:40:22,914 --> 02:40:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bugs that the internet are talking about are nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Saints Row.

2399
02:40:29,017 --> 02:40:32,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's child's play.

2400
02:40:33,579 --> 02:40:35,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games have bugs down to a fine art.

2401
02:40:36,521 --> 02:40:37,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, have a good show, guys.

2402
02:40:38,302 --> 02:40:39,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Steel, UT.

2403
02:40:39,202 --> 02:40:40,162
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having a great show.

2404
02:40:41,283 --> 02:40:41,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

2405
02:40:43,284 --> 02:40:47,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com if you want to help us be a great show, too.

2406
02:40:48,306 --> 02:40:49,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2407
02:41:05,356 --> 02:41:12,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The self-entitled wads of fuck that drive in the parking lot at Whole Foods.

2408
02:41:13,846 --> 02:41:21,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how expensive your damn car is or how much gas it guzzles or how organic you fucking eat.

2409
02:41:21,876 --> 02:41:23,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to fucking drive!

2410
02:41:24,261 --> 02:41:53,489
[SPEAKER_03]: what a great place to find assholes I know you find assholes of all varieties and not just inside the shopping place another one goes to god I forgot what it was oh yeah, goes to Origin and the Mass Effect 3 update that just happened because I want my console back bitches, however I once again got Flycam working and

2411
02:41:55,868 --> 02:42:03,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being sick, because my son just drives home every single illness like a fisherman's net for illness.

2412
02:42:04,432 --> 02:42:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of sucks.

2413
02:42:05,332 --> 02:42:06,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think that's what children do?

2414
02:42:06,673 --> 02:42:07,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their revenge?

2415
02:42:08,574 --> 02:42:09,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge for what?

2416
02:42:09,554 --> 02:42:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Discipline.

2417
02:42:12,426 --> 02:42:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2418
02:42:14,827 --> 02:42:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess F you to that and F you to having to move my desk upstairs because for some dumb reason management thought it was a great idea to fucking flip the building upside down and so they have everybody from the third floor moving to the second floor and everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit I gotta move because I store all sorts of weird shit at my desk like arcade parts.

2419
02:42:41,079 --> 02:42:51,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an MP5 and a System 573 board for Dance Maniac's second mix, a coin box, and a Neo Geo arcade board at my desk.

2420
02:42:52,288 --> 02:43:04,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Among a bunch of figurines, I have a Gundam collection, I have anime stuff up on my shelves, and I have a what I consider life-size papercraft model of a Koopa.

2421
02:43:05,908 --> 02:43:09,392
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have a chicken that has an Elebit riding on top of it.

2422
02:43:09,432 --> 02:43:09,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2423
02:43:10,152 --> 02:43:12,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a chicken with an Elebit riding on top.

2424
02:43:12,635 --> 02:43:14,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone fucking remember Elebits?

2425
02:43:14,857 --> 02:43:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

2426
02:43:15,678 --> 02:43:16,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami?

2427
02:43:16,899 --> 02:43:18,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make another Elebits game.

2428
02:43:19,702 --> 02:43:20,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Wako, go ahead.

2429
02:43:22,218 --> 02:43:35,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, gosh, I was talking about this with my wife, and I was like, you know what, F you to the podcast app on iPod, iPhone, which is pretty old, but I finally updated my iPod, even though I heard that it was terrible.

2430
02:43:36,108 --> 02:43:43,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was really mad because I couldn't scan through the show to find, like, every time I plug it into my car, it would reset back at the start, and I hated that.

2431
02:43:43,733 --> 02:43:48,796
[SPEAKER_11]: But before, I could always just, uh, you know, like, kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at.

2432
02:43:49,176 --> 02:43:50,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But I couldn't do that, and I couldn't figure it out.

2433
02:43:51,998 --> 02:43:53,579
[SPEAKER_11]: and two seconds later she finds out how to do it.

2434
02:43:53,599 --> 02:43:58,603
[SPEAKER_11]: You swipe the little logo for the show up and then there's a deal in there and you shuttle it out.

2435
02:43:58,643 --> 02:44:00,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel so stupid, but... The podcast app is terrible.

2436
02:44:00,965 --> 02:44:03,667
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still terrible, so still F you the podcast app.

2437
02:44:03,747 --> 02:44:05,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, you Stitcher to listen to the show.

2438
02:44:06,229 --> 02:44:08,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, but it's... You gotta stream Stitcher, don't you?

2439
02:44:08,471 --> 02:44:09,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

2440
02:44:09,411 --> 02:44:11,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta download because I listen to the card.

2441
02:44:11,413 --> 02:44:14,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I think Stitcher will now let you download.

2442
02:44:14,315 --> 02:44:18,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say that's something they added to because a lot of podcasters were complaining about that.

2443
02:44:18,538 --> 02:44:19,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they added that.

2444
02:44:19,719 --> 02:44:20,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check that out.

2445
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:22,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I listen in the car, so I can't stream.

2446
02:44:22,644 --> 02:44:23,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to.

2447
02:44:23,585 --> 02:44:24,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

2448
02:44:24,667 --> 02:44:24,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

2449
02:44:25,167 --> 02:44:25,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

2450
02:44:26,970 --> 02:44:27,270
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2451
02:44:27,771 --> 02:44:31,817
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't have tomorrow off, unlike a lot of yous.

2452
02:44:32,458 --> 02:44:32,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't either.

2453
02:44:34,488 --> 02:44:35,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm unemployed.

2454
02:44:36,771 --> 02:44:38,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.

2455
02:44:38,993 --> 02:44:40,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas in pajamas.

2456
02:44:41,296 --> 02:44:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to that.

2457
02:44:42,137 --> 02:44:43,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get tomorrow off.

2458
02:44:44,099 --> 02:44:45,140
[SPEAKER_10]: What's a president's day?

2459
02:44:45,521 --> 02:44:46,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Also F you to Shane.

2460
02:44:48,044 --> 02:44:50,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking bought Pokemon games for Shane.

2461
02:44:51,127 --> 02:44:51,267
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2462
02:44:51,327 --> 02:44:51,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a hen...

2463
02:45:19,998 --> 02:45:20,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Hentai something.

2464
02:45:20,819 --> 02:45:21,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what it was called now.

2465
02:45:22,219 --> 02:45:24,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked funny.

2466
02:45:25,101 --> 02:45:29,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he does this weird penis spin on some guy's face or something.

2467
02:45:29,583 --> 02:45:34,265
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Hentai, not Sentai.

2468
02:45:34,425 --> 02:45:35,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Back away from Loki a little bit here.

2469
02:45:37,702 --> 02:45:41,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, I think she was talking about the new American version is really terrible or something.

2470
02:45:42,703 --> 02:45:43,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Megaforce, Rangers.

2471
02:45:43,863 --> 02:45:48,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we all are entertaining this fucking Power Rangers discussion.

2472
02:45:48,244 --> 02:45:48,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Knock it off.

2473
02:45:49,364 --> 02:45:52,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you hush, because I have like two Laserdiscs.

2474
02:45:53,365 --> 02:45:58,946
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger, and the other one is like another, I think, Mega Ranger movie.

2475
02:45:59,406 --> 02:46:00,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So, shut up.

2476
02:46:00,447 --> 02:46:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hentai common.

2477
02:46:02,267 --> 02:46:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

2478
02:46:02,987 --> 02:46:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Hentai Kamen.

2479
02:46:03,868 --> 02:46:04,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Hentai Kamen.

2480
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:05,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2481
02:46:05,731 --> 02:46:10,558
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a brand new superhero movie.

2482
02:46:11,319 --> 02:46:11,679
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2483
02:46:11,759 --> 02:46:13,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to a few more topics for you guys.

2484
02:46:13,983 --> 02:46:19,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange On Radio, Loki.

2485
02:46:20,359 --> 02:46:25,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some Kickstarter games that are actually getting publishers, which is kind of cool.

2486
02:46:25,827 --> 02:46:29,011
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is this game called Takedown.

2487
02:46:29,331 --> 02:46:31,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a tactical shooter game.

2488
02:46:32,055 --> 02:46:36,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeing kind of like a slow-paced Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or something like that.

2489
02:46:37,562 --> 02:47:04,957
[SPEAKER_02]: um sort of like that sort of series I guess um but it's gonna be coming out by 5 of 5 games uh called uh was it Takedown Red Saber and I guess the guy that developed it was uh was it Christian Allen oh I guess that's why it's similar to Tom Grant he was uh one of the creative directors for the Ghost Recon series and also I guess um SWAT and Rainbow Six so that's kind of cool um so that's gonna be coming out uh it doesn't say when though but uh sometime in 2013 um

2490
02:47:06,217 --> 02:47:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: and then uh Wildman we remember that was the one that was being done by Gas Powered Games kind of like as the last ditch hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going out of business thing well actually they canceled their Kickstarter um so and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter is because it got purchased by Wargaming it was I think World of Tanks so no word if they're going to still be doing the Wildman game but uh at least now they have some funding

2491
02:47:37,090 --> 02:47:37,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

2492
02:47:40,853 --> 02:47:42,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.

2493
02:47:42,855 --> 02:47:43,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one here too.

2494
02:47:44,257 --> 02:47:50,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about a 90s arcade racer because there's just not enough Daytona USA in your life and the like.

2495
02:47:51,707 --> 02:47:52,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome.

2496
02:48:11,336 --> 02:48:17,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are going to do this new racing game for iOS, Android, and Wii U. I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing... They picked it up.

2497
02:48:17,899 --> 02:48:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the publisher.

2498
02:48:18,639 --> 02:48:18,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2499
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:19,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they picked it up.

2500
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2501
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:21,521
[SPEAKER_10]: They are the publisher.

2502
02:48:22,601 --> 02:48:33,706
[SPEAKER_10]: The producer is Tyrone Rodriguez, is the Nysalis producer who will be producing and helping the game come to the iOS, Android, and Wii U, which I think is interesting.

2503
02:48:33,886 --> 02:48:34,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's one that...

2504
02:48:35,667 --> 02:48:37,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're not talking about 360 or PlayStation.

2505
02:48:37,729 --> 02:48:41,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Wii U. PC, Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.

2506
02:48:42,873 --> 02:48:43,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool.

2507
02:48:43,473 --> 02:48:43,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2508
02:48:44,194 --> 02:48:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost backed it, but I'm poor.

2509
02:48:46,976 --> 02:48:47,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm poor.

2510
02:48:48,945 --> 02:48:50,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's it.

2511
02:48:50,866 --> 02:48:52,727
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get to the Skype line.

2512
02:48:52,747 --> 02:48:57,108
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2513
02:48:57,649 --> 02:49:01,370
[SPEAKER_10]: We will talk about what's going on in games.

2514
02:49:01,770 --> 02:49:02,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever you want to talk about tonight.

2515
02:49:02,851 --> 02:49:03,811
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a lot of stuff tonight.

2516
02:49:03,871 --> 02:49:05,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure it's going to elicit some sort of reaction.

2517
02:49:05,912 --> 02:49:07,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Skype line is open now.

2518
02:49:07,953 --> 02:49:10,734
[SPEAKER_10]: While we wait for some calls, Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?

2519
02:49:14,279 --> 02:49:25,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really have anything I wanted to talk about other than I wanted to go into a little bit more detail with that whole iPad thing because they had some cool notes that I missed in there after I read through it.

2520
02:49:25,785 --> 02:49:31,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently those cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant for capturing objects that you place on top of it.

2521
02:49:32,089 --> 02:49:38,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it would capture both sides of a 3D object or they even may have more than just a couple cameras on there.

2522
02:49:39,172 --> 02:49:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would import the full 3D object into your game, which is kind of cool.

2523
02:49:45,498 --> 02:49:47,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they said 6-axis.

2524
02:49:49,581 --> 02:49:52,023
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to have some sort of LED strips on the side.

2525
02:49:52,043 --> 02:49:57,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that part that looked like the whole plywood thing.

2526
02:49:57,788 --> 02:49:59,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go to the phones because we're getting calls.

2527
02:49:59,409 --> 02:50:00,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2528
02:50:00,370 --> 02:50:00,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2529
02:50:01,010 --> 02:50:01,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, can you guys hear me?

2530
02:50:02,071 --> 02:50:02,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, we can hear you.

2531
02:50:03,556 --> 02:50:06,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I just wanted to say, hey, what's up guys?

2532
02:50:06,997 --> 02:50:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Long time no talk to you.

2533
02:50:08,177 --> 02:50:08,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this?

2534
02:50:10,378 --> 02:50:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce yourself.

2535
02:50:12,358 --> 02:50:12,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Gamer Girl.

2536
02:50:13,059 --> 02:50:14,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamer Girl!

2537
02:50:14,279 --> 02:50:15,139
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Gamer Girl?

2538
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:22,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know what to talk about.

2539
02:50:22,834 --> 02:50:25,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think she's also lagged a little.

2540
02:50:25,415 --> 02:50:26,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think you're listening to us.

2541
02:50:27,695 --> 02:50:28,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear a little bit of echo.

2542
02:50:28,916 --> 02:50:30,876
[SPEAKER_10]: You might want to mute the radio in the background there.

2543
02:50:31,336 --> 02:50:32,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's no problem.

2544
02:50:32,837 --> 02:50:34,677
[SPEAKER_10]: What was going through your head when you hit the dial button?

2545
02:50:34,757 --> 02:50:36,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it still echoing?

2546
02:50:37,498 --> 02:50:37,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

2547
02:50:37,838 --> 02:50:40,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a second.

2548
02:50:42,039 --> 02:50:42,559
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hold.

2549
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:42,940
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll wait.

2550
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:43,380
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing.

2551
02:50:43,700 --> 02:50:47,261
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't got nothing better to do.

2552
02:50:47,281 --> 02:50:49,541
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make up another rumor and talk about it.

2553
02:50:49,581 --> 02:50:50,161
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that sound?

2554
02:50:50,181 --> 02:50:50,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shoot.

2555
02:50:50,902 --> 02:50:51,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what's up, gamer girl?

2556
02:50:54,246 --> 02:50:55,146
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind tonight?

2557
02:50:57,447 --> 02:51:01,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I don't know if I'm still... We hear you, honey.

2558
02:51:02,308 --> 02:51:02,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep talking.

2559
02:51:03,309 --> 02:51:04,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I get a what what?

2560
02:51:05,789 --> 02:51:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, shoot.

2561
02:51:07,270 --> 02:51:08,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think she can hear us.

2562
02:51:08,770 --> 02:51:10,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Honey, try back later, because I don't think you can hear us.

2563
02:51:11,371 --> 02:51:11,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to say.

2564
02:51:13,471 --> 02:51:14,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, that's always depressing.

2565
02:51:15,212 --> 02:51:15,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2566
02:51:15,812 --> 02:51:16,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2567
02:51:16,952 --> 02:51:17,933
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try to get a phone.

2568
02:51:18,693 --> 02:51:19,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2569
02:51:19,553 --> 02:51:19,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2570
02:51:20,473 --> 02:51:22,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I don't know if I'm still...

2571
02:51:23,911 --> 02:51:24,652
[SPEAKER_10]: We hear you, honey.

2572
02:51:25,312 --> 02:51:26,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep talking.

2573
02:51:27,154 --> 02:51:28,254
[SPEAKER_10]: We're hearing ourselves.

2574
02:51:28,775 --> 02:51:30,696
[SPEAKER_10]: All aboard the mail train.

2575
02:51:30,736 --> 02:51:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew this was going to come up.

2576
02:51:32,578 --> 02:51:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you guys.

2577
02:51:32,998 --> 02:51:35,660
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Porkchop.

2578
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:36,220
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?

2579
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:39,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you can hear me and I can hear you?

2580
02:51:39,143 --> 02:51:39,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2581
02:51:49,642 --> 02:51:51,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's a miracle.

2582
02:51:51,784 --> 02:51:52,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I fixed the show.

2583
02:51:52,705 --> 02:51:53,386
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I fixed it.

2584
02:51:53,666 --> 02:51:54,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, guys.

2585
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.

2586
02:51:56,729 --> 02:51:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'll agree.

2587
02:51:58,390 --> 02:52:03,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all this, you know, the rumors about the PS4, this whole used games thing.

2588
02:52:04,236 --> 02:52:04,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

2589
02:52:05,023 --> 02:52:06,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to believe anymore.

2590
02:52:06,283 --> 02:52:07,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to lose faith.

2591
02:52:07,684 --> 02:52:08,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, and here we are.

2592
02:52:08,664 --> 02:52:18,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We're making all this shit up and just rumor-mongering, and we just make the whole thing worse in our desperate attempt to get all the thousands of clicks that we get every week here on the show.

2593
02:52:19,407 --> 02:52:21,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.

2594
02:52:21,348 --> 02:52:27,369
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys were talking about old games and chat rooms, especially games in development hell and stuff like that.

2595
02:52:28,209 --> 02:52:32,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of sad to hear the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and The Last Guardian.

2596
02:52:32,691 --> 02:52:33,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking forward to those.

2597
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:41,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't these companies just wake the fuck up and realize these games will sell?

2598
02:52:41,342 --> 02:52:42,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I know The Last Guardian will anyway.

2599
02:52:43,283 --> 02:52:45,324
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.

2600
02:52:45,344 --> 02:52:46,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So get on that.

2601
02:52:46,885 --> 02:52:50,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop bitching about fucking iPads and all this bullshit.

2602
02:52:50,866 --> 02:52:52,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?

2603
02:52:53,767 --> 02:52:58,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes big titles come out and they don't sell, and it makes developers nervous.

2604
02:52:59,693 --> 02:53:02,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there was like, you know, sometimes there is a lot of hype.

2605
02:53:02,955 --> 02:53:05,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Hype is just the theme for this week.

2606
02:53:05,217 --> 02:53:13,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising and I looked at the footage and I think, OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games kind of real justice like Bayonetta.

2607
02:53:14,183 --> 02:53:14,683
[SPEAKER_01]: They did that.

2608
02:53:15,223 --> 02:53:21,708
[SPEAKER_01]: But this game, there's something I can't shake about it as much as I love Metal Gear Solid and Raiden himself.

2609
02:53:21,748 --> 02:53:22,528
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cool character.

2610
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:24,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just getting a weird feeling off it.

2611
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:26,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.

2612
02:53:28,624 --> 02:53:30,365
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going into your decision ultimately?

2613
02:53:31,126 --> 02:53:33,588
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to help you get un-weird, if anything?

2614
02:53:34,388 --> 02:53:34,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2615
02:53:35,409 --> 02:53:39,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fact that spin-off titles aren't always great.

2616
02:53:41,674 --> 02:53:44,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I'm a bit tentative about.

2617
02:53:45,256 --> 02:53:56,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching it and I'm thinking, even DMC, the new Devil May Cry game, I'm very scared to buy that because I really, really loved the series before that and now it's just turned on its head.

2618
02:53:56,545 --> 02:53:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: The game where you're not Dante?

2619
02:53:59,610 --> 02:54:00,631
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Where You're Not Dante?

2620
02:54:01,291 --> 02:54:03,412
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game Where You're Dante Mark 2, yeah.

2621
02:54:03,933 --> 02:54:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.

2622
02:54:08,495 --> 02:54:10,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like another doctor, it's okay.

2623
02:54:10,837 --> 02:54:13,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.

2624
02:54:13,938 --> 02:54:14,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.

2625
02:54:14,739 --> 02:54:16,340
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just retconned in there.

2626
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:20,062
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is there?

2627
02:54:21,462 --> 02:54:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry is the other kind of thing about it, is that this version in particular, I don't know if that's Bayonetta's fault.

2628
02:54:27,944 --> 02:54:28,724
[SPEAKER_01]: The Devil May Metro?

2629
02:54:29,124 --> 02:54:29,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinda, yeah.

2630
02:54:30,045 --> 02:54:31,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Devil May Metro, a little bit.

2631
02:54:31,985 --> 02:54:33,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not a bad thing.

2632
02:54:33,826 --> 02:54:37,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.

2633
02:54:37,267 --> 02:54:38,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard something like that.

2634
02:54:38,687 --> 02:54:41,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the spitting image of the guy who developed the game.

2635
02:54:41,968 --> 02:54:42,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?

2636
02:54:42,908 --> 02:54:43,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be worse.

2637
02:54:43,489 --> 02:54:51,091
[SPEAKER_02]: He could have the face of, like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried or... Or one of the Jonas Brothers.

2638
02:54:51,611 --> 02:54:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be... I'm going to make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.

2639
02:54:57,056 --> 02:54:59,438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it could be a Dante de Medna version.

2640
02:55:02,341 --> 02:55:03,722
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like DLC.

2641
02:55:03,863 --> 02:55:06,465
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like for guilty pleasures and stuff like that.

2642
02:55:06,565 --> 02:55:12,170
[SPEAKER_10]: What is ultimately going to... The boardroom guys want to get in your head as a gamer.

2643
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:17,295
[SPEAKER_10]: What is ultimately going to make that decision for you if you are going to pick up Devil May Cry or not?

2644
02:55:18,994 --> 02:55:46,982
[SPEAKER_01]: if you just leave it alone you know don't don't don't don't twist it to think that you know this is a reboot and as far as I'm concerned the game was fine before they went and did all this I don't know fucking lost city of demons turning the fucking buildings upside down it was fine when he was the demon hunter and he was hot and he had white hair initially but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo I don't know what to make of him at all okay I'm just

2645
02:55:47,625 --> 02:55:48,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ruin it.

2646
02:55:48,325 --> 02:55:49,385
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can really say.

2647
02:55:49,405 --> 02:55:51,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play boardroom guy for a second here.

2648
02:55:52,586 --> 02:55:54,487
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you get the female audience.

2649
02:55:54,947 --> 02:55:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You go the bayonet route.

2650
02:55:57,888 --> 02:56:01,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You have his penis basically act like her hair in that game.

2651
02:56:01,469 --> 02:56:03,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just flopping around, attacking things.

2652
02:56:04,729 --> 02:56:06,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be frightening.

2653
02:56:07,710 --> 02:56:10,591
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do, but still.

2654
02:56:13,291 --> 02:56:18,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to actually have a main male character who's just in completely oversexed positions.

2655
02:56:19,375 --> 02:56:20,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Go play Devil May Cry.

2656
02:56:21,016 --> 02:56:24,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I want the over-the-top, like, you know, a comic book cover.

2657
02:56:25,458 --> 02:56:26,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Done by Rob Liefeld.

2658
02:56:27,239 --> 02:56:29,641
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, you want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.

2659
02:56:29,661 --> 02:56:31,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.

2660
02:56:31,562 --> 02:56:32,562
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what she's talking about.

2661
02:56:32,662 --> 02:56:33,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious.

2662
02:56:34,203 --> 02:56:35,184
[SPEAKER_10]: You want a Hawkeye game.

2663
02:56:35,802 --> 02:56:38,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy Renner stars as the main character.

2664
02:56:38,763 --> 02:56:39,564
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be perfect.

2665
02:56:39,764 --> 02:56:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just play Jeremy Renner's butt the game with a Wii move.

2666
02:56:47,207 --> 02:56:49,067
[SPEAKER_10]: You all are taking this show to a very strange place.

2667
02:56:51,208 --> 02:56:54,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Porkchop, I've got to wrap up so I can try to get another call.

2668
02:56:55,150 --> 02:56:56,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other thoughts for us tonight?

2669
02:56:56,830 --> 02:56:58,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thanks very much.

2670
02:56:58,091 --> 02:56:59,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you personally.

2671
02:56:59,591 --> 02:57:00,932
[SPEAKER_01]: You put me on the path of exile.

2672
02:57:01,312 --> 02:57:03,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very satisfying and I'm going to play more of it.

2673
02:57:04,602 --> 02:57:05,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Diablo 3, finally.

2674
02:57:33,463 --> 02:57:39,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was Diablo, but even so, just playing it and killing things, it was worth it.

2675
02:57:39,647 --> 02:57:41,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally worth waiting, and the internet was crap downloading.

2676
02:57:41,909 --> 02:57:42,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Took ages.

2677
02:57:42,689 --> 02:57:43,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth it.

2678
02:57:43,329 --> 02:57:45,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Go try it out, at least, even if you're not a fan.

2679
02:57:45,631 --> 02:57:46,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it out.

2680
02:57:47,952 --> 02:57:49,674
[SPEAKER_10]: A ringing endorsement from overseas.

2681
02:57:49,694 --> 02:57:50,054
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

2682
02:57:50,294 --> 02:57:50,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't beat that.

2683
02:57:51,054 --> 02:57:53,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.

2684
02:57:53,696 --> 02:57:54,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Good girl.

2685
02:57:54,256 --> 02:57:54,517
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2686
02:57:55,197 --> 02:57:55,797
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, Porkchop.

2687
02:57:55,857 --> 02:57:56,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, buddy.

2688
02:57:57,258 --> 02:57:57,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it easy, guys.

2689
02:57:58,039 --> 02:57:58,279
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2690
02:57:58,319 --> 02:57:58,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

2691
02:57:58,739 --> 02:57:59,059
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

2692
02:57:59,079 --> 02:57:59,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2693
02:58:00,826 --> 02:58:03,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I will try this call one more time because it's a new name, I think.

2694
02:58:03,368 --> 02:58:04,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2695
02:58:04,349 --> 02:58:04,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this?

2696
02:58:06,530 --> 02:58:07,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, you gotta call Echo 123.

2697
02:58:09,232 --> 02:58:09,692
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2698
02:58:09,712 --> 02:58:10,833
[SPEAKER_10]: And turn off your speakers.

2699
02:58:11,293 --> 02:58:13,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Use headphones.

2700
02:58:13,395 --> 02:58:15,076
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta stop the show when you're calling in.

2701
02:58:15,436 --> 02:58:16,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

2702
02:58:18,158 --> 02:58:20,239
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.

2703
02:58:20,279 --> 02:58:21,140
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another one coming in.

2704
02:58:21,460 --> 02:58:22,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2705
02:58:22,421 --> 02:58:22,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2706
02:58:23,782 --> 02:58:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You talk about Path of Exile way too much.

2707
02:58:26,904 --> 02:58:27,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

2708
02:58:27,504 --> 02:58:27,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

2709
02:58:28,064 --> 02:58:28,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Shane.

2710
02:58:29,517 --> 02:58:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

2711
02:58:30,137 --> 02:58:30,637
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

2712
02:58:31,418 --> 02:58:31,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2713
02:58:31,738 --> 02:58:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing Pokemon.

2714
02:58:32,918 --> 02:58:36,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hate boner, since we've been using that term a lot tonight, why the hate boner for Path of Exile?

2715
02:58:37,220 --> 02:58:39,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.

2716
02:58:40,761 --> 02:58:42,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Path of Exile?

2717
02:58:42,902 --> 02:58:48,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer, because it was crap.

2718
02:58:50,164 --> 02:58:51,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, there's a difference.

2719
02:58:51,765 --> 02:58:52,565
[SPEAKER_10]: And Torchlight 2.

2720
02:58:52,605 --> 02:58:53,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Torchlight 2?

2721
02:58:54,246 --> 02:58:57,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the first one, the demo of it, and it was kind of boring.

2722
02:58:57,607 --> 02:58:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

2723
02:58:59,403 --> 02:59:01,244
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the problem, Shane.

2724
02:59:01,804 --> 02:59:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2725
02:59:03,465 --> 02:59:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: We have stuff to do.

2726
02:59:06,086 --> 02:59:09,728
[SPEAKER_04]: But I gotta watch Kyoryuger some more because it's so funny.

2727
02:59:10,148 --> 02:59:11,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to watch it now.

2728
02:59:11,209 --> 02:59:12,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, why did you call in tonight?

2729
02:59:12,349 --> 02:59:14,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile or did you have something else?

2730
02:59:16,851 --> 02:59:17,892
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's pretty much it.

2731
02:59:20,623 --> 02:59:22,084
[SPEAKER_04]: and Nino Cooney sucks there.

2732
02:59:22,204 --> 02:59:22,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey!

2733
02:59:24,166 --> 02:59:25,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game he hasn't played that he hates.

2734
02:59:25,867 --> 02:59:26,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Nino Cooney.

2735
02:59:27,128 --> 02:59:28,550
[SPEAKER_11]: You have it.

2736
02:59:28,590 --> 02:59:29,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have it.

2737
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:30,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not fun.

2738
02:59:30,411 --> 02:59:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It is super boring.

2739
02:59:31,932 --> 02:59:34,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pokemon aspect is cool and the battles are fine.

2740
02:59:34,454 --> 02:59:35,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like the battles.

2741
02:59:35,515 --> 02:59:37,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But the story is terrible.

2742
02:59:37,857 --> 02:59:38,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

2743
02:59:38,558 --> 02:59:42,961
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane.

2744
02:59:43,001 --> 02:59:44,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.

2745
02:59:45,083 --> 02:59:47,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I got into probably... Are you playing Persona?

2746
02:59:48,105 --> 02:59:49,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.

2747
02:59:49,946 --> 02:59:50,047
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

2748
02:59:50,067 --> 02:59:50,127
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

2749
02:59:50,167 --> 02:59:50,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody proof.

2750
02:59:51,668 --> 02:59:56,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect, and we have the Pokemon, and... Echo Image.

2751
02:59:57,292 --> 02:59:59,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway.

2752
02:59:59,893 --> 03:00:00,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was in DDR.

2753
03:00:01,715 --> 03:00:05,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance, was largely in part to Shane.

2754
03:00:05,497 --> 03:00:05,797
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2755
03:00:06,858 --> 03:00:31,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I do influence Shane sometimes and Nino Cooney was one of them is that I convinced him to get Nino Cooney right now he doesn't like it he's gonna give me his copy I made the wrong choice it's just it's like the bizarre review Nino Cooney every reviewer is like no the story's amazing but you know there's some problems with the with the gameplay and the battle system battle system's great but story oh sucks now this means Shane can give me his copy

2756
03:00:32,375 --> 03:00:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: of Ni No Kuni.

2757
03:00:33,196 --> 03:00:33,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2758
03:00:33,897 --> 03:00:40,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little limited edition case I have with it because it goes for like 40 bucks just the case alone.

2759
03:00:41,084 --> 03:00:41,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

2760
03:00:42,866 --> 03:00:43,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get the book?

2761
03:00:44,848 --> 03:00:45,969
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did not get a book.

2762
03:00:45,989 --> 03:00:46,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I want that book.

2763
03:00:47,831 --> 03:00:47,991
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2764
03:00:49,733 --> 03:00:51,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.

2765
03:00:51,774 --> 03:00:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The story is so boring.

2766
03:00:53,635 --> 03:00:55,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about any of the characters.

2767
03:00:55,316 --> 03:00:59,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I care about my little Mighty Might guy, and that's pretty much it.

2768
03:00:59,538 --> 03:01:02,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I named him Fodder because I figured he wasn't going to be worth anything, but he's really good.

2769
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:03,520
[SPEAKER_11]: He is really good.

2770
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:07,462
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually lasts a long time, but if you read game facts, they all say, Oh, he's horrible.

2771
03:01:07,522 --> 03:01:08,362
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got bad stats.

2772
03:01:08,382 --> 03:01:11,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I just want to be clear here, Chad.

2773
03:01:11,284 --> 03:01:12,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to be clear.

2774
03:01:12,725 --> 03:01:14,746
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.

2775
03:01:15,327 --> 03:01:15,507
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2776
03:01:15,688 --> 03:01:20,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But you are current on every episode of Power Rangers ever made, correct?

2777
03:01:21,376 --> 03:01:23,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, not entirely.

2778
03:01:23,519 --> 03:01:25,743
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.

2779
03:01:26,043 --> 03:01:26,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, I see.

2780
03:01:26,925 --> 03:01:28,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And how's the story in Pokemon?

2781
03:01:28,467 --> 03:01:29,789
[SPEAKER_10]: You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?

2782
03:01:30,205 --> 03:01:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes Okay, Shane, wait I have to ask you, because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages What is your favorite Sentai series?

2783
03:01:38,209 --> 03:01:39,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Sentai series?

2784
03:01:39,329 --> 03:01:43,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Probably Gokaiger Really?

2785
03:01:43,671 --> 03:01:59,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it cracks me up, but Kyoryuger might take its place I still Oh, and Dekaranger I still say Megaranger was the best I don't know, I haven't seen that one Most of the later ones Go watch Megaranger, it's awesome

2786
03:01:59,537 --> 03:02:00,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys done?

2787
03:02:01,484 --> 03:02:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: No, are you done?

2788
03:02:02,527 --> 03:02:02,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2789
03:02:03,631 --> 03:02:04,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, have a good time.

2795
03:02:23,058 --> 03:02:24,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some.

03:02:30,824 --> 03:02:31,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I got time for one more call.

2800
03:02:33,607 --> 03:02:34,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Ain't nobody got time for that.

2801
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:37,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I got bronchitis!

2802
03:02:40,444 --> 03:02:41,725
[SPEAKER_10]: That lady's making a killing.

2803
03:02:42,365 --> 03:02:44,087
[SPEAKER_10]: But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?

2804
03:02:44,127 --> 03:02:45,688
[SPEAKER_10]: She was on Tosh last year.

2805
03:02:45,928 --> 03:02:48,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.

2806
03:02:49,411 --> 03:02:50,132
[SPEAKER_10]: He was on Tosh too.

2807
03:02:52,133 --> 03:02:53,074
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tough to make a living.

2808
03:02:53,474 --> 03:02:54,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna find out now.

2809
03:02:54,255 --> 03:02:54,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

2810
03:02:54,755 --> 03:02:55,676

03:02:58,738 --> 03:02:59,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Ranma from the East Coast.

2814
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:00,320
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going?

2815
03:03:01,181 --> 03:03:02,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, pretty good, pretty good.

2816
03:03:04,282 --> 03:03:07,244
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.

2817
03:03:07,684 --> 03:03:09,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I heard.

2818
03:03:09,144 --> 03:03:09,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the memo.

2819
03:03:09,825 --> 03:03:10,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job on that.

2820
03:03:10,845 --> 03:03:12,346
[SPEAKER_10]: But congrats on your first live show.

2821
03:03:12,886 --> 03:03:14,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, and we try.

2822
03:03:14,426 --> 03:03:17,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Evidently, Winamp didn't like a certain MP3 and decided to give me the middle finger.

2823
03:03:19,031 --> 03:03:21,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It might do that with some of the foreign name titles, just so you know.

2824
03:03:21,953 --> 03:03:22,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have warned you about that.

2825
03:03:23,114 --> 03:03:26,576
[SPEAKER_10]: These are things we learn through trial and error.

2826
03:03:29,158 --> 03:03:31,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.

2827
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:32,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2828
03:03:32,380 --> 03:03:38,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And Anime Jam Session can also be heard live on VOG Network Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.

2829
03:03:39,104 --> 03:03:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: VOG got two new live shows.

2830
03:03:40,365 --> 03:03:43,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.

2831
03:03:43,307 --> 03:03:44,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like we kind of doubled.

2832
03:03:45,289 --> 03:03:45,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

2833
03:03:45,809 --> 03:03:46,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we went from three to five.

2834
03:03:47,050 --> 03:03:47,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It's close.

2835
03:03:49,051 --> 03:03:49,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty cool.

2836
03:03:51,912 --> 03:03:54,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winamp?

2837
03:03:57,293 --> 03:03:58,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Just making it through school.

2838
03:04:00,614 --> 03:04:01,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Just chilling, just making it through school.

2839
03:04:01,974 --> 03:04:02,555
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you studying?

2840
03:04:03,635 --> 03:04:04,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Networking technology.

2841
03:04:04,835 --> 03:04:06,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you didn't get the notice on that.

2842
03:04:06,756 --> 03:04:08,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided to go back to college.

2843
03:04:10,763 --> 03:04:11,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2844
03:04:11,263 --> 03:04:11,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2845
03:04:27,590 --> 03:04:43,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, you gotta tell our audience, I know it's a video game show, but like, I was reading, I saw it on Tumblr, I saw it on Facebook, I saw it on Twitter, like, there was drama everywhere, give us a little bit, give us a little bit of the drama, give us a tease.

2846
03:04:44,483 --> 03:05:02,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, the main issue was cosplayers in Congo was a kind of piss that an international Jewish organization took up a majority of the convention area and places for taking photography and there was pretty much insults going between both sides back and forth.

2847
03:05:03,756 --> 03:05:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2848
03:05:04,997 --> 03:05:05,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, really.

2849
03:05:07,979 --> 03:05:11,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?

2850
03:05:14,502 --> 03:05:19,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like when you get two groups of people together who decide to act like name-calling five-year-olds.

2851
03:05:19,145 --> 03:05:21,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.

2852
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:41,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, update on Antoine Dodson.

2853
03:05:42,223 --> 03:05:45,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Released a single in 2012 called Lovesick Lullaby.

2854
03:05:45,726 --> 03:05:46,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And how did that sell?

2855
03:05:46,847 --> 03:05:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I just downloaded it.

2856
03:05:48,108 --> 03:05:48,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

2857
03:05:49,830 --> 03:05:50,731
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the problem.

2858
03:05:51,452 --> 03:05:52,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it, Ooptron.

2859
03:05:52,353 --> 03:05:53,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at your life, look at your choices.

2860
03:05:54,875 --> 03:05:55,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Antoine Dodson songs?

2861
03:05:56,276 --> 03:05:57,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Ain't nobody got time for that.

2862
03:05:58,539 --> 03:06:00,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?

2863
03:06:00,921 --> 03:06:02,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, it's 2013.

2864
03:06:02,383 --> 03:06:02,903
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new year.

2865
03:06:03,444 --> 03:06:04,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Ain't nobody got time for that.

2866
03:06:04,585 --> 03:06:11,452
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.

2867
03:06:11,692 --> 03:06:12,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2868
03:06:12,313 --> 03:06:13,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in Huntsville.

2869
03:06:13,554 --> 03:06:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2870
03:06:13,814 --> 03:06:14,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Huntsville.

2871
03:06:14,455 --> 03:06:15,556
[SPEAKER_10]: He smoked marijuana.

2872
03:06:15,576 --> 03:06:18,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out.

2873
03:06:18,199 --> 03:06:18,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

2874
03:06:24,022 --> 03:06:25,384
[SPEAKER_10]: What else should I ask you about, Ranma?

2875
03:06:25,444 --> 03:06:25,804
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2876
03:06:27,405 --> 03:06:28,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a few things to say.

2877
03:06:29,527 --> 03:06:30,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, and I'll be on my way.

2878
03:06:31,649 --> 03:06:38,134
[SPEAKER_08]: The convention that you went to was called Animation on Display, and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Abare, was there as a guest.

2879
03:06:39,335 --> 03:06:39,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

2880
03:06:40,315 --> 03:06:40,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2881
03:06:41,356 --> 03:06:47,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is called Zuden Sentai Kyuruger.

2882
03:06:48,062 --> 03:06:50,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the third Sentai series based off of Dinosaurs.

2883
03:06:50,764 --> 03:06:50,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2884
03:06:51,718 --> 03:06:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, because what was the one?

2885
03:06:55,540 --> 03:06:56,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Dairanger.

2886
03:06:56,080 --> 03:06:56,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Dino Thunder?

2887
03:06:56,961 --> 03:06:57,581
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Dairanger.

2888
03:06:57,601 --> 03:06:58,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinosaurs dress up and transform?

2889
03:06:58,761 --> 03:06:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

2890
03:06:59,882 --> 03:07:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoo Ranger was the first one.

2891
03:07:02,343 --> 03:07:04,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Zoo Ranger, that was the first one.

2892
03:07:04,164 --> 03:07:10,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Dairanger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old White Ranger guy.

2893
03:07:11,668 --> 03:07:16,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, little do many people know is that the White Ranger was actually from a completely different series.

2894
03:07:17,554 --> 03:07:18,615
[SPEAKER_03]: They had better outfits.

2895
03:07:18,855 --> 03:07:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

2896
03:07:19,776 --> 03:07:20,116
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

2897
03:07:20,296 --> 03:07:20,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they did.

2898
03:07:20,857 --> 03:07:21,897
[SPEAKER_03]: They totally had better outfits.

2899
03:07:22,498 --> 03:07:25,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ranma, after this call, I feel like I learned something.

2900
03:07:30,364 --> 03:07:31,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more things.

2901
03:07:31,145 --> 03:07:32,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get out of here.

2902
03:07:32,386 --> 03:07:34,727
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole Year of Luigi thing.

2903
03:07:35,088 --> 03:07:38,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.

2904
03:07:39,351 --> 03:07:45,636
[SPEAKER_08]: As proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie wearing my Luigi hat.

2905
03:07:46,909 --> 03:07:47,529
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

2906
03:07:47,649 --> 03:07:48,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Never wash that hat again.

2907
03:07:50,531 --> 03:07:50,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

2908
03:07:50,951 --> 03:07:52,071
[SPEAKER_10]: You should probably wash it once in a while.

2909
03:07:53,152 --> 03:07:55,533
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.

2910
03:07:55,953 --> 03:07:56,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

2911
03:07:56,313 --> 03:07:57,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that works.

2912
03:07:58,634 --> 03:08:00,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I haven't seen this picture.

2913
03:08:01,035 --> 03:08:01,575
[SPEAKER_10]: How did I miss this?

2914
03:08:01,595 --> 03:08:02,575
[SPEAKER_10]: You have not seen it?

2915
03:08:02,756 --> 03:08:03,756
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's hilarious.

2916
03:08:03,776 --> 03:08:04,296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

2917
03:08:07,622 --> 03:08:08,123
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

2918
03:08:08,463 --> 03:08:09,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh God, I love it.

2919
03:08:09,424 --> 03:08:09,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2920
03:08:10,085 --> 03:08:11,687
[SPEAKER_10]: When are you going to get your ass back out here?

2921
03:08:11,707 --> 03:08:13,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you put that on Tumblr or something?

2922
03:08:13,289 --> 03:08:15,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.

2923
03:08:16,633 --> 03:08:21,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money and I'm done with college, okay?

2924
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I want to come back out there again.

2925
03:08:23,542 --> 03:08:25,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go out there and go to a con.

2926
03:08:25,524 --> 03:08:26,626
[SPEAKER_03]: How about We Crash New York?

2927
03:08:27,822 --> 03:08:37,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Tiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here and me down there and Jovi Dea down here to do a big ol' party thing, you know what I'm saying?

2928
03:08:37,228 --> 03:08:37,708
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2929
03:08:37,728 --> 03:08:39,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.

2930
03:08:39,769 --> 03:08:41,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Only if it's a sexy party.

2931
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:43,011
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have that.

2932
03:08:43,071 --> 03:08:47,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.

2933
03:08:48,114 --> 03:08:48,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2934
03:08:48,634 --> 03:08:49,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like fun to me.

2935
03:08:49,275 --> 03:08:50,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show.

2936
03:08:51,396 --> 03:08:51,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine, okay.

2937
03:08:52,036 --> 03:08:52,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm outta here.

2938
03:08:52,537 --> 03:08:53,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

2939
03:08:53,857 --> 03:08:54,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

2940
03:08:54,358 --> 03:08:54,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

2941
03:08:55,891 --> 03:08:57,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Another A-plus phone call from Ranma.

2942
03:08:58,574 --> 03:09:01,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.

2943
03:09:02,379 --> 03:09:03,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Echo 1, 2, 3 in the future.

2944
03:09:06,223 --> 03:09:06,643
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

2945
03:09:07,504 --> 03:09:07,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2946
03:09:08,686 --> 03:09:13,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, or tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.

2947
03:09:14,132 --> 03:09:15,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit, I gotta do the tweets.

2948
03:09:17,093 --> 03:09:18,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet

2949
03:09:41,992 --> 03:10:09,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired and this guy was a George actually went for 80 plus hours and he actually finished or he beat the world record I guess at about over 84 hours and 36 million points so at least that's what the thought is right now that he has broken the record for both longest time playing on a

2950
03:10:13,294 --> 03:10:14,964
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes to score all night.

2951
03:10:17,370 --> 03:10:19,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a last-minute story if I ever heard one.

2952
03:10:19,512 --> 03:10:23,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's on topic and legit.

2953
03:10:23,776 --> 03:10:26,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.

2954
03:10:26,959 --> 03:10:28,300
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually super important.

2955
03:10:29,401 --> 03:10:34,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.

2956
03:10:35,406 --> 03:10:36,207
[SPEAKER_10]: When's it happening?

2957
03:10:37,108 --> 03:10:38,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, 5 p.m.

2958
03:10:38,609 --> 03:10:41,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m.

2959
03:10:41,792 --> 03:10:43,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Eastern, so that means in about...

2960
03:10:43,753 --> 03:11:10,787
[SPEAKER_10]: two more hours we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita and it is ahead of the February 20th event meaning this is confirmed the two events are about separate topics so the February 20th event is all about something new because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week or tonight so Loki upon hearing that you just said earlier in the show where's the information on the Vita any reaction to this hearing this

2961
03:11:11,687 --> 03:11:12,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to see what they say.

2962
03:11:12,748 --> 03:11:20,618
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the problem is when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games, and it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.

2963
03:11:21,078 --> 03:11:25,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other funny thing you want to see.

2964
03:11:25,484 --> 03:11:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and games side.

2965
03:11:30,569 --> 03:11:32,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do a lot of promotions with them.

2966
03:11:32,291 --> 03:11:37,314
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now because I probably can't go.

2967
03:11:37,914 --> 03:11:45,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possibly to go on the red carpet premiere for This Is The End with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.

2968
03:11:45,740 --> 03:11:47,541
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife might not like it.

2969
03:11:47,701 --> 03:11:48,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

2970
03:11:48,822 --> 03:11:49,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll fucking go.

2971
03:11:50,063 --> 03:11:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Our rep.

2972
03:11:51,004 --> 03:11:51,644
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Loki.

2973
03:11:51,804 --> 03:11:54,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Our rep in house has been asking me.

2974
03:11:54,866 --> 03:11:55,847
[SPEAKER_02]: She's all, okay, well, what...

2975
03:11:56,207 --> 03:12:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in the electric or electronic device that Sony has that you know what's hot right now with Sony and stuff I was like oh yeah well you know there's the PlayStation 4 it's gonna be coming out and then there's the Vita so I may actually get another Vita

2976
03:12:09,582 --> 03:12:12,423
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not having to pay for it, of course, but... You have a rough life.

2977
03:12:13,023 --> 03:12:15,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I... I might have to go to a movie premiere.

2978
03:12:15,423 --> 03:12:15,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, no.

2979
03:12:16,223 --> 03:12:17,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

2980
03:12:17,123 --> 03:12:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another Vita.

2981
03:12:17,964 --> 03:12:21,824
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.

2982
03:12:21,844 --> 03:12:30,246
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to a winery one time, and then they went to... They went to Monterey, and I got... I didn't get included in either of those trips.

2983
03:12:30,366 --> 03:12:33,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to stay back and answer phones.

2984
03:12:35,327 --> 03:12:35,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

2985
03:12:35,667 --> 03:12:36,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

2986
03:12:36,647 --> 03:12:38,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, quickly, I gotta do some quick Twitter topics here.

2987
03:12:39,050 --> 03:12:40,692
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw sent us a couple stories here.

2988
03:12:40,752 --> 03:12:42,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just gonna do one because I'm pressed for time here.

2989
03:12:43,495 --> 03:12:48,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.

2990
03:12:48,500 --> 03:12:48,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2991
03:12:49,141 --> 03:12:49,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Get out.

2992
03:12:49,781 --> 03:12:51,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that this was something they were doing.

2993
03:12:51,383 --> 03:12:53,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been floating for a little bit.

2994
03:12:53,525 --> 03:12:55,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought they had a play... On PS1 they did, right?

2995
03:12:55,508 --> 03:12:55,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

2996
03:12:57,930 --> 03:13:00,632
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the Masters of Terra something.

2997
03:13:00,732 --> 03:13:03,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.

2998
03:13:03,574 --> 03:13:07,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't, you know, amount to anything.

2999
03:13:09,739 --> 03:13:16,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct is greater than Super Metroid.

3000
03:13:16,124 --> 03:13:16,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

3001
03:13:17,305 --> 03:13:20,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know Orange Laundry is the show where every gamer has a voice.

3002
03:13:20,227 --> 03:13:20,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Except you.

3003
03:13:20,707 --> 03:13:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

3004
03:13:22,350 --> 03:13:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

3005
03:13:34,515 --> 03:13:39,079
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never said that there's a stupid question.

3006
03:13:39,539 --> 03:13:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pushing it.

3007
03:13:40,520 --> 03:13:55,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we are on the topic of Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars, and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know that

3008
03:13:56,655 --> 03:13:58,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars figures with Disney figures.

3009
03:14:17,987 --> 03:14:19,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.

3010
03:14:20,110 --> 03:14:21,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.

3011
03:14:21,412 --> 03:14:22,233
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

3012
03:14:22,333 --> 03:14:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game.

3013
03:14:28,020 --> 03:14:31,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet.

3014
03:14:32,026 --> 03:14:35,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.

3015
03:14:37,358 --> 03:14:37,658
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

3016
03:14:38,218 --> 03:14:47,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, from SSJ100, Matt, with so much negativity stemming from video games lately, someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.

3017
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:49,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

3018
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:50,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

3019
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:52,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to scan through this real quick.

3020
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:53,861
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.

3021
03:14:54,961 --> 03:15:01,722
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games, and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.

3022
03:15:01,802 --> 03:15:06,643
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a nonprofit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.

3023
03:15:07,043 --> 03:15:08,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?

3024
03:15:26,491 --> 03:15:27,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah, wah.

3025
03:15:27,452 --> 03:15:29,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Womp, womp, womp.

3026
03:15:29,773 --> 03:15:30,093
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

3027
03:15:30,893 --> 03:15:31,314
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it.

3028
03:15:31,334 --> 03:15:31,934
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to wrap up.

3029
03:15:31,954 --> 03:15:33,995
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at midnight 30 Eastern time here.

3030
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:34,755
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running a little late.

3031
03:15:34,815 --> 03:15:37,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got to go around and wrap it up.

3032
03:15:37,597 --> 03:15:40,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show and staying with us for all three hours tonight.

3033
03:15:41,979 --> 03:15:43,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, we do this show for free.

3034
03:15:45,101 --> 03:15:48,843
[SPEAKER_10]: We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that.

3035
03:15:49,183 --> 03:15:51,284
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do it because we love you guys and we love the community.

3036
03:15:51,364 --> 03:15:53,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, even the nasty emailers too.

03:15:54,365 --> 03:15:55,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you so much.

[SPEAKER_10]: You can help spread the word about our show by telling a friend.

3039

3054
03:16:22,356 --> 03:16:30,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Nino Cooney podcast, just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard.

3055
03:16:30,738 --> 03:16:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to call it Nino Podcast?

[SPEAKER_10]: Nino Podcast.

[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, my desk is just spread out.

3069
03:17:29,814 --> 03:17:30,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a mess.

3070
03:17:30,294 --> 03:17:31,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's organized chaos.

3071
03:17:31,634 --> 03:17:32,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not organized at all.

3072
03:17:32,794 --> 03:17:35,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff.
