00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February 17th, 2013.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Blarg.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Blarg, yarg. How you doing?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm tired.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tired?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, thank you for the ca-ca-coc-pa-pa.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time and then it came out.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The caffi. You were just saying it, you know, with an accent. The caffi.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love coffee.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, I love coffee too.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm drinking it and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit because I went to San Francisco yesterday.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How was San Francisco?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It was gay.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What'd you do in San Francisco? I'm sure the weather was great. What'd you do in San Francisco?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It was fantastic. Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara and, well, there was beer involved and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have been there.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's good.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, it's not just a clever title.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's freaking good pizza.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, it is. Good stuff.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, yeah, there was some bar hopping and some curry rice earlier in the day and an anime convention that I had no idea was going on.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie, because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone's like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japan town.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was like, I'm not here for the con. I'm just wearing my jacket.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you do a deadpan just like that?

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Awesome.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I love the random impromptu anime convention.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Dark Sakura approaches. Quick, throw an anime convention.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, I saw people putting on armor in the in the Japan town.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OK, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I saw people putting on armor. I was like.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not the cherry blossom festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sure enough, I, you know, I run into somebody and wearing a blue trench coat and a button up shirt.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He's like, yeah, and there's my my doctor over there.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was like, so is there a convention going on?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's like, oh, yeah, it sucks.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, I don't even remember what the convention was called.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where was that? Was it at the was it was over the Kabuki Hotel.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Interesting. You know, that's where they're going to be having the gamer expo,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but they call it gamer X now because they can't call it gamer con legal stuff.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But that's where they're having that. So it seemed like a pretty good venue.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But I mean, I want to go to that one.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But it was cosplay central all over Japan town and assholes with cameras.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's the other thing I call them assholes.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know, there's people who know how to behave,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
how to assure people aside when they're taking their photos.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
looking for the girls to the biggest.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm up with this in backing up into Techmaster Loki, everybody backing up into people

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And, you know, he tried to I ran into him again and I just said,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you know, look where you're going ass face or something.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And it was just being rude. You know, there's a way to take photos at a convention.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And the way this guy did it is not it.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Did you go to the anime convention and say I wasn't supposed to be here today?

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right. I don't keep up with the concert anymore.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How do I know all this?

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki, officially everybody.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello. How are you doing?

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm doing fine.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Good. Don't do that.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But I can remember.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You had to think for a minute.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's been a while since I've been to the con. No, I don't think I have.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't even remember the last con I went to. It was probably like ASET.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I remember the last con job I pulled.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's a con job? It sounds hot.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Con? Con artist?

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, OK.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OK. Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He's a familiar guy.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
or ever listened to Hoard House and hear his e-mails and tweets and all that.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It is Flaco Jones, everybody.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hello, everybody.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How are you doing?

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm doing great.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, I love that.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Because you just reminded me of Ni No Kuni and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're sticky and smell of caramel?

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Can I smell you?

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's all this English candy.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes, it's all the Cyl candy, which much love to Cyl.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know if Cyl listens to Orange Lawn Triadio, but I hope she won't mind.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've been giving some of the candy away.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I had to lay claim to the Mars Bar because I love Mars Bars.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, yes, Cyl from Girls Gone Wow, which if you haven't heard the show, it's a fantabulous show.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's you can hear it Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geek or Wednesday mornings, excuse me, at the Voice of Geeks Network.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's Wednesday nights if you're in the UK, but they are a lovely British based group.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not just Cyl, it's Cyl, EJ, Raven and Rob.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I correspond mostly with Cyl because, you know, in getting her shows and so forth.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And Cyl offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain, like the Smarties over there, which are like totally different than Smarties here.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And like Aero Bars, which we don't have here at all.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jelly Babies, which I'd never had, which were pretty good.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't eat Jelly Babies.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But she sent stuff that I've never seen there, like the Bubblies. I've never seen them there.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, yeah. So pretty cool.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And oh my God, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs. I had one yesterday.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I have a return package. I don't want to spoil, just in case Sil is listening.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But I might spoil by the time it gets there.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I do have a return package we're sending. And all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So if you know Sil.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And we're sending her a token of our love.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right. In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Sil that we're sending.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we'll send that over there soon.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Alright, Flaco, what's new with you? What have you been up to? When was the last time you were on the show? A couple months ago, right?

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was on the year-end show.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So December 30th.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right, the last show of the year. Because you ruined one of the shows in June.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And hopefully tonight's show will be better.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I scared everybody in December because something happened that hadn't happened. I guess the stream went down and that hadn't happened in a few weeks.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it was scaring people.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, I should warn everybody. I was having major internet issues yesterday. Like, Alan and I were trying to play World of Warcraft and disconnected like eight times. It was insane.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He had net flatulence.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My iPad wouldn't even connect to the internet. It was dumb. So we unplugged our routers overnight. And so far today, they've been fine. So we'll keep our fingers crossed. But Flaco's presence could break them again.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I like that I have this reputation with the show. I'm the number one fan of Hoard House and the number one curse on a locker.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Exactly. Exactly. So you you have two young ones at home. You just how old is your little girl now?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She's almost one. She turns a year next month.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So you have a less than a year old at home. Yes. How do you juggle that with game playing?

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I play very late at night or early in the morning. And you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni, something like that, I can actually play when they're up. They don't get bothered by it too much.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon. You know, he doesn't like the battle. He gets bored of that, which I guess a lot of people do.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You read some of the online reviews. But yeah, he loves the animated cut scenes in that. And, you know, another game we've been playing lately is The Unfinished Swan, and he loves that game.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So if he loves the game, he'll actually request it. And Unfinished Swan, obviously, you can't say that, but he calls it tree.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because when you, when you highlight the icon on the PlayStation, it just has a picture of, you know, like an ink splattered tree. And so that's what he calls it.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So when he comes in the living room, he starts saying tree, tree. And like, you want us to play tree? Yeah.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we put, you know, we load up that game when we start playing it. And he just, he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I've used those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari had just, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So it's just interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve. And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think they will.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It'll just be different.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They're holding back on it right now. They just want to save it.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You think so?

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Holding back on it.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They can do it now.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Or Oliver will be able to have the Aluma Room that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just in time for that phase.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Boobs everywhere.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Just in time for that phase.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I thought you just called the motorboat room.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Akuma JP in our chat room.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
By the way, hi, chatters.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We're always joined with the live chat room because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
vognetwork.com.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Akuma JP in chat says, sky sounds old.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ha ha ha.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, jerk, keep this in mind.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OLR is on our 11th year this year.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So, if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We didn't start this show when we were 18.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We were more like 23 or 24.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, you do the math.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You know what? The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And what's that?

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because I'll be 37.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In a row?

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I rest my case.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So, and I'll be 35.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, Jamie's the old one.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on, Akuma.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Redirect your jokes appropriately.

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Vintage.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This rack took years to grow.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And I'm two weeks older than Rob.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I know. I feel like the young kid.

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And all my friends, I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I guess I just hang out with youngins.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's the deal.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, Akuma JP in our chat room says, so you are old, lol.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Bonk.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're only as old as you feel, honestly.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I will say this with all honesty.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We will talk about video games in a minute here, but obviously I still play video games,

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which a lot of people think is a youthful activity, although I don't think so.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think because we all grew up in a generation that at least had Atari 2600,

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
video games has always been a part of our lives.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, I can't imagine not playing video games at this point, right?

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Really, for real.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I have to agree with that for myself as well.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20 year olds.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's totally not the case.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
know that I was really sick when I was 29.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I missed two or three weeks at OLR because I'd been in the hospital.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'd have surgery.

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, it was one of those things where they had to screen me

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and that was the type of stuff I had going on.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, it was scary and I think all that stuff going through that before 30

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
kind of definitely made me feel like turning 30 is awesome.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I get to turn 30, yes!

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You want to know what's funny?

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Back in my early days on AOL, I had a friend who I chatted,

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
another anime fan who was 10 years old.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I remember chatting with him when he graduated college.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That makes me feel old.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, I know, right?

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm like, my nieces can drink.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's weird.

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I remember when they were born.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But now you can take them out drinking.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The other day, we got an email to the show that was like,

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've been listening to you since I was 13.

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm like, oh my God.

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He's like, I'm in college now.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh my God.

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Not many.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Gunsmoke, The Simpsons.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Doctor Who.

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There's only a few.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So we're awesome.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and live at the Voice Ease Network.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What the hell was that?

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They say that that kind of stuff happens all the time.

263
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It happened in San Francisco, right?

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Later on.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, but it totally wasn't the same thing.

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It didn't shatter windows and stuff.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.

268
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Probably somebody's science project out there.

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Russia, meteor shatter you.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Little pictures in Soviet Russia.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I was busy being asleep.

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, you don't live in Russia.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, no, no, no, no.

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I actually didn't see the news until I got up late today

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
because I've been sick most of the day.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I was like, meteor, fuck, sleep.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, watching the videos online blew my mind.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and of course the car alarms is always the best part.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Somebody get Bruce Willis's Armageddon.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
as they have these dash cams going.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never fazed by any of this.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no like, oh my God!

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's just like, right?

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's like, what?

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're just like, oh, that's weird.

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die, oh well.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in like, I don't know,

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Philadelphia or something?

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, and there's like a camera going. I can just imagine it right now.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said,

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and it was just like a small thing.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The guy's like driving on the freeway and he's like,

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh my God, did you see that?

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's just like, okay.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh my God, thanks Obama.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was driving home really late at night

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and there was a big green streak across the sky,

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but it didn't explode like that one,

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
so obviously it wasn't even close to the size,

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but I thought it was pretty cool.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I was like, oh wow, that thing just comes streaking across

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If it had been in my neck of the South, it'd be, the fuck is that?

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hand me a beer.

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Shit, that means we're going to get them another hurricane.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Porkchop in our chat room says,

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I guess I'm assuming they're in public cars.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, so I thought maybe the police cars.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, apparently they're really, from what I read,

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
they're really into dash cams because I guess in traffic courts and stuff,

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They have to have physical evidence.

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And so because of altercations like that,

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you know, any sort of car accident,

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
they want to have something to document it.

323
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So that's why they do it.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know, Nelly was born in Russia.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Did she have anything to say about it?

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank God it didn't happen here.

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
She was born in the Ukraine.

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So it's a little different.

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
A little different.

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Uh, interesting.

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, I don't know what that has to say.

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, Rob, everything Slavic is not Russian. Thank you.

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you sure?

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It was in the 80s.

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I thought Canada was a state.

337
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Anyhow, I don't know what that had to do with video games,

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but as far as like nerd news goes,

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
like it was one of those things where I watched it.

340
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was like, oh my God.

341
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You make a burning Legion joke.

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, I saw that on Twitter.

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Kashi Meteor.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Someone Kashi Meteor.

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Code Man in chat says it was Team Rocket.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There was a gif of the lights going out and Team Rocket shows up.

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I guess it was Goku.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
All right.

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's get into video games

351
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and the video games that you have been playing this week

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

353
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Dark Sakura.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar. That was awesome.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You inhaled that thing.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I love Mars bars.

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So I beat Mass Effect 2 again.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I started on Mass Effect 3

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and got Fly Cam working.

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But now,

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you know, we got that patch 1.5

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and none of my cheats

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
work anymore.

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So I just figured out how to put in

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
key binding commands using the coalesced editor.

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And now all I have to do is hit

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
zero for god mode.

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, but really,

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I played WoW

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
for an hour.

373
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And I

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
would actually log on and play more WoW

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but I would like people

376
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you know, plug it.

378
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
yes, I know that Mars bars

380
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
are Milky Ways but they're not the regular

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Milky Ways. They taste better.

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
They're different-er.

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They're actually from Mars.

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They are.

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And you don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
so having it say Mars with the packaging

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
on it and everything makes me

388
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
stupendously happy.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So, now if I can find

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
whatchamacallits I'd be even happier.

391
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I played

392
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I played

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
something else.

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't remember what it was.

395
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh yeah, Dan had a friend

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
over and they played through Contra hardcore

397
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and then played

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
through Ghouls

399
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and Ghosts

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
which was pretty fun because

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
my friend and I left

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and then we came back

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and they were still playing Ghouls and Ghosts

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
like hours later.

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I'm like, what playthrough were you on? Oh, just the beginning

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
of the second playthrough.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Really. So yeah.

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And then I got

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
now this isn't a game but it's related to a game

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I found the Mass Effect

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Paragon Lost

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
for like 16 bucks brand new.

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money

414
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
let's buy it.

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It didn't suck.

416
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The only thing that I really didn't like about it was

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
how the kroken were drawn.

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I did not care for the character design.

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And it got me in the feels.

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Damn you Bioware.

421
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So yeah.

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Damn those feels.

423
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Damn the battle tits.

424
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Full speed ahead.

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Alright, let's move on to Loki.

426
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I didn't play a whole ton this week.

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sure I started some of the

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
kind of DLC stuff

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
or not DLC stuff, the

432
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
mod quests

433
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I guess if you will. There's one that's kind of

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
where you hire a boat and you can actually go

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to a bunch of different islands and stuff.

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And it was neat, I guess.

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, it's pretty well done.

438
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And they voice acted everything

439
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
so that's a little weird hearing people that

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
don't sound like the five different

441
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
NPCs that are in the game.

442
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They have voice, all the characters

443
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
it's ridiculous.

444
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So I played a little bit of that

445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and then

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
a little bit of Borderlands

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
more Call of Duty.

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We actually bought Map Pack 4

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
or Content Pack 4

451
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
so now we have a few more maps

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that I've already kind of gotten sick of.

453
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But we got to do something because

454
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 is not coming out

455
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
in May like we had hoped it was so

456
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
got to have something to tide us over.

457
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then I just got done playing

458
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
DDRX2

459
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
on my PC.

460
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Even though, yes, that's an arcade

461
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
game, but it

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
runs on a PC so I played

463
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it anyways.

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And it isn't the versus

465
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
second mixing, that's 3 I guess.

466
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But it's X2.

467
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's cool, looks like

468
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Stepmania, I guess.

469
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It looked a lot to me like the

470
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Playstation 3 version of the game.

471
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They just adapted that engine.

472
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or the Wii, DDR2 on the Wii.

473
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm surprised they don't release a PC version.

474
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It runs on a PC, there's

475
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
no work to be done.

476
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Literally no work to be done.

477
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Licensing would be the only thing.

478
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I guess, but just put

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Konami Originals in there.

480
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Done. Put it on Steam. There you go.

481
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Money. Just rolling in.

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So there's that. And then my wife

483
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
has been taking

484
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
over the Xbox because she's been

485
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
playing Fable 3.

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Really? Yeah.

487
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's not even the best Fable game.

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She played Fable 2 all the way.

489
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And so she's playing Fable 3.

490
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games.

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Who's getting into Fable. Or is into Fable.

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, she is into Fable.

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Does she play good or bad? She's playing good.

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay.

495
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That game is...

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It just makes me realize

497
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
how much Peter Molyneaux is full of

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
crap.

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And he's just like talking

500
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
about all these different

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
enhancements

502
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and all this is the first time

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
ever in the game and the dog is awesome

504
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
blah blah blah blah.

505
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay, you're so full of shit it's not even funny.

506
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
By the way folks, is anyone still curious

507
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
about curiosity? Because I'm pretty sure

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
everybody's fucking forgotten about this

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
curiosity. No, you know who hasn't

510
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
forgotten about curiosity is Alan.

511
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Because he'll be sitting there on my iPad and

512
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
he'll walk into the room and he'll be like,

513
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Have you checked on the cube Rob? Have you checked on the cube? What's in the cube?

514
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Did you find what's in the cube yet?

515
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Break the touch. Break the cubes.

516
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He does it just like that too. Break the cubes Rob.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know what you would even

518
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
what that's going to be. I think it's going to just be like

519
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
whoever finally, the last person

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to give that game up is going to be the winner

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
pretty much.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Well I was going to ask you about this because

523
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
there was that new Alien game

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that came out this week from Gearbox

525
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
except for one site. Apparently really liked it.

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But whatever. And then I went

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
on this Twitter thing. Now I don't know

529
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
shit about this game really but

530
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
jock? Because you know one particular

532
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
organization seemed to like it.

533
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And I was like, well isn't like a difference of opinion

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
okay? And it was really weird

535
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
because Metacritic retweeted or no

536
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
favorited one of my tweets. I was like, that was kind of

537
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
weird but okay.

538
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Alright. But yeah

539
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
there was all this crap going on. I guess

540
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
a big part of it was that

541
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
a lot of the stuff they'd been showing at E3

542
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and the type of stuff they'd been talking about

543
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
didn't actually come to fruition in the game.

544
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well yeah it makes a lot of sense.

545
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And people are like, oh we're going to sue

546
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and I'm just like

547
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
well game companies have been doing

548
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
this shit for years and you just brought up Peter

549
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Molyneux. Like he's the master of this shit.

550
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He makes up shit all the time.

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Exactly. Who's trying to sue him?

552
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I know nothing.

553
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He's not really working

554
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
he's not really attached to any more Fable games

555
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
or anything like that as far as I'm aware.

556
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There was Fable It's Not On Rails.

557
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I seriously don't even know the name of the game.

558
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's just Fable It's Not On Rails.

559
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Fable The Journey

560
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Fable The Book The Game

561
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The Series The Movie

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't know. But yeah

563
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
even the whole Gearbox

564
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
well there's two jokes I made about it.

565
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
First off Gearbox you've got

566
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox

567
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and Borderlands Gearbox

568
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
well this is made by Duke Nukem

569
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Forever Gearbox.

570
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And then the second thing is

571
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
yeah it's just because they showed

572
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
more fancy features and stuff like that

573
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that may have been running on a PC version

574
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
or something like that

575
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
that come time to actually

576
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
implement that on a console

577
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
oh we don't have the memory

578
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
bandwidth to do all these fancy

579
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
things we've got to scale it back a bit

580
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
or oh we don't have enough processing

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
power or the frame rates and shit

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
or whatever and so maybe that's why.

583
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But then again why wouldn't they just

584
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
allow that to kind of run

585
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
unleashed on the PC

586
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
probably because it's a console port

587
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't know.

588
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Who cares?

589
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Bad games happen all the time. Are you really surprised

590
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
that a movie tie-in game

591
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is bad? Really?

592
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I mean everyone's shocked that

593
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
this movie tie-in game is bad

594
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I mean

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
it doesn't really matter it's just

596
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
yeah

597
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
we all really kind of hope that

598
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Duke Nukem is as good as Borderlands

599
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
hell I thought Duke Nukem forever

600
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
this is going to be awesome because it's somebody of the guys that did Borderlands

601
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No

602
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
No it's the team that did Duke Nukem forever

603
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
clearly

604
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
RossDielUT in our chatroom at

605
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
live.vognetwork.com says

606
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
differences is great but when there's literally one

607
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that looks shady even with a game that doesn't get

608
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
well received there's always at least a group of

609
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
people who like the game

610
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
well yeah I mean you know

611
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
one guy liked the game but I can think of

612
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
like you know there's been like that one voice

613
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
that passionately defended it

614
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as like

615
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
you know what they say now it'd be different if they didn't mention

616
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
any of the flaws

617
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
but maybe they just thought that you know it didn't really

618
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
affect the game too much it's a person's

619
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
opinion one guy's opinion and you're just like

620
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
flipping shit over it

621
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
There's also no evidence in this scenario

622
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I mean people are like oh because it's running next

623
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
to an ad for the same game it's clearly

624
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
been bought I can't believe first off

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I can't believe I am the one

626
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
defending a big name site

627
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
like I'm usually the first one to

628
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
criticize that stuff Yeah because you know what they're going to sell ads

629
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
so they can run that site

630
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh my gosh game sites sell game ads

631
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
get out but there's no further

632
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
evidence that this whole thing was you know

633
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and so the Twitter wants to convict

634
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and say this is full of shady it's not

635
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
like that whole scenario with what was the

636
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
freaking game at GameSpot that got that guy

637
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Kane and Lynch Yeah that whole thing

638
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
like there was more evidence and there

639
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
was stuff that came out about that and all

640
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
the shady dealings and the guy himself basically

641
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
said you know yeah it was

642
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you know there was some stuff going on

643
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff

644
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean I don't know

645
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I just think like the internet

646
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
should just get over it okay there was one

647
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
person that said it was good you know

648
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
well you know what somebody out there

649
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2

650
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
somebody out there probably liked Yaris

651
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it was free I like Silent Hill

652
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Revelations the movie nobody

653
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
else like that I want it I need to see

654
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
it you and Ospher actually

655
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Ospher on Twitter would defend that so there you

656
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
go it's something about being high on

657
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
leaderboards on VoG ActDef would probably like

658
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
it too well he did like it I

659
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
think look at oh my god

660
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
you know look at you know if you're gonna like blame

661
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
or mark games down just because

662
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
of like glitches and stuff like that then

663
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Earth Defense Force 2017

664
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
should have gotten like a one out of ten

665
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
because that thing is

666
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
glitchy as hell there is

667
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
no physics

668
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
no physics whatsoever or at least

669
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
no realistic physics

670
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
it's just it's crap the AI

671
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
is completely retarded

672
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
so yeah it

673
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
happens get over it

674
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ross Steel UT in chat says and it

675
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the game it took seven fucking years to make

677
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and had eight devs on it

678
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Lincoln just came out

679
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think

680
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
18 years to make that's

681
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd

682
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
because she was cast in it like ten years ago

683
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and you know had to defend

684
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated

685
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
for an Oscar sometimes things

686
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
get trapped in development hell it doesn't necessarily mean

687
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
they turn out bad like you're doing forever

688
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000

Grand Theft Auto 5 came out in 2001

697
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000

698
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000

702
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week

703
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because I've been having long hours

704
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
at work and you know when I come home I'm like

705
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I have to raid in WoW or something but

706
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I did play one new game and

707
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
it was something where it went

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000

709
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000

pretty soon because you guys are all

724
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
talking like gateway

725
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
game addicts or something

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
yeah okay you say that now

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
let me see it you want to see it

728
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
no I want to see the box it's actually super cute

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't care

730
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
alright so here's the thing

731
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
it's on the DS not the 3DS but the DS

732
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and well then I could play it

733
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but I don't care I've been having

734
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
fun with it you know what here's what I like

735
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
compared to Pearl it moves at a faster

736
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
pace it gives you all this shit up front

737
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and you know you don't have to like go

738
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
forever and grind more and I

739
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon

740
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
at the beginning than there was in Pearl

741
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and it's just kind of

742
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
little quality of life improvements

743
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
here's where the game kind of

744
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
like goes crazy though is that there's all these

745
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
like online things like

746
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I can't figure out half this shit with the online

747
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
like some of it's in the

748
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
manual and some of it I tried to go online

749
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me but it's just

750
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it's so weird like

751
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you can use your little

752
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
online gear to put your Pokemon

753
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to sleep and then you go on the

754
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
website and you register for the website

755
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and then you link your DS

756
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to the website and then you

757
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
can do that Pokemon

758
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
that you just put to sleep you can

759
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville

760
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
but you can also play these little online

761
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
games so your Pokemon can send

762
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you things back in the regular game

763
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
once you tell your Pokemon to wake

764
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
up and then you launch your game again

765
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and you hit the button

766
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
to tell it to wake up and go find where

767
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
like it's like oh my god

768
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it's like an 18 step process

769
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
my brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment

770
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you said put him to sleep

771
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
put him down sorry Pikachu

772
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it's funny

773
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
but I mean it's not I can

774
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
appreciate that the Pokemon company is like trying to do

775
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
these new things with Nintendo's infrastructure

776
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
which I can't imagine is a

777
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
real delight to work with

778
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
but it just kind of goes to show

779
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
like the fact that there's

780
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
just all these bells and whistles that are

781
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
buried like five minutes deep is just I don't know

782
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I feel like Pokemon kind of needs

783
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
a better interface like

784
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
it would be better if they could streamline

785
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
a lot of that maybe

786
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the new 3DS version X and Y

787
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks

788
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
good so it'll be

789
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
cool to see that

790
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but yeah I mean don't let

791
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
my little rant get you wrong especially

792
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
for the core game about finding

793
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the new Pokemon and challenging

794
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the gym leaders and all that it's all

795
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace

796
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
than the other games do so you'll get pretty

797
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
immediate rewards out of it

798
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
there's a medal system in the game since

799
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did

800
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
their own little thing with medals and you can have

801
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
your little title when you go online

802
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
you know what

803
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I found my copy of Pearl

804
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
did you? yeah it was dusty

805
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
yeah

806
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I had played Pearl about three weeks ago

807
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and then I was like gosh this

808
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
game kind of moves really slow but this one's

809
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
a little better actually it's a lot better

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
it's all animations

811
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in the little cut scenes too which is much

812
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
better than what it was before

813
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
where it's just like you know you see them

814
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
like shake up and down and that's like their little

815
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
attack a little silly

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
you know what my cat's butt

817
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
makes me think of Pokemon

818
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
what? because she does

819
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you know when you see the little Pokemon bounce

820
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
back and forth on the thing she does

821
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
this little thing now where she wiggles her butt and then

822
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
jumps back and forth and I'm like

823
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Midna used fetch

824
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
or something

825
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
oh I should say this too I'm playing Pokemon Black 2

826
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and I didn't play Black 1 and I'm

827
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
doing just fine it's like the sequel thing

828
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
not an issue and I can appreciate

829
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
that that you know it didn't have to like they

830
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
always reference like all the people that you

831
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
talk to are like two years ago this happened

832
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
two years ago this happened so I guess that's

833
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
kind of its way of catching you up so that's

834
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that's kind of cool I guess

835
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
what is this that you're showing me?

836
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
that okay that internet meme is seriously

837
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
15 years old I know I think it's

838
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
great that someone still remembers it

839
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
she's showing me the pictures of the cat oh is that in chat room?

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
yeah the pictures of the cats

841
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
playing Pokemans and it says my Pokemans

842
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
let me show you them I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago

843
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm saving it

844
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
alright Flaco Jones

845
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
how was your gaming week? it was pretty good

846
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I got to play a lot of games this week or not a lot

847
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
of games but a lot of two games

848
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and the first one was

849
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Unfinished Swan I kind of

850
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because

851
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I played the demo which is basically

852
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
just the first level and really liked

853
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it and my wife kept pestering me

854
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
she's like why don't you just buy this game

855
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
we love playing the demo but then we have to stop

856
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and it's like okay I'll buy the game

857
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
then I was mad because I missed out it was on sale

858
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and I missed the sale by like a day and I was like

859
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
well I could have saved five

860
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
dollars she's like just buy it who cares

861
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that's really rough when your wife is sitting

862
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
there saying buy the damn game

863
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Flaco buy the game

864
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
just buy it I don't care if it's not on sale

865
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
like what kind of bizarro world do you live in

866
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
well I'm really glad I bought it because it was

867
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
an awesome game and we

868
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday

869
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
we'd go back and forth I'd watch a little game

870
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
we'd play some more of that I tweeted about that

871
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer

872
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
of the game so I didn't hashtag

873
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
anything but I guess you can

874
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
get stuff come up

875
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
this tweet deck

876
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think allows you to run one feed for

877
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
your Twitter and so but you can also

878
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
run a search and it'll pop right up there

879
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
like okay do you remember

880
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
when we had Ronnie from Big Brother

881
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Eleven on Horde House a couple weeks ago

882
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
yeah uh okay so we

883
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
got him uh this

884
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
was really Shane and X for his doing I can't take credit

885
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we got him addicted to Frog Fractions

886
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but I sent which is that Flash

887
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
game and if you haven't heard of it it's hilarious

888
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
but Shane and X for won't shut up about that game so they were talking

889
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
about it on the show so I sent Ronnie

890
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the link and I said something like

891
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
here's Frog Fractions you're welcome

892
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I've ruined your life or whatever or something like that

893
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and the guy who wrote

894
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Frog Fractions favorited it

895
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
like I didn't hashtag it

896
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I didn't include him he just randomly

897
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
sees the tweet I guess so it's

898
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
just funny like and I'm assuming

899
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Metacritic found my other thing this

900
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
week in a similar fashion yeah probably

901
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
if you mention anybody they'll have they have someone who's

902
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
watching the Twitters and will exactly watch

903
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
what you say on Twitter

904
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
so yeah so I played that

905
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and mainly I had gotten all the trophies

906
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
except for we still needed

907
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the hardest trophy to get in the game

908
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
was to do the first level

909
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
only using three paintballs

910
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and the point of the game is you splatter paint around

911
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
at least the first part of the game

912
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
you splatter paint around to see where you're going

913
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and it's kind of like a puzzler

914
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
it's kind of built like a shooter though

915
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
you know cause you just have like you're just shooting paintballs

916
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
all over the place can you make dirty noises while you're doing it

917
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
cause the way you describe it where you're like shooting paint everywhere

918
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
you could make these really disgusting noises like

919
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
then

920
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
not quite like that it just sounds like a

921
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
paintball gun

922
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
so uh

923
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
we did that my wife kind of

924
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
talked me through oh okay what next time you play

925
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
you should try it there was something in that game that did

926
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
make a dirty sound I can't remember it now though

927
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
especially with the wife around not the kids so much

928
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
but with the wife around see they're always around when we play

929
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the game that's because they love it so much

930
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
but yeah so we we we did that my wife

931
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
talked me through it she found a guide

932
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
online and it's like walk backwards

933
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
until you hit a wall walk left until you

934
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
hit a wall walk straight you'll hear

935
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
leaves cracking under your feet cause you

936
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
pretty much do level blind everything's

937
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
completely whited out so I

938
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
we got that trophy and that was our 100% for that

939
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
so that was really cool and the other game

940
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I played of course was Ni No Kuni

941
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I passed the 31 hour mark

942
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
last night and I played a little bit more today

943
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
did it go downhill after 15 hours?

944
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
no I have no idea what that

945
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
was about I don't know maybe my hours are different

946
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
than other people's because I've been doing everything

947
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
so I guess you can't really get

948
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know can you hit a wall

949
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
if you're just doing everything? I don't think so

950
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to

951
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
speed do it really fast and then you kind of

952
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough

953
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
maybe you haven't gone out there cause it is pretty

954
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
grindy though I found it it's not

955
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
super grindy for me because if I do the quest

956
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
in the process of doing the quest I fight enough battles

957
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that I level up and it's not

958
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
really felt grindy to me but I

959
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
could see how people would think it's

960
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
too grindy but I don't mind that

961
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean Secret of Mana is really really

962
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
grindy and there's no quest in that you just have to go out and

963
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
grind grind grind to get your party up

964
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
old school Final Fantasy games were very very

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
very grindy so I mean compared to

966
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
what we used to play it's not

967
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
grindy at all it's a walk in the park

968
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I felt a lot like playing WoW you know doing these

969
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
quests and going out and finding

970
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
rare pets and things like that that's what I've

971
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
really been getting hooked into is

972
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
finding all these familiars I look at some online

973
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
like what's the best one like oh I want to get that

974
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
so I go find one and I get it and

975
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
you have to fight a while because the taming is kind of random

976
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
you can't just tame it you just have to wait for it

977
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to kind of fall into your lap

978
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I've gotten very lucky apparently

979
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I spent an hour

980
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
trying to get uh what is that town

981
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Alma Moon the one with the milk right

982
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
yeah were you trying to get the babanas the big

983
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
uh banana guys

984
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I had to search for the banana guys

985
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
for an hour

986
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
an hour and then finally

987
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I trapped one and then here's the hilarious

988
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
part right because for that quest you have to get the banana

989
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and the turban monkey right yeah so

990
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I go and I'm like all excited so

991
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I go to turn in the banana and he's like oh you

992
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
got the bananas but you didn't get the turban monkey

993
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
well what I didn't realize is that the turban

994
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
monkey had evolved

995
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
because I had him in my party so the

996
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
turban monkey evolved so I had to go get another

997
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
one they don't evolve unless you give him a

998
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
treat well he was in my party

999
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I wanted him to evolve I didn't realize that was

1000
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
so adorable I'm gonna feed you

1001
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
he was so hungry I wanted him

1002
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't evolve very quickly don't feed him after midnight

1003
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
yeah I fed him after midnight and that was my mistake

1004
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
yeah well that's pretty bad

1005
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I could have screamed

1006
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I could have screamed that's why I haven't played in a

1007
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
week and a half I'm still punishing the game

1008
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
well see when I do those quests I usually go

1009
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
out and just do that because I consider

1010
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that kind of one of my grind sessions because I know those

1011
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I think it's only come up

1012
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
one at a time in a different town but

1013
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and then that's like the first thing I'll do I'm like oh this is a

1014
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
good time to grind because this

1015
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
one quest requires a lot of grinding so I'll go out

1016
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and I'll go tame the three pets

1017
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and then I'll bring them back and I bring them back

1018
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
right away so I didn't realize

1019
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway

1020
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but I didn't know that was something

1021
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
that would mess it up so now it's good to know

1022
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you don't ever evolve your

1023
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I have only evolved the main ones that I use

1024
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't evolve a lot of them

1025
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I evolve them all

1026
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
well if you hold on to them a little bit their stats get better

1027
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and the stats carry over

1028
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability

1029
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
like I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not gonna miss

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
anything by evolving them but then I'll evolve them

1031
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
yeah that's usually a good point to do

1032
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
some of them I hold out longer

1033
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
because some of them are more like late bloomers and stuff

1034
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
so you can actually stretch them out a little bit longer

1035
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
have more stats carry over

1036
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it's not a big deal if you're just gonna play through the game and beat it

1037
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
but there's some end game stuff in there

1038
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
some post game that there's certain pets that are

1039
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
really strong and so if you just

1040
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
kinda keep them in your party just let them level

1041
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
they'll be like really powerful by the end of the game

1042
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and you do the colosseum stuff

1043
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
like I already did the first round of the colosseum

1044
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and I beat that and it was really hard

1045
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but I got through that

1046
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the fencer puppy is really good right?

1047
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
or is it a kitty?

1048
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
yeah I have that he's pretty good

1049
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I still like them on might and I look online and people say

1050
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
oh the mighty might's not that good

1051
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
but I don't know I really like him

1052
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
he's got a shield he defends really well

1053
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
he blocks out of attacks I use him I still use him as my main guys tank

1054
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so

1055
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
yeah I don't know people complain about him though

1056
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I guess but the cat is getting better

1057
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the cat's lower too

1058
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
but I've metamorphosized both those guys

1059
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I just kinda have two metamorphosized pets

1060
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and I always use my third slot just as like a leveling slot

1061
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and I did just get the new Nino Cooney one

1062
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
the one that's free on the Playstation network

1063
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I was just gonna ask you to talk quickly about the downloads

1064
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
cause there's a free like what gold one

1065
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
or something?

1066
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
it's a little well mine was a little red dragon

1067
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and I named it Little Strazza

1068
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
a little WoW reference cause it looks like

1069
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it reminds me of Alex Strazza in the Red Dragons

1070
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
like it looks just like a red whelpling from WoW

1071
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
so I named it Little Strazza and uh

1072
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
yeah and it's a little red dragon

1073
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and I've not even used it in combat yet

1074
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
but it's

1075
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I've heard it's pretty good and I looked online

1076
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
most of the dragons are really good

1077
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
so I'm gonna work on that one

1078
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you reminded me about names have you really just sat there

1079
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and read some of the suggested names

1080
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
cause every Pokemon that you can pick in the game

1081
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
has like four suggested names

1082
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and some of them are so fucking funny

1083
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
like the Turban Monkey thing

1084
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
uh one of the suggested names was Turbanula

1085
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I died

1086
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I died some of them are so

1087
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
funny I need to look at that now

1088
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I look at the first one and I always change it

1089
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
always cycle through cause there's four for each one

1090
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
well I named him Toad Bandit cause he looked kinda like

1091
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Toad but with a bandit mask on

1092
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
so you're Toad Bandit

1093
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
ok so though I have to ask this

1094
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
cause this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones

1095
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is it when you rename them they keep that name

1096
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
like forever through all of their evolutions

1097
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but does it still let you know what

1098
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
they originally are? you know he's talking

1099
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon right?

1100
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm sorry I was thinking of Pokemon

1101
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
it's really a lot

1102
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
it's pretty much the same fucking thing

1103
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I never played Pokemon but now I'm kinda interested cause I'm like

1104
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
this game's really fun maybe I would like Pokemon cause I like

1105
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
getting my familiars I like feeding them

1106
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
the combat is the totally different part

1107
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm sorry I had looked down for a moment

1108
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like

1109
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Pokemon?

1110
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to answer your question even though you didn't ask about this

1111
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you can rename them

1112
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
but it will say what the name of their

1113
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
kind of general familiar is

1114
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
so if you need to look something up on that you can

1115
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
for anyone else who's interested in that

1116
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and that was my gaming week

1117
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Ni No Kuni lots of it

1118
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Ni No Lots of Kuni

1128
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
alright let's move into some gaming

1129
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
news tonight and talk about what's

1130
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
going on in the world of gaming some big news today right

1131
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Logie? Yeah so today Bungie

1132
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
revealed Destiny

1133
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and they have like a little kind of behind

1134
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
the scenes development video that showed

1135
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
actual I'm pretty

1136
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
sure no actual gameplay

1137
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
or if there was it was so insignificant

1138
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that I didn't remember

1139
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
but basically

1140
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Destiny is this

1141
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
always on persistent

1142
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
kind of first person

1143
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
shooter adventure

1144
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I guess where you

1145
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
take on these guardians

1146
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
of kind of one of the last

1147
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
civilizations

1148
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
in the solar system

1149
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and you kind of venture out to

1150
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
different planets and stuff like that and fight

1151
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
aliens and

1152
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
all sorts of stuff so it's kind of I think

1153
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
what you know originally the description was

1154
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
kind of like a single player co-op

1155
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and you know

1156
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
multiplayer game all mixed together

1157
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
all at once

1158
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
it should be interesting

1159
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm not sure exactly how

1160
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
how they're going to how you're going to

1161
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
interact with their people it was going to be like kind of an emo

1162
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
this reminded me it sounded a lot like

1163
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
fantasy star I guess

1164
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
you know where as that was

1165
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
you know fantasy star online

1166
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that's a good way of putting it that is

1167
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
kind of what it sounds like where it's like you have the

1168
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
central hub type of thing but you can go out with

1169
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
friends and I guess

1170
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
they were showing I actually did watch one of

1171
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the four minute videos they put out where

1172
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
they showed how the iPhone I'm assuming

1173
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Android as well would integrate with it where you could like

1174
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
send messages like let's meet up on Venus

1175
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
or something like that I don't know

1176
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and you can let's meet up on Uranus

1177
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
hahaha

1178
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
let's do some

1179
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
grinding on Uranus dark side of Uranus

1180
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
alright anyways

1181
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
yeah so it

1182
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
looks neat I mean definitely

1183
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
a huge franchise

1184
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
they've got like a ten year plan with it

1185
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and they're just gonna

1186
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
wait wait wait ten year plan

1187
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the game announced for PlayStation

1188
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
3 and Xbox 360 right?

1189
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I think it's going to be probably

1190
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

1191
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
and then probably whatever next gen consoles also

1192
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
so their ten year plan

1193
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
is how to get you to buy it three times

1194
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
is that really what the ten year plan consists of?

1195
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
it's got to be right?

1196
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm not sure

1197
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
yeah I think so because they're going to get you

1198
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
on the PlayStation 3 and 360 where the game

1199
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
comes out which it's assuming

1200
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the game comes out this holiday season

1201
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Destiny is going to be going up against

1202
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
these new consoles which

1203
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
if Destiny is as ambitious as they say

1204
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I mean go back to our last weeks show

1205
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
about how

1206
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
much these new consoles

1207
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
really need to be here right now and if people

1208
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
are going to adopt them

1209
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I would imagine there's versions of

1210
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Destiny in development for these

1211
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox

1212
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
next to the world

1213
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
but it's definitely not going to be just next gen

1214
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
they can't

1215
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Activision is smart enough to know

1216
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
we're not going to gamble on

1217
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
next gen right away

1218
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
they're going to do it like okay we're going to put out

1219
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen

1220
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
stuff at the same time that way if you want the next gen

1221
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
version of the game you will have it

1222
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
if you want a current gen version of the game you can have that too

1223
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
because they know that there's a huge

1224
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
install base already why cut out

1225
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
all that money?

1226
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and none for Wii U buy

1227
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that's hard to say with Activision

1228
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I mean because they've got

1229
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
they have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit

1230
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and they even have a few games coming out although

1231
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean out in the hot excited I began

1232
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
about like re-releasing

1233
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the amazing Spiderman

1234
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
that was the Xbox 360 version

1235
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that

1236
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
they have Wii U version 4

1237
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The Walking Dead

1238
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and even though they did Call of Duty

1239
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U

1240
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
they're still supporting the Wii U

1241
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
actually Activision is a pretty strong supporter

1242
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
of the Wii U right now

1243
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
maybe followed up by

1244
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Ubisoft although

1245
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
you know a lot of their games

1246
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
aren't coming to the Wii U

1247
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I would say

1248
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I would see a Wii U version of this coming out

1249
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I mean especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version

1250
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
why not they would work

1251
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
did you find the lack of PC interesting?

1252
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
because I sure did

1253
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah a little bit

1254
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I mean the PC is the thing that could

1255
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
evolve over those 10 years

1256
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and the PC is the one thing that will still be here

1257
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
you know us people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes

1258
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it

1259
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I mean who's to say

1260
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that there's not going to be a PC version for it

1261
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
this is just kind of like

1262
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
hey we're announcing this thing

1263
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
really say which consoles it's going to be on

1264
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
so they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC

1265
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it's just

1266
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I don't know

1267
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
what did you think about all this?

1268
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
what do you think?

1269
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
because I have an opinion that others might not agree with

1270
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
but what do you think Loki?

1271
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
but I don't know really much about it yet

1272
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I mean I'm not going to be like oh my god Bungie made it

1273
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I got to go buy it

1274
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I didn't really buy Halo

1275
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I bought Halo 3

1276
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that was the only Halo game I ever owned

1277
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and I was just kind of like okay this is hard

1278
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I mean it's just not like

1279
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't lose my shit over Bungie games

1280
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm going to be blunt

1281
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass

1282
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
this whole video I watched

1283
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
this whole pomp and circumstance

1284
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
this is our big ambition

1285
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and I really felt like

1286
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
half that video was like

1287
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
well you know we made Halo

1288
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and we got to follow up to that and Halo was this

1289
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and we've poured all our company into this

1290
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
since Halo and Halo Halo Halo Halo

1291
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
like they had to name check Halo

1292
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
but here's the thing that gets me about that

1293
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong

1294
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Halo 2, one of the greatest

1295
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
video games ever made

1296
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison

1297
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
is that Halo 4

1298
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
which Bungie didn't do

1299
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
was better than Halo 3

1300
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
yes

1301
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
absolutely in many ways was better than Halo 3

1302
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
better than Halo 2

1303
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I don't know

1304
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
gaming was a lot different with all those years in between

1305
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and Halo 2 really pushed so many things

1306
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
forward in a different way

1307
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
but you know Halo 4 they didn't have anything to do with

1308
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and it was a better game than what they did

1309
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
at the end of the run

1310
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'm not the only one thinking it okay

1311
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
so when they talk about all this

1312
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Destiny stuff and like you know how much

1313
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
of their Halo influence and all this has to do

1314
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm kind of like

1315
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
now are they saying that they had

1316
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
one foot out the door when ODST

1317
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and all this stuff was being done and they were already

1318
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
working on Destiny or what

1319
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
what stock am I putting into this

1320
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
because really I felt like all we heard

1321
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
about today was an idea

1322
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and although some of it's interesting like the iPhone

1323
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
integration and

1324
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
you know what this felt like?

1325
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
this felt like a Kickstarter video

1326
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
like at the very end

1327
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
at the very end they're gonna like

1328
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
okay and now we need you to back this

1329
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
pre-order it we need you to go pre-order it

1330
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and back the game yes

1331
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
that is a great comparison

1332
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
that is really what it felt like

1333
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
it felt like somebody's Kickstarter video

1334
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and it's like

1335
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and there was very little gameplay in it

1336
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
there was some gameplay

1337
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I sort of remember

1338
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
the gameplay I saw was

1339
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
nothing new

1340
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
nothing new but granted it was three seconds

1341
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
of gameplay but I looked at it and went

1342
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
okay so you can co-op with your friends

1343
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and maybe they're gonna be putting like

1344
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
a warlock type class and a hunter class

1345
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and a first person shooter

1346
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
in more of a mass effect way than a

1347
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Diablo way but I'm still like

1348
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I mean I'm not convinced

1349
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that this is like the OMG

1350
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
rule breaking

1351
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
game that's gonna have a ten year cycle

1352
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
well here's the thing I'm wondering though

1353
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
cause if you have this coming out and this is supposed to be

1354
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
like a first person shooter let's just say

1355
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
where are they gonna put this as far as in

1356
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
comparison to Call of Duty I mean if it's gonna

1357
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
release with a next gen console

1358
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
or something like that or around that time

1359
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean you're gonna

1360
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
it's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter

1361
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
you're gonna have Grand Theft Auto in September

1362
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you're gonna have some massive games in

1363
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
November you're gonna have another Call of Duty

1364
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
game you're gonna have

1365
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
it's just

1366
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
where are they gonna put a game of this

1367
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
size I guess

1368
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I don't know it's Activision

1369
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it's gonna be weird to see them

1370
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
splitting their resources as far

1371
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
as marketing goes between Destiny

1372
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kinda like

1373
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
well Call of Duty's just not quite

1374
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
you know what it used to be we're just gonna

1375
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
kinda back burner that

1376
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
a little bit and just kinda release something

1377
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that's a slight upgrade and people will buy

1378
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
it and then we'll focus all of our

1379
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
money into this because this is our

1380
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
10 year deal thing

1381
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm looking

1382
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
at some comments in our chat room at

1383
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
live.vognetwork.com code man says

1384
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
this is the first I've heard of this game is that

1385
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
bad?

1386
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
No because when you really need to hear about

1387
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
the game is you know just before the game comes out

1388
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
those week one sales but this is

1389
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
their efforts to get more people talking

1390
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
about it success here we are and now you've

1391
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
been educated on it so here's the thing too

1392
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
why announce it now it's like a really weird

1393
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
time to announce it I mean why not

1394
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
it's an empty floor in Telly 3

1395
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
why is Sony doing a big announcement next week

1396
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
there's not a lot of other stuff

1397
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
video game things for people to be writing about

1398
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Sony I think needs something you know because

1399
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
right now you know they don't have any

1400
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Playstation I mean they kind of announced

1401
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
their slate of Playstation 3 titles with

1402
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The Last of Us and

1403
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
then they've got you know

1404
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
a couple games that I don't think a lot of

1405
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
people care about like Puppeteer

1406
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and was it the

1407
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Beyond

1408
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Beyond Two Souls which Beyond Two Souls

1409
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
looks alright but I mean let's be honest that's not going to be

1410
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
like this huge it's

1411
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
it's still kind of niche I mean

1412
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
the genre and

1413
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
then their Puppeteer game which I got to be honest

1414
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
their kind of

1415
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
kids' titles aren't doing very well or the

1416
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
children's titles I guess or younger

1417
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
skewed titles

1418
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
so I think they have to

1419
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
really come out with you know

1420
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
here's what our game plan is you guys

1421
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
you know stick with us you know especially

1422
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
with the Vita because holy crap

1423
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Vita there's nothing really announced other than

1424
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
we know there's that new game from

1425
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Media Molecule there's going to be

1426
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
the Killzone shooter game and

1427
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
and what? There could

1428
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
be some type of ace in the hole

1429
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
with the next Playstation we don't know how

1430
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
the next Playstation will interface with the Vita

1431
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
could it do a Wii U type of thing

1432
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
because that apparently now everybody feels like they have to call you

1433
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
you know because I know

1434
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even

1435
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
a little bit later in the show but like

1436
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
my bar for the Playstation 4

1437
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
right now is set so fucking low

1438
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
that's good though that's a good place

1439
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
for Sony to be in isn't it?

1440
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
don't they want I mean if the bar is low that's

1441
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
actually good news yeah

1442
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
because they could really kick your ass

1443
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
with these expectations

1444
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
but here's the thing I'm setting the bar so low

1445
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
because I don't think they're going to hit that even

1446
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I mean it's just I don't expect anything

1447
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
from them I just I'm expecting to be

1448
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
kind of like

1449
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
huh okay cool

1450
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
well here's the other thing too is

1451
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
remember guys it's February

1452
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and the console won't be out until

1453
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
November I'm sure is a safe bet if it's not

1454
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
delayed right

1455
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
so you know

1456
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
don't expect them to say a lot

1457
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you know maybe we'll get some pictures

1458
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
maybe we'll see a couple

1459
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
of the games but don't expect

1460
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
price don't expect release

1461
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
date don't expect all the bells and whistles

1462
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
expect an idea

1463
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
of what Sony thinks the next

1464
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
generation of gaming is please God

1465
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
do not be Facebook

1466
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
just don't I don't know

1467
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
social game I really

1468
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
just I'm going to get irritated

1469
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
if I hear that word too much at the same time

1470
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
hmm I kind of hope

1471
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need

1472
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
some more memes seriously

1473
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
we need more

1474
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
well this is why it's a pre-recorded thing

1475
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Namco Namco

1476
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I bet I'm expecting a Ridge Racer

1477
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
okay I'm expecting a Ridge Racer

1478
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
game it's been a while okay

1479
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I need a new Ridge Racer game

1480
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
alright I'm going to move on with news from a company

1481
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
we always expect great things from

1482
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
which had a surprising announcement this week

1483
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
that they actually let some people go

1484
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
it's Valve

1485
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
yeah apparently up to 25

1486
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
people were affected by these changes

1487
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
now a lot of this is very vague

1488
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but some of this came from a tweet

1489
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet

1490
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
that said yep got fired today time

1491
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
for new exciting projects

1492
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
so that was somebody

1493
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
at Valve and was working on hardware

1494
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and the

1495
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
internet did some more research and found out

1496
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
that part of what she had been working on was living room

1497
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
PC controllers

1498
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
also affected

1499
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
thanks to internet research

1500
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
director of business development Jason

1501
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Holtman had left the company

1502
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
some employee

1503
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
pages on Valve's site actually changed

1504
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
pretty significantly

1505
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
very interesting

1506
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
renewal did end up commenting on this to

1507
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Engadgett

1508
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
so

1509
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
it could have nothing to do with

1510
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
layoffs maybe something

1511
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
it could be a personnel issue although

1512
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
that's a hell of a

1513
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
speculation

1514
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
let's just say that he was working on

1515
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
controllers

1516
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't think they really need to

1517
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
work on a controller because it's already

1518
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360

1519
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
controller

1520
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
why do we need another controller?

1521
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Steambox would come with its own controller

1522
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
yeah but whatever

1523
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
just use another third party controller

1524
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I don't think they really need to

1525
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
make another controller

1526
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
just use an existing controller

1527
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
support any controller

1528
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
here's the other thing

1529
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow

1530
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes

1531
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
happen at really weird times for reasons

1532
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
because the project is done

1533
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one

1534
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to another and it's not like the business is always

1535
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
constant there's not projects that

1536
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
go on forever unless

1537
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
maybe Bungie is feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever

1538
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but if Destiny doesn't do very well

1539
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
oh if that flops

1540
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that will hose the whole

1541
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
company but anyway that's neither here nor there

1542
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
projects start and projects end

1543
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and if there's not a new project to go to when

1544
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
one project ends people are let go

1545
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
it sucks but it happens that's the game

1546
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
industry so

1547
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
it's just weird to hear it coming from

1548
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Valve because it's like dude shouldn't he

1549
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
be working on Half Life 3?

1550
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
but who knows what they have up their sleeve

1551
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
oh no there could be no Half Life 3

1552
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
we will be waiting forever

1553
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I still if you want to sell

1554
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
a million of those Steam Boxes

1555
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
just announce two exclusives

1556
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
announce one exclusive

1557
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
anything that ends in 3

1558
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
coming out of Valve I'm talking

1559
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Half Life 3, Portal 3

1560
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3

1561
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
any of those gets the lead

1562
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
on the Steam Box

1563
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Steam Box will sell more than we do

1564
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Half Life 2, Episode 3

1565
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Half Life 3, Portal 3

1566
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Team Fortress 3 and

1567
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
you'll outsell Wii U in like a day

1568
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and maybe like

1569
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Garry's Mod X3 I don't know

1570
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
alright let's move on

1571
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Dark Saga

1572
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
how about something that's

1573
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
a little less frustrating

1574
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
as soon as I can get a stupid

1575
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
iPad to work

1576
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ok so

1577
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
there have been some leaks

1578
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and there's people are kind of

1579
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
oh ok you know

1580
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
taking it a little bit in stride

1581
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
but there is a few issues

1582
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
that are coming out with the

1583
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
DualShock 4 release image

1584
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
who all here has seen it

1585
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
so I don't

1586
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
ok

1587
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
well the controller itself

1588
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and the photo by the way

1589
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
also shows that that might be a dev kit

1590
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
for the Orbis dev kit

1591
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but they're saying that

1592
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you know just on the

1593
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
items pointed out on the controller

1594
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
itself is that there's the two point multi

1595
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
touch pad

1596
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
the move tracking light on the controller

1597
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
itself

1598
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
the loudspeaker and a headphone

1599
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
socket and then they're talking

1600
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
about what they're seeing on the

1601
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
what they're I'm guessing to be the

1602
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Orbis dev kit would be

1603
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive

1604
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
two USB 3.0

1605
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
slots and

1606
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
just a number of other things

1607
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
they're basically saying that

1608
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
it's

1609
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
going to be some pretty

1610
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
hardcore material and they have

1611
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
a lot of high hopes for the controller

1612
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
now honestly I think that that might be

1613
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
a little too much in the controller I'm actually wondering

1614
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
how much it's going to weigh

1615
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and I don't think it's going to come out with

1616
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
all of the things that they're trying to

1617
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
pump into it but it's interesting

1618
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
it does raise some questions

1619
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I think it's actually it's not multi

1620
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
touch on that touch pad it's just

1621
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
single and there's the rear touch pad

1622
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
from the Vita isn't it?

1623
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
the rear one is multi touch

1624
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
you can pinch and stuff like that

1625
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
but what's kind of different

1626
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
about it though is they're saying that it's

1627
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
basically going to be used for interfaces and basic

1628
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
stuff I don't even know why you need it to be

1629
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
honest and then

1630
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
of course they are reshaping the

1631
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
trigger buttons on there they say

1632
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
they're supposed to be a little bit more springy like the

1633
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
360 stuff

1634
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
surely you've all seen the gif of where

1635
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
the little move light is actually a

1636
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
siren and then the little screen is flashing

1637
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
used game, used game, used game

1638
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that's the purpose of the

1639
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
screen

1640
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
the little loud speaker

1641
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
so Popo can come get you

1642
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
it looks like the analog sticks they've got a little

1643
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
difference on the top of it it's kind of

1644
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
got a little bit of lip on the edge of

1645
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
the actual sticks themselves

1646
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
so that your thumbs don't fall off of them

1647
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
like they do on the PS3 ones

1648
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
the one thing that they're saying with this one

1649
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
is actually that they were

1650
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
saying that there wasn't a corresponding

1651
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
touch on the

1652
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
back this is on the front of the controller

1653
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
is where the touch is showing

1654
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
well that's good because the rear touch

1655
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
on the Vita

1656
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller

1657
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
that would just be irritating

1658
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and then the other things there's a

1659
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
share button on there that was spotted

1660
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in the upper left

1661
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
hand corner of the touch pad area

1662
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
that actual speaker spot

1663
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
they're saying might actually be a microphone

1664
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
kind of similar

1665
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
to what's on the Vita I guess

1666
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
or could it maybe pick

1667
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
finally it picks up your voice

1668
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
like there's a built in cross voice chat

1669
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
thing on Playstation like there should have been all along

1670
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it

1671
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
had like a built in headset

1672
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
in there where you could put your headphones plugged in

1673
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your

1674
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
opponent?

1675
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think it's one goldmine

1676
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
that we use missing

1677
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
we got this virtual console and all this stuff

1678
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
why can't I play games online

1679
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?

1680
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
the problem though is I don't think that would work

1681
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
because if you think about it there's no camera

1682
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
on the actual controller itself

1683
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
that you can see

1684
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
no I don't think there's actually a camera

1685
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
you would see a camera on that

1686
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I mean I don't think

1687
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
here's what I want to know

1688
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
so they've got that little bar at the end that's basically

1689
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
supposed to be like the move stuff

1690
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
how the fuck are you supposed to do that

1691
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
as like a move controller

1692
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I mean it doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable

1693
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
at all

1694
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
because I remember you can use the dual shock

1695
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
3 for the kind of

1696
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
nunchuck portion if you will

1697
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I bet there's a way you grip it sideways

1698
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
you can probably grip it sideways

1699
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and like use your fist

1700
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I understand that you could probably grip it sideways

1701
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
but your fingers would probably naturally

1702
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
your fingers would want to go over that light

1703
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
because you'd be holding on to the middle of it

1704
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and your hand's going to want to go over

1705
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
that sensor in the middle

1706
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I just don't think that's a good design

1707
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
either that or they're going to have a separate

1708
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
move related something

1709
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
and this is going to be more for just like

1710
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
a gestural almost like the 6 axis

1711
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
yeah I'm wondering if it's not

1712
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I think it's going to be more like that

1713
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move

1714
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve

1715
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
6 axis in a way

1716
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
maybe instead of

1717
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
you need to remember very important

1718
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
this is a prototype big word

1719
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
there this will change

1720
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
this is not what the controller is going to look like

1721
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that

1722
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
maybe it could be grippy

1723
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm making shit up

1724
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
there could be other things we don't see on it now

1725
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
these things can and will change

1726
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
they always always do so that's not

1727
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
the final look of that controller

1728
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
that'll be interesting I still don't understand what they're

1729
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
going to use that touchpad for

1730
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
the share button idea I guess that's kind of neat

1731
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
but once again that also kind of scares me

1732
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
because that gets in the whole social

1733
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
gameplay stuff you know where

1734
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
oh I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook

1735
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
you guys can watch me

1736
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
beat up this hooker

1737
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
well you're getting the Ouya aren't you?

1738
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?

1739
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
so maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works

1740
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
the touchpad on the front of the Ouya I believe

1741
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
is multi-touch and I think that's meant for playing

1742
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
like other

1743
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Android games that would not use

1744
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
the controller like you could actually use that

1745
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
to play

1746
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Angry Birds or something like that

1747
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
cause I'm like how do you

1748
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
translate on a tiny little screen

1749
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
what's going to happen on the

1750
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
that is tough yeah cause you wouldn't

1751
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
it's not as easy as looking at a touch screen

1752
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
where okay I can see where my finger is

1753
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I know where I'm hitting but you know

1754
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
having it translate

1755
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
although you say that but then you know

1756
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
we all use touchpads so

1757
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
we seem to figure out a way around that

1758
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1759
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
uh Black Wolf

1760
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show

1761
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
name checks Uno in a comment to me

1762
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
and I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking

1763
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
about have a video camera so other people can watch

1764
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I mean Uno was a huge selling game

1765
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I don't know if it was because of the camera future

1766
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
well but I mean cause the game's

1767
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
years old it was a huge seller

1768
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
no it was five bucks

1769
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
five or ten yeah

1770
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
you got the camera

1771
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
the camera upgrade was free it didn't originally

1772
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
support the camera cause the camera wasn't out yet

1773
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
but then when the little vision cam came out

1774
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
they did a free upgrade for it

1775
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
let's see what else

1776
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
there was a comment from whatupG

1777
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Sony just show what they want

1778
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
the PS4 controller to be

1779
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and then change big time like the boomerang did

1780
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
boomerang is an excellent example

1781
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
of how things can and will change

1782
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
or a perfect example

1783
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
the zapper controller

1784
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
that they showed at E3

1785
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
for the Wii that looked fucking amazing

1786
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and then they put out a piece of plastic shit

1787
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
so works in reverse too

1788
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
it could

1789
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
alright let's move on with more news

1790
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
speaking of Nintendo

1791
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
they had some announcements

1792
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and it's very exciting if you're

1793
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
a 3DS owner

1794
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
lots of news for you guys including game announcements

1795
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
they announced a brand new Mario

1796
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
and Luigi Dream Team

1797
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
kind of a new game in that franchise

1798
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
also

1799
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
that's supposed to be coming out

1800
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
for the 3DS

1801
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I don't think it was

1802
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
they have a special deal now

1803
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
if you haven't bought a 3DS

1804
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
if you buy the 3DS

1805
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
XL and Luigi's Mansion

1806
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

1807
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
you get a free game

1808
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
including Super Mario 3D Land

1809
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask

1810
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and Star Fox 64 3D

1811
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and some other games you probably don't want

1812
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Mario Golf

1813
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
World T coming to the 3DS

1814
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
this summer

1815
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
so that's kind of exciting

1816
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
there's a new Mario game

1817
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Mario and Donkey Kong game

1818
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
more puzzle stuff, that's going to be coming to the 3DS

1819
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
eShop as well as a new

1820
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Dylan's Rolling Western

1821
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
The Last Ranger

1822
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
that's going to be coming out on March 11th

1823
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
which actually that's supposed to be

1824
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
kind of a pretty cool game as well

1825
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
The Harmony Knight

1826
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The Harmony Knight and Curseploosh

1827
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Curseploosh is a really weird premise

1828
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Have you ever wondered what it's like

1829
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
to be a rock thrown down a well?

1830
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
No

1831
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Well now you can

1832
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Doomplague in chat says was Fire Emblem on that list

1833
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem

1834
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
at the Nintendo Direct

1835
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out

1836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I think that just came out

1837
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D

1838
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
for the 3DS

1839
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
coming out

1840
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And last but not least, the most important news

1841
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
June 9th, North America

1842
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
June 14th in Europe

1843
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Animal Crossing New Leaf

1844
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
coming out

1845
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
The better question is

1846
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
though, what did they have for the Wii U?

1847
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And

1848
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
not a whole lot actually

1849
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
The Wii U, couple announcements

1850
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of

1851
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
DLC that's going to be coming out for

1852
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
New Super Mario Brothers U

1853
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So that'll be coming out later on

1854
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry

1855
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Yeah, it's alright, you're biting some of my stories

1856
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I do have other stuff on Wii U

1857
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Just one little thing

1858
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Honestly, I checked it out this week

1859
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
and it's not really that big a deal

1860
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's Wii Street U

1861
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
which is the Google enhanced thing

1862
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's basically Google Maps for your Wii U

1863
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You know what?

1864
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's neat because it's something different

1865
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you can't really get anywhere else

1866
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and it is pretty smooth

1867
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's a pretty smooth experience

1868
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
How is Google Maps on the Vita?

1869
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Because of the whole fact it's got the gyroscope

1870
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and you can kind of look around

1871
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'll have to show it on the Vita?

1872
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I think you just get the normal maps

1873
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I don't know if it does the whole sensor

1874
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Does it? Or even with phones

1875
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I think you can do that

1876
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Not on Google Earth on iPhone

1877
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
No, this operates very differently

1878
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and it's all set up so that

1879
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
there's places already bookmarked

1880
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to go take a look at and stuff

1881
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
The interface is interesting

1882
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I mean, it's neat

1883
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's the type of thing you would see as a demo

1884
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
but it's not exactly

1885
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
going to sell any systems or make people

1886
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
feel like, ooh, there's all this new value in my system

1887
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I like how they said free for a limited amount

1888
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
of time, like someone's really

1889
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
going to buy this one

1890
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I don't know if I would have paid money for it

1891
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
unless it was really, really cheap

1892
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So, I don't know

1893
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
The Super Luigi DLC looks

1894
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
interesting though because it sounds like they're talking about

1895
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
basically just redoing the whole game almost

1896
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
and they're going to redo all the levels and everything

1897
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah, that's a perfect way of putting out another

1898
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
new Super Mario Brothers game

1899
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
without actually putting out another new Super Mario Brothers game

1900
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's done with DLC

1901
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You know what though? I'm okay with that

1902
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
because you're talking about $20 DLC versus $60 game

1903
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
We don't know what the price is on that

1904
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more

1905
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I guess we'll see

1906
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You should be careful what I say

1907
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
but I can't imagine it's going to be as much

1908
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
as you think it is

1909
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Also, on the Wii U

1910
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
a new Miiverse community

1911
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
for Zelda

1912
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I actually

1913
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
watched the Nintendo Direct and they did

1914
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
kind of make a little bit of a deal about this

1915
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
where they're like, it's the first Miiverse

1916
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk

1917
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
about Zelda and you know it's just going to be

1918
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
a bunch of people with a really creative artwork

1919
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
and so forth

1920
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
which I guess it's neat but it's weird to me

1921
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
that this is a

1922
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
big deal

1923
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have

1924
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
a game behind it, what a fucking concept

1925
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's stupid, and the other thing too

1926
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
is we love your amazing artwork

1927
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
couldn't you think of an idea of

1928
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
hey, how about we put some places

1929
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
where you can showcase that artwork

1930
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
we'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since

1931
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm pretty much going to guess

1932
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Well, Loki, it's showcased when you turn the system on

1933
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That's all built into the whole

1934
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I understand that, but I'm just saying

1935
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
that this is basically the equivalent of a

1936
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
forum, how hard is it to

1937
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
create a sub-forum in a forum

1938
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Apparently really difficult for Nintendo

1939
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
engineers Let's also not forget

1940
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
though that this forum is coming to iPhones

1941
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
which was a pretty big announcement of the last

1942
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Nintendo Direct, so they're kind of setting the stage

1943
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
for that, but again

1944
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I like Miiverse

1945
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
There's a lot about it I do like

1946
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and I've talked about that before when I talked about

1947
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the Wii U in general

1948
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
but I don't think this is like a game changer

1949
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It's a logical next step

1950
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Here's my worry

1951
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Maybe theory or something

1952
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
This whole thing

1953
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
they're all like, oh there's a lot of news

1954
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans

1955
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
and 3DS fans

1956
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
This is so that

1957
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
you guys know there's stuff coming

1958
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
There wasn't really anything for the Wii U

1959
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
though, it was all 3DS

1960
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
so which makes me wonder

1961
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
how far away are we from an announcement that

1962
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U

1963
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
gamepad, because they have a ton of shit

1964
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
coming out for the 3DS and

1965
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
nothing coming out for the Wii U

1966
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It makes perfect sense to say, hey

1967
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
2 birds 1 stone, there you go

1968
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
They won't be in 3D, but no one uses

1969
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
the 3D feature anyways, we'll just have

1970
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
the top screen up on the TV

1971
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
bottom screen up on your gamepad, done

1972
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
eShop

1973
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
What gets me is that

1974
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
they did this whole thing about

1975
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
it's the year of Luigi

1976
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and they really went all out

1977
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie

1978
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and every little shot of one of their talking heads

1979
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
had a little Luigi doll back there

1980
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
but I was like, okay the only Luigi

1981
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion

1982
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
which we already knew that was a thing

1983
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and that was going to be coming, and then they say

1984
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Luigi's a character in the golf game

1985
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and then this Luigi DLC

1986
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
which is cool, yes, but

1987
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
to brand it all as the year of Luigi

1988
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I was kind of like

1989
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
yay

1990
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You know what you need is a Waluigi vs. Luigi

1991
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
game

1992
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Just, you know, I don't know

1993
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Just say we've got Luigi content

1994
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Whatever, whatever

1995
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Well that makes me wonder, when is this new

1996
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Super Luigi content coming out

1997
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
If it's the year of Luigi, it's not going to be

1998
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
first half of the year

1999
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So you could be waiting for this crap until

2000
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
fourth quarter

2001
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I got it, a new Mario is missing

2002
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Did we say the year of Luigi? We meant the

2003
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
decade of Luigi

2004
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I mean, I'm just

2005
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The eventually

2006
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Once again, I would have thought

2007
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Especially after all these announcements of delays

2008
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Even some delays by Nintendo

2009
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Like of their first party titles

2010
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
That they would have said, hey, you know what

2011
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles

2012
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
being delayed, here's what we have coming

2013
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So that, you know, but they had nothing

2014
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They had nothing to announce

2015
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh, Doom Plague mentions in our chat room

2016
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The part of the Luigi thing

2017
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
was also a new Mario and Luigi game

2018
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Where you're inside Luigi's dream

2019
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay, yes, I forgot about that

2020
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting

2021
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
character to me. You are inside his dream

2022
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So... I don't want to be

2023
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
inside Luigi How are you

2024
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Luigi inside Luigi? You're not

2025
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's Luigi-ception

2026
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's like Mario Innerspace

2027
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So again, it's not like

2028
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Okay, so it's just

2029
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
These were all things that existed where like

2030
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Stretch people, we need a

2031
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
theme, people

2032
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
What's the theme, people?

2033
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street

2034
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Let's, you know, go inside the dream

2035
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard

2036
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The Pikmin versus

2037
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Garden Gnomes

2038
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Lego City Stories

2039
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Luigi

2040
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Scene Legos

2041
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Luigi likes Legos

2042
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Luigi likes Legos

2043
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Ah

2044
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Crap

2045
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Legend of Zelda Wind Waker

2046
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
They're both green! Yes?

2047
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yes? Green?

2048
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
The Legend of Luigi

2049
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Alright, let's move on with more news

2050
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And then we'll get to release dates

2051
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Dark Sakura

2052
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Jeez, well

2053
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Back to the, and this is now we're getting into

2054
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
depressing. The Wii U

2055
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
has sold a few systems

2056
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A few, and by a few I mean

2057
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
55,000 in January

2058
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And this is just US numbers

2059
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Do you know how many Xbox 360's

2060
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
were sold?

2061
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
281,000. So a system

2062
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
that's already been out for a few years

2063
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
is outselling the brand new

2064
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Wii U. And is cheaper and has more games

2065
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
to be fair. But

2066
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
still, you know

2067
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
they, um

2068
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
their goal was supposed to be

2069
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I think over 100,000

2070
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
well, well over that really

2071
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but they've completely undersold

2072
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
and so now, um

2073
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
they're, uh

2074
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
they had announced

2075
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
that if it had sold

2076
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
um, uh, if

2077
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
that it sold

2078
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
3.06 million

2079
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
worldwide as of December

2080
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but

2081
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
now, um, their forecast of

2082
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
5.5 million has gone down to 4 million

2083
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
worldwide. And I bet it's gonna go down again

2084
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
at the end of this month. I don't see any more

2085
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
systems, there's no games

2086
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
there literally is no Wii U games coming

2087
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
out this month. None.

2088
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I think that they're really

2089
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
probably looking to the handheld market to

2090
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
uphold their console market

2091
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It gets me though that everybody

2092
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
is crying that it's the death of Nintendo

2093
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and now Nintendo will be forced to do

2094
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Mario games on the 360

2095
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Ha ha ha ha

2096
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
This is the, the unfortunate thing

2097
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
is that this is the exact same

2098
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
fucking thing as the 3DS.

2099
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Exact same thing.

2100
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The 3DS launched

2101
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
with a couple of good games, then

2102
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
literally nothing. What, we got

2103
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Ping Pals was a big release

2104
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
on the 3DS. That was not

2105
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
on 3DS. Oh no, I was regular DS. I don't know

2106
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It's still, with a Spongebob

2107
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
game. You had shit on the 3DS

2108
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
for a long time and then finally

2109
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
they dropped the price and like a couple

2110
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
years later the 3DS is bomb.

2111
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And hopefully Nintendo can make

2112
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
magic work twice. I think

2113
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
the only danger part is that Nintendo

2114
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
is gonna have to work that magic

2115
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
twice and they may have to drop the price of the

2116
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Wii U in order to do it. Well maybe then I'd get

2117
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
one. Yeah, I think that's awesome. But I still don't have a 3DS.

2118
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You know, so

2119
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Special year of Luigi

2120
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
green Wii U

2121
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't wanna see

2122
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
a green Wii U

2123
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I'm wondering what they're gonna

2124
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
do with the price, especially when these new

2125
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
consoles launch because it's gonna be

2126
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
tough if they're having trouble

2127
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
getting people to be interested in it now.

2128
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
When you have all that buzz of

2129
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
all these awesome Wii U's. Especially

2130
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
if, god forbid, you know

2131
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
that Destiny or something like that is not

2132
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
on the Wii U.

2133
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Granted I was on the Wii U

2134
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Destiny's on the Wii U

2135
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Madden's not on the Wii U

2136
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
People are gonna be like, well why do I need a Wii U?

2137
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yeah but if Zelda's on the Wii U

2138
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It's Wind Waker though!

2139
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I'm not even talking about Wind Waker

2140
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.

2141
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah, new Zelda games not coming out this year.

2142
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year

2143
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
other than Wind Waker HD.

2144
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
But that would be

2145
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
enough for some people though.

2146
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Something else to think about though

2147
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
All they would have to do

2148
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Wind Waker HD comes with one

2149
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
playable HD Zelda level.

2150
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Flying off shelves

2151
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You won't be able to find that shit anywhere

2152
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Watch

2153
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders

2154
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
had the Metal Gear

2155
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo

2156
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
in it that actually wasn't bad

2157
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and got a sequel

2158
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Crackdown

2159
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Alundra, didn't it have

2160
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
the Final Fantasy 7 demo?

2161
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I know I was saying Alundra

2162
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
How many people bought that

2163
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
and all the Dragon Ball fans?

2164
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yeah that was it, it was the 8 demo.

2165
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But anyway

2166
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
There's a lot of people who will go out

2167
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh shoot

2168
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Was it

2169
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
one of the games had a Xenogears

2170
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
demo with it too?

2171
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And there's people

2172
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
who will just buy a game to get the demo

2173
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
of something that they want more

2174
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Here's the thing honestly

2175
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now

2176
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Is because once these 3DS games

2177
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
are out it is all hands on fucking

2178
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
deck for the Wii U

2179
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Everybody at Nintendo first and second parties

2180
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
are going to be cranking out shit for Wii U

2181
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It is Wii U's last stand and it's going to be

2182
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
pretty fucking amazing to watch play out

2183
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I think that's why it's so

2184
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
3DS heavy because I think the holiday is going to end up

2185
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
pretty weak because I think

2186
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
there's like rush projects happening

2187
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
They're going to crank it out

2188
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
for this holiday season, they have to

2189
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And if we're still sitting here

2190
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
next January telling the same tale

2191
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
then I'll

2192
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo

2193
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
better be cooking up a Mario game

2194
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
for the Playstation 4

2195
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And in the end as long as there are

2196
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
people who have little kids they want to play

2197
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
games, they're going

2198
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
to go for a Nintendo system

2199
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Nintendo has that level of

2200
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
brand recognition and the association

2201
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
that they're working as a kid

2202
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
friendly, family friendly system

2203
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
until the kid

2204
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
falls over and drops the tablet

2205
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and breaks it

2206
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I agree, they're owning the

2207
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
handheld market but

2208
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
they may just not be a console

2209
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
But they weren't

2210
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
But they may just not be a console

2211
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
company anymore

2212
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Too early

2213
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I'm not, I don't want you

2214
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
to say I'm Nintendo defending

2215
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and all this stuff, I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this

2216
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It is pretty shitty

2217
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
This is having a worse month

2218
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
These numbers are so

2219
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
bad, it is worse than any month

2220
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
like the 360

2221
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
PlayStation 3

2222
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I wouldn't go that far

2223
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
has on record

2224
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
What were Dreamcast sales like

2225
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
in their first couple months?

2226
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point

2227
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It's just a different culture now

2228
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
There have been

2229
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
people that were drawing comparisons

2230
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
between Sega's last days

2231
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and Nintendo

2232
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Which is redonkulous

2233
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
That whole Nei saying whatever

2234
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
That's like the anti-fanboy

2235
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It's no better

2236
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
How well did GameCube do?

2237
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It was third place and Nintendo did fine

2238
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
As long as they're making enough money to keep

2239
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
costs up in the company

2240
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
As long as they're turning a profit

2241
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
or at least breaking even

2242
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
The handhelds

2243
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
are going to do that for them just fine

2244
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
They'll make it just fine

2245
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
They'll be around

2246
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's not going to be like Sega

2247
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Sega didn't have that handheld

2248
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Sega also had some stupid marketing

2249
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
They also had

2250
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
really bad piracy

2251
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That was the downfall of the Dreamcast

2252
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast

2253
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
had an entire CD

2254
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
spindle of burned games

2255
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Every single burned game

2256
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And then had their boot disk to play their imports

2257
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Yep

2258
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
No comment

2259
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Some people had

2260
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Para Para on their Dreamcast Rob

2261
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I don't think that system is done

2262
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I just think that right now

2263
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
They're not doing a lot

2264
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Basically the thing is they're not

2265
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy

2266
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U

2267
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
that they should buy a Wii U

2268
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
That's my thing

2269
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
They need to have some sort of

2270
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
here's what's coming out

2271
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
soon

2272
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah, working on Smash Bros. game

2273
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah, you know what?

2274
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You could have just launched this system and not said anything

2275
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros. game

2276
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Hell fuck!

2277
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Just say, hey we're working on an F-Zero game

2278
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
That would sell a few more systems

2279
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Rob would buy another system, there you go

2280
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Hell yeah

2281
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But I want to see the receipts

2282
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You already bought a system, Rob

2283
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I did buy a system, I'll buy another for F-Zero

2284
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I will, I need two gamepads

2285
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Two tablet controllers, yeah

2286
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Such a consumer war

2287

Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release

2292
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U

2293
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That's true

2294
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
This week we've got a couple big games

2295
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
coming out, the first one being Crysis 3

2296
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2297
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
and PC

2298
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

2299
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
on Playstation 3 and

2300
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Xbox 360

2301
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
We've got a PSP title, yes, there's actually

2302
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
a PSP game coming out still

2303
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Axis Games putting out

2304
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
visual novels for some reason on the PSP

2305
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Hakuoki, Warriors of

2306
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Shinsengumi on

2307
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
the PSP

2308
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I want to play that

2309
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And

2310
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Possibly at the end of this week

2311
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2

2312
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
the add-on content pack for Playstation 3 and

2313
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Xbox 360

2314
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
You can buy the content stuff

2315
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
or pre-order the game

2316
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Or your console isn't online

2317
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
You'll also be missing out on the next

2318
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
gen systems

2319
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I'm planning on picking one of these up because

2320
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
it allows me to install them into multiple systems

2321
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
and I've got two systems that we play on

2322
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?

2323
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yes, I'm sure, it's all on disk

2324
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Alright, then I can move on to

2325
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Japan

2326
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
On the Playstation 3 in Japan this week, some price

2327
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
reductions, the best series for

2328
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z

2329
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Ultimate Blast, Naruto

2330
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Ultimate Ninja Storm 2

2331
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Ryuga Gotoku of the End

2332
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and Saint Seiya Senkai

2333
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
As far as new games go, on February 21

2334
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

2335
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
comes out in Japan

2336
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
That's pretty awesome

2337
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?

2338
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Uh, yeah

2339
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Going into the beta, it's not new

2340
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oh, it's a re-release, ok

2341
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Also, how did I miss this?

2342
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm on the PS3, also on a price reduction this week

2343
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
in Japan. Don't you want to play Mass Effect

2344
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
with all Japanese garris?

2345
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I don't know if they did the voiceovers again

2346
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
if the subtitles are...

2347
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos

2348
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
to see if the voice is nearly as hot

2349
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It might be subs, it might not be dubs

2350
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
We don't know

2351
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Well, that just looks like the

2352
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
US trailer

2353
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, it doesn't

2354
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So it's probably just subs

2355
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh well

2356
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Anyhow, let's look at other systems

2357
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
How about anything on the Xbox 360?

2358
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Uh, price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon

2359
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
You have that to look forward to on the 360

2360
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think that we

2361
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
use bad here

2362
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yeah, exactly

2363
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And that's another thing people tend to forget

2364
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
is that, you know, oh well, forget it

2365
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
On the Vita, yes

2366
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
the Vita in Japan

2367
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
CL No Surge

2368
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Ushina Ureta Hoshi Isasagushi

2369
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Reincarnation

2370
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Also, next rev

2371
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Shoushi Shiken comes out

2372
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
both new games on the Vita this week

2373
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus

2374
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week

2375
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Did you know that?

2376
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I won't

2377
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
On the Wii U in Japan this week

2378
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
there is a game, Tank Tank Tank

2379
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
but we've talked about how that game

2380
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Tank Tank Tank before

2381
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week

2382
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Magi Hajimari no Meikyu

2383
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
comes out from Bandai Namco

2384
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Let's go to the UK

2385
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Dark Sakura

2386
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
In the UK we have a few things

2387
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
On the 21st we have

2388
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Metal Gear Solid Rising

2389
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And then on the 22nd

2390
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
there is Crysis 3

2391
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC

2392
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And

2393
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I think that's it

2394
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Let me check my calendar

2395
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Because I completely forgot

2396
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
the last day of the week is, yeah, that's it

2397
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
That's it

2398
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
We're done

2399
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

2400
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
and then the classic game of the week, Loki

2401
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So, we keep hearing a lot about

2402
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
this Xbox Entertainment

2403
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
and this TV

2404
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
initiative that they're doing

2405
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Well, apparently what they're working on

2406
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
is supposed to be this

2407
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
interactive TV

2408
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
and they're saying similar to how they have

2409
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
the interactive presentations of the Grammys

2410
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
or the Oscars or something like that

2411
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
that it would be some sort of

2412
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
interactive TV, I don't know if with Spark Glass

2413
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
or if they're talking more along the lines of like the Sesame Street

2414
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
stuff with Kinect

2415
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Throw the tomatoes at the people on stage

2416
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah, wouldn't that be awesome if like

2417
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
they did the Grammys through the Xbox or something

2418
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
and then it's like, you know, while Justin Timberlake

2419
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
is on stage, push A if you would like

2420
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
to release the hounds

2421
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Like that whole time

2422
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I would pay for that feature

2423
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
No, if it was like

2424
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Bieber

2425
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Throwing tomatoes

2426
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
would be funny though, like

2427
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends

2428
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Release the B's on the Bieber

2429
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
That's right

2430
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Push B for Beyonce

2431
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Or like

2432
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
they could have eye tracking

2433
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
or something like that

2434
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Who can stare at Katy Perry's

2435
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
breasts the least?

2436
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Go!

2437
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Dammit! Lost!

2438
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Or like camera switching

2439
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Like, you know, during a football game

2440
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
or something

2441
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah, during the Grammys

2442
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
there's one on the stage and one on

2443
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Chris Brown and Adele fighting

2444
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
and then there's another one on Katy Perry's

2445
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
breasts and you can just watch that

2446
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
cam the whole time, every time she applauds

2447
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yes

2448
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Rewind

2449
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Rewind

2450
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Push A if you want to release the Kraken

2451
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Amazing

2452
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
How about just 1 versus 100

2453
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
as a network?

2454
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Could that be the interactive TV?

2455
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Because that would be awesome

2456
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Game shows would rule

2457
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But I'm not going to hold my breath

2458
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
because that's too good

2459
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You know, right now

2460
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I would just like to see whatever

2461
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
it is that they're going to come out with

2462
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
and actually have it functioning without

2463
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
them saying, here's what we're going to do

2464
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
As far as I'm aware, and I know the new season

2465
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit

2466
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
working with goddamn Game of Thrones

2467
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
so, you know, why am I supposed to believe

2468
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
that, you know, any of this stuff is going to

2469
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
actually work either

2470
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
With smart glass? Yeah

2471
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And where's my

2472
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
goddamn interactive map on

2473
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Android? How about that smart glass?

2474
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Smart glass is fucking useless

2475
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
on Android, I can't like, do anything

2476
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
with it

2477
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you

2478
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It doesn't do anything

2479
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?

2480
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3

2481
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Woohoo!

2482
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Smart glass is the

2483
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
fucking future, everybody

2484
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
That's what I have the problem with these console manufacturers

2485
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
is coming up with stupid

2486
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
fucking ideas to do the same

2487
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
shit we've already been doing

2488
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Why do I need to have a new way to

2489
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
swipe through menus? Why do I need a stupid touchpad

2490
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
to swipe through menus when I can use the analog stick, the

2491
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
shoulder buttons, the directional

2492
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
pad? I've already got three fucking ways

2493
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
or connect? Why do I need

2494
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
another way? I'm sorry

2495
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
You know what Microsoft is? Microsoft is the

2496
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Fox TV of gaming. I don't mean Fox News

2497
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I mean Fox TV because like

2498
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
they announce this big feature and make a

2499
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
pomp and circumstance of it and then they

2500
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
cancel it after two episodes

2501
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Like seriously. They put it in the Friday death slot

2502
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Like XNA? Firefly

2503
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Right? Am I right?

2504
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
One versus a hundred? Wonder

2505
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Falls

2506
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Am I right?

2507
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Game Room?

2508
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
What other Fox shows got

2509
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
The Cleveland show? Is that still on the air?

2510
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
That is still on the air actually. The Game Room did

2511
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
last a good year or so before they pulled the plug

2512
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Running Wild

2513
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
What was the show about the town with the lake?

2514
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Eureka?

2515
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It was like two episodes or something

2516
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Eureka was on the lake

2517
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Eureka's on Syfy

2518
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Lake Town?

2519
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Well actually now it's NBC apparently

2520
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Would be the

2521
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
network to compare it to

2522
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
What was that show with the

2523
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
spies and they had like a house

2524
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I remember that

2525
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I don't know

2526
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
The Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a TV show?

2527
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
No not Mr. and Mrs. Smith

2528
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Or where Jamie gets her

2529
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
name. The Bionic Woman

2530
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Oh my gosh

2531
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Thank you Tigerclaw

2532
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Dollhouse

2533
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
They gave that a second season

2534
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Shadow Next Gen

2535
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Game Room got 13

2536
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
game packs and it had about

2537
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
100 games well on its way to that

2538
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Thousands of games they promised

2539
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
at CES

2540
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Thousands of games in my

2541
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
imagination

2542
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Technist

2543
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Sarah Connor Chronicles

2544
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
That was actually a decent show

2545
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
What would it last like 3 seasons?

2546
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
2 seasons?

2547
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
That's better than, you know, we're talking

2548
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Fireflies level stuff

2549
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It has Shirley Manson in it

2550
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah I was gonna say anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week

2551
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Like I'm gay and I still drool

2552
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
over her, she's hot

2553
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Alright

2554
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
One more story for you guys

2555
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I don't know how to transition into this story

2556
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Cause I'm not gay for GameStop that's for sure

2557
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
How about a big burp?

2558
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
GameStop

2559
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Power to the players

2560
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013

2561
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Supposedly even though they're closing

2562
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
250 they're gonna open

2563
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
60 to 70 more

2564
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But that's just, you know, location moving

2565
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
As neighborhoods build up there'll be new ones

2566
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And purchased

2567
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
40 are coming from UK retailer Game

2568
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So some of those GameStops will be in the UK

2569
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
A quote from the CFO

2570
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Rob Lloyd if you care

2571
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
During the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco

2572
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Quote

2573
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
We've been successful at that for two years

2574
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And we'll continue that program in 2013

2575
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah I think it's because a lot of these

2576
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
They took over like, you know, the EB

2577
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Games and stuff like that and they're in the same mall

2578
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Yeah or like literally you have

2579
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Like a GameStop and then across the street

2580
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Another GameStop

2581
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while

2582
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yeah

2583
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Yeah

2584
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Yeah

2585
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah

2586
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah

2587
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Yeah so

2588
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I mean

2589
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I think if, you know, again if you're in an unprofitable

2590
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Location or a redundant location

2591
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Then you're probably in trouble

2592
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
But I imagine most stores will be okay

2593
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But you know then CNN

2594
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Or Fox News since I mentioned them earlier

2595
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Picks up a story like this and

2596
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Console gaming is dead y'all

2597
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Console gaming is dead GameStop

2598
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Is closing their doors

2599
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out

2600
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
That their games that they sell are causing

2601
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
People to become murderers

2602
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
See it's proof right there

2603
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It's mobile phones, everybody wants to play Smurf Village

2604
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Haven't you heard?

2605
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Mobile phone, it's Temple Run, that's gaming

2606
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Smurf Village is just code for terrorism

2607
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Okay

2608
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
See now I have

2609
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
This is the mental image I'm seeing now

2610
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Is the ColecoVision Smurfs with

2611
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
You know AKs

2612
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Shooting Gargamel in the face

2613
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
My childhood has been raped

2614
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Well

2615
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
All I have to say to this news is

2616
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
LOL bye

2617
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Sorry to the people that work there

2618
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living

2619
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
But the corporation itself is

2620
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Kinda terrible so I hope that

2621
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Where the ashes land

2622
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
From old GameStops a new indie

2623
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Retailer will emerge one can at least dream

2624
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Hey Play'n Trade now is your chance

2625
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
To actually become like GameStop

2626
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Since you think you are anyways

2627
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Don't they have like a very similar logo too?

2628
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
They have

2629
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
That's GameTrader

2630
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah they actually think that they're like a GameStop

2631
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And they kinda try to

2632
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Push themselves away and they're like

2633
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Oh we got all these stores

2634
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Yeah it doesn't really

2635
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
They don't they actually haven't expanded in like

2636
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
A long time so

2637
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Alright let's take a step

2638
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Let's take a step back to a simpler time you guys

2639
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Let's go back to a time

2640
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Where GameStop actually had competition

2641
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Or back when GameStop

2642
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Wasn't even GameStop yet

2643
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Babbages, Funkoland

2644
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Software etc

2645
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Back before they were just all

2646
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Swallowed whole

2647
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
By GameStop

2648
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It's the classic game of the week

2649
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Star Saga take us back to simpler times

2650
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
The game of the week

2651
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Is Cinestar

2652
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah

2653
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Cinestar came out by Williams in 1982

2654
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And um

2655
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
It was uh

2656
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
A pretty neat little game

2657
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Kind of though

2658
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
For me I'm not very good at it

2659
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But I'll just keep going

2660
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Basically you are in a spacecraft and you have to create

2661
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Cinnabombs

2662
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Cinnabon? I love Cinnabon

2663
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I love Cinnabon

2664
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh my god

2665
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Show's cancelled we're going to Cinnabon bye bitches

2666
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I mean that's the good news is that

2667
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Even though GameStops are closing

2668
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Cinnabon next door will still be A-OK

2669
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It's not next door

2670
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
That was where the software etc used to be

2671
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Now there's like a what a tinder shop there?

2672
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Lady don't take me literally OK

2673
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
OK show's cancelled

2674
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Cinnabombs

2675
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You have to shoot

2676
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
At planetoids

2677
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And get the crystals that are released

2678
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And you have to use the bombs

2679
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
To defeat Cinestar

2680
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Who is this huge spacecraft

2681
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
With a skull face

2682
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And um

2683
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
You're constantly under construction as you're going through the game

2684
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So it's sort of like the Death Star

2685
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But without being the Death Star

2686
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah beware I live

2687
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid

2688
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I hunger for Cinnabons

2689
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
That's all pretty awesome

2690
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Wow

2691
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
This guy wants his fucking Cinnabon

2692
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So is this like actually Cinestar

2693
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Or is this like you know

2694
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live

2695
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
This is the guy that goes to the airport

2696
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
To get Cinnabon OK

2697
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
OK can I get back to the review please

2698
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
So once Cinestar is formed

2699
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
As we heard the digitized voice

2700
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Pops up who's actually a radio personality

2701
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
John Deramus

2702
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And it's played through an

2703
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
HD55516 CVSD decoder

2704
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Ooh says

2705
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I hunger coward

2706
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And then it tells you run run run

2707
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
But how would you run in space

2708
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Would it just be fly like a little bitch

2709
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I don't know

2710
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Anyway

2711
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So um

2712
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Basically it just eats you

2713
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinnabons

2714
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
To satiate this Cinestar

2715
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
He needs that cinnamon

2716
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Sugary goodness

2717
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So you move from zone to zone

2718
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And keep you know beating Cinestar

2719
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker

2720
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Why don't we go kill

2721
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
That asshole that keeps rebuilding

2722
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Exactly exactly They really weren't smart

2723
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
In the early 80's

2724
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So you have to go through the worker zone

2725
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
The warrior zone, planetoid zone and void zone

2726
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
The void zone being

2727
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
The difficult one because it has

2728
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Very few planetoids to blow up

2729
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Um

2730
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So also

2731
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You know of course

2732
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
The Cinestar can be repaired

2733
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
By its little drone fuckers

2734
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Unless you satiate him

2735
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
With tasty Cinabons

2736
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So yeah

2737
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
There were different ports

2738
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
There was the Atari 2600

2739
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
The 8 bit computers

2740
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
They were almost done

2741
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
But there was

2742
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
The video game crash and they're like no

2743
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
So we actually got it on

2744
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
The Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for

2745
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Smash, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast

2746
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Playstation and PC

2747
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures

2748
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
On Xbox, GameCube and PS2

2749
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
And then on PC

2750
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures

2751
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Extended Play for the PSP in 2005

2752
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It was one of the first

2753
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Games to use stereo

2754
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
In the sit down version

2755
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And it had

2756
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Independent sound boards just for that

2757
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
For purpose

2758
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And it used the 49 way

2759
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Joystick that Williams had produced

2760
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Specifically for that game

2761
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
As far as

2762
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Other versions that have come out

2763
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
There was a pseudo sequel

2764
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
On the PC in 1999

2765
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Called Cinestar Unleashed

2766
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
It had nothing to do with

2767
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
The original creators

2768
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
But it was supposed to be

2769
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
A pretty neat little game

2770
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And then Cinestar got re-released

2771
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
For the Midway's Greatest Arcade

2772
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Hits on the Game Boy

2773
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Advanced without

2774
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
The cool features

2775
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
There's also

2776
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
A lot of other little

2777
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Cinestar is really just

2778
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
You know

2779
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
A big part of classic gaming

2780
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Like in

2781
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
There was

2782
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'm trying to see if I can find it

2783
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
For Team Fortress 2

2784
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
The heavy weapons guy says I live

2785
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I run cowards

2786
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And then

2787
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Cinestar is in one of the

2788
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Dresden Files books

2789
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
There

2790
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
A group of students at the College of William and Mary

2791
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Did a musical version

2792
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Called Cinestar the Musical

2793
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I have to find this now

2794
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And then

2795
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
They used the voice of Cinestar

2796
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
In an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!

2797
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
The Abridged series

2798
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Which is a web series that

2799
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I've been introduced to

2800
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
This sequel

2801
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
When he wants Cinnabons he wants over

2802
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
9000

2803
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Couldn't help myself

2804
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Let's listen to some of the

2805
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
voice

2806
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
You throw those Cinnabons at him

2807
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You go ship

2808
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
There it is your classic game of the week

2809
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Beware I live

2810
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Cinestar

2811
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Available in arcades everywhere

2812
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
If you can find him in business

2813
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
If you live in 1982

2814
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So it's available in Bobby's arcade

2815
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yes

2816
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You had to have caught

2817
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Bobby's show to get the reference

2818
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
There it is your classic game of the week

2819
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And jeez Ron-Chan you're fast

2820
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
On the posting

2821
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
He's managing the tumblers

2822
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Shout out to the OLR tumbler

2823
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
The OLR tumbler is

2824
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com

2825
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And while you're at it

2826
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Look at my Mass Effect one

2827
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Isn't your Mass Effect one

2828
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
More popular than the Orange Lounge radio one?

2829
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Yes

2830
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
So you don't need the help

2831
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I'll repost it

2832
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I'll show some promo love

2833
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
You'll tumble it

2834
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game

2835
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
That's not going to happen

2836
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Last episode

2837
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
We're not going to have a last episode

2838
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
We're going to do this until we're dead

2839
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Well then there would be a final episode

2840
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Yeah but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly

2841
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
This is morbid

2842
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I don't like where this is going

2843
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Beware I die

2844
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Give me Cinnabons

2845
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Rob ate one too many Cinnabons

2846
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
He dead

2847
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Let's remember with the theme

2848
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
from Mass Effect

2849
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Alright

2850
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Well that does it for the classic game of the week

2851
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I've said that three times now

2852
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
So I swear we're done with part A

2853
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
But don't go anywhere because this show is so much fun

2854
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
We've got plenty more coming in part B

2855
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Including the foogle question of the week

2856
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
A very interesting patent name

2857
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Something that Sony did

2858
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Oh god somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news

2859
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
There is news and yes it is legit

2860
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Information on Mass Effect

2861
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000

as we are live

2872
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
You should join us sometimes Sunday nights

2873
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
at the voice of geeks network

2874
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
vognetwork.com

2875
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Where you can hear such live antics as

2876
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break

2877
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
When some quiet music is playing

2878
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
So people can hear what we're saying

2879
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Just barely though

2880
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Oops oh well

2881
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
See at least we weren't talking any smack

2882
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
It was just more Nino Cooney talk

2883
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It was Nino Cooney talk and Rob

2884
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Coffee

2885
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And birthday cake oreos that's really all you missed

2886
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Alright there you go

2887
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
ActDeft says it's the Flaco Jones curse

2888
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
taking its course

2889
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Well if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's gonna get

2890
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I guess I'll take it

2891
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
That's not so bad

2892
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I was sitting here going like

2893
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Oh that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight

2894
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I can't even

2895
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Just kidding

2896
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week

2897
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I've played Aliens

2898
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Colonial Marines all his fault

2899
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
He didn't warn me

2900
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Why Bobby?

2901
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Why?

2902
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Alright I would never

2903
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Alright anyhow

2904
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Let's get back into some gaming

2905
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
news rapid fire news time

2906
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So Eain Zinga

2907
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
settled their lawsuits over the

2908
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Ville which was ripping off

2909
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
social and

2910
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
of course we don't know any of the

2911
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
details of what they settled for but it's settled

2912
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
and that's over

2913
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I was hoping for a

2914
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
long drawn out

2915
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
fist fight

2916
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I wanted it to be Judge Judy

2917
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
solved I wanted it to go to Judge

2918
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Judy

2919
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Don't sit there

2920
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
and tell me you didn't know what you're doing

2921
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Um

2922
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Halo 2 on

2923
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
PC the multiplayer support has been

2924
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
extended thanks to

2925
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
you know

2926
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
begging from fans

2927
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Originally it was gonna be cutting

2928
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
the servers off on

2929
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
February 15th

2930
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
but apparently now it's

2931
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
been extended to June

2932
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
and they're investigating further options

2933
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
to support the fans

2934
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
of the Halo 2 on PC so

2935
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
that's good

2936
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
That's good news for the dozens and dozens

2937
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
of people still playing

2938
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Halo 2 on PC

2939
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Who do you think has more? More people playing

2940
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Halo 2 on PC or more people that

2941
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
listens to OLR? What do you think?

2942
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
OLR

2943
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Really? I was gonna go for Halo

2944
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Actually yeah I mean with all

2945
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
you know all kidding aside

2946
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Halo 2 I mean it's the only place you can

2947
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
play it since

2948
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
you know they shut down the Xbox 360

2949
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
or excuse me Xbox regular

2950
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
one because of 360 infrastructure

2951
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
that they never really

2952
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
followed through on

2953
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than

2954
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
100 people on our friends list?

2955
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Oops

2956
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Um and then finally

2957
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Sniper Elite has a brand new game

2958
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
in their franchise and going the route of

2959
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
most other game franchises out there

2960
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
they've decided to add zombies

2961
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie

2962
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Army is gonna be coming out exclusively

2963
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
on PC they're out on

2964
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Steam for $15

2965
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
and that's at the end of this

2966
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
month on the 28th

2967
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite

2968
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
it's a World War 2 sniper game

2969
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
and the second Sniper Elite game

2970
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
you actually got to shoot the balls

2971
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
off of Hitler if you wanted to

2972
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Hooray

2973
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
They even have the cool like you know Mortal Combat

2974
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
X-Ray mode thing where you can see the

2975
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
testicles explode Oh that's so

2976
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
lovely

2977
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Thank you for that

2978
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
And in case you didn't get that game they actually are re-releasing

2979
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
the uh Sniper Elite V2 with

2980
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
the Kill Hitler

2981
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
uh you know

2982
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
DLC in there which it should really be teamed up

2983
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
with Danger 5 you know cause

2984
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
their mission is

2985
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
to kill Hitler Orange Lounge Radio is apparently

2986
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
the show this week where people can hear about

2987
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
exploding Hitler's balls

2988
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I thought they only had one

2989
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Anyhow

2990
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Uh is that it?

2991
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Please be it That's it

2992
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Let's move on to something a lot less offensive

2993
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
It is uh Bit.Trip

2994
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
uh the Bit.Trip series

2995
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
uh Bit.Trip soundtracks

2996
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
for 20 bucks

2997
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
and when you pre-order

2998
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
with that 20 bucks the

2999
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Bit.Trip Runner 2 future

3000
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Legend of Rhythm Alien you will get

3001
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
6 Bit.Trip soundtracks

3002
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
for free although they're not really free cause you're paying

3003
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
20 bucks for it but uh

3004
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
pretty cool you know if you are a fan of

3005
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Bit.Trip Runner so in other words if you're not Bobby

3006
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I was gonna say is that like kind of how

3007
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
they try to sell you two pieces of crap on

3008
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
TV and really the whole

3009
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
trick is just to get you to pay twice as much

3010
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
for more than one that you need The trick is

3011
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
to get you to pre-order Bit.Trip Runner 2

3012
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
and boost its numbers

3013
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
but the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good

3014
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
like if you like the 8-bit music

3015
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff

3016
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks

3017
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
In fact I imagine most of you have um

3018
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
acquired the soundtracks if you're

3019
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
a fan of the series but wouldn't it be nice

3020
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
to get them legally and you can do

3021
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
that here for 20 bucks

3022
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
pre-order

3023
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
uh let's see I also

3024
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I guess apparently uh you

3025
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
can get some of the soundtracks for a dollar

3026
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
and then 10 dollars you get the Runner 2

3027
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
soundtrack as well well look at that

3028
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
good times

3029
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
uh there is a game

3030
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive

3031
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
version of said game it's Need for Speed

3032
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Most Wanted uh this game

3033
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

3034
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
last year

3035
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
but it's coming out on the Wii

3036
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
this year and

3037
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
uh it's gonna have some new stuff in it such as

3038
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
the whole uh you can actually

3039
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
you know have the off TV mode on the gamepad

3040
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
but then there's something about on the gamepad

3041
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
you can actually help

3042
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
somebody that's playing on the big

3043
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
screen uh you can guide

3044
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
them you can help them or you can either

3045
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
hinder them they're calling it a co-driver

3046
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
father and son mode is something

3047
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
that they've called it amongst the criterion

3048
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
developers you can literally have

3049
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your

3050
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
shit up on that gamepad

3051
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
that reminds me of what I do in Grand Theft Auto sometimes

3052
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I'll have a thing where I can spawn cars

3053
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
in front of me actually on my phone I'll do that

3054
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
and I'll put it in first person mode and let the cab driver

3055
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
try to drive while I'm dropping boats in front

3056
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
of him and he just like

3057
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
dropping boats yes that's awesome

3058
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
on the gamepad you can turn traffic on

3059
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
and off you can change the environment between

3060
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
night and day distract cops

3061
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
get a map that shows you where the cops

3062
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
are and the speed cameras and

3063
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
you can just take control away of the car from the driver

3064
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
awesome

3065
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
doing it wrong I'll be taking over

3066
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
into the wall

3067
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
uh there you go so uh

3068
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
let me see a quote from Alexander

3069
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Ward creative director quote

3070
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
when we sat down to think about bringing Most Wanted

3071
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
to Wii U we thought of this in a car game

3072
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
what can the second player in the room do

3073
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
we could have just released a vanilla version

3074
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
of the game put it out and say hey it's Most Wanted

3075
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
on the Wii U but really Nintendo's

3076
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
challenge there is to allow others to interact

3077
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
with the main player using the gamepad

3078
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
you know when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted

3079
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
on the Wii U I got the impression that you were gonna

3080
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
have two people playing at the

3081
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
same time one on the gamepad one on the

3082
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
TV I think you can do that that sounded

3083
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
a lot better I think you could do that too

3084
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I think there's just oh good this is

3085
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
another mode they should really have it just

3086
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
like passenger mode where you just

3087
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
your gamepad is like the side window

3088
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
you can roll it up and down and that's it

3089
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
and the wind blows in your face and

3090
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
that's all you can really do is just look out the window

3091
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
and roll the window up and down I wonder if there will be

3092
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
a dark soccer mode where a big button will pop

3093
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
up and you push it and it goes Dan

3094
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
coffee you are never

3095
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
gonna let me live that down little Starbucks

3096
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
shows up on your map

3097
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
you know there's people listening who probably

3098
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
have no idea where that came from

3099
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
you wanna tell the story or should I

3100
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
go ahead we were on a road

3101
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
trip to Disneyland and I was trapped in

3102
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
the back seat with Dan and dark soccer

3103
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
in the front as they were having

3104
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
heated discussions

3105
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
through the trip down but

3106
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
one of the things that you know would happen

3107
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
for hundreds and hundreds of miles is that

3108
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
dark soccer would be Dan

3109
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
coffee and

3110
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
every time we drove by a Starbucks which when

3111
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
you're on highway 99 is all the time

3112
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
five miles Dan

3113
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
coffee

3114
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
so Rob where's your phone

3115
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
finally shut up

3116
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
so finally finally we get to

3117
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
a Starbucks like we're like halfway to Disneyland

3118
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
we finally pull over to Starbucks and

3119
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
she gets her coffee and I proceed to

3120
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
leave my cell phone in the sandwich

3121
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
shop except oh it was actually in my back

3122
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
pocket the whole time

3123
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
wah wah wah wah

3124
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
now you know when knowing is

3125
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
half the battle aren't you glad she

3126
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
asked me to tell that story I didn't ask

3127
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
you to tell the story it's so people don't get it

3128
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
so I could delay this news

3129
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
the 3DS has become the

3130
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
best gaming machine out there

3131
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
is a attention grabbing headline

3132
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
that was run on Kotaku this week

3133
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
why Kotaku an attention grabbing headline

3134
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
that's unheard of

3135
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
they don't stretch the truth at all

3136
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
no

3137
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
uh yeah so

3138
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
how many articles did they write about hating

3139
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
aliens colonial marines I can't remember

3140
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
was it in the double digits because I think it was

3141
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
uh

3142
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
honestly I was

3143
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
this story was something that was shared with us

3144
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
in the show world thread by somebody

3145
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview

3146
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
with somebody but no it actually

3147
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
is just a whole story written about

3148
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
hey the 3D remember when the

3149
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
3DS was fucked and now

3150
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
look at all this stuff oh my god it's just basically

3151
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News

3152
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
that had already been run

3153
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
but now under the guise of this is why the

3154
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
3DS is the best

3155
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
fucking game system

3156
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
considering that there's like

3157
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
you know

3158
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
they're talking handheld game system

3159
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
there's really only a couple to choose from

3160
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
one of them being the 3DS and one of them being

3161
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
the Vita no one's really gonna make the argument

3162
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system

3163
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
out there

3164
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I'm tapping

3165
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
my finger do I want to go there

3166
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
do I want to go behind door number 4

3167
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
a system is only as good as the

3168
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
games that are on it

3169
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
no I unless it has reach around

3170
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I have another rant brewing

3171
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
do I want to go there

3172
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
drama

3173
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
this website is such shit

3174
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
why does everybody keep reading it

3175
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
and here I am talking about it

3176
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
and it's gonna be more people checking it

3177
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I fucking can't

3178
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
why do we keep bringing

3179
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
this fucking shitty

3180
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
website up all of the time

3181
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and why does their attention grabbing antics

3182
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
work all of the time

3183
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I can't anymore

3184
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I do not want any stories

3185
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
from this website ever again on our show

3186
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
we are better than this

3187
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
done, banned

3188
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I'm serious, do not link this

3189
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
website ever again for a news story

3190
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
there are better places on the internet to get your

3191
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
gaming news done

3192
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
they just grab all the stories from other people anyway

3193
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
just go to the site, click the link that they got

3194
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
and then use that one

3195
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I am taking a stand here, I am not

3196
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
giving these fuckers hits anymore

3197
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
it is ridiculous

3198
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Rob, yes, coffee

3199
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I think I might need

3200
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
another cup

3201
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
how about some more news stories DarkSakura

3202
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Sega

3203
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
yay, I love you Sega

3204
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Sega has

3205
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
a line of PCs

3206
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
it's called the Sega Note PC laptop

3207
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
and they have different styles, there's the generic

3208
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn

3209
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
and the Dreamcast

3210
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
and they're

3211
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
anywhere between

3212
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
$1,000 to $2,100

3213
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
and

3214
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
they'll come with the 64 bit version

3215
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
of Windows 8

3216
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
a 1920 by 1080 display

3217
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
4 gigs of RAM and a 500 gigabyte

3218
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
hard drive

3219
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
and a Pentium 2020M processor

3220
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
so yeah

3221
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
and it will be obsolete in 5 seconds

3222
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
moving on, how about some Square

3223
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Square

3224
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
actually

3225
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
registered

3226
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain

3227
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
domains

3228
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
so maybe we're gonna see some

3229
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
re-releases or

3230
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
reboots, but there's

3231
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
wolfensteinspiel.com

3232
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
and warfornasgoth.com

3233
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
so

3234
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
who knows

3235
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game, I hope it's done

3236
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
in Wolfenstein 3D fashion

3237
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
the 3D ones never were

3238
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I love the little

3239
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I love the little sound they make

3240
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
like

3241
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
with the digitized voices

3242
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
what

3243
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I'm just American

3244
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
you know that

3245
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
actually when they did the re-releases

3246
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
with that one, it's actually like banned in Switzerland

3247
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Tina Turner

3248
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
cannot play Wolfenstein now

3249
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
in her new home

3250
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
country

3251
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I love that woman, I'm sure she's crushed

3252
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
and then

3253
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
last but not least

3254
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit

3255
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been

3256
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
trying to ignore because Axl Rose

3257
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
pretty much has been

3258
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
well, yeah it got

3259
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
thrown out of fraud court so

3260
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
not a big deal anymore

3261
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Axl sucks

3262
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
it's all good, he's attached to what

3263
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
that new Band Fuse game that's coming out

3264
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
and you know Band Fuse, the one that's gonna try to do the same

3265
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
thing that what Power Gig tried to do

3266
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
you remember Power Gig

3267
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
right?

3268
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I do remember Power Gig

3269
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
yes, so Band Fuse

3270
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
the new Mastiff music game is gonna be coming out

3271
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
it's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing

3272
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
but I think the difference with this one

3273
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
was that it's real guitar

3274
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
and you can sing

3275
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
that's really it

3276
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
you know what, you could do that with

3277
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Beatles Rock Band

3278
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
well that's not a real

3279
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
guitar though

3280
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
but no one cares

3281
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
mostly more than Band Fuse

3282
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
was that it?

3283
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit

3284
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
jeez Rob, I was chatting with chatters

3285
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Rab! I was participating

3286
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
think of another one

3287
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
my extended hate boner was spewing

3288
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
into the chat room, alright

3289
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
your hate boner

3290
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
tonight's show has been brought to you by the words

3291
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
hate and boner

3292
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
in other words hate boner used in tandem

3293
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
be sure to make the special noise

3294
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
let's go to a segment that never makes us

3295
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners

3296
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
have to say in the Google Question of the Week

3297
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

3298
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
or our Google Plus community

3299
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
you can participate with

3300
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
a question we ask of our fan communities

3301
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
each week on the program

3302
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
starting off with this week's

3303
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
question

3304
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
it was announced today that the new game Destiny

3305
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
will require a persistent internet connection

3306
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
on previous episodes, OLR and Bobby

3307
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
have talked about other games that require

3308
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
an always online internet connection

3309
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
such as Diablo 3 and the new

3310
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
SimCity

3311
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
how do you feel about games that require an always on

3312
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
internet connection?

3313
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
and where I was kind of going with this

3314
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
you know, obviously listeners come to draw their own conclusions

3315
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
and part of the reason we do this

3316
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
was that we let some games

3317
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
slip by and it's fine

3318
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
it's accepted, like World of Warcraft

3319
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
always online internet connection

3320
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
new SimCity

3321
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
we're not so forgiving

3322
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
but Destiny kind of falls

3323
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
in that weird kind of middle part where it's like

3324
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
well, clearly online is a big

3325
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
component of it, but you're going to have to

3326
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
always be connected, so I was curious

3327
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
if our listeners kind of

3328
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
gave it a pass or no

3329
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
we only had one response on Google Plus

3330
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
so I'll read that, from Rentertainment

3331
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
the one guy still using Google Plus

3332
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
we need a high profile game with a

3333
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
wide and vocal audience to have an always

3334
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
on internet connection mandate

3335
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
that way when some part of it fails

3336
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
leaving people unable to play the game they paid

3337
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
money for, the general public will rage

3338
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
out about it, when the public rages out

3339
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
about it, assuming these companies actually give

3340
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
a shit about what the public wants, these

3341
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
companies will finally see

3342
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
how appropriate

3343
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
these companies will finally see

3344
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
what a mistake the always on

3345
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
internet connection mandate is

3346
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Rentertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to

3347
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
introduce you to a game called Diablo 3

3348
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
this actually

3349
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
happened, you couldn't log in

3350
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
to Diablo 3 for like a week

3351
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off

3352
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
after like an hour, and

3353
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
speaking of hate boner, the internet

3354
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
really had a big one for Diablo 3

3355
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
because of the always online, because you might remember

3356
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Diablo 2, you could play

3357
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
LAN, and you could play offline

3358
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
there's actually a game

3359
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny

3360
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
that's going to be similar to this

3361
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
SimCity

3362
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I'm talking about more long lines of Destiny

3363
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
like an online first person

3364
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
shooter game that's

3365
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
kind of like an MMO type thing

3366
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Defiance from Trion

3367
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
games, that's going to be coming out

3368
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
in April, and it's

3369
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
online only

3370
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
they are an MMO company

3371
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
however, this is a game

3372
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
it's buy to play type thing

3373
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
and it's on consoles

3374
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
on PC and PS3, Xbox 360

3375
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
so this

3376
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
is something similar to

3377
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
that, obviously not

3378
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
as grand as I guess

3379
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Destiny, but I see

3380
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
this actually has an online port

3381
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
once again, it was very vague on

3382
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
everything, on why it needs

3383
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
to be, why is it that

3384
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
we need this

3385
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
online world

3386
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth

3387
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
we're going to have battles and stuff like that

3388
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into

3389
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
or is it just like

3390
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
oh, well I need to see my friend

3391
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
he just cleared this spot

3392
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
so now the enemies are easier here

3393
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I don't know, I don't really know what they're doing

3394
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
but it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there

3395
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
versus SimCity where

3396
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
you just interact with your friends

3397
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
cities that they make

3398
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Diablo 3, despite everybody

3399
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
raging on it and everything

3400
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
still sold, what, 11 million

3401
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
that's

3402
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I don't think that's going to tell them

3403
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I got the message, no more always online

3404
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
yeah, right, well, and if that were the case

3405
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
we wouldn't be seeing it now like a

3406
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
fucking trend, right, like Destiny

3407
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
SimCity, you know

3408
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
the game Loki just talked about and all these other

3409
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
things, so

3410
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
alright, I just got a

3411
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
text message from the person that

3412
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
linked me that story originally that I blew up

3413
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
at, I'll just say it's Jason

3414
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
he doesn't mind me saying that I'm sure, he says

3415
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
in their defense it was

3416
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
an opinion piece, not news, but

3417
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
lol, I was the straw that broke the camel's back

3418
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
this is like congratulations

3419
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
you are the catalyst

3420
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
let me just put it this way, this is

3421
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
this is a website, Rob chose the red ending

3422
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not going back

3423
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
down this road, no, close the door

3424
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
lock it, done, alright

3425
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
moving on, alright, what do you want to

3426
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I just want to say

3427
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Gawker figured out animated

3428
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
gifs a couple months ago, and they've

3429
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
been running with it ever since

3430
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
you know the gif format has been on the internet

3431
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
since like the early 90s, I understand that

3432
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
but now they literally have posts

3433
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
they're like, hey look at this, these are

3434
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
some animated gifs I made based off of

3435
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
this trailer that just came out

3436
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
you know, I think it's funny that gif is still associated

3437
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
with CompuServe, so they got a Tumblr

3438
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
account, or started reading, oh no

3439
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
they didn't, because those are the things I associate

3440
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
with the animated gif, I get my best animated

3441
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
gifs ever from OhNoTheyDidn't

3442
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
which is a LiveJournal community and

3443
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal

3444
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
that and Russian Meteorite sightings

3445
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
so, anyhow

3446
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
do they have like sightings like

3447
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I just saw the Russian Meteorite down Starbucks

3448
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
down the street here, no, well you know LiveJournal

3449
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
is huge in Russia, LiveJournal is like

3450
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I don't know if it's Facebook big in Russia, it got purchased

3451
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
by a Russian company, yeah I mean, but not

3452
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
that's not the reason it's big in Russia, it just

3453
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
it is big in Russia, I just thought it might have been a meme

3454
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
thing or something like that, where they, it's like

3455
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
no, but like a lot of the YouTubes

3456
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
were linked to people's Russian LiveJournals

3457
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
alright, cool, you know, I'm glad LiveJournal

3458
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
is still alive somewhere, anyhow

3459
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
foogle, hello

3460
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
always online connections and some

3461
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
of our answers from Facebook, which really

3462
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
had a lot of answers on it, so I can't

3463
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
read them all, so please visit our

3464
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Facebook community and read them all in their entirety

3465
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
facebook.com slash orange lounge

3466
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
radio, Fabrice A

3467
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
says very annoying and they are

3468
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
punishing the wrong people, some people have a

3469
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
crappy internet connection or even no internet

3470
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
connection at all, so they can hardly play

3471
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
people who bought the game legally and suffer

3472
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
one of the previous problems can't play

3473
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
people who play illegally don't

3474
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
have any of those problems because the DRM

3475
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
is absent

3476
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
flaming toilet, god I love that name

3477
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
says I would think that the fiasco with

3478
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
PSN going down for two months a couple

3479
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
years ago would have taught game makers that

3480
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
requiring an always on internet connection

3481
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
is a very bad idea

3482
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
but they're always going to think it's never going to happen

3483
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
to us, how many games were unplayable

3484
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
or almost unplayable during that time

3485
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
because there was no network to connect to

3486
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
thank you flaming toilet for reminding us

3487
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
never forget

3488
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
playstation network fucking went down

3489
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
like it ate shit

3490
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
literal shit for two months

3491
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
horrible

3492
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
cell agent why not says

3493
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
we're sorry, your game is not available at this

3494
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
time, please hang up and try again

3495
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
lolz

3496
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
you remember that crap that actually happened with me in mass effect 3

3497
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
when they were having the origin

3498
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
issues, yes, and I couldn't

3499
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
connect, but I also couldn't play

3500
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
my single player game because it

3501
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
wouldn't verify my DLC

3502
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
yeah

3503
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Christopher K replies and says

3504
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
the always on idea is such that

3505
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
people won't exploit and mod the games

3506
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
this enables companies to utilize

3507
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
microtransactions and disable cheat

3508
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
codes that allow players replayability

3509
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
if they want to fully explore the game after

3510
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
completion, it's a way for publishers

3511
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
to siphon more than the games retail

3512
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
price for those who want shortcuts

3513
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
there are several countries that still do

3514
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
cap bandwidth or spotty internet coverage

3515
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
why shouldn't I be allowed to play a game

3516
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I paid for whenever, wherever I

3517
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
like, I'm not too opposed to an

3518
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
online activation of sorts, but let me

3519
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
play offline when I'm traveling

3520
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
you know a good point that this indirectly

3521
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
brings up is that you know we've heard about

3522
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Destiny's 10 year plan and so forth

3523
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
what happens after 10 years

3524
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
what happens when

3525
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
they want to pull the servers

3526
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and so forth, where's that

3527
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
$60 investment in the game I made

3528
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
and you know I heard

3529
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
damn I wish I could remember where I heard about this

3530
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
but I remember hearing about one

3531
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
of the reasons why $60 games and people

3532
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
are willing to pay that $60 price is the

3533
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
equity that you're getting in those games

3534
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
the fact that you can turn around and sell those games

3535
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
for a value later, and when you

3536
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
talk about

3537
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
when you talk about robbing people

3538
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
of the ability to sell used games

3539
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
that there's now no

3540
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
equity and there's nothing worth

3541
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
investing $60 in

3542
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
but if your game, you know if you were going to turn off

3543
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
used games and then have it be $30

3544
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
maybe that wouldn't feel like

3545
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
such a blow because the games

3546
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
overall are cheaper and this could actually be a

3547
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
great thing for everybody if the games are really

3548
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
cheap

3549
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I still think $30 or $40

3550
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
might be too much

3551
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
my point is though

3552
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I can still plug in an Atari 2600

3553
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
and appreciate the games I grew up on

3554
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
let's say

3555
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
for whatever reason Destiny is a game

3556
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
that Flacco gets his kids to start playing

3557
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
which I doubt but

3558
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
just humor me for a minute here

3559
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
what if they want to revisit that game in their 30s

3560
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
and they can't because the 10 years is up

3561
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
the servers are down, the plug's been pulled

3562
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
what now?

3563
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
it's sad

3564
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
there are games that are like that

3565
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
a lot of these games that were online

3566
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
only or something like that

3567
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
they're just completely useless now

3568
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I don't know

3569
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I can't think of anything that you would have

3570
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
but yeah

3571
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
they pull servers all the time

3572
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
so it's very possible

3573
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I'm sure there's some MMOs, especially some of these

3574
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Sony MMOs that

3575
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
went offline

3576
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I know there's a few that we mentioned before

3577
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
even like Playstation 2 games

3578
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
and stuff like that

3579
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I don't know

3580
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
even big MMOs go down to main

3581
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
say if you bought a boxed copy

3582
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
of The Matrix online or something like that

3583
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
you can never play Tabula Rasa

3584
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
you can never play it

3585
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Star Wars Galaxies

3586
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
yeah that's right, you will never experience

3587
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
the pre-New Galaxy

3588
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
experience, or the post for that matter

3589
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
ever again in your life

3590
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon

3591
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
he's just gonna get killed

3592
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
the WoW killer is coming out

3593
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Flaco

3594
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
The WoW killer, Elder Scrolls Online

3595
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
it's the WoW killer, Flaco

3596
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
now Destiny's the WoW killer

3597
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I keep seeing that in the chat all night

3598
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
they're both killing WoW

3599
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Miss Scarlet killed WoW

3600
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
in the conservatory with the lead pipe

3601
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
hate boner

3602
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
back to Fugal

3603
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Burr replied and said

3604
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
in the case of Destiny

3605
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I can be justified by what they're trying to do

3606
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
with the gameplay, which at least makes me a little

3607
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
more understanding about it

3608
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
however, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?

3609
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
get out of our head

3610
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I feel like always on DRM is a decision

3611
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
made by focusing too much on the short term

3612
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
if this trend continues

3613
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history

3614
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
when servers inevitably retire

3615
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
or entire publishers go bankrupt

3616
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant

3617
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
fits right in, doesn't it?

3618
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Red The Haze says

3619
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
not everyone has internet

3620
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
and the US is far from number one

3621
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
when it comes to internet

3622
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Gary B replies and says

3623
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I wanted to see if I could Facebook

3624
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
stalk this guy and figure out where he lived

3625
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?

3626
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
or else I'll get

3627
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
behind in some sort of

3628
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
quest or whatever the fuck is going on

3629
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
it might also be something that

3630
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
kind of turns me off to it because

3631
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I don't have the time to dedicate

3632
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
to an MMO or something like that

3633
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Last comment

3634
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our

3635
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Facebook to read them all

3636
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
jlinks says

3637
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Well I could play FPS's offline

3638
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
in single player, I didn't make that

3639
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
the main reason I bought the game

3640
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
if the game's good and I have the methods available

3641
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
to play it, I'll buy it, simple as that

3642
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That's our comments

3643
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
from Facebook and Google Plus

3644
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
thank you guys who all responded

3645
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
sorry I didn't read everybody's

3646
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
but it's only a three hour show

3647
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Let's get to a few more news stories

3648
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
and pretty soon Skype calls

3649
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Loki

3650
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I swear to god that Sony is trolling us

3651
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
because there is no way that like

3652
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I just

3653
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
can't believe that they would actually

3654
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
do this, but apparently

3655
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
there is a patent that they have

3656
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
and I know this is going to come

3657
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
as a shock to you guys, they actually

3658
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
have a tablet that they have patented

3659
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and I'm really

3660
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I need to check this out right now

3661
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
to see what it's called, but they're calling

3662
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
the iPad

3663
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
like E-Y-E pad, there is no way that

3664
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
that is called the iPad

3665
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
that's a

3666
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
European patent thing that they're

3667
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
showing me here, it doesn't really help me very much

3668
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
17 pages

3669
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
let's see, 17 pages

3670
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I think it looks like it's made out of

3671
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
particle board or something like that

3672
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
it's just weird, but basically it's

3673
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
a tablet device, looks thin

3674
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
looks like a directional pad, you know

3675
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
face buttons, possibly a speaker

3676
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
and one analog stick, shame

3677
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
on you Sony, have you not

3678
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
learned from the PSP one analog

3679
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
stick that's more than the iPad's

3680
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
got, well still though

3681
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I like the big square sharp

3682
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
corner design, reminds me of the NES

3683
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
will I be able to install MAME on this?

3684
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I don't know

3685
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
so they don't really

3686
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
say, I want to make sure that

3687
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
it's actually called the

3688
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
iPad or

3689
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I had heard that name too

3690
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
for what it's worth, now

3691
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I think that someone's making that up

3692
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I don't honestly think that they

3693
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
would do that, oh my god

3694
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
no, they actually have it

3695
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
called the iPad

3696
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
it makes sense, the Playstation 9

3697
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
but again, take it with a jar of salt

3698
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
a gallon of salt, no

3699
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
it's in their patent information

3700
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
they refer to it as the iPad

3701
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
like E-Y-E pad

3702
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
that's a patent law, that's a lawsuit

3703
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
right there, holy fuck balls really

3704
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
and honestly I think

3705
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
this is something that you would see from a Chinese

3706
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
knock off, you know, like iPad

3707
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
thing that they would actually have it spelled out like that

3708
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
so

3709
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
yeah, so they have this thing

3710
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
patented, who knows

3711
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
there was the iToy

3712
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
that's true

3713
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I understand why they're using the iPad

3714
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
and the Playstation 9 and all that stuff

3715
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
it makes sense to me, however

3716
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Apple's gonna go, no, fuck you

3717
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
you can't call it the iPad

3718
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
this really is a whole come at me bro

3719
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
move at Apple

3720
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
but again, huge

3721
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
results, you know, I don't know

3722
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
this seems, it seems unnecessary

3723
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
to have both this and the

3724
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
little thingy built into the controller

3725
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I don't understand

3726
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
well, here's some of the stuff, let me just read some of the cool things

3727
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
that they're saying that this thing has

3728
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
they're saying that

3729
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
it's gonna have stereoscopic

3730
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
cameras on it, so you're gonna be able to

3731
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
like, I guess, record 3D or

3732
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
something like that, kind of like the 3DS

3733
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
they're saying that there's some

3734
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
sort of

3735
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
weird prism thing going on

3736
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
with their touchpad and stuff

3737
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
it's gonna have 6-axis

3738
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
built into it, at least that's what they're

3739
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
everything has a 6-axis

3740
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
built into it

3741
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
so I guess, you know, we'll have to hear more about it

3742
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
if this is gonna be part of the Playstation 4

3743
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
is this a story coming from my favorite

3744
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
website, because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit

3745
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
no, it's a patent, it's actually a patent

3746
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
this is, I'm reading this

3747
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
you can understand why I'm asking though, right?

3748
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
no, no, no, no, I'm reading all of this

3749
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
yes, they did run this

3750
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
they did run the story as did everyone else

3751
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
but I'm just saying though, this is actually from

3752
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
the patent, I'm reading straight out of the patent

3753
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
description

3754
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
maybe patent, we don't know if it's real

3755
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
right? is it coming from the official patent

3756
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
website, or is it

3757
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
they have a link there or something?

3758
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
well they've got it, it's from

3759
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
it's actually linked from

3760
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
or it's embedded from the European

3761
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
patent applications

3762
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
nah, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it

3763
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
it's true, but

3764
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
it also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games

3765
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily

3766
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
a tie-in to the Playstation 4

3767
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit

3768
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
so why would they not maybe want to come up

3769
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
with a hybrid Playstation tablet

3770
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
well, they're saying though, here's one of the things

3771
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
is therefore, in addition to the convenient

3772
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis

3773
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
controller provides the PS3

3774
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
with data and all that stuff, now they're talking about

3775
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
PS3 a little bit

3776
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
uh

3777
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I don't know, we'll see

3778
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
it's just

3779
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
it seems a little weird, but

3780
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
they could do it, I guess

3781
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I mean, they tried to put out some Playstation

3782
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
or Playstation branded

3783
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
tablets

3784
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
that all looked really weird, but

3785
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
who knows, we'll see

3786
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday

3787
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
it's right around the corner

3788
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
yeah, I think they're just covering their bases

3789
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
like all these patent applications

3790
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
iPad, I mean, really

3791
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
just call it like the Playstation

3792
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
tablet or something like that, you know

3793
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
something, Sony Playstation

3794
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
tablet, not iPad, I mean

3795
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
calm down, it's the name in a patent, it's not the final

3796
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
just call it a thingy and be done with it

3797
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
that's right

3798
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
anyhow, one other rumor going

3799
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
around about new consoles that just won't

3800
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
die, is the fact that used

3801
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
games are not going to be playable on it

3802
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
you can bet that Electronic

3803
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Arts EA is just cheering

3804
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
about this, after all, they're the ones that started

3805
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
the online pass shit, aren't they?

3806
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
well, anyhow, the chief

3807
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
financial officer, Blake Jorgensen

3808
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
had a talk with Gamasutra

3809
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
and Gamasutra asked him

3810
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
about the whole used games and these rumors

3811
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
in response, quote

3812
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
it's one of those classic double-edged

3813
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
swords, in one way

3814
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
the used game business has been critical

3815
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
for the health of the retail channel

3816
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
and having a healthy retail channel

3817
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
is an important thing for us

3818
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
we would like to sell everything at full price

3819
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
would we like to sell everything at full price

3820
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
excuse me, and not have a used games market?

3821
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
sure, but I think the used game market

3822
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
is a little like any other kind of market

3823
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
where it creates liquid

3824
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I hate this word

3825
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
liquidity

3826
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
the fact is that liquidity benefits

3827
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
us in some fashion

3828
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
so if someone goes in and trades a game

3829
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
there's a good chance they're going to buy another one of our games

3830
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
and so if there's a liquid market

3831
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I think that's not a bad thing at all

3832
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
so it's

3833
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
sort of like a half admission that

3834
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
maybe used games aren't the worst thing in the world

3835
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
could this be a sign

3836
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
of things to come if EA is

3837
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
openly, or at least one of their executives

3838
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad

3839
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
thing, or are they just setting this up

3840
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
for when the ban hammer comes down

3841
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
on this pretty soon, with the used games

3842
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
any thoughts on EA's comments?

3843
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Loki?

3844
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Do you have anything?

3845
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I think they're already making their money

3846
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
on used games with the whole

3847
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
online passes, I mean I think they were

3848
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
touting before that they made a ton of money on

3849
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
online passes, so to them that's

3850
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
just money in their

3851
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
pockets, I guess

3852
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I was actually going to say something along similar lines

3853
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
they've found a way to keep making

3854
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
a profit on it, and that is

3855
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
a really, you know

3856
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
with a lot of cases in the

3857
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
used market, the people who

3858
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
are getting rid of their used games are trying to get

3859
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
the new next better, we've

3860
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
even traded in some of our games, some of our

3861
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
crappy ones, to get new games, so

3862
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
it's, and I mean

3863
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
especially it's even better for

3864
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
EA as an example

3865
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
if someone trades in one of their

3866
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
competitor's games to get to one of theirs

3867
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
so I mean, that

3868
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
whole liquid market thing

3869
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
is pretty, I'd say

3870
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
pretty accurate. And also considering that EA

3871
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
is also one of these companies that puts out yearly

3872
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
releases of their sports games, and they probably

3873
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
know that people aren't going to want to

3874
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
hold onto their copy of Madden

3875
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
13 or something like that, when Madden

3876
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
25, the dumbest

3877
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
new, what are they thinking

3878
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
there? Okay we're going to go 13 to 25

3879
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
and then next year it's going to be 15

3880
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
and then in a few years we're going to have

3881
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
25 again. If it's the 25th year

3882
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I get it, it's not

3883
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
call it like Madden 25th anniversary

3884
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
not Madden 25, it's stupid, anyways

3885
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
that's not the point. The point is

3886
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
that they release games

3887
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
each year and that

3888
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
they know that people are going to need to trade these

3889
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them

3890
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
because they're essentially useless after

3891
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
it comes out. And after

3892
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
all, EA shuts off their servers in a couple years

3893
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
anyways, so you kind of

3894
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
want to trade that in. He is kind of

3895
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
full of dicks right now. Well, here's

3896
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
a further comment I want to, because they were

3897
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
pushed a little further on the whole

3898
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
used games and is that something that's happening

3899
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
in the new consoles. Here was the

3900
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
rest of the quote, quote, I can't really

3901
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
comment on where the next generation boxes

3902
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
are going to be relative to used games.

3903
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I will say that the trend in the business

3904
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
is to have that always on

3905
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
connectivity and connect with a customer

3906
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
and to the extent that the software identifies

3907
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
a certain customer is going to create

3908
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
some issues going down the road in the used

3909
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
game market. But I do believe that

3910
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
the consumer likes it and it's been

3911
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
good for the retail channel.

3912
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Um...

3913
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Um...

3914
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
What? I do believe

3915
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
the consumer likes it. Um...

3916
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Didn't I just read some

3917
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
frugal answers that didn't seem to go that direction?

3918
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
They like the always on connectivity?

3919
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
And they've done some polls on

3920
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
certain websites that

3921
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
basically have said the same thing. In fact,

3922
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
actually GameStop did a poll. Was it 60%?

3923
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Over 60% of, you know, people

3924
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
that use GameStop or whatever don't

3925
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
like not having used games.

3926
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
This worries me when that sentence comes

3927
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
out of a game maker's mouth. Is how

3928
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
out of touch are you?

3929
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
See, people in the boardroom

3930
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
think they know what we want.

3931
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
But clearly they don't.

3932
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
But by telling us in an interview

3933
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
this is what gamers want

3934
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
then the more gullible will

3935
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
run with it and, you know, the CNNs

3936
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
will say, oh well, you know,

3937
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers

3938
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
want according to electronics art.

3939
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Um, why don't you try talking to a

3940
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
gamer? Well, and

3941
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
see, that's the thing. They have a habit

3942
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
of trying to manipulate the

3943
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
data that they find to suit

3944
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
their own purposes. That's, anything can

3945
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
be changed. And they have

3946
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
to get an unbiased source

3947
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
if they're going to have accurate information. But all they want

3948
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
is for people to tell them the same things

3949
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
that's going to support the outcome that they

3950
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
look for. Uh, the

3951
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

3952
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
gives a Homer Simpson quote.

3953
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Facts are meaningless. You can create facts

3954
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
for something that is remotely true.

3955
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Interesting note to end that

3956
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
on. Let's move on, DarkSakura.

3957
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Well, how about, uh,

3958
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
something else EA's managed to fuck up?

3959
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?

3960
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Okay, EA come close

3961
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
to really royally fucking up. The Mass Effect

3962
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
series.

3963
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And yes, we warned you, there is

3964
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Mass Effect news. BioWare

3965
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
is basically saying don't call

3966
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
it Mass Effect 4 because it's

3967
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
implying that it is a

3968
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
another addition to the trilogy.

3969
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Um, they're saying,

3970
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
um, that basically the

3971
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
trilogy's over. This is another game

3972
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
in the universe. And, uh,

3973
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
the comparison here is, and I'll read the

3974
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
quote from, um, from Priestly.

3975
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
It says, um,

3976
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
if you have three games centered

3977
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
around a group of key soldiers in the

3978
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
US Army during World War I and then decided to make

3979
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
a game about another group of people during the

3980
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Second World War, the games would have many points

3981
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
in common and feel true to one another.

3982
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
So basically it's saying, you know,

3983
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
it's saying it's not necessarily going to be a

3984
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
prequel or a sequel. It could be set

3985
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
within the same time frame.

3986
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
There could be other things going on, but

3987
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
it's not going to be associated

3988
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
with the Shepard story. So,

3989
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Mass Effect 4 Moderner Warfare?

3990
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I have no idea.

3991
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Um, but they are,

3992
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
um, you know, talking about, uh,

3993
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
it's, uh, being in development

3994
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
with BioWare Montreal and

3995
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
that, uh, that's the same, uh, office

3996
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
that of course gave us this

3997
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
superb multiplayer.

3998
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
As I mentioned before, um,

3999
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
and Mass Effect 2, which is The Crown,

4000
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
it's not necessarily the popular opinion amongst

4001
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
my Mass Effect loving friends, but

4002
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
um, I'm okay with them going a completely

4003
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
different direction and kind of starting over, if

4004
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
you will, because, you know, they created

4005
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
such a great universe the first time

4006
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
that

4007
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
why not get introduced to new people

4008
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
that will be as compelling, if not more so

4009
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
than the first group? That's okay, I think.

4010
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
The only, the thing that would make me happy

4011
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them

4012
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
a production timeline

4013
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
and actually put out

4014
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
a good quality product

4015
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
with great writing, the way that

4016
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Mass Effect 2 was.

4017
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
That would just completely

4018
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
tickle me to no end. Of course I'm gonna

4019
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
play it, I mean. Sadly that won't happen.

4020
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I know, right? That's so sad.

4021
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I mean, and this is the problem is that, yeah,

4022
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I'm an addict, I'll still play it. I love the universe.

4023
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
You know, even with the,

4024
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
the pieces

4025
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
of shit that are involved in Mass Effect

4026
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
3, I still

4027
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
play the game on, I've probably played it more

4028
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
than 2, just because I like how it

4029
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
plays better. If it keeps using

4030
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
the

4031
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
newer incarnations of the

4032
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.

4033
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
You know, as long as it's fun to play and

4034
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I get more lore, I'm happy.

4035
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
The multiplayer is so good, too.

4036
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
It is. We should play again, but you don't play on PC

4037
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
anymore, and that makes me sad.

4038
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I kind of do a mix and match now.

4039
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Well, then come play online with me.

4040
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Meh.

4041
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
So anyways, there's yet another

4042
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
rumor going along with the PlayStation 4

4043
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Orvis, whatever you call it.

4044
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
So that is

4045
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that

4046
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
because they purchased Gaikai,

4047
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
they're going to be using that

4048
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
streaming service to

4049
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
stream PlayStation 3 games to

4050
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
the new PlayStation.

4051
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Basically saying that there's not

4052
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
going to be really any backwards compatibility

4053
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
with the old system, which makes sense.

4054
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility.

4055
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
A lot of it

4056
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
is being offered as

4057
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.

4058
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Basically

4059
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
saying that this is also going to kind of coincide with

4060
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
also physical releases for

4061
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.

4062
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I can see

4063
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
this as kind of an evolution of

4064
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
that whole

4065
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
PlayStation Plus game library thing,

4066
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
because right now you have to download and install

4067
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
everything, which takes fucking forever.

4068
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Whereas this, you could be just like

4069
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
okay, I want to play, uh,

4070
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Steam 302. Go.

4071
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And then just load it up and stream it.

4072
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
And the hour-long game trials, too.

4073
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Like, you have to actually

4074
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
download the entire game to play

4075
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
for an hour and then just delete it.

4076
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
So, once again, we'll see.

4077
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming

4078
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.

4079
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I spent so much money on that. Obviously, it's going to be

4080
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
integrated somehow.

4081
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week, too.

4082
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
That seems something obvious that they could

4083
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
talk about. They could almost do that with

4084
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
the PlayStation 3.

4085
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that

4086
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
is PlayStation 4. I think that they could

4087
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
do this, hey, you guys,

4088
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
you know how you have that online game library

4089
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
right now? Well, guess what?

4090
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff

4091
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
instantly. It makes sense, because

4092
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so

4093
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2

4094
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
inside of it as well, so it could run all the games.

4095
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
And then when they started cutting that out

4096
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
and getting the price down,

4097
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
you know, that disappeared.

4098
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
So maybe they're trying to not

4099
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
wow us with a $599

4100
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4.

4101
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Probably more like

4102
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
$499. But, you know,

4103
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
don't expect it to be

4104
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
that low. But this

4105
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
is one way they'll be able to save some money on

4106
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
the console and maybe not have it be so expensive

4107
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
is that they're going to use the streaming technology

4108
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
to emulate some of the

4109
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
older games. I hope, though, that it's

4110
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
just an option. That you can

4111
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
also, like, okay, you can stream it, or you

4112
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
can download it, because, once again,

4113
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
if their service goes to shit,

4114
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
then that's going to suck not being

4115
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
able to play your game, because

4116
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
you can't stream it anymore.

4117
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I would assume that you'd be able to

4118
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
download it as well. I hope that you could

4119
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
do that. Shadownextgen with a comment in our

4120
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

4121
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
PlayStation Network is in no way good enough

4122
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
to do streaming gameplay like that.

4123
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Even with Gaikai.

4124
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Is PlayStation Network ready for that

4125
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
kind of bandwidth?

4126
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
It's a fair question. Let's put it this way, though.

4127
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with, like, some

4128
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
of the demos with, like, FIFA and stuff like that

4129
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
through a web browser and stuff. I think they

4130
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
could probably handle it.

4131
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Is it going to look good, though, coming through

4132
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
your bandwidth? You know, like,

4133
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
through your internet connections, again,

4134
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
like, all fucking pixelated and shit?

4135
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I don't know.

4136
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
That's...

4137
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
We'll just have to see, I guess.

4138
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Alright.

4139
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Kind of a follow-up

4140
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
story of sorts. You remember when

4141
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan

4142
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
and how it's going to this free-to-play model

4143
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
on the Wii U? That hasn't

4144
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
arrived in America yet, but

4145
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
guess what? It's going to happen in

4146
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Europe as well. Europe will be the next

4147
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.

4148
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
The base download will have

4149
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Monster Battle, Free-for-All, and Team

4150
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Versus, and you can play them up to three times.

4151
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Woohoo.

4152
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
The first add-on is MyKong,

4153
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
which will cost

4154
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
$1.99 in Euros

4155
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
through February 28th.

4156
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Interesting.

4157
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I want to fight the bees!

4158
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I hear the game's not very good, but

4159
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I mean, it's a fun arcade game, but

4160
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I don't know.

4161
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
As much as I love the game, I really don't see it

4162
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
as well. Unless everyone has

4163
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
the things. I think the free-to-play

4164
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
model is certainly interesting.

4165
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Anybody

4166
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?

4167
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Do you think they will roll this out

4168
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
to the States next? Anybody?

4169
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
I'd have to, I think.

4170
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I think they'll eventually roll it out to the States.

4171
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I'd be interested to see

4172
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I guess I'm a little bit

4173
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I don't know. Namco's

4174
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
tried doing this whole free-to-play

4175
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
type approach for some of

4176
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
their games. It didn't work out so well

4177
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
with the Ridge Racer on the Vita.

4178
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Remember that? Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.

4179
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
That was, pay $30, $40

4180
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
and get nothing.

4181
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Get a demo, and then buy

4182
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
extra crap for it.

4183
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
So that kind of sucked, but

4184
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
we'll see.

4185
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
$2 is not that bad for an

4186
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
add-on.

4187
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Let's go to the mailbag. Every week

4188
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
you guys send us emails. Mailbag at

4189
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4190
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
and we read them here on the show.

4191
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4192
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
where you can send us emails every week.

4193
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
We have one email this week and

4194
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I'll go ahead and read it. It just came in

4195
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
like an hour ago. I'll go ahead and read it.

4196
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
No biggie.

4197
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
It's a gem of an email, so I want to

4198
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
read this through. Alright.

4199
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Here we go.

4200
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Hey, OLR.

4201
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
First off, it seems like you guys have

4202
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
joined the rest of the media in spending

4203
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
time on every next-gen rumor that

4204
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
comes down the pike, no matter how

4205
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
hilarious or ill-thought. It's

4206
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
been proven that the mainstream games media

4207
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
can be easily fooled into believing anything,

4208
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
as has been shown by various

4209
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
angry forumites and Tumblr people all

4210
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
over the years. And while I know that the

4211
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
blogs will go after anything that gets clicks,

4212
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
why do you guys spend time on nonsense

4213
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
rumors? That's a good

4214
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
question. In what way does

4215
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
panic-mongering help the show?

4216
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
It's clearly not bringing in the page

4217
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
hits. Clearly

4218
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
it's not. How rude.

4219
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
But you're here. That's what counts.

4220
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Have you guys ever thought

4221
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
of vetting these rumors, trying to

4222
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
sift the possibly legitimate things

4223
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
from the blatant and senseless bullshit?

4224
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Well, I am glad

4225
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
that you asked that question. Because

4226
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
that is a great... We should

4227
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
go vet those rumors. In fact, let me

4228
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
place a call to Sony right now

4229
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
and ask that question. I know, right?

4230
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Let me just, let me get them on the line and

4231
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4

4232
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
rumors. Because you know, as you

4233
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
mentioned before, it isn't going any

4234
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
distance and getting us hits at all

4235
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
that, you know, sites like

4236
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I don't know, the ESA, when measuring

4237
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
E3, doesn't even want to take a second look

4238
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
at independent podcasts and all that stuff.

4239
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Clearly, these guys are on my

4240
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
speed dial, and I can vet

4241
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
this shit till the cows come home.

4242
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
I was just talking...

4243
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.

4244
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?

4245
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, we were chillin'.

4246
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Absolutely. We'll get some fro-yo

4247
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
afterwards. I got photos of my

4248
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Dan and Yu Suzuki, which is actually

4249
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
true, I do. Let me put a little reminder

4250
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
out there about what this show is all

4251
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
about, alright? In case you forgot.

4252
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Uh, this

4253
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
show started because we all played

4254
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
DDR at the arcades, and after

4255
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
DDR, we would go and we would go to the

4256
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
restaurant that was down the street, and we would

4257
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
sit around over, you know, food that was bad

4258
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
for us, like mozzarella sticks and so

4259
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
forth. Fried cheese. Oh god, they're so fucking

4260
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
good, huh? And we would talk smack about

4261
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
what's going on in games, and you know

4262
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
what happens a lot of times when people are talking

4263
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
smack? They're talking about the

4264
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
rumors and things that go around in the

4265
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
industry. You know, I can't think

4266
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
of a time when we've said this stuff on

4267
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
air and said, you know, this is fact,

4268
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
people. Believe this, people. You know,

4269
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
I think we like to bring these ideas

4270
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
up and say, this is a rumor,

4271
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
take it with a grain of salt, like I think

4272
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
we just said about that iPad thing.

4273
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Or ask people what they think

4274
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
about it. Exactly. What's wrong with

4275
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
discussion? What is wrong with discussing

4276
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
and talking about ideas? Because

4277
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
some rumors do

4278
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
pan out to be true. So

4279
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
why not talk about

4280
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
what goes through the heads

4281
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
of these people that don't really

4282
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
want to be so ready to talk about

4283
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
these things? And I think that's what

4284
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
we try to do with the community. So

4285
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
if you have an opinion on these rumors

4286
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
besides the fact that these rumors are

4287
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
bullshit, well, why don't you share that opinion

4288
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
with us? That's what the show is set up for, where

4289
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
every gamer has a voice. So

4290
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
tell us a little bit about what you think

4291
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
these rumors could be good or

4292
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
bad for the future. Such

4293
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
as we just talked a little bit about destiny

4294
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
and the fact that it requires an always

4295
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
online connection. That is fact,

4296
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
not rumor. They said that

4297
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
today. But that's something that's going to impact

4298
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
the game industry. The whole fact

4299
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
about used games being banned on the new

4300
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
consoles. That's a rumor, yes.

4301
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
But I think all of us sit

4302
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
here and go, do you think, can you

4303
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
sit there and you honestly think to yourself

4304
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
that in no boardroom ever

4305
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
has it been said by a senior

4306
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
executive, we should lock out

4307
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
new games on the new console.

4308
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Use games. Is that what

4309
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I said? Lock out new games.

4310
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Lock out the new ones.

4311
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Then we have to do an even newer system and have to

4312
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
charge them.

4313
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
The online pass idea came

4314
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
from somewhere.

4315
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Rumors are often

4316
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
founded in fact.

4317
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I just don't think this was a very well thought

4318
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
out email, honestly.

4319
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
But

4320
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
the biggest thing too is that

4321
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I actually like looking at the rumors

4322
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
and the speculation and keeping

4323
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
track of it so I can see what legitimately

4324
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
happens when something comes out to see

4325
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
who was right, who was on the right track.

4326
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Was our technology really

4327
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
in the place where we had

4328
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
this capability? For me

4329
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
it's actually a gauge of how

4330
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
ambitious consumer

4331
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
level technology is.

4332
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
I think it's neat.

4333
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Black Wolf

4334
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
in Chat says, I'm not a journalist. I'm a

4335
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
commentator. I don't actually have the resources

4336
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
to be a real journalist.

4337
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Well, what is a real journalist anyway?

4338
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Because some things that get away with

4339
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
being real journalism are a little

4340
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
bit laughable. But anyway

4341
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I do like that comparison.

4342
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I'm not a games journalist either,

4343
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
really. I actually think more than anything I'm a

4344
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
games analyst.

4345
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I will analyze the shit out of your game. I say

4346
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
that with a straight face too.

4347
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I'm a games analyst. A lot of you are games

4348
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
analysts too. You really are.

4349
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Some people are just anal. We've been

4350
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
sitting here talking about games for 11 years and

4351
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
there's some other guys that go out there

4352
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
in every story and being interviewed with

4353
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
a games analyst title. But you know what?

4354
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
They get about as much stuff right as we do.

4355
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
And about as much wrong as we do. Because

4356
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
one of those games analysts was out there this week,

4357
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
a big one in fact, talking about how this is

4358
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
the doom and gloom, the end all be all for Nintendo.

4359
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
And that Nintendo is fucked. And I'm

4360
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
thinking like, dude, what are you smoking?

4361
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
It is way too fucking early to say anything

4362
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
about that. I don't care what degree you have under your belt.

4363
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
This is, this is just not

4364
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
like

4365
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
it's not, it is way too

4366
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
early to say something like that.

4367
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
A year from now, maybe. But this is Nintendo

4368
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
we're talking about. Come on.

4369
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
It's one thing to bring up rumor

4370
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
without having anything to substantiate

4371
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
it. It's completely

4372
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
different if you actually have items

4373
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
that are going to back it up. Like, okay, for example,

4374
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
let's say that

4375
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
it's a year from now and Nintendo

4376
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
has continued to have dismal sales

4377
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
and we're starting to see extreme

4378
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
price reductions on the Wii U

4379
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
and we're starting to see the

4380
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
3DS

4381
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
game sales drop, then

4382
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
at that point it might be safe to speculate

4383
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.

4384
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
But right now, like

4385
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
you said, no. It's completely

4386
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
different just to completely sensationalize

4387
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
something and try to get

4388
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
people to back you up by being

4389
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
even more sensational about

4390
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
it as opposed to stating

4391
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
well, this is what's being said.

4392
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
This is what we've seen. Make your

4393
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
own decision. There's people out there

4394
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
who will just read anything and believe it immediately.

4395
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
It's just like, you'll see

4396
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
commenters on news stories

4397
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
where they're talking about a rumor and they're like

4398
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.

4399
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
It's like, if that's

4400
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
true, then I'm not buying an Xbox

4401
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
or if that's

4402
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.

4403
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
It's like, oh, this is absolute fact

4404
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
because it's coming to me from

4405
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
this gaming blog that I trust their

4406
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
information, so therefore it is

4407
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I am not going to buy this

4408
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
console. These are the people that are

4409
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind

4410
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
eight times. These are the ones that

4411
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
start a petition or join a group

4412
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game

4413
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
and then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.

4414
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
I mean, whatever.

4415
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
But yeah, I think

4416
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I know for a fact that

4417
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
and this comes from just my line of work

4418
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
that I don't deal in guarantees.

4419
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I know that.

4420
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I'm always

4421
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
leaving myself a way out

4422
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
and there's no way that I'm saying anything

4423
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
is absolute fact unless

4424
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
I actually see it.

4425
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Now, rostielut is in chat right now and says

4426
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
makes a note that I'm now hated.

4427
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I didn't say I hated you.

4428
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
No one said we hated you.

4429
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys

4430
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
spend time on nonsense rumors?

4431
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
In what way does panic mongering help the show?

4432
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
I just thought I would express

4433
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
why we spend time on nonsense rumors.

4434
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme

4435
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
of a viewpoint. It's not like we're sitting here going

4436
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
AHHHHH!

4437
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
So under Nintendo! Oh my god!

4438
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
I could hear once.

4439
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Run!

4440
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Plus, if the site gets more hits

4441
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I might lose to bog the game.

4442
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
That's what it's really

4443
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
about, isn't it? That's what I care about.

4444
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Alright, let's get to the other half

4445
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
of the email which is a question

4446
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I think is a little

4447
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
a little more up our alley.

4448
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Secondly, Aliens Colonel

4449
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Marines has been released after seven years

4450
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
development and the consensus seems to be that it's

4451
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
a hot mess.

4452
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
This is the type of email I like to get.

4453
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem

4454
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Forever, the game had a protracted

4455
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
crap ton of development houses working

4456
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
on it. My question here is this.

4457
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
At what point are there too many hands

4458
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
in the pot and when should a project

4459
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
just be cancelled? In my view

4460
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
anything past three years in two development

4461
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
houses is asking for disaster.

4462
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
It's all about contracts you sign.

4463
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Cooks in the soup.

4464
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
And what you're going to be responsible

4465
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
for if you don't come through with the product

4466
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
you promised whoever paid you

4467
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
money to come through with.

4468
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled

4469
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
at one point, was it not? Like when the company

4470
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
went out of business and Gearbox essentially just

4471
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
bought what was left over from it.

4472
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.

4473
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
But they kind of

4474
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
picked up the ashes and released what

4475
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
they did for better or for worse.

4476
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Right?

4477
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
It's a

4478
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
question with a lot of gray area because it's not like

4479
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
you can draw a line and say

4480
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
you did three years in two development houses.

4481
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Well that doesn't necessarily

4482
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
take everything into effect because I think a game

4483
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
like Smash Brothers

4484
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
didn't the one on the Wii take more

4485
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
than three years to develop? I think it did.

4486
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Didn't it take more like four?

4487
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
You know and it came out okay.

4488
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
The game was pretty good. It's one of the better Wii titles.

4489
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
You know it worked out.

4490
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
So you know I don't think

4491
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long.

4492
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
How long has Bioshock Infinite been

4493
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
in development?

4494
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Delayed by years.

4495
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Or

4496
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
maybe how long has

4497
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Last Guardian been in development?

4498
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Well that's never going to come out.

4499
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
How about Final Fantasy Versus

4500
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
13? Yeah

4501
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
there's a great example huh?

4502
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Yeah but the

4503
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Agito 13 came out at zero.

4504
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
So anyway

4505
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
I don't think there is a line you can

4506
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
draw but I think there does come a point where

4507
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
somebody has to assess it and this is what

4508
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
happens once in a while and this is why games get cancelled.

4509
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Is that somebody walks in there every three months

4510
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
and says I'm here representing the people

4511
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
who put their money into this and is paying

4512
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
all your paychecks right now. Show me what you

4513
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
got. And if it doesn't live up to expectations

4514
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
done. Cancelled. Money pulled.

4515
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
That's what happens. That's part

4516
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
of the ebb and flow of it. So you know if there's

4517
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
enough development and things to show

4518
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
every few months the game keeps

4519
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
going but if it stops the game

4520
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
is done.

4521
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I wonder if it's just one of those things where they just

4522
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
they just they crapped out what they had

4523
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
it sounds like they shoved it off to this other

4524
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
company to finish it off what they'd started

4525
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
and it was just kind of a mess

4526
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
like it just sounds like maybe it was just like

4527
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
mismanaged and I don't know but I haven't

4528
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
played the game so I feel weird kind of sitting here

4529
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
and giving all these opinions on a game I haven't played.

4530
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I can really only go off of what you know the internet

4531
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
is saying about it.

4532
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
And the bugs of the internet are talking about are

4533
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim

4534
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Red Dead Redemption Saints Bro

4535
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
I mean that's

4536
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
that's child's play.

4537
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Those games have bugs down to

4538
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
a fine art. Anyway

4539
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
have a good show guys.

4540
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
We're having a great show.

4541
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
It's great.

4542
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com

4543
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
if you want to help us be a great show too.

4544
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

4545
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Two

4546
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
The self entitled wads of

4547
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
fuck that drive in the parking lot

4548
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
at Whole Foods.

4549
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
I don't care how expensive

4550
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
your damn car is

4551
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
or how much gas it guzzles

4552
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
or how organic you fucking eat.

4553
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Learn to fucking

4554
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
drive.

4555
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
I know.

4556
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
You find assholes of all

4557
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
varieties and not just inside

4558
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
the shopping place.

4559
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Another one goes

4560
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
to

4561
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
oh yeah

4562
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
goes to

4563
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Legend and the Mass Effect

4564
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
3 update

4565
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
that just happened because I want my

4566
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
console back.

4567
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
However

4568
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I once again got fly cam working.

4569
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
And

4570
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
I think being sick

4571
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
because my son just drives

4572
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
every single illness like a

4573
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
like a fisherman's neck

4574
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
for illness.

4575
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
So that kind of sucks.

4576
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
That's what children do. That's their revenge.

4577
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Discipline.

4578
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I don't know.

4579
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
So

4580
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I guess FU to that and

4581
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
FU to having to move my desk upstairs

4582
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
because for some dumb

4583
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
reason management thought it was a great idea

4584
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
to fucking flip the building upside

4585
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
down and so they have

4586
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
you know everybody

4587
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
from the third floor moving to the second floor and

4588
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit

4589
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I got to move because I store all sorts of weird

4590
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
shit at my desk like arcade parts.

4591
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
So you know

4592
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
it's a little weird.

4593
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I have an MP5

4594
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
and a System 573

4595
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
board for Dance Maniac

4596
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Second Mix, a coin box

4597
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
and a Neo Geo arcade board

4598
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
at my desk among a bunch of

4599
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
figurines. I have a Gundam

4600
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
collection. I have anime

4601
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
stuff up on my shelves.

4602
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
And I have a what I consider

4603
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
life size paper craft

4604
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
model of a Koopa.

4605
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
And I have a chicken

4606
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
that has an Elibit riding on top

4607
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
of it. That's right. I have a chicken

4608
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
with an Elibit riding on top.

4609
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Does anyone fucking remember Elibits?

4610
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Hello? Konami?

4611
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Let's make another Elibits game.

4612
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Waco go ahead.

4613
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Uh

4614
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
gosh I was talking about this with my wife

4615
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
and I was like you know what FU

4616
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
to the podcast app

4617
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
on iPod, iPhone

4618
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
which is pretty old but I finally updated

4619
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
my iPod even though I heard it was

4620
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
terrible and I was really mad

4621
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
because I couldn't scan through

4622
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
the show to find like every time I plug

4623
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
it into my car it would reset back to the start and I

4624
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
hated that. But before I could always just

4625
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
you know like

4626
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at

4627
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
but I couldn't do that and I couldn't figure it out. Well my wife

4628
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
grabs it and two seconds later she finds

4629
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
out how to do it. You swipe the little

4630
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
logo for the show up and then there's a

4631
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
deal up there and you shut all of that. I feel so

4632
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
stupid but the podcast app is terrible.

4633
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Still terrible so still FU the

4634
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
podcast app is terrible. Honestly use Stitcher

4635
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
to listen to the show. Sorry but

4636
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
you got to stream on Stitcher don't you? Yeah

4637
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
yeah I got to download because I listen in the

4638
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
car. Actually I think Stitcher

4639
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
will now let you download. I want to say that's something

4640
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
they added to because a lot of podcasters

4641
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
were complaining about that. I think they

4642
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
added that. I'll check that out. Yeah

4643
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
I listen in the car so I can't stream.

4644
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Don't

4645
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
don't

4646
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Alright my FU of the week goes to the fact that

4647
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I don't have tomorrow off unlike

4648
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
a lot of yous. I don't either.

4649
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I'm unemployed.

4650
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I have tomorrow off. I'm going to

4651
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.

4652
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Bananas in pajamas.

4653
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
So FU to that I don't get tomorrow off.

4654
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
What's a President's Day?

4655
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Also FU to Shane.

4656
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Fucking bot Pokemon

4657
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
games.

4658
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
You can buy next the fucking

4659
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Power Rangers game. No.

4660
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
We've had this discussion. I said that's one

4661
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
that's one you're not going to get. Oh my god

4662
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
isn't there a new Sentai series out? Shane

4663
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
is there a new Sentai series out because I

4664
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
want to watch it. Follow his Facebook. He says it's terrible.

4665
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
They have that new

4666
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
one now. It's a new movie that's coming out

4667
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
that's

4668
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
the pervert one.

4669
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
The guy that wears the

4670
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
panties over his face or something like that.

4671
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
What? It's like a

4672
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
hentai something.

4673
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
I don't remember what it's called now.

4674
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
It looks funny.

4675
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Because he does this weird penis spin

4676
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
on some guy's face

4677
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
or something.

4678
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
He wears

4679
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
he wears hentai not sentai.

4680
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Back away from Loki a little bit here.

4681
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Oh no I think Shane was talking about the new

4682
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
American version is really

4683
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
terrible or something.

4684
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Megaforce Rangers. And here we all are

4685
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
entertaining this fucking

4686
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Power Rangers discussion. Knock it off.

4687
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Hey you hush.

4688
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I have like two laser discs.

4689
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
One of them is Mega Ranger vs.

4690
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Car Ranger. And the other one is

4691
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
like another I think Mega Ranger movie.

4692
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
So shut up. It is

4693
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
hentai common.

4694
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Hentai common. Hentai common.

4695
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Yes. They have a brand new

4696
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
super hero

4697
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
movie.

4698
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Alright let's go to a few more

4699
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
topics for you guys and then we're going to get to the

4700
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Skype line at 1877 Game O

4701
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
L R or our username on Skype.

4702
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Loki. So there's some

4703
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Kickstarter games that are actually getting

4704
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
publishers which is kind of cool.

4705
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
One of them is

4706
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
this game called Take Down.

4707
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
It's like a tactical shooter

4708
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
game. They're seeing kind of like a

4709
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
slow paced Tom Clancy's

4710
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Ghost Recon or something like that.

4711
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Sort of

4712
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
like that sort of series

4713
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
I guess. But

4714
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
it's going to be coming out by five of five games

4715
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
called Take Down Red Saber.

4716
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
And I guess the guy that developed it was

4717
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Christian Allen. Oh I guess that's why it's similar to

4718
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Tom Grant. He was one of the creative

4719
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
directors for the Ghost Recon series and

4720
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
also I guess

4721
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
SWAT and Rainbow Six.

4722
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
So that's kind of cool.

4723
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
So that's going to be coming out.

4724
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
It doesn't say when though but sometime in

4725
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
2013. And then

4726
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Wildman. Remember that was the one that

4727
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
was being done by Gas Powered Games

4728
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
kind of like as the last ditch

4729
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going

4730
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
out of business thing. Well actually

4731
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
they canceled their Kickstarter.

4732
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
So

4733
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter

4734
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
is because they got purchased by Wargaming.

4735
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Because I think World of Tanks.

4736
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
So no word if they're going to still

4737
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
be doing the Wildman game but

4738
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
at least now they have some funding.

4739
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
So that's good.

4740
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.

4741
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
I got one here too. It's about a

4742
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
90's arcade racer. Because there's just

4743
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
not enough Daytona USA in your life.

4744
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
And the like.

4745
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
It looks awesome.

4746
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Nysalis. Is that how you say their name?

4747
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Nysalis. They are doing

4748
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
this Kickstarter for what's called the 90's

4749
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
arcade racer. It has already exceeded

4750
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
the 10,000 pound gold

4751
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
that they had set. Nysalis

4752
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
made Cave Story.

4753
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
And they are going to do this new racing game

4754
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
for iOS, Android, and Wii U.

4755
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Well I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing

4756
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
their, they picked it up. Oh that's the publisher.

4757
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Yeah they picked it up. Thank you. They are the

4758
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
publisher. The

4759
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
producer is Tyrone Rodriguez

4760
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
is the

4761
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Nysalis producer who will be

4762
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
producing and helping the game come to

4763
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
the iOS, Android, and Wii U.

4764
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Which I think is interesting. Here's one that

4765
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
now we're not talking about 360

4766
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
or Playstation. It's Wii U. PC,

4767
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.

4768
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
It looks cool.

4769
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Yeah. I almost backed it

4770
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
but I'm poor.

4771
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
But I'm poor.

4772
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Alright. That's it.

4773
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
We're going to get to the Skype line.

4774
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
1877 Game OLR. Or our user name

4775
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

4776
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
We will talk about

4777
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
what's going on in games.

4778
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Whatever you want to talk about tonight.

4779
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
We've had a lot of stuff tonight. I'm sure it's going to

4780
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
elicit some sort of reaction. So the Skype line is open

4781
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
now. While we wait for some calls

4782
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?

4783
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Um...

4784
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Nah. I didn't really have anything

4785
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I wanted to talk about other than

4786
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I wanted to go into a little bit more

4787
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
detail with that whole iPad thing.

4788
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Because they had some cool notes

4789
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
that I missed in there after I read through it.

4790
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Apparently those

4791
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant

4792
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
for capturing objects that you

4793
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
place on top of it. So basically

4794
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
it would capture both sides of a 3D object

4795
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
or they even may have

4796
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
more than just a couple cameras on there.

4797
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
And it would import the full

4798
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
3D object into your game.

4799
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Which is kind of cool.

4800
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Of course, you know, they said

4801
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
6 axis

4802
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
They're supposed to have some sort of LED

4803
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
strips on the side. I guess that part that looked

4804
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
like the whole

4805
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
what is it, a plywood thing.

4806
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Let me go to the phones because we're getting

4807
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

4808
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Hey, can you guys hear me? Hi, we can hear you.

4809
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Alright. I just wanted to say

4810
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Hey, what's up guys?

4811
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Long time no talk to you. Who is this?

4812
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Introduce yourself.

4813
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
It's Gamer Girl.

4814
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Gamer Girl! How you doing, Gamer Girl?

4815
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
So

4816
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know

4817
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
what to talk about.

4818
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
I think she's also

4819
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Oh, I think you're listening to us

4820
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I hear a little bit of echo.

4821
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
You might want to mute the radio in the background there.

4822
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Well, that's no problem.

4823
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
You're just going through your head when you hit the dial button.

4824
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Is it still echoing?

4825
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Uh huh.

4826
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Um, hold on a second.

4827
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
We'll hold. We'll wait.

4828
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
There's nothing we got to do.

4829
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
We don't got nothing better to do.

4830
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
We'll make up another rumor and talk

4831
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
about it. How's that sound?

4832
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Oh, what's up Gamer Girl?

4833
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
What's on your mind tonight?

4834
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Okay, I don't know if I'm

4835
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
still

4836
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
We hear you honey. Keep talking.

4837
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Can I get a what what?

4838
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Um, shoot.

4839
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I don't think she can hear us.

4840
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Honey, try back later because I don't think you can hear us.

4841
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Sorry to say.

4842
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Aw, that's always depressing.

4843
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Yeah. Alright, let's go to the phones.

4844
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Ooh, anyone new?

4845
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

4846
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Okay, I don't know if I'm still

4847
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
We hear you, honey.

4848
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Keep talking.

4849
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
We're hearing ourselves.

4850
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Shoot.

4851
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
God damn it. Alright, let's try it.

4852
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Flocko's fucking Hair Doll.

4853
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
I knew this was going to come up.

4854
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

4855
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Hi, you guys. It's Porkchop. How's it going?

4856
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Wait, wait, wait. You can hear me?

4857
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
And I can hear you? Yes.

4858
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Oh my god. It's a miracle.

4859
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I fixed the show.

4860
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Hi, guys.

4861
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.

4862
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I don't know what to believe anymore.

4863
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I'm starting to lose faith.

4864
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
I know, and here we are. We're making all this shit up

4865
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
and just rumour-mongering

4866
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
and we just made the whole thing worse

4867
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
in our desperate attempt to get

4868
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
all the thousands of clicks that we get

4869
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
every week here on the show.

4870
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.

4871
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Like, the guys were talking about, you know,

4872
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
like, old games in chat

4873
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
and especially games in development hell

4874
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
and stuff like that.

4875
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I don't know.

4876
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
And it was kind of sad to hear, like, you know,

4877
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2

4878
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
and The Last Guardian. I was looking forward to those.

4879
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Like, why can't these companies

4880
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
just, you know, wake the fuck up

4881
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
and realise these games will sell

4882
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
because they had a...

4883
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Well, I know The Last Guardian will anyway.

4884
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.

4885
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
So, you know, get on that.

4886
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Stop bitching about fucking iPads

4887
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
and all this bullshit.

4888
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?

4889
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Because sometimes, you know, big time

4890
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
because sometimes, you know, big titles come out

4891
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
and they don't sell.

4892
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
And it makes developers nervous.

4893
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
I guess there was, like, you know,

4894
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
sometimes there is a lot of hype.

4895
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Hype is just the theme for this week.

4896
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Like, even, I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising

4897
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
and I looked at the footage and I think,

4898
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games,

4899
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
kind of real justice,

4900
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
like Bayonetta, they did that.

4901
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
But this game,

4902
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
there's something I can't shake about it

4903
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
as much as I love Metal Gear Solid

4904
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
and writing himself his cool character.

4905
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I'm just getting a weird feeling off it

4906
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
and I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.

4907
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
What's going into your decision, ultimately?

4908
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
What's going to help you get home weird, if anything?

4909
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I don't know.

4910
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
It's the fact that,

4911
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:41,000
you know, spin-off titles aren't always great, you know.

4912
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:45,000
It's something that I'm a bit tentative about

4913
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
and I'm watching it and I'm thinking,

4914
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
like, even DMC, the New Devil May Cry game,

4915
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
I'm very scared to buy that

4916
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
because I really, really

4917
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
loved the series before that

4918
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
and now it's just turned on its head.

4919
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
The game where you're not Dante?

4920
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Pardon? The game where you're not Dante?

4921
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
The game where you're Dante Mark 2, yeah.

4922
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Yeah.

4923
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I've been scared of him for so long.

4924
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.

4925
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
It's just like another doctor, it's OK.

4926
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.

4927
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Of course, yeah.

4928
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
That's just Red Cannon in there.

4929
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:21,000
No point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is it?

4930
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry,

4931
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
is the other kind of thing about it,

4932
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
is that this version in particular...

4933
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
The Devil May Metro?

4934
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Kinda, yeah. Devil May Metro, a little bit.

4935
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
I mean, that's a bad thing.

4936
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.

4937
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
I've heard something like that.

4938
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Apparently, the spitting image of the guy

4939
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
who developed the game, I'm like, what?

4940
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
It could be worse. He could have the face of,

4941
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,000
like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried, or...

4942
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Or one of the Jonas Brothers.

4943
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Oh, that would be...

4944
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,000
I'm gonna make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.

4945
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Hey, no, it could be a Dante de Medna version.

4946
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I would know.

4947
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
That's like DLC.

4948
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
That's like, you know, guilty pleasures and stuff like that.

4949
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
What is ultimately going to...

4950
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
You know, this is...

4951
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
The boardroom guys wanna get in your head as a gamer.

4952
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
What is ultimately going to make that decision for you

4953
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:18,000
if you're gonna pick up Devil May Cry or not?

4954
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:21,000
If you just leave it alone,

4955
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
you know, don't...

4956
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Don't twist it to think that you're...

4957
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
No, this is a reboot.

4958
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
And as far as I'm concerned, the game was fine

4959
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
before they went and did all this,

4960
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I don't know, fucking lost city of demons

4961
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
turning the fucking buildings upside down.

4962
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
It was fine when he was the demon hunter

4963
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
and he had white hair initially,

4964
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,000
but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo...

4965
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I don't know what to make of him at all.

4966
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Okay, I'm gonna play...

4967
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Don't ruin it, that's all I can really say.

4968
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I'm gonna play boardroom guy for a second here.

4969
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,000
This is how you get the female audience.

4970
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
You go the Bayonetta route, okay?

4971
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
You just have... You have his penis

4972
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
basically act like her hair in that game,

4973
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:04,000
so it's just flopping around, attacking things.

4974
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
And there you go.

4975
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
That would be frightening.

4976
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do,

4977
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
but still.

4978
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I would love to actually have a main male character

4979
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:19,000
who's just in completely oversexed positions.

4980
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Like...

4981
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
We'll play Devil May Cry.

4982
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I know, I want the over-the-top,

4983
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
like, you know, a comic book cover.

4984
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Done by Rob Liefeld.

4985
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
You're like... You want the Hawkeye Initiative

4986
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,000
to be a video game.

4987
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.

4988
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
That's what she's talking about.

4989
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
That would be hilarious.

4990
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
You want a Hawkeye game.

4991
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Jeremy Renner stars as fucking the main character,

4992
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:40,000
so that would be perfect.

4993
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
I would just play Jeremy Renner's, you know,

4994
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
butt the game.

4995
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
With, you know, Wii Move.

4996
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Or Wii.

4997
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
You're taking...

4998
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
You all are taking this show to a very strange place.

4999
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Alright.

5000
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Uh...

5001
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Anyway, Porkchop, I got to wrap up,

5002
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
so I can try to get another call,

5003
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
but any other thoughts for us tonight?

5004
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Yes, thanks very much.

5005
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,000
I want to thank you personally.

5006
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
You put me on the Path of Exile.

5007
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:02,000
It's very satisfying,

5008
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
and I'm going to play more of it.

5009
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,000
How about that?

5010
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Somebody just accused me,

5011
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I think it was on Hoard House this week,

5012
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
saying I never shut up about that game, so...

5013
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Which, I've mentioned it twice,

5014
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
and apparently I never shut up.

5015
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Says the person who mentions Mass Effect of Pokemon all the time.

5016
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
I instilled fearmongering in people

5017
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:23,000
if they didn't go play Path of Exile.

5018
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:24,000
It's worth a shot.

5019
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
For a five gig download,

5020
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
this game really is worth a shot,

5021
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
and you heard it here, so...

5022
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Like, honestly, didn't you play it,

5023
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
and you were like,

5024
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
oh my god, Diablo 3, finally.

5025
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Uh, well, it was Diablo,

5026
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
but even so, just playing it and killing things,

5027
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
it was, look, it was worth it.

5028
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Totally worth waiting,

5029
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
and the internet was crap downloading,

5030
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
took ages, it was worth it.

5031
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Go try it out, at least,

5032
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
even if you're not a fan.

5033
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Try it out.

5034
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
A ringing endorsement from overseas.

5035
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:50,000
There you go.

5036
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Can't beat that.

5037
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.

5038
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Good girl.

5039
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:55,000
All right, that's it, Porkchop.

5040
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Have a good one, buddy.

5041
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Take it easy, guys.

5042
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
All right, bye-bye.

5043
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
All right, I will try this call one more time,

5044
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:03,000
because it's a new name, I think.

5045
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Hi, you're on Orange Country.

5046
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Who's this?

5047
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:06,000
It was crap downloading, took ages.

5048
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Nope, you gotta call Echo 1-2-3.

5049
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
That's it.

5050
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,000
And turn off your speakers.

5051
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Yeah, well, yeah, that's the problem.

5052
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Use headphones.

5053
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
You gotta stop the show when you're calling in, so.

5054
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Sorry.

5055
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Uh, we'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.

5056
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:21,000
We have another one coming in.

5057
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Hi, you're on Orange Country.

5058
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Who's this?

5059
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:26,000
You talk about Path of Exile way too much.

5060
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Oh, god, here we go.

5061
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Hi, Shane.

5062
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Hello.

5063
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,000
How are you?

5064
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:32,000
I'm good.

5065
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I'm playing Pokemon.

5066
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Why the hate boner,

5067
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:35,000
since we've been using that term a lot tonight,

5068
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
why the hate boner for Path of Exile?

5069
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.

5070
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Have you played Path of Exile?

5071
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:47,000
I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer,

5072
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
because it was crap.

5073
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
I'm telling you, there's a difference.

5074
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
And Torchlight 2, have you played Torchlight 2?

5075
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I played the first one, the demo of it,

5076
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
and it was kind of boring.

5077
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
You're the problem, Shane.

5078
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Shane.

5079
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Yes.

5080
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
We have stuff to do.

5081
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Mm-hmm.

5082
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,000
But I got to watch Kilryuger some more, because it's so funny.

5083
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I need to watch it now.

5084
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
All right, why did you call in tonight?

5085
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile,

5086
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
or did you have something else?

5087
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
No, that's pretty much it.

5088
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
And Ni No Kuni sucks there.

5089
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Hey!

5090
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Another game he hasn't played that he hates.

5091
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I have a Ni No Kuni.

5092
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,000
You have it.

5093
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Yes, I have it.

5094
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
It is not fun.

5095
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,000
It is super boring.

5096
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:34,000
The Pokémon aspect is cool, and the battles are fine.

5097
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:35,000
I actually like the battles.

5098
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:36,000
What else is wrong with it?

5099
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:37,000
But the story is terrible.

5100
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Here's the thing.

5101
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Here's the thing.

5102
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane,

5103
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
that I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.

5104
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
I got into probably...

5105
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Are you playing Persona?

5106
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,000
And they're right.

5107
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,000
I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.

5108
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:50,000
See?

5109
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:51,000
See?

5110
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Everybody proof.

5111
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Mass Effect, and we have the Pokémon and...

5112
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Acornage.

5113
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway,

5114
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:00,000
because it was in DDR.

5115
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance,

5116
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
was largely in part to Shane.

5117
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
But I do influence Shane sometimes,

5118
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
and Ni No Kuni was one of them,

5119
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
is that I convinced him to get Ni No Kuni, right Shane?

5120
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,000
Yeah, but now he doesn't like it.

5121
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
He's gonna give me his copy.

5122
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:13,000
It was between that and Devil May Cry,

5123
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
and I made the wrong choice.

5124
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
It's like the Bizarro review, Ni No Kuni.

5125
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Every reviewer is like,

5126
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
oh, the story's amazing, but, you know,

5127
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:25,000
there's some problems with the gameplay and the battle system.

5128
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
But Shane's like, battle system's great,

5129
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,000
but story, oh, sucks.

5130
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Now this means Shane can give me his copy.

5131
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Of Ni No Kuni?

5132
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Yeah.

5133
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Now I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little

5134
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
limited edition case I have with it,

5135
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:38,000
because it goes for like 40 bucks,

5136
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:39,000
just the case alone.

5137
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Damn it.

5138
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Did you get the book?

5139
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
No, I did not get a book.

5140
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Oh, I want the book.

5141
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
No.

5142
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.

5143
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Like, the story is so boring.

5144
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
I don't care about any of the characters.

5145
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I care about, like, my little mighty,

5146
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
mighty guy, and that's pretty much it.

5147
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
I named him Fodder,

5148
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
because I figured he wasn't gonna be worth anything,

5149
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,000
but he's really good.

5150
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
He is really good.

5151
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
He actually lasts a long time,

5152
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
but, though, if you read game facts,

5153
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,000
they all say, oh, he's horrible.

5154
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
He's got bad stats.

5155
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Okay, so, I just want to be clear here,

5156
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I just want to be clear.

5157
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.

5158
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,000
No.

5159
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
But you are current on every episode

5160
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:20,000
of Power Rangers ever made, correct?

5161
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Um, not entirely.

5162
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:25,000
There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.

5163
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
I see, I see.

5164
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
And how's the story in Pokemon?

5165
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?

5166
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Yes.

5167
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Okay, Shane, wait.

5168
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
I have to ask you,

5169
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages,

5170
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,000
what is your favorite Sentai series?

5171
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,000
Sentai series?

5172
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Yeah.

5173
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Um, probably Gokaiger.

5174
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Really?

5175
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Yes, it cracks me up,

5176
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:47,000
but Kyoryuja might take its place.

5177
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
I still...

5178
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Oh, and Dekaranger.

5179
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
Dekaranger.

5180
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
Dekaranger's awesome.

5181
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:54,000
I still say Mega Ranger was the best.

5182
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,000
I don't know.

5183
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
I haven't seen that one.

5184
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Most of the later ones.

5185
03:01:58,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Go watch Mega Ranger.

5186
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:00,000
It's awesome.

5187
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Are you guys done?

5188
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
No, are you done?

5189
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
Yes.

5190
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Bye, have a good time.

5191
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Thanks for calling.

5192
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Mm-hmm.

5193
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,000
Bye.

5194
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
He's like, mm-hmm.

5195
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:15,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

5196
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane

5197
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,000
live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network

5198
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:23,000
on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft.

5199
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:24,000
And then some.

5200
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

5201
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Now live every week.

5202
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:30,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

5203
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:33,000
I got time for one more call.

5204
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

5205
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I got bronchitis.

5206
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
That lady's making a killing.

5207
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?

5208
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
She was on Tosh last year.

5209
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.

5210
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,000
He was on Tosh, too.

5211
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:53,000
It's tough to make a living.

5212
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:54,000
I'm going to find out now.

5213
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Hold on.

5214
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

5215
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Who's this?

5216
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
That's the one and only Ronda from the East Coast.

5217
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Hey, Ronda from the East Coast.

5218
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,000
How's it going?

5219
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Ah, pretty good, pretty good.

5220
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.

5221
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
Yeah, I heard.

5222
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
I got the memo.

5223
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Good job on that.

5224
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
But congrats on your first live show.

5225
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Thanks, and we try.

5226
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Evidently, Winnamp didn't like a certain MP3

5227
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:19,000
and decided to give me the middle finger.

5228
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
It might do that with some of the foreign name titles,

5229
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,000
just so you know.

5230
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:23,000
I should have warned you about that.

5231
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
That's worse.

5232
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:27,000
These are things we learn through trial and error.

5233
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Mm-hmm.

5234
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
Mm-hmm.

5235
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.

5236
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Thank you.

5237
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:35,000
An anime jam session can also be heard live on VOG Network

5238
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.

5239
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
VOG got two new live shows.

5240
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.

5241
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
It's like we kind of doubled.

5242
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Not really.

5243
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,000
I guess we went from three to five.

5244
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:48,000
It's close.

5245
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
So pretty cool.

5246
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:55,000
So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winnamp?

5247
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Just making it through school.

5248
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Just chilling, just making it through school?

5249
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
What are you studying?

5250
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Networking technology.

5251
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
I guess you didn't get the notice on that.

5252
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:10,000
I decided to go back to college.

5253
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
I am quite proud of your achievement.

5254
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Thank you.

5255
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
No, I did get the memo on it, but I don't assume

5256
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
that the radio listeners all know the story about them.

5257
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:20,000
So I sometimes ask rhetorical questions, but anyway.

5258
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Any cons going on lately?

5259
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Weren't you at a con this weekend?

5260
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,000
No, that was Kat's a con, but we're going to be covering that

5261
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:30,000
this week because there was so much drama and controversy

5262
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,000
going on there.

5263
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Oh my God, you've got to tell our audience.

5264
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:36,000
I know it's a video game show, but I saw it on Tumblr.

5265
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,000
I saw it on Facebook.

5266
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
I saw it on Twitter.

5267
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,000
There was drama everywhere.

5268
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Give us a little bit.

5269
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,000
Give us a little bit of the drama.

5270
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Give us a tease.

5271
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Sure.

5272
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Sure.

5273
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:49,000
The main issue was cosplayers and con goers, a kind of piss

5274
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:53,000
that a international Jewish organization took up a majority

5275
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,000
of the conventions of the convention area and places

5276
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
for taking photography.

5277
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:01,000
And there was pretty much insults going between both sides

5278
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
back and forth.

5279
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Really?

5280
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Yes, really.

5281
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?

5282
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
I don't know enough about it.

5283
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:20,000
And honestly, I just feel like asshole photographers.

5284
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:23,000
You will talk later because believe you me, I have friends

5285
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
that are also Jewish and cosplayers.

5286
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:28,000
We're pissed at both sides as well, but we'll see that

5287
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,000
for another time.

5288
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:32,000
I just don't like when you get two groups of people together

5289
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,000
who decide to act like name calling five year olds.

5290
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.

5291
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Also, update on Antoine Dodson released a single in 2012

5292
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
called Lovesick Lullaby.

5293
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,000
How did that sound?

5294
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:48,000
I just downloaded it.

5295
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Oh, my God.

5296
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
You're the problem.

5297
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Damn it, Uchon.

5298
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Look at your life.

5299
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Look at your choices.

5300
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Antoine Dodson songs?

5301
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

5302
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:01,000
So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?

5303
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Yeah.

5304
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,000
No, it's 2013.

5305
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,000
It's a new year.

5306
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:05,000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

5307
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested

5308
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:11,000
for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.

5309
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:12,000
No.

5310
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,000
Back in Huntsville.

5311
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:14,000
No.

5312
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Huntsville.

5313
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,000
He smoked marijuana.

5314
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Get out.

5315
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Hide your bong.

5316
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Hide your roach.

5317
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:25,000
Anyway, what else should I ask you about, Rama?

5318
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:26,000
I don't know.

5319
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
I just have a few things to say.

5320
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:29,000
All right.

5321
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
Quick, and I'll be on my way.

5322
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:34,000
The convention that you went to is called Animation on Display,

5323
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:39,000
and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Hebert, was there as a guest.

5324
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Neat.

5325
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,000
Yes.

5326
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:45,000
And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is

5327
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
called Zuden Sentai Kuruja.

5328
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:51,000
It's the third Sentai series based off of dinosaurs.

5329
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Fun, because what was the one?

5330
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Dioranger.

5331
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Dino Thunder?

5332
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,000
No, Dioranger was...

5333
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Dinosaurs dress up and transform?

5334
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,000
That's pretty awesome.

5335
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:01,000
No, no.

5336
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Kuruja was the first one.

5337
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Yeah, Zooranger.

5338
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
That was the first one.

5339
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Dioranger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old white ranger guy.

5340
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Mm-hmm.

5341
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Yeah.

5342
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:16,000
Yeah, a little too many people know is that the white ranger was actually from a completely

5343
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,000
different series.

5344
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
They had better outfits, just saying.

5345
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:20,000
They did.

5346
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Yes, they did.

5347
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:22,000
They totally had better outfits.

5348
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Well, Rama, after this call, I feel like I learned something.

5349
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Two more things, I'm going to get out of here.

5350
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,000
All right.

5351
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
The whole Year of Luigi thing.

5352
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.

5353
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:44,000
That's proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie

5354
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,000
wearing my Luigi hat.

5355
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:48,000
That's awesome.

5356
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Never wash that hat again.

5357
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Just kidding.

5358
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,000
You should probably wash it once in a while.

5359
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.

5360
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Oh, okay.

5361
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,000
All right.

5362
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
That works.

5363
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,000
That works.

5364
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Oh, my God.

5365
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:01,000
I haven't seen this picture.

5366
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,000
How did I miss this?

5367
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:03,000
You have not seen it?

5368
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
No.

5369
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,000
That's hilarious.

5370
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:06,000
That's pretty cool.

5371
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:07,000
That's awesome.

5372
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Oh, God, I love it.

5373
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
All right.

5374
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
When are you going to get your ass back out here?

5375
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Can you put that on Tumblr or something?

5376
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.

5377
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
I will.

5378
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:20,000
I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money

5379
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,000
and I'm done with college.

5380
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Okay.

5381
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
Because I want to come back out there again.

5382
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I want to go out there and go to a club.

5383
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
How about we crash New York?

5384
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Well, Chiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here

5385
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:36,000
and me down there and Jovidea down here to do a big old party thing.

5386
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:37,000
You know what I'm saying?

5387
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:38,000
There you go.

5388
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:39,000
We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.

5389
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Only if it's a sexy party.

5390
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
They do have that.

5391
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:47,000
It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.

5392
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:48,000
Awesome.

5393
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Sounds like fun to me.

5394
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
All right, Rama, I got to let you go to wrap up the show.

5395
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Fine.

5396
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Okay.

5397
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
I'm out of here.

5398
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
All right.

5399
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Have a good one, buddy.

5400
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Another A plus phone call from Rama.

5401
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:02,000
Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.

5402
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:06,000
Echo one, two, three in the future.

5403
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,000
There we go.

5404
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
That's it.

5405
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us.

5406
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
Mailbag at orangelandtrady.com or tweet us.

5407
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

5408
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:17,000
Oh shit, I got to do the tweets.

5409
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:18,000
Here I was ready to wrap up.

5410
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:19,000
I have a last minute story.

5411
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:20,000
All right, go for it.

5412
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
I got to pull up the Twitters.

5413
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:25,000
So there is a new world record for Qbert.

5414
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Apparently, George Layouts, I guess, he had been playing Qbert with a friend, Ed Hemskerk.

5415
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:41,000
They've been playing the game for 30 years now, and they've been trying to go for this world record.

5416
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired, and this guy, George, actually went for 80 plus hours.

5417
03:09:52,000 --> 03:10:01,000
He actually beat the world record, I guess, at about over 84 hours and 36 million points.

5418
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:11,000
So at least that's what the thought is right now, that he has broken the record for both the longest time playing on a single quarter and score.

5419
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:15,000
He likes to score all night.

5420
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:19,000
Here's a last minute story if I ever heard one.

5421
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's like on topic and legit.

5422
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.

5423
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:29,000
All right, no, this is actually super important.

5424
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:35,000
Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.

5425
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
When's it happening?

5426
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:42,000
Today, 5 p.m. Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m. Eastern.

5427
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:48,000
So that means in about two more hours, we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita.

5428
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:55,000
And it is ahead of the February 20th event, meaning, this is confirmed, the two events are about separate topics.

5429
03:10:55,000 --> 03:11:03,000
So the February 20th event is all about something new, because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week, or tonight.

5430
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:09,000
So, Loki, upon hearing that, you just said earlier in the show, where's the information on the Vita?

5431
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Any reaction to this, hearing this?

5432
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
I'm going to see what they say.

5433
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:18,000
See, the problem is, when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games.

5434
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:21,000
And it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.

5435
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:24,000
And here's the other funny thing you want to see.

5436
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:30,000
Because I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and game side.

5437
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
And we do a lot of promotions with them.

5438
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:38,000
In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now, because I probably can't go.

5439
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:46,000
It's possibly to go on a red carpet premiere for This Is The End, with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.

5440
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:47,000
It'll be fun.

5441
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,000
My wife might not like that.

5442
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:49,000
But here's the thing.

5443
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:50,000
They've been...

5444
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,000
I'll fucking go.

5445
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,000
Our rep...

5446
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,000
My name's Loki.

5447
03:11:53,000 --> 03:12:00,000
A rep in house has been asking me, she's all, okay, well, what's in the electronic device that Sony has?

5448
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
You know, what's hot right now with Sony and stuff?

5449
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:06,000
And I was like, oh yeah, well, there's the PlayStation 4, it's going to be coming out, and then there's the Vita.

5450
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:09,000
I may actually get another Vita.

5451
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
I'm not having to pay for it, of course, but...

5452
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
You have a rough life.

5453
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Well, I...

5454
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:15,000
I might have to go to a movie premiere.

5455
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:16,000
Well, no, no.

5456
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:17,000
Here's the thing, though.

5457
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:18,000
I've got another Vita.

5458
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:22,000
Right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.

5459
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:28,000
They went to a winery one time, and then they went to Monterey.

5460
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,000
I didn't get included in either of those trips.

5461
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:35,000
I had to stay back and answer phones.

5462
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Thanks.

5463
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:37,000
Good times.

5464
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
All right, quickly, I've got to do some quick Twitter topics here.

5465
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Tigerclaw sent us a couple stories here.

5466
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
I'm just going to do one because I'm pressed for time here.

5467
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:48,000
A video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.

5468
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:49,000
Oh, yeah.

5469
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Get out.

5470
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:51,000
I didn't know that this was something they were doing.

5471
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
That's been floating for a little bit.

5472
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Yeah, but there was...

5473
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:55,000
I thought they had a Play...

5474
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:56,000
There was the...

5475
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:57,000
On PS1 they did, right?

5476
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Really?

5477
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,000
There was the Masters of Terra something.

5478
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:03,000
Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.

5479
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:06,000
It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't,

5480
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:09,000
you know, amount to anything.

5481
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,000
Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct

5482
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
is greater than Super Metroid.

5483
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:17,000
Just saying.

5484
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:20,000
Well, you know, Orange Lontre, who is the show where every gamer has a voice.

5485
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:21,000
Except you.

5486
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,000
No, no, no.

5487
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:23,000
He has a voice, but...

5488
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:24,000
He has a voice.

5489
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
Just what's it like to have such a wrong voice?

5490
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:32,000
I mean, there's no such thing as a wrong opinion, but that's really fucking close.

5491
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:37,000
I've never said there's no such thing as a...

5492
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
I've never said that there's a stupid question.

5493
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:40,000
That's pushing it.

5494
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:46,000
Since we are on the topic of, you know, Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars,

5495
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:55,000
and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know

5496
03:13:55,000 --> 03:14:02,000
that in Disney, and obviously this is all very, very early, but they have greenlit Star

5497
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:04,000
Wars figures for Disney Infinity.

5498
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:08,000
Probably not coming out anytime soon, but it is in the works.

5499
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:12,000
So don't be surprised next year if you see Star Wars figures.

5500
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:17,000
What would be interesting is Star Wars figures with Marvel figures with Disney figures.

5501
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:20,000
Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.

5502
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:21,000
Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.

5503
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:22,000
You know what?

5504
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:27,000
Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game,

5505
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:32,000
so I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet,

5506
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:35,000
especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.

5507
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:40,000
Alright, and lastly from SSJ100Matt,

5508
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,000
with so much negativity stemming from video games lately,

5509
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:47,000
someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.

5510
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
Very interesting.

5511
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
Let's see, I'm trying to scan through this real quick.

5512
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:54,000
God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.

5513
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:58,000
The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games,

5514
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:01,000
and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.

5515
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:06,000
It's a non-profit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.

5516
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Similar to an arcade in Massachusetts called Tokyo Game Action,

5517
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:13,000
which was also non-profit, but they closed.

5518
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:16,000
No game list available yet, but they're talking about driving games,

5519
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:19,000
pinball machines, air hockey, Kinect, and many more.

5520
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:23,000
So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?

5521
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:27,000
Wah wah.

5522
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Womp womp womp.

5523
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
Alright, that does it.

5524
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:32,000
We gotta wrap up.

5525
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
We're at midnight thirty eastern time here.

5526
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:37,000
We're running a little late, so we gotta go around and wrap it up.

5527
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show

5528
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
and staying with us for all three hours tonight.

5529
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Remember, we do this show for free.

5530
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:49,000
We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that,

5531
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
but we do it because we love you guys and we love the community.

5532
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Yes, even the nasty emailers too.

5533
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
I love you so much.

5534
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:00,000
You can help spread the word about our show by telling a friend.

5535
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

5536
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Leave us a nice review on whatever website you found the show on,

5537
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:07,000
iTunes or Stitcher or wherever.

5538
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:08,000
We really appreciate it.

5539
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Tumblr, you can tumbles about us and all that good stuff.

5540
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

5541
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
Flaco, thank you very much for being here tonight.

5542
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:16,000
I hope you had fun.

5543
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,000
I did.

5544
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:18,000
Alright, good times.

5545
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

5546
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Just thanks for having me.

5547
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:22,000
I got to talk about Ni No Kuni.

5548
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:25,000
I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Ni No Kuni podcast,

5549
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:30,000
just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard.

5550
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
Are you going to call it Ni No Podcast?

5551
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:33,000
Ni No Podcast.

5552
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:34,000
Ni No Cast.

5553
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:40,000
I think Ni No Podcast would be a great addition to the VOG network.

5554
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:41,000
I'm sure Bobby would have no problem.

5555
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:42,000
He would love it.

5556
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:43,000
No problem at all.

5557
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:44,000
Green light, green light.

5558
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:46,000
I'm going to just offer you the spot right now.

5559
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:47,000
We'll just call it Bobby Blackwolf Night.

5560
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:50,000
We'll have Mass Effect Podcast and Ni No Kuni Podcast back to back.

5561
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
And then the Brony show.

5562
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Oh yeah, the Brony show.

5563
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:55,000
The Brony show.

5564
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Sounds great.

5565
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:57,000
It'll be awesome.

5566
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:02,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

5567
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Hate boner.

5568
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:09,000
My final thought tonight is sunflower seeds.

5569
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

5570
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:15,000
My final thought is, I don't know, I don't have anything.

5571
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
I just don't want to move upstairs.

5572
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
I hate moving my stuff.

5573
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:20,000
Get a peon to do it for you.

5574
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:24,000
I've been in that spot for a long time and I just don't like moving

5575
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:27,000
because everyone's like, well, your desk is a mess anyways.

5576
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
Actually, no, my desk is just spread out.

5577
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
It's not a mess.

5578
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,000
It's organized chaos.

5579
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,000
It's not organized at all.

5580
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:36,000
It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff.

5581
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
It's got to be stored somewhere.

5582
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:42,000
It's sure as hell not going to be at my house.

5583
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Alright, that's it.

5584
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Thanks a lot, guys, for tuning in and listening and staying with us

5585
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:47,000
all night long.

5586
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:48,000
Here, have a cookie.

5587
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:49,000
We'll see you again next week.

5588
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:50,000
Good night.
