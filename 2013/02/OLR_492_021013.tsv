13899	19905	Tonight, February 10th, 2013, a Wii U exclusive game is pushed back to go multi-platform.
20245	23568	Controversial rumors surround the next Xbox, and could J.J.
23688	26111	Abrams make a Portal movie after Star Wars?
31550	36833	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36953	44756	It is Orange Lounge Radio back on this February 10th for our 492nd episode.
45317	49899	After a week off last week, I'll tell you why and give you all our sorry excuses in a minute.
50199	57462	But first, say hello to the well-rested and ready to go back for another week of OLR, my co-host DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57502	58183	And I'm unemployed.
58783	59543	And you're unemployed.
59603	60184	Fun employed.
60444	61344	It's the preferred term.
61484	61744	Oh, no.
63365	63725	Not very.
64385	69728	I'm not really having a lot of fun because I had what also caused the show to.
71008	71308	Yes.
71688	71909	Yeah.
72189	72409	Yes.
72529	74230	And if I didn't say it, my name is Rob Roberts.
74270	75790	I can't remember if I introduced myself or not.
76050	76490	No, you're not.
77051	78271	So, yes, I am.
78531	79632	How dare you question me?
80392	84194	Anyway, there is no question that we are also joined every week by the one and only.
84874	85974	Who wants to die for art?
87495	88716	Who wants to die for art?
88796	91878	Oh, Loki, Techmaster Loki definitely doesn't want to die for art.
92098	92579	No, I don't.
92619	94180	But he almost did over this weekend.
94340	95281	I didn't almost die.
95441	97782	And he's dying for that pizza he's eating right now.
97842	101605	Well, see, that's the thing is my stomach hasn't stretched out again.
102185	104107	It only takes like a day for it to go back, I guess.
104767	109791	And so I even got a small and I'm only able to eat half of it right now.
110871	111332	That's good.
112825	114146	Yeah, it's portion control, right?
115307	116628	Even though you want to eat the whole thing.
117168	118610	It's alright, I've already done my part.
118990	121512	Sickness, drop five pounds.
122813	125855	Speaking of sickness, it's a big part of the reason why we weren't here last week.
126596	127977	I actually got really sick.
128017	133481	I was out of work on a Friday and a Monday, and no, I was not just trying to extend my weekend.
133641	135663	I actually had the worst of it on Saturday and Sunday.
135723	135983	It's just...
136423	137564	The head cold from hell.
137624	138444	I don't know what else to say about it.
138464	139445	It might have been a flu or something.
139845	142567	So I obviously didn't want these two coming over and getting sick.
142987	144187	Except I already had it.
144207	145568	Yeah, I think you were sick anyway.
145888	147549	I was actually sick for about seven days.
147689	149330	I was like, yeah, I'll just come over anyway.
149430	149791	Yeah, I know.
149831	150911	Loki was like, God damn it.
151251	151752	I'll come over.
151792	152972	I'll just do the show by myself.
153293	155214	And we got to talk about the news.
155274	156895	It's such a busy week in gaming.
156935	157475	I'm like, I know.
157635	157855	I know.
157915	158916	It sucks to lose this week.
158976	159996	But let it go, Loki.
161417	164780	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
181290	182410	Here's a question for you.
182751	191856	Would you play a football game on Xbox if it was Turians versus humans versus Corians or whatever?
193182	195363	I sincerely doubt that's ever going to happen.
195924	196624	Yeah, I would play it.
197104	197364	Really?
197424	200165	It's not going to happen to a company that owns both of those franchises?
201066	201586	That's right.
201606	202867	I really don't think it's going to happen.
203247	208489	DarkSakura presents... Turian Ball, actually.
208529	208729	No.
209430	212431	Turian Balls might be a whole different type of game that DarkSakura would want to present.
212471	214492	But anyway, let's get into...
216893	217894	That face, though.
217954	219295	I wish this were a video show.
219355	219775	It's not.
219835	220776	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
220836	224638	I was picturing it, but all of my favorite fan artists have other plans.
227380	231162	How many X-rated Mass Effect fan art sites have you looked up in your time, DarkSakura?
231182	232303	Technically only one.
232743	232884	Oh.
233264	235465	But there's a few tumblers that I follow.
235685	236166	Oh, I see.
236226	236526	I see.
238107	244311	But if you don't go to their main page, then it doesn't count because they got reblogged and there's nothing you can do about it, right?
244651	245492	Oh, well, oops.
245512	245712	Oops.
247850	250693	How Is Our Gaming Weeks?
266408	267449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
283797	286459	It's like, hey, we got PlayStation Home!
286719	287780	I don't fucking care.
288681	311637	Well, it's funny, because when that was all unfolding, I was at work, and I was on one of my 15-minute breaks at work, trying to furiously catch up on Twitter, and I saw what some of the other indie podcasters I follow were saying on it, and like, OMG, PlayStation 4, and I said, why are we getting all... What if this isn't like a PlayStation Vita conference, like a Nintendo Direct style, here's the upcoming Vita games, like, why are we all so... Because there's nothing coming.
312117	314099	Why are we all so quick to assume it's PlayStation 4?
314739	329151	But then, what ended up, Forbes or Wall Street Journal or one of those more financial magazines, or excuse me, newspapers went with a rumor, which they don't typically tend to do unless they really put a lot of stock in it, that yes, it's going to be PlayStation 4.
331900	339362	and, you know, I've said on Orange Launch Radio, I don't believe that Sony is under any obligation to put PlayStation 4 out this year.
339802	347324	We've talked, you know, we talked at the end of last year about what might be the big shocker next year and I even kind of said that PlayStation 4 might not happen this year.
348024	350205	But, you know, I'm okay being wrong.
350625	351125	It happens.
351565	353365	Oh my God, games analysts sometimes get things wrong.
353385	354226	I don't know that yet.
354266	354806	That's true.
355066	355946	But come on, you're right.
356006	360327	Sony has, even if it's Vita, Vita, Vita, Vita and then little tiny
360387	362671	Sony doesn't have to say what Sony doesn't want to say
372406	372807	Troll Troll Troll
391926	395489	But now that you're looking, you know, going up to this February 20th conference, it makes a lot of sense.
395929	401733	They're trying to get around the typical convention cycle of release your news at E3.
402334	415263	They purposefully are doing this ahead of Microsoft a couple weeks after one of their execs even said, we have no reason to show our cards before Microsoft, which is a very interesting sort of turnaround.
415283	420507	It's also the week before Destination PlayStation where they meet with all their retail partners and stuff like that.
421087	425431	So perhaps, you know, this is ahead of that and Game Developers Conference is in March too, right?
426112	437904	So, you know, they might have some things to say or show about that because certainly you've got to have the third party support and get the other developers on board pretty early as another company is learning the hard way this week, but we'll get into that later.
437924	438765	Yeah.
440744	452913	It's very interesting now because Sony will be the talk of everything between February and whenever Microsoft finally announces whatever they're doing, which could be E3 at this point, although why not announce it a little earlier?
453013	455055	It won't be because that's not how they did the 360.
456796	457256	That's true.
457276	457957	That's not how they did the 360.
459238	459678	DarkSakura?
459998	460258	I don't know.
460278	466623	I just have another thought about Sony keeping quiet for the sake of raising that speculation and gathering interest.
468889	478072	Even if they don't mention anything more than a little teeny thing about the PS4, they're building all the suspense and getting people interested in what they're going to say.
478292	483813	Oh yeah, it's definitely the hype machine is in full force now and that's what 2013 is going to be.
483853	485434	It's going to be the year of the...
486194	488615	As somebody called it this week, Gen 4 consoles.
488635	492777	I think Sony themselves called it Gen 4 consoles in an unrelated discussion.
492797	493617	So what's the Nintendo?
493657	494238	Minus 5?
494318	494918	I know, right?
495098	496458	It's like, oh, I see.
496699	499200	The console generations didn't start until Sony got to the table.
499760	500640	I think it's in reality.
500680	502821	What, we're getting into the 9th generation, I think?
503041	509624	I know that the Magnavox, it was the Odyssey, the Fairchild were considered Gen 1 consoles.
510164	511825	Atari was Gen 2.
514967	525133	The Magnavox Odyssey came out in 79 and the Fairchild Channel F came out right around the same time or right before that maybe.
525733	531517	And then there were the Texas Instruments systems came out in 81 so did the 2600?
533926	534947	NextGenGaming.com
553947	579660	one other thing though I think and I wanted to touch on this is I find it very interesting that Sony is kind of going to the web they're taking their case to the internet I find it a move very inspired in part by what Nintendo Direct is doing and you know Sony got a lot of shit the year they unveiled the PlayStation 3 and rightfully so that press conference was a hot mess I mean we made fun of it on this show for years and years Giant Enemy Crabs 599 US dollars Ridge Racer Africa
582421	585063	That was a... No, Africa was the next year.
585283	585563	Was it?
585823	586404	Yeah, I think it was.
586424	587384	No, I don't think it was.
587564	588185	Well, whatever.
588445	589646	It was a fucking mess.
589746	592648	I mean, it was an awesome mess and we loved it as gamers.
593008	595029	But Sony doesn't want to make that same mistake twice.
595370	601894	So why not have a nice, polished, pre-edited presentation that they deliver directly to the internets?
602394	604656	Which I also think is fascinating is that...
606036	608798	E3 is losing some of its relevance in that regard.
609079	622928	Now, I'm not out here saying E3's dead, oh my god, and you know, E3 has its place, it's important, yes, but it's very interesting that E3 is not going to have the big reveals of either of these consoles, although certainly...
623808	639019	some of the big game announcements and some of the specifications release dates, prices a lot of that probably won't come out till E3 don't expect you're going to know the release date and the price of this machine on February 20th not going to happen I feel very confident in saying that
639699	644221	because Sony does kind of want to size up what their competition is doing before they're ready to announce something like that.
644681	652024	And just the price of parts can fluctuate that much in the time period between February and when this thing actually gets released.
655385	661407	Anything that you are looking forward to or not out of this particular event on the 20th?
661427	662948	Because it's only 10 days away at this point.
663028	665309	No, I'm not even really considering anything.
665789	668391	I just... I don't know.
668431	670532	It'd be nice to see what they had planned for the Vita.
671813	674034	As I mentioned on Twitter, I got rid of mine.
676485	680469	Yeah, someone was interested in making an offer on it before someone put it on eBay.
680669	681830	Yeah, I noticed that all came up.
682431	683512	That was in the two-week break.
683552	685534	You sold your Vita during the two-week break.
685734	685954	Yeah.
687195	692300	So, you know, there's really nothing coming out for the Vita.
692781	697966	And the PlayStation 3, it's just not really... Not a whole lot of stuff that excites me about that.
698526	698807	So...
700501	700841	I don't know.
701421	704302	It would be interesting to see what they have to offer, what's going to be unique.
704602	708083	Once again, it's going to have to be something that's kind of this big wow factor thing.
708783	710283	That's really what did it for the Wii.
710523	719265	The Wii may not have been technologically superior, but it was like, hey, look, you're going to be able to play games a completely different way than you've ever played games before.
719705	720825	And that's why it took off.
721446	723446	Now that everybody kind of has the same type of thing, it's...
724467	725027	Thanks for watching!
740220	760832	I just really hope that this, you know, new console, you know, I think we've heard a lot about not necessarily this console may not be so much about the technological aspect of it, but kind of the way it integrates itself, the gaming, you know, a true entertainment box and that whole, you know, social gaming becoming more prevalent and Gaikai integration, you know, how is that going to be a factor and so forth.
761312	771294	One thing I really fear, though, is that I really fear all the execs sitting in the boardroom, and we all know just about every bad decision made in gaming started in a boardroom somewhere, right?
771674	775335	And I'm really worried that everybody's just tapping into Facebook.
775675	777355	We've got to have a piece of Facebook gaming.
777455	778455	Facebook is gaming.
778675	779435	That's what people want.
779495	783736	People want Facebook, and they want the mobile games and the OUYA, and that's what the people want.
784156	787957	And we've got to have a one-button integration that goes with Facebook and so forth, and
788197	790739	We got to have games playable on Facebook that are on the PlayStation 3.
791420	793101	And I'm just like, God, I hope not.
793181	795162	Because that really feels like a step backwards to me.
795523	799966	If we go all like Farmville on PlayStation 3, that can be one element of it.
800246	801927	But I really hope that's not the focus.
802428	806271	I don't think that they're going to do that because they've been kind of more, you know, core audience.
806431	810414	Once again, you know, and the same thing would have been reading all these, you know,
810774	811414	and so on.
835285	835845	Thanks for watching!
853490	875460	so that's the thing is no one's forcing you at gunpoint to buy a new console for the next generation so I don't understand why anybody should feel you know like that this is your own choice just listen to what their options are and then make a decision or hey trust me if you decide not to buy a new console there's plenty of games you know seven generations worth of games that you can go play
877763	883569	Going to the chat room, of course, we always do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
883969	888874	We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
889214	892657	And a big thank you to all those of you that have turned up live tonight.
892957	902146	I know we have a lot of competition going on tonight with the silly Grammys on TV, which I think are one of the worst of all the award shows, but people still seem to want to watch it anyway, so there's that.
902806	906868	Jack Trenton said that they didn't believe in not making a system where you couldn't play used games on
932807	939651	I know we're going to get into this a little more later in the show, but I just don't think Sony or Microsoft, for that matter, is that stupid.
940672	944374	But, I mean, again, every bad decision comes from a boardroom somewhere.
945055	947336	It's incredibly ballsy to try something like that.
947376	948717	I think that's a good way to put it.
948837	951099	That would be a ballsy move.
951299	955702	That's basically saying, hey, buy, sell, trade retailers, we don't need you.
955902	959845	And when they say buy, sell, trade retailers, we mean GameStop.
960365	961266	They need GameStop.
962567	964210	And that's just going back to what you said, Loki.
964290	969239	It just encourages people not to buy it, and so publishers are stuck making games for the systems they already have.
969259	971022	It's gotta be everybody's on board or not.
971162	974567	And even then, if everybody's on board with it, people will go elsewhere.
974588	975128	I mean...
976738	979840	At this point, they're not the only companies making consoles.
979880	986423	I mean, granted, there's going to be the Ouya, which is Android-based and stuff, and that may not be what you're looking for, but it's open.
986763	995488	It's more open than these consoles are, so if they try to do something like that, which they're not, I just don't see it working out for them.
995948	999490	Actdeft in our chatroom, and the PSP didn't catch up at all.
999830	1002992	The Vita seems like it's going the way of the PSP or worse.
1003172	1004833	Is the Vita hosed at this point?
1005413	1010515	Do you think Sony... I mean, I know you just sold yours this week, so maybe I can already tell your perspective.
1010876	1012757	But has Sony written the Vita off?
1012997	1013957	Is the Vita done for?
1014057	1016819	I don't think they've written it off, but they sure didn't start off very well.
1016839	1020901	Because the problem was they outsourced a lot of their big games for...
1021641	1022261	Thanks for watching!
1046848	1063623	and it sucks because you had the same company that made the really terrible first person shooter resistance game do that and now, you know, they had even like Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which was supposed to be alright but I don't think it was, you know, I don't know if it sold systems but...
1065084	1078307	The thing was, now the next game that's supposed to be this, oh, this is really going to define the system as Killzone, which, that's cool that it's a first-person shooter in Killzone, but I'm not a big fan of the Killzone franchise.
1078327	1083388	So for me, looking at the outlook of what's coming out for the Vita, there just wasn't anything there for me.
1083408	1087249	That's why I got rid of it, because I just had nothing I wanted to play on it.
1088410	1091933	What happened with things like Final Fantasy X Remake?
1092313	1094375	Oh, that's still way the hell down there.
1094395	1094855	And who cares?
1094915	1101400	It's a remake of Final Fantasy X. Well, the whole HD part, there's parts about that that are relevant to my interests.
1101440	1103222	I'd check it out, probably.
1103482	1112750	Whatever, I mean, I just... I played 10 already, so... I agree that you can't... You know, you can't support your system with nothing but remakes, Nintendo.
1113571	1116654	But, you know, it's... It helps.
1117415	1119356	It's just not... I mean, that's nice...
1120137	1120757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1140169	1140969	It wasn't my thing.
1140989	1144910	I mean, I'm not even really a huge fan of Smash Bros., but at least Smash Bros.
1144950	1146711	seemed like... I don't know.
1146771	1147771	It was kind of more fun.
1147791	1154313	I guess I can identify... Not really identify the characters, but, you know, the characters were a little bit more... I don't know how to really put it.
1154393	1159894	It's just like I don't really have any... I guess any attachments to any of these characters in the Sony game, I guess.
1160114	1162055	It's like, you know, Jak and Daxter, cool.
1162075	1163435	I haven't really played any of those games.
1163495	1164236	Or Sly Cooper.
1164716	1164976	You know, I...
1166747	1191834	I don't really care about that series there just wasn't a lot of stuff there now if they announced Grand Theft Auto and it was coming out in March that'd be a whole different story I'd probably be still keeping that system or it just if they announced hey Grand Theft Auto is coming to the Vita yeah I'd be still sticking on to that but it's just nothing that I really wanted for it was coming out and it's kind of the same problem with the 3DS because remember the 3DS was when they were talking about 3DS it was like hey Saints Row DJ Hero coming to the 3DS I was like fuck
1192074	1195219	Yes, that sold the system for me.
1195560	1198926	Saints Row on the go and DJ Hero, that'd be pretty awesome.
1199246	1201530	And then neither one came out, so I was like, ah, fuck that.
1203021	1203882	Yeah, that was disappointing.
1203902	1208365	But really, overall, what it is is it's just I don't have time for portable gaming anymore.
1208445	1210626	It's like I don't go anywhere.
1210786	1215730	I don't need a portable system, so there's really no need for me to have this.
1215890	1216910	Some comments from chat.
1217110	1222314	TigerClaw says, Sly Cooper is awesome, and Actdeft says, Loki, you should totally play Sly Cooper for real.
1223074	1223515	Well, then, cool.
1223535	1225676	I can pick it up on my PS3, but I'm not.
1226257	1231040	Once again, it's just I don't need a portable system anymore is what it is.
1231220	1232421	I just don't need it because I don't.
1233041	1234502	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1259059	1259999	Busy, actually.
1261160	1263281	I played some Mass Effect 2, of course.
1264601	1267982	I actually don't think I logged into WoW at all, which is weird.
1268983	1272324	And I started Dragon Age 2, which I really like the game.
1272564	1273885	I liked it when I played it before.
1273905	1276226	It just, you know, killed my hand to play on the Xbox.
1276846	1280707	So I'm playing it on PC, and I'm having a really good time with it.
1281568	1281728	And...
1283689	1286312	We have had another addition to our gaming family.
1304764	1306505	What else was it that I was playing?
1306985	1311286	Oh yeah, we got another Super Nintendo that came with a box of games.
1311386	1313747	And among them was Pocky and Rocky 2.
1314948	1317829	Which goes for, oh, unboxed a good 90 bucks on eBay.
1317949	1319569	It's a pretty rare Super Nintendo game.
1319709	1320630	We bought the whole batch for 50.
1321010	1321930	Where did you find all this?
1322310	1322670	Goodwill.
1323251	1323791	Oh really?
1323951	1324131	Yeah.
1324311	1324611	Wow.
1325011	1325912	You know what else I got at Goodwill?
1326292	1327132	An earring magic pen.
1327392	1327732	In the box.
1329853	1330474	That's awesome, though.
1330494	1330574	For $10.
1330654	1336302	You found such a gaming motherlode, I guess, of sorts.
1336322	1343110	Well, since we've already got a bajillion other Super Nintendos, we're going to sell this one with a copy of Super Mario World.
1343151	1346014	We'll put it up on Craigslist, and I'll share the link later.
1346174	1347917	Dan's also selling his old driving rig.
1348226	1351688	and I got a copy of Mega Man X out of it because you got dupes so I can't complain.
1352169	1358013	Well, we've got a bunch of other dupes too but Dan and I sat all that night, that first night and played Jeopardy together.
1358953	1363576	Like the deluxe Jeopardy and he's like, I don't know what area to pick now.
1363616	1364537	I know all this other stuff.
1364557	1364917	What about this?
1364937	1374664	I was like, just pick the French Revolution and then I started answering all the questions in the French Revolution because you know me, I'm a stupid history nerd and he's like, oh my God, you knew all those.
1374724	1377365	I was like, yeah, you married a smart woman.
1377385	1377426	Hi.
1378747	1381591	and like Wheel of Fortune.
1381611	1383995	We played Wheel of Fortune and Super Tecmo Bowl.
1384963	1385463	Superbazooka
1411920	1412360	Blastrous.
1412521	1413201	Yeah, Blastrous.
1413221	1415864	Yeah, we've got like a bajillion Super Scope 6 copies now.
1416265	1418267	And another Mario Paint, even though we have no mouse.
1418307	1419688	We have the mouse pad, we have no mouse.
1421710	1422671	And what else?
1423432	1423912	Battle Clash?
1423952	1424613	Not Battle Clash.
1425634	1426195	Battle Chess?
1426395	1427016	No, not Battle Chess.
1427036	1429078	It was another Super Scope game that's like...
1430367	1431068	I know what you're talking about.
1431088	1431468	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1431608	1431828	Yeah.
1431968	1433350	The other Super Super Six game.
1433910	1435512	Or Metal something.
1435692	1435992	Yeah.
1436032	1436272	Yeah.
1436613	1437874	Something tank thing.
1437914	1440596	I'm sure somebody in chat will yell it out, but yeah.
1440736	1443579	We also, what else came in that collection?
1444699	1445961	I said Wheel of Fortune, right?
1446101	1446281	Yeah.
1446601	1446741	No.
1447242	1449604	Wheel of Fortune came with it.
1451005	1453047	Killer Instinct also came with it.
1453807	1454348	What'd you find?
1454668	1478441	Battle Clash Battle Clash, that's it was the game I think you're thinking of there was also this is the long list of games that supported the Super Scope Battle Clash, Bazooka Blitzkrieg The Hunt for Red October had bonus games in it Lamborghini American Challenge had many games Lemmings 2 The Tribes had calibration Metal Combat, Falcon's Revenge, Operation Thunderbolt I remember that one
1479482	1484170	T2 The Arcade Game, Tin Star, X-Zone, Yoshi Safari
1489934	1494016	We got something like, I want to say, 12 games or so with the system.
1495257	1500259	Dan and I also sat down, because he took a few days off and I'm unemployed.
1502000	1508523	We cataloged all of our games that we have at our house right now, and this isn't including what we've loaned out.
1509623	1529038	or what's not at the house given that would be our Atari, all of our Atari games which would be 2600, 5200, 7800 we did get Lynx though, Lynx stuff was at the house our Clicovision, Intellivision and Odyssey, Odyssey 2 collection so we cataloged 1279 individual games and we have dupes of some of them
1533080	1533421	Indipendent Skews
1545822	1566174	Fair enough Even though you're not a Best Buy, but that works I forgot that we had two copies of Cyberbots But Dan and I are actually starting to think about selling off some of our dupes So we're giving friends and OLR listeners first crack So I'll let you guys know when that's happening
1566957	1569660	All right, very retrotastic week, it sounds like.
1569820	1570320	It's awesome.
1571021	1572382	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1572402	1573103	What have you been up to?
1573123	1574204	What have you been sick?
1575445	1576245	Let's see, what did I do?
1577126	1579688	I played a bit of Minecraft.
1579849	1583572	I built, I'm not really sure what it is, a small bridge, I guess.
1583732	1584393	Oh yeah, I played that too.
1585173	1588895	And then, um, I just noticed actually our dynamic map's not working correctly.
1589015	1592477	It's showing up someone else's world, which is not of my interest.
1593377	1604242	Um, and then I played, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row the 3rd today because, um, I'd left some of my games at work and I wanted to play those, but, um, you know, Saints Row happened to be in my bag and...
1604542	1605103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1629326	1631387	Damn, that kind of sucks.
1631887	1633107	I really don't want to play that game again.
1633407	1638189	I mean, maybe later on, but just not... I don't know.
1638389	1641049	I just don't want to do all those activities again because some of those are really annoying.
1643170	1644671	And then, let's see, what else?
1644931	1648912	I also played a little bit of Forza Horizon, just mainly working on some decals.
1650492	1655794	I played a small bit... Well, we played some Borderlands 2 this week, and...
1657867	1658808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1674030	1687975	Skyrim, more Skyrim my modded game on PC it's getting really buggy probably because I'm not supposed to put 87 mods on it I actually removed some because I had 90 something there at one point but
1689135	1691857	Um, yeah, lots of mods in the game.
1691957	1694478	It's, it's awesome because the game is so large.
1694759	1702103	Once again, I don't know, I can't remember what's part of the game and what's a mod, at least some of this stuff.
1702143	1707266	I mean, obviously the Realm of Chuck Norris wasn't in, um, the original Skyrim, but, uh,
1708860	1709160	It's fun.
1709321	1724276	And I did try the Dovah Bear mod and it got annoying because Dovah Bear, like most of the other NPCs in some games, it just kept walking in front of me and trapping me in places because it just wouldn't get out of my way.
1724777	1728060	And I wanted to attack things and just stand there growling and
1728601	1729201	Thank you for watching!
1749866	1750567	My gaming week.
1751247	1756250	Last week when I was sick, I played a lot more Ni No Kuni, which I talked about on a previous episode of the show.
1757090	1761192	Still enjoying it, even though I'm about to that 15-16 hour mark.
1761572	1764033	And of course, I've taken a pretty big break the past few days.
1764173	1771317	I played a lot of console games when I was sick, so I've not been wanting to do that because I haven't been sick since Monday.
1771717	1774919	But I do still intend on finishing Ni No Kuni at some point.
1775339	1776600	Path of Exile Path of Exile
1799917	1808864	and I don't know if you guys are familiar with this game at all but Path of Exile is a free game and it is put out by Gear Grinder Games.
1809025	1810326	I might have messed that up, sorry.
1810706	1819333	I don't have the notes in front of me but it's got microtransactions in it but they are very big on saying that
1819873	1822814	They want to do ethical microtransactions.
1822874	1828396	They don't want to do the type of microtransactions that would hold you back in like a Zynga game, like an energy meter running out or something.
1828456	1833558	They want to sell cosmetics, spell effects, pets.
1834159	1841402	And if you look at their marketplace, that is the kind of stuff they're selling along with like extra character slots and extra stash things and so forth.
1844303	1847404	The money factor is not holding the game back, whatever.
1847464	1850645	Which I believe technically the game is still considered open beta right now.
1851485	1854206	And probably will be in beta for a long time, kind of like Gmail is.
1854306	1859007	But Path of Exile is a Diablo clone of sorts, for lack of a better term.
1859027	1860648	That's the best way I could explain it to you.
1860688	1867610	If you've played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2 or even Diablo 3, you pretty much get the gist of what Path of Exile is going to be like.
1868190	1877153	and it does have the fully online integration where you can get other people to join your game while you're going and you can party up to take on mobs that will be of an increased difficulty.
1878914	1879354	Let's see.
1879694	1891218	Also, there are six classes in the game and everything is kind of based around the three kind of guiding stats of intelligence,
1891938	1893659	Strength, Dexterity.
1893960	1896941	And so you have one class that's very focused in each of those areas.
1896981	1899903	Like I play a witch, which is the intelligence-focused class.
1900203	1906748	But then there's other classes that are like Strength meets Dexterity, Strength meets Intelligence, which I think is like the Templar, and so on and so on.
1907168	1911671	And everything is very dictated by the colors that go along with those stats because you get gems that are those colors.
1912551	1913992	Most items have sockets in them.
1914372	1916554	All the abilities are driven by gems.
1917074	1925582	And where this game gets really interesting is that you get gems that modify abilities if you have them in a connected socket.
1926142	1931166	Like for example, let's say I have a blue gem that makes fire and I do like a little fire bolt.
1931507	1935330	Well, when I beat a quest later on, I might get another gem that's called fork.
1935771	1943537	And if I put fork and I tie it in a socket that joins with the fire spell, I will get a fireball that forks.
1944598	1951763	It's pretty cool because it gives it this way of developing your own spells in a way.
1953024	1958968	There is no gold in the game, which I found very interesting at first, but everything is basically barter.
1960249	1966333	The scrolls of Identify and the scrolls of Town Portal become your currency, which is really interesting to me.
1967454	1972117	The way you level up your characters is basically Final Fantasy X's Crystallarium.
1972457	1978322	I can't really explain it any better, but it's this gigantic map where you move through all these different talents.
1978702	1980984	I think the level cap in the game is like 100.
1982185	1985127	You can imagine this leveling chart is gigantic.
1985927	1994755	and so there's so many ways that you could screw up your build because one of the tiny drawbacks is that there's very few ways to respec.
1994895	2001981	I mean, you can respec a little bit limited, one point or two, but if you screw up your class, you're stuck with it and you'll have to roll again or whatever.
2003963	2006965	But yeah, I mean did I mention this game's free?
2007665	2010147	So how can I sit here and really complain about it at all?
2010387	2024376	The graphics are really good, they're optimized very well Especially, you know, because I even have problems in games like Diablo 3 and Warcraft sometimes But the graphics are optimized very well in Path of Exile
2024996	2053241	and I guess the only maybe little drawback I would say is that I feel like the camera is always zoomed in too much and although you can zoom in a little bit to you know kind of see your character a different way for screenshots and whatever like you can't zoom out enough which can kind of be a bitch in multiplayer modes but that is one tiny ass gripe in the scope of what is really a great game that if you're a fan of Diablo or Torchlight or any of that stuff this game is free
2054321	2062523	and I will be honest to God surprised if this game can pull it off and sustain itself on this model.
2062583	2063224	That's the only thing.
2063264	2066425	I kind of look at this and go, how can this company not be bankrupt in a year?
2067205	2074927	But I've been enjoying it enough where I almost just want to kick them 20 bucks just to say, well done, applause.
2075207	2079428	I'll just buy something stupid like more character slots or something just to support the game.
2079488	2081229	I actually kind of want to do that.
2081969	2082770	It's weird, huh?
2083590	2087474	But I want to support a company that I think is doing a pretty awesome thing here.
2089115	2090296	Yeah, so Path of Exile.
2090536	2092097	I recommend it.
2092277	2092578	I do.
2093659	2096281	Even though the game's still in beta and so forth, it's fun.
2096821	2101385	And hopefully we'll only get better with time as it gets out of beta.
2102065	2103146	So, well done.
2104668	2106209	That was pretty much my gaming week.
2106629	2108311	So we'll move on to some housekeeping news.
2109284	2111624	You can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2111664	2116305	We're also on Facebook and Google+, so please find us on social media.
2116365	2117025	We appreciate it.
2117745	2121186	Also want to give a shout-out to our friends at Anime Jam Session.
2121526	2127147	It's one of the other shows you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
2127227	2136108	They are about to hit 100 shows this week, so congratulations to Ranma, Ari Rockefeller, the whole gang over there at Anime Jam Session.
2136809	2138829	By the way, to celebrate their 100th episode
2139269	2139969	and DarkSakura.
2166477	2168458	All right, that does it for housekeeping.
2168498	2172340	Let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.
2172480	2174841	It's been pretty damn busy, hasn't it, Loki?
2175302	2175522	Yes.
2176162	2181345	So one of the announcements this week was that Rayman Legends has been delayed.
2182365	2183106	Oh, no.
2185107	2193011	It was originally supposed to be one of the bigger Wii U releases for people that bought the Wii U. It was one of the games that they were kind of touting, not even E3.
2194311	2202436	And the other bit of news that goes along with that, not only has it been delayed to September, but now it's not going to be exclusive to the Wii U anymore.
2202496	2205478	It's also coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2207219	2208080	Because they want to make money.
2209721	2210281	Exactly.
2211642	2216725	Because they said that the reason that they have the delay is because it's not done yet.
2219684	2228012	And, you know, they said, well, we could put out the Wii U version now and then do the other ones later in September.
2228152	2231996	But we usually release all of our stuff simultaneously.
2232877	2236600	And we're just, you know, it's not a standard practice.
2236640	2238422	We just do this on a case-by-case basis.
2239122	2240003	Basically, here's what it is.
2240063	2241665	Okay, folks, if you think about it.
2242765	2244466	This is going to be a game that they're going to want to market.
2245266	2253088	Why would you double your marketing spend so that the Wii U people, the very few of them that may buy this game, get advertised to?
2253588	2263830	I mean, so basically, it's better just to wait, put the extra polish on the Wii U version of the game, put it out in the other consoles, make some additional content, market it all at the same time in September.
2265050	2267731	What does suck, though, about that is...
2269132	2271373	What the hell is now coming out for the Wii U?
2271893	2278396	Because, honestly, that was going to be the only game for the Wii U in February.
2278817	2280998	So now you have two months with no Wii U games.
2282538	2283279	When's Pikmin out?
2283319	2283619	March?
2284500	2285580	No, Pikmin got delayed.
2285820	2286280	Oh, boy.
2287541	2288001	Not good.
2288141	2289362	There's no first party title.
2289382	2290202	There's the LEGO game, right?
2290222	2299906	The LEGO game is the only first party title that they have for... I mean, that's... Yeah, it's not really Nintendo, but they're, I guess, publishing it.
2300486	2305188	But, yeah, that's going to be... There's a lot of stuff in March, but, I mean, let me put it this way.
2305228	2311231	I looked at the list of stuff coming out for the Wii U. There's maybe about eight games until the end of the year so far that have been announced.
2312251	2317116	and I'm including all of the like Zelda HD and all that stuff.
2317236	2321579	I mean, there's literally not a lot to go around right now.
2321940	2323982	Well, then to play devil's advocate.
2325723	2333390	Yes, I can see where the audience for this Rayman game will expand quite a bit by delaying the game and doing it on 360 and PlayStation 3.
2333970	2334471	I get that.
2334511	2336893	But at the same time, you had a captive audience of
2337333	2340796	That is how some people are really taking this news
2362082	2367725	Ubisoft right now is pulling in profit hand over fist, so I don't really think that it's going to hurt them that badly.
2370107	2373049	Entertain my point for a minute here, whether I really believe this or not.
2373409	2380614	What about the concept that there was a captive audience in the Wii U audience, and now in September, you're going to get your game notice in September?
2380714	2390701	I mean, Rayman, yes, it has its fans, and it's always going to appeal, especially as a kid-friendly type of game, where I've seen a lot of people on the internet saying, well, now it's got to go up against Grand Theft Auto.
2391301	2391702	Hello.
2391822	2393643	How short-sighted of a statement is that?
2393804	2394244	I'm sorry.
2394324	2397247	If you are one of those people saying that, I'm smacking you upside the head.
2397587	2398428	Wake up call.
2398688	2400790	Do those two games really have the same audiences?
2400810	2401391	Counter-advocate.
2401971	2402492	Hello.
2402832	2403152	Yeah, I know.
2403453	2403813	Family.
2404313	2404514	Yeah.
2405094	2408097	Where it's a decision between buying something for the kids or buying something for the grown-ups.
2408237	2434644	however all that being said when you're at September you're knocking down the Christmas season's door and those games are going to be a dime a dozen those family games so why wasn't the opportunity seized to really have Nintendo fans full undivided attention a smaller audience yes a loyal audience clearly Loki any thoughts on that um
2436332	2438714	I once again, I just think it just comes down to money.
2439094	2442896	And it's because they're going to spend less money in marketing that.
2444818	2447680	I mean, they could just put it out the Wii U version without any marketing.
2447740	2451162	But then, you know, they're not going to make a whole ton of money off of that.
2451702	2455485	I mean, granted, they've already kind of marketed it with demos and stuff like that.
2455525	2459548	But once again, you have to consider what the install base of the Wii U is.
2459808	2460788	It's not very large.
2461249	2465171	And how many what percentage of those people are going to buy Rayman Legends?
2466572	2486299	being that's the only game in two months maybe quite a few of them but it's still not a big chunk I mean if you could guarantee all of them would buy it and maybe that might be worth it but it's just it's not gonna happen they know third-party attachment rates on this these things are not not good
2487679	2494123	I want to share a point, and I will credit this to Bobby because it's something he said on his show, so please support Mr. Bobby Blackwolf.
2494844	2498006	Bobby Blackwolf Show, 5 o'clock here at VOG, 8 o'clock Eastern.
2499106	2511914	He talked about how Nintendo gets this rap all the time where it's all about the first-party games, and Nintendo does great for first-party and their stuff, but they don't do enough for third-party games.
2512094	2527405	So here they go, they put out their system and the reason why they have this big blank slate is that they wanted the third parties to be able to carry this, is that they didn't want to flood the market with their own stuff because they wanted the third parties to have a chance to shine, to have a chance to sell their games.
2528005	2532809	And to be fair, Zombie U has done very well in that category, also an Ubisoft game.
2533329	2539533	But, you know, the system's launch was Mario and Nintendo Land and there's not going to be anything else till Christmas.
2539793	2541534	So third parties, here you go.
2541814	2542995	Here's your chance to shine.
2543315	2548798	And instead of taking that chance, Ubisoft has literally shit on them.
2549298	2570699	like literally taking a dump all over that offering from Nintendo I mean whether it's a good business decision or not that's pretty much what happened because Nintendo did put a lot of stock and investment in this whole you know we got Rayman Legends coming da da da we got an exclusive demo da da da only to get the literally shit on by Ubisoft with this
2573228	2581421	So I mean, can we really complain about how Nintendo doesn't support third parties when this is how the third parties respond?
2583482	2595029	Well, okay, I'm sorry, but to play, I guess, devil's advocate there, I don't really think that the whole blank space right here is to allow for third parties.
2595149	2604595	I think it's that Nintendo's development is fucked up, and that's because they had stuff for first quarter that they were going to put out first-party titles, and they're just not fucking done yet.
2605136	2607937	And it's not a matter of them, oh, we're being gracious to these third parties.
2608478	2609659	They have nothing coming up.
2610279	2611280	They're probably, like...
2611980	2613141	Thanks for watching!
2627874	2630416	There's still PlayStation 2 games coming out last year.
2630716	2635299	I mean, a couple, but that's still many years after the system's done.
2636260	2639782	Versus the Wii U comes out, nothing this year.
2640222	2642564	There's like three games for the Wii coming out.
2643564	2644205	And that's it.
2644445	2645806	It's just nothing.
2646226	2647547	Just drop down to nothing.
2648688	2650189	And there's nothing for your new system either.
2650229	2653631	It's just like they said, fuck you guys, we're just going to go to the other platforms.
2656570	2657991	I've been playing Devil's Advocate a lot.
2658071	2659272	Here's my honest opinion.
2659292	2660252	Here's what I really think.
2660433	2662394	Now that I've shared all this other stuff, here's what I really think.
2663034	2667017	The Ubisoft decision from a purely business and nothing else perspective, it does make sense.
2667717	2673161	And so as disappointing as that is, as a Wii U owner, honestly, I probably wasn't going to buy the game anyway.
2673501	2675983	Rayman was not the system seller for me anyway.
2678164	2682087	I think Nintendo is in a situation exactly like the 3DS situation.
2682448	2685310	And it's really ridiculous that they're in that situation yet again.
2685730	2689093	But I think the only way out of it... I mean, the 3DS is in a great place now.
2689413	2691635	And Nintendo is essentially going to have to repeat history.
2691875	2693016	They're going to have to eat shit.
2693136	2696999	They're going to have to cut the price of the Wii U. That's the only thing now.
2697239	2700642	And we're going to get another one of those E3s this year where Reggie comes out on stage and says...
2701022	2701923	You fucking want games?
2702163	2702443	Bam.
2702583	2703124	Here's a game.
2703284	2703784	Here's a game.
2703944	2704425	Here's a game.
2704585	2705045	Here's a game.
2705185	2705526	Fuck you.
2705586	2705886	I'm out.
2706146	2707507	That's going to be their E3 this year.
2707667	2711130	It's going to be just like the year that this all went down with 3DS.
2711710	2712971	And that'll be that.
2713031	2718095	And then a year from now, we're all going to sit here going, how did we ever doubt Nintendo and the Wii U?
2718395	2721998	Will the Wii U be the force to be reckoned with the Wii was?
2722659	2722919	No.
2724100	2729244	But if these... I mean, who's to say these other consoles...
2730475	2732117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2747553	2775494	and things they might do and missteps they might make of their own that could really piss people off in convincing them to spend $500 on these new consoles and if that happens and you're the soccer mom come Christmas time do you want to buy one of these $500 consoles that doesn't play used games or do you want to buy this other console that has the Nintendo name on it that has Mario's face on it that just had its price slashed by 50 bucks to play games that albeit are not that much better technologically than the ones that are out now
2779776	2782479	Believe it, that could happen all over again.
2783440	2785222	History could very well repeat itself.
2786784	2790087	Even though we're all sitting here laughing at Nintendo right now, don't count them out.
2790348	2794893	It is way too early, and Nintendo is far too stubborn to let it go.
2796477	2799718	I also have the special superpower of lucky bitch powers.
2800498	2814002	Because seriously, I mean, have you not noticed that just when things seem, you know, about to be down for Nintendo, they pull something out of their ass or something turns around or just one little thing will work in their favor and it all turns around.
2814722	2814922	Right?
2814942	2816143	Yeah.
2816763	2817383	Lucky bitch powers.
2819861	2821021	We'll see, though.
2821041	2822822	A lot can happen between now and E3.
2822902	2824242	It's going to be a very interesting year.
2824742	2825182	Can't wait.
2826563	2827923	A note for our live listeners.
2828023	2832304	We are aware that the show is cutting out a little bit here and there, and a lot of you are having to reload.
2833105	2833725	We're sorry about it.
2833785	2839226	The same problem was affecting Bobby's show tonight, so we actually think it does not originate with us.
2839946	2841887	I know we had some lousy...
2842487	2843168	Blame God Blame God
2862441	2866743	It's really the problem is our choice to go with Blizzard cooling for our server.
2868104	2868924	Exactly, right?
2869204	2872005	Should have gone with water or air.
2872406	2873286	No, Blizzard!
2873346	2873906	It's better.
2875207	2876927	Did you get all that Rayman stuff out?
2876947	2878808	They're going to have an exclusive demo.
2879609	2882370	Hey, good luck Nintendo, man.
2882690	2884891	They know how to show appreciation.
2885771	2890113	They're going to have you guys put out another... Ubisoft's going to put out another demo.
2890353	2893615	and other exclusive ream and legends demo.
2893775	2894255	At some point.
2894495	2902179	Ross Steel and UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the third parties aren't going to go back to Nintendo.
2902279	2903380	It's not gonna happen.
2904180	2905921	I think that's a bold as fuck statement.
2907262	2907742	I don't know.
2907982	2912224	I mean, there's some other stuff that we may talk about later on that...
2913745	2916708	Well, why don't I throw this out there as far as third parties go.
2916988	2928457	Activision, interesting little development during their earnings call where Bobby Kotick was asked about Skylanders and so forth, how the console sales with that all goes.
2928998	2937064	He said, quote, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U. We're concerned about the install base for 6 to 11 year olds.
2937825	2940027	So, of course, this caused all the blogs to run with...
2940427	2957542	Activision is concerned about Nintendo because he did use that you know we're concerned okay we'll see I don't think I wouldn't worry about this too long term but it does show Nintendo really has to show a clear future on how that console is going to print money very soon
2958769	2963071	Here's one for you, since I see it's not in our show rule.
2963851	2964231	EA.
2965592	2969414	There's no EA sports games for the Wii or Wii U this year, so far.
2969634	2970314	Yeah, I noticed that.
2970554	2972395	And that's up through August, through Madden.
2972775	2976357	No Tiger, no... And this even goes with 2K.
2976657	2977437	No MLB game.
2977897	2980038	There's no NCAA and no Madden.
2980398	2980918	I mean, that's...
2982259	2982920	Thank you for watching!
2992734	2993074	I don't know.
2993574	2993934	FIFA.
2994094	2995395	I could see FIFA being on there.
2995555	2999556	But right now, no Wii U titles, sports-wise.
3000616	3001036	And who knows?
3001096	3003697	Maybe they'll continue with other franchises of theirs.
3004397	3020202	Let's not forget, though, despite the fact we say all the third parties are abandoning ship, which I think it's a little early to say that for sure, remember one place where Wii U and Nintendo themselves have really endeared themselves, and don't count out what this base can do for your console, is indies.
3021300	3021821	PS3, Xbox 360 Heavy
3048274	3052335	Maybe people have all started realizing that it's the same game every year.
3052395	3053655	Nope, they haven't figured that out yet.
3054316	3056116	Still the number one selling sports game.
3056556	3059437	Ranma in our chatroom suggests Tecmo Bowl for Wii U, please.
3060697	3062078	It could be an interesting time for somebody.
3062098	3064238	Didn't they try that for the Wii and how well did that sell?
3064258	3064938	Yeah, that's true.
3065619	3068679	This could be an interesting time for somebody else to come in and do their knockoff game.
3068719	3071100	I mean, it couldn't be NBA or NFL officially, but...
3071981	3076790	you have to know there's no football game that's as good as super high impact end of story
3080492	3082693	High Impact Wii U. No Super Garrus Ball.
3082993	3083854	Anything is possible.
3084194	3085114	Yeah, Super Garrus Ball.
3085715	3086155	Guys.
3086675	3087515	Mega Man Soccer.
3087936	3089556	You know, even I think the joke is getting old.
3090737	3091297	Which is funny.
3091397	3095159	We actually, that's when we were cataloging our games, I completely forgot that we had Mega Man Soccer.
3095419	3106485	I don't know if you noticed on Twitter, someone was saying that they, oh, was it like a Mass Effect spoof of, was it a Gangnam Style or something like that?
3106505	3106685	Yeah.
3107595	3111591	Yeah, what was that wallpaper that everyone's been, their phone wallpaper now?
3112378	3114019	No, no, it wasn't that.
3114099	3119401	I was replying to someone's tweet, and it was about something that had to do with Mass Effect.
3119881	3129925	Like, oh, I'm surprised there hasn't been a... You guys should do a Mass Effect... Oh, it was like, you guys should do a Mass Effect parody song to Gangnam Style or something like that.
3129945	3134887	And I was like, I'm sure someone's already done that to Mass Effect.
3135028	3138809	And sure enough, they had a Mass Effect Gangnam Style.
3138829	3140810	I think it was like Garrus Style or something like that.
3141534	3147477	There is this wallpaper for phone circulating that's Garrus and Kaden.
3147497	3149078	Yeah, it's Garrus style.
3150059	3150979	It's just a still.
3152820	3156962	Yeah, I'm kind of spent on Gangnam Style after the pistachio commercial.
3159544	3161985	Wait a minute, were you watching a football game on TV?
3162025	3162525	Yes, you were.
3162565	3163306	You wouldn't have seen that.
3164146	3165227	No.
3165647	3166047	Objection!
3167188	3167348	Hulu.
3167368	3167528	Hulu.
3168254	3169555	Oh, fine.
3170515	3172135	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
3172156	3172976	Girl, don't even.
3174216	3174877	Oh, I will.
3175897	3183160	Well, there is a developer called Ack Studios, A-C-K-K, which makes me think of Bill the Cat now.
3184120	3185901	They've put out an announcement.
3185921	3190442	They're working on a 3D RPG that is inspired by Earthbound and The World Ends With You.
3190882	3192323	It's going to be on the Wii U eShop.
3192543	3194544	It's codename is Project Y2K.
3194944	3196965	Aren't they like 13 years too late for that name?
3198746	3211616	But there is a teaser up for it and basically they're saying that basically right now it's concept art, finalized script and storyline, and graphics and gameplay engine.
3213117	3215399	I forgot this story was on our show roll tonight.
3215459	3216320	What did I just say?
3216580	3218822	What did I just say about indies and the Wii U?
3221615	3223436	It could make for a very interesting marriage.
3223456	3224057	That's all I'm saying.
3224997	3227678	If Nintendo finally actually puts its stock in this.
3227698	3231880	Isn't it more like Wii U leaving one mistress for another?
3232020	3233901	Well, it would be quite the change for Nintendo.
3233941	3239003	Because remember, three years ago, fans had to start a letter-writing campaign.
3239483	3252616	to get games like Xenoblade, which should have been an obvious put that out here in the States, please, and Last Story, which has done well for XSEED, and now Pandora's Tower.
3252916	3259082	Maybe Nintendo finally could be doing this turnaround where they're like, maybe gamers here want this shit.
3259202	3260583	This could be a niche for us.
3260763	3262665	So they're changing their polygamy for a harem.
3263566	3264567	However you want to phrase it.
3265583	3266843	I'm just trying to think of a good analogy.
3268124	3268884	I want to hear him.
3269984	3270904	Who doesn't want to hear him?
3272085	3273365	Except you'd have to pay for all of this.
3273445	3273785	Never mind.
3277106	3277526	All right.
3278006	3278787	Moving on then, I guess.
3279647	3279967	All right.
3280187	3280407	Let's see.
3280427	3282048	We've talked crap about Sony.
3282068	3283388	We've talked crap about Nintendo.
3283428	3284588	Who are we leaving out, Loki?
3284788	3286389	We're going to talk about Microsoft.
3288429	3294371	As we get close to E3, and I'm sure it's just not going to quit until they make their final announcements...
3295346	3299587	Let's talk about random Xbox next generation rumors.
3300067	3305508	So starting off, the next Xbox will always be online and will use Blu-ray.
3306289	3318972	Well, kind of a big duh with the Blu-ray because, you know, either it's going to be Blu-ray of their own proprietary format, obviously something that's going to be... But Microsoft can't use Blu-ray, Loki.
3318992	3321012	That's a Sony product.
3321092	3322673	That doesn't make any sense.
3323413	3324473	You're talking crazy.
3326372	3327333	They can totally do it.
3327413	3334497	I'm surprised actually they don't use HD DVD because that's technology that they have access to and no one's using it for anything.
3334917	3346385	Sony was also one part of Blu-ray and I also want to remind everybody Microsoft kind of sucked some dick to get Final Fantasy XI on its console early on which had this whole Play Online front end.
3346685	3347765	Who owns Play Online?
3349306	3350147	I'm dropping the mic now.
3351894	3364643	Anyways, so yeah, there's rumors going around that it's supposed to be always online, which I guess is supposed to somehow tie in with maybe, I don't know, the way used games work?
3364783	3373128	I mean, some way to, I guess, cut into the second-hand game market by authenticating your games or something?
3373149	3373789	I don't really know.
3374089	3379553	There's no real specifics on that, on why that's even an important fact on there.
3380133	3402357	the other one is of course that there's going to have some sort of they say natural speech detection and speech attacks which I know they've been trying to do that kind of crap with the Kinect and I always think it's very like useless I mean just like oh I plug in the Kinect and Kinect I want you to do this you know or Kinect yeah but you have functional hands
3403653	3415438	I understand that, but I'm saying that they're trying to improve on this front right here, and to play devil's advocate, that's really only benefiting a small percentage of their market base.
3415878	3416759	I'm talking about as far as...
3419150	3425552	I don't really know how much further they're going to go with this, how this is going to play into the next-gen console.
3427212	3434014	I believe this is actually... Even though this is all rumors and we should take it with a grain of salt, I believe this part, the text-to-speech part, is absolutely true.
3434394	3438356	And I think the proof is in something that's actually going on in the 360 right now.
3438756	3446018	There's in the Kinect channel, or whatever it is, you go into the Kinect thing, there's an app you can download that is nothing but...
3447078	3448780	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3468715	3474060	They're trying to collect different accents and the way people talk through this channel.
3474320	3479805	They're trying to collect all this information, which is really weird when you consider, well, they've already implemented a lot of this.
3480125	3482087	So they're gearing for something else.
3482548	3485430	So I think the proof is there that this is happening.
3485450	3491976	They're trying to get it more user-friendly instead of saying, like, Xbox, play DVD, or play...
3493497	3499680	Xbox Search, X-Files, Play, where can I find the X-Files?
3499980	3501581	Or where can I watch X-Files?
3501601	3502601	You should talk like GLaDOS.
3503462	3511265	I would believe that they're going to show a video or something of the new Xbox where somebody walks in as they're getting home from work.
3511625	3518708	Hanging up their jacket or whatever and somebody's walking in going, Xbox, play last night's episode of The Walking Dead.
3519248	3525611	And the Xbox will just magically turn on and maybe it powers on your TV too or something, I don't know, through an infrared communication.
3525971	3526811	And then there it goes.
3526871	3528212	It starts playing The Walking Dead.
3528352	3530873	And so they're going to – that will be like a thing.
3531033	3545730	Oh, and I hope that we get another one of those stupid demonstrations where they're saying in front of the Kinect, like, oh, I'm virtually trying on outfits, or, oh, I'm going to scan in my skateboard logo or whatever so it can appear on my object in-game.
3546090	3550013	Oh, wait, all that shit that they promised us for the Kinect and never fucking came through with?
3550513	3560319	I guess, you know, getting a vague color for my car, which, by the way, with that fucked up camera was always like a whitish-pinkish color, no matter what the lighting in the room.
3561139	3562480	I guess that's much better.
3562560	3572046	Oh, by the way, the whole internet connection thing was, of course, supposed to be that whole, oh, it's not going to play used games because it's going to be always connected to the internet and it's going to be tied in.
3572086	3573207	Basically, they're saying, like, you...
3573687	3577371	Have a one-time code you use and that's it.
3577771	3579814	And then your disk is useless, I guess.
3581335	3582116	It doesn't make any sense.
3582276	3583077	It's not going to happen.
3583698	3592827	I mean, once again, like I said, you're not being forced to buy a new console and they're not going to cut out... I mean, seriously, if they cut out GameStop, who's going to sell their console?
3592987	3596111	Yes, I understand there's other retailers out there that sell consoles, but...
3597651	3599354	They all want to sell used games too.
3599374	3602598	But those GameStops aren't going out of business because those guys aren't selling consoles.
3602698	3604261	All they're saying is, hey, you know what?
3604701	3606003	You should buy a PS4 instead.
3606864	3607004	Why?
3607044	3608026	Because it plays better games.
3608647	3610830	Oh, and because you can sell your games back.
3611741	3613003	Thanks for watching!
3631185	3635788	But it was talking about a lot of things that really didn't happen until more recently.
3637149	3644854	So I think that it's not necessarily that it is going to do all this, that they want it to do all this, and it will eventually do all that.
3644894	3646736	You can't expect instant gratification.
3647656	3649137	Oh, we're going to have all this.
3649257	3650438	Well, it's going to happen right away.
3650718	3651539	No, it's not.
3651859	3657243	You have to keep in mind what happens in reality and keep on top of the technology.
3658928	3662090	And so help me keep Peter Molyneux out of E3.
3662950	3666011	I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on for a minute and just do a what if.
3666132	3681879	I don't really think this, but I think it's worth going down an avenue exploring here for a little bit because like you say, Loki, if the Xbox doesn't play used games and the PlayStation 4 does, then Microsoft might as well seal its own fate right now because they won't be sold in GameStop.
3682039	3687142	But what if, tinfoil hat, what if Sony and Microsoft are in cahoots
3687722	3694407	We've heard about the rumors about the trademark or whatever that the Sony discs would be tied to the console.
3694427	3696529	So we've had this rumor about Sony already.
3697069	3710159	What if Sony and Microsoft have had secret meetings and it's not unheard of that competitors will have meetings about mutually beneficial topics because maybe EA brought them both to the table or somebody else, okay?
3710499	3714842	So what if they have both decided that used games will not be playable on the consoles?
3715322	3716023	Then what happens?
3716542	3716722	and so on.
3740231	3740732	I understand that.
3740752	3746520	Let's say you're on a tight budget and you need to trade in those old games to make up the money to buy the new games.
3747501	3750625	Okay, so you can't do that anymore because that option's gone.
3750706	3751406	So what are you going to do?
3752668	3756413	You're going to have to train yourself to now wait six months for them to drop the price of the game.
3757406	3757806	DarkSakura.com
3779437	3784498	Well, in my whole little tinfoil hat scenario, I agree now with Ross UT in our chatroom.
3784818	3786939	Nintendo would be the only winner in that pact.
3787479	3796102	Absolutely go back to what I said at the beginning of the show where Nintendo can dig themselves out of this hole if Sony and Microsoft fuck themselves, and this would be one way to do it.
3797042	3799482	Now, I'm going to take the tinfoil hat off, put it on the table.
3799783	3800663	Here's what I really think.
3801483	3808666	I don't necessarily think these rumors are false, just like I don't think the rumors about the PlayStation 4 disk protection or whatever is false.
3809086	3812607	However, Microsoft's had a real problem with dev kits.
3813007	3814688	And where do most of these rumors start?
3814728	3817229	They start from disgruntled devs and so forth.
3817549	3819790	Loki, did you not buy a dev kit on eBay?
3820590	3821591	Not eBay, but yeah.
3821871	3822151	Okay.
3822511	3823632	Now, here's the thing.
3823772	3826233	I don't think Microsoft really wants you to have one of those.
3826293	3830695	And it seems to me like a lot of that shit's been floating out there randomly where anybody could get it.
3831076	3841361	So my thought is maybe the dev kits always require you to be online and the dev kits will always be reading or talking to Microsoft or what have you.
3841661	3855308	to make sure that these games don't leak early because what Microsoft's really trying to combat is not the used game market but day zero piracy because that is what hurts the most is the piracy that gets out there before the game even goes on sale.
3855328	3859811	You mean like Halo 4 being leaked four weeks early, two weeks early?
3860031	3862472	Ding, ding, ding, absolutely, Loki.
3862672	3863873	That is absolutely it.
3863953	3870817	And I would even say it would be realistic to see that perhaps a game goes on sale digitally
3871357	3876718	Just a couple days before it goes on sale in tangible form, not much to GameStop chagrin and so forth.
3877078	3882460	That's a direction I could see where they go down the line again, and it is all about combating piracy.
3884520	3888021	That I would see and would understand if that's what they're doing.
3888041	3894403	And to require an online-only console, it's just not going to happen anyways because not everyone has internet.
3894443	3899624	I mean, even now, our internet, especially high-speed internet, not everyone has high-speed internet.
3900824	3902766	Or has reliable high-speed internet.
3903286	3905047	I mean, there's a lot of things that could go wrong.
3907309	3912913	27% of Xboxes never online, according to an Ars Technica article that cited a 2010 study.
3913273	3917696	Granted, in three years a lot can happen, but it's got to be above 10%, which is a number that can't be ignored.
3921081	3928767	Yeah, so, I mean, and let's just say, now I understand that some of those may have gone online at some point, but does it mean that they're always online?
3928807	3937474	Like, I know, like, sometimes my Xbox doesn't have an internet connection, depending on where I'm using it and stuff, and that would kind of suck that, oh, I can't play a game on this because...
3939179	3940681	Because of some reason, I don't know.
3941122	3952776	If they really want to combat piracy or something, what they could do, if you're going to do a one-time code thing, is have it like a PC game, like I have my Grand Theft Auto games and stuff, where I can revoke that code at some point.
3952836	3956161	Say I want to trade it in or whatever, and I revoke that code, and then...
3956681	3961103	That way, okay, you don't have that code, you can't really play this game on the system.
3962303	3963364	That could be one way to do it.
3964144	3969146	So then they'd be trying to hose the rental market, because the rental market wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of that one.
3969486	3972007	Yeah, but they don't really care about the rental market.
3972187	3972667	Interesting.
3974688	3975208	Interesting.
3975388	3979010	Alright, well, we will see in the coming months.
3979250	3981791	And if it all sucks, if all the consoles suck, there's always Steam.
3982031	3984472	And Steam's going to have those same games that are on consoles.
3985032	3989974	I mean, obviously not the Microsoft first party or Sony first party, but you're going to have a lot of those multi-platform games.
3990114	3998237	By the way, don't expect Sony or Microsoft to be very forthcoming about this in their press conferences or whatever Sony's doing on February 20th.
3998897	4007552	These questions will have to be asked point blank and they will be asked by journalists at E3 and that is where the answer will be found is when those interviews come out.
4007993	4008554	We shall see.
4010575	4017762	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, error.
4018563	4022606	Meanwhile, let's talk about somebody else that's in some trouble right now, Zynga.
4023367	4026971	Oh boy, it's just been bad news after bad news after bad news.
4027151	4029353	And, you know, we've had a lot of financial reports lately.
4029993	4051474	and apparently another one came out here Zynga did pretty bad in 2012 they posted a 209.4 million dollar loss that's not as bad as 2011 when it was a 404.3 million dollar loss but keep in mind they've closed some places since then they've had to make some cutbacks
4054217	4060683	I don't know if they're going to be shutting down other games or what, or what the future holds, but they're still losing money.
4061143	4062464	Maybe the Facebook thing is over.
4064566	4076257	I guess maybe not over, but it's not the huge thing that people once thought it was, which again, I would caution Sony and Microsoft in their whole trying to capture that market and so forth.
4076637	4077998	Look at what's happening to Zynga.
4078378	4079540	It's kind of a fad.
4080260	4081762	Don't marry Facebook.
4082283	4083324	It's only going to get ugly.
4085067	4086028	You can't play catch-up.
4086048	4088451	You just have to come up with something new.
4091636	4094700	Why marry Facebook when you can make your own Facebook?
4095999	4111848	and I have a hard time believing Microsoft doesn't want to make their own maybe not necessarily like you know the exact same thing that Facebook does but what if they could take some of the parts of Facebook and kind of make Xbox Live a new version of that I don't know
4115189	4121218	I could see where they maybe want to make their own thing as opposed to just trying to marry something that's already out there.
4121599	4123822	But then again, it didn't work so well for Apple, so I don't know.
4123842	4126446	We here at Microsoft are now going to partner with the new MySpace.
4128898	4135825	Well, the new Myspace, as funny as that joke is to make, the new Myspace is really about music and not so much games or anything else.
4135865	4139629	It's really about music and artistry because that's kind of what Myspace turned into when everybody left it.
4140650	4143133	It was all artists trying to promote themselves.
4143193	4144594	It's kind of like they were all each other's friends.
4145735	4147477	Myspace now is trying to compete with Pitchfork.
4148294	4149035	and Pinterest.
4149575	4151576	But it's like a Pinterest of music is what it is.
4151836	4153217	It's a pin fork.
4153677	4161582	I was lucky enough to get invited to the thing as in preview or whatever and it looked nice but there was nothing there for me.
4161942	4167446	I was honestly only there to see how I could pimp Orange Lounge Radio and you know the podcast stuff I do like you know what's in it for me.
4168607	4169207	Couldn't find it.
4171588	4173810	So not really on it.
4174970	4175971	Anyhow let's move on.
4176812	4177292	Dark Saga.
4178283	4180955	Well, we know of That Game Company, right?
4181699	4183145	Sure, Flower, Journey.
4183780	4185861	Well, this is just a little interesting.
4186642	4191565	More put it in here, yeah, just for the interest side of it and to help people keep things in perspective.
4192265	4195787	When Journey shipped, they were bankrupt.
4196707	4198529	They could not pay their employees.
4199369	4205993	They really just went ahead and shipped out the game with a prayer that they wouldn't lose more.
4206773	4211376	And as it turned out, that's put them back up in the top and kept them alive.
4211916	4225705	So it's just, you know, you think of all these companies that are pretty much, we've been saying sinking ship, sinking ship, but really all it takes is that one shining, you know, gemstone out there that's gonna, you know, bring them back.
4226145	4228367	Just thought this would be a good one for perspective.
4229059	4230920	You never know what's going to happen.
4258578	4259479	You never know what's going to happen.
4259739	4261140	Just don't make shit and you'll be okay.
4261980	4264482	Some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4264542	4269026	Going to the last story a little bit, Technist wants to clarify, Microsoft already has a deal with Facebook.
4269366	4272348	That's why you see Bing Maps and Bing Translate on Facebook.
4273789	4279373	I don't know what the limit of exclusivity it would be to that.
4279393	4281375	I know it's a hard word to pronounce, isn't it?
4281835	4282615	Exclusiveness.
4282816	4283336	Exclusiveness.
4283796	4284436	Exclusity?
4285737	4289058	That still doesn't stop Microsoft necessarily doing their own thing.
4289338	4290599	What does Facebook get out of it?
4290659	4292299	Maybe the Skype integration thing?
4292319	4297441	Because that was something they were really hyping up for their Messenger and chat was their Skype.
4297762	4298762	So yeah, I guess you're right.
4298822	4301063	Microsoft and Facebook already have some ties.
4301503	4309426	Doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't do their own thing, or could Sony, although based on history, I don't think Sony would pull it off very well.
4309486	4310026	But you never know.
4310086	4310906	I might be surprised.
4310966	4314147	Sony might have bought a company that fell off my radar that could do it.
4314707	4315948	So who knows?
4317068	4319449	I am also just totally like...
4320649	4323110	Mass hypothesizing, making shit up.
4323150	4326470	But who wouldn't want to get like a Facebook for gamers?
4327330	4333172	I mean, that would seem like... And I think there are some startups out there kind of trying to capitalize on that a bit.
4333192	4335332	But nobody's really struck gold with that idea yet.
4335352	4339173	I wouldn't believe that the publishers themselves aren't trying to do that a little bit.
4339193	4339893	Look at Miiverse.
4340773	4342694	Kind of moving that direction a little bit.
4343234	4344674	As much as Nintendo can.
4346343	4346843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4371089	4372250	I thought that was just like a fad.
4372510	4373390	They were just trying.
4374871	4375811	Well, people buy it.
4375951	4381054	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on 3DS this week.
4381174	4384275	Omerta, City of Gangsters on Xbox 360.
4387297	4388938	And I want to say that I think that's it.
4389438	4391159	Because there wasn't that much coming out this week.
4397022	4409346	I guess technically within the week, next Sunday they're going to be having the Zombie U Nintendo Wii U 32GB Deluxe set.
4409506	4413867	It's going to be a Zombie U and a digital copy of Nintendo Land.
4413887	4416948	So you're not going to have much of that hard drive left over.
4418228	4421769	I like how Ubisoft waited for that to go to the factory before they fucked Nintendo.
4421829	4421989	No.
4424102	4424542	Anyhow.
4424963	4426103	Yeah, hey, let's make this deal.
4426363	4427504	I know, let's make this deal.
4428965	4430746	Oh, and fuck you, huh?
4430846	4432466	I know, that's business.
4432887	4433527	That is business.
4434728	4436889	Going to Japan, checking out the Japanese releases.
4436989	4450536	On Valentine's Day, which happens to be release day in Japan, PlayStation 3, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, price drops for Dragon's Dogma and Lollipop Chainsaw because Lollipop Chainsaw is getting the Valentine's edition on February 14th.
4450556	4452257	Even though this is a steaming, festering pile of poo?
4452927	4454368	Yes, even though it's a steaming fest.
4455288	4456028	That's an opinion.
4456828	4458049	Lots of stuff on the Xbox 360.
4458709	4459669	Who would have thought I said that?
4459689	4461570	Of course, most of this is price reductions.
4462230	4471173	Lollipop Chainsaw, Kinect Star Wars, Gears of War 3, Disneyland Adventures, Forza 4, Dragon's Dogma, Dance Central 2, all of those getting price reductions this week in Japan.
4472894	4482679	And as far as new stuff goes, Aliens, Colonel Marines, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, and Ginga Force come out this week in Japan.
4482719	4483599	Those are all new things.
4483919	4484940	You know what?
4485580	4488181	About that Aliens, Colonial Marines, I actually want that game.
4488582	4488782	Yeah?
4488822	4489182	Why's that?
4489542	4492524	Because, and God, why can I never remember his damn name?
4492844	4495305	The guy who played Bishop is reprising his role.
4495685	4496226	Oh, that's cool.
4496346	4497566	But you know who else he voiced?
4498347	4498967	Admiral Hackett.
4499780	4500341	Of course.
4500681	4501101	Oh, you.
4501701	4502002	Oh, you.
4502662	4512008	PlayStation Vita in Japan this week gets Sakura So No Pet Na Kanojo in regular and limited editions, and Silent Hill Book of Memories gets its Japanese release.
4512108	4512848	Girls Pets?
4513128	4513969	Just in time.
4514009	4515030	Better than Girls Butts.
4515750	4520373	Just in time for Valentine's Day Silent Hill game on the Vita.
4521354	4527918	Absolutely nothing on the Wii U, but Tank Tank Tank is out in the near future, although I thought that was going free-to-play or something was happening.
4528658	4528938	I don't know.
4528978	4530699	It's on my list for some reason for next week.
4530819	4538182	They have like a demo or something that's coming out that you can unlock parts of the demo or something if you pay money.
4538262	4538562	I don't know.
4538602	4540143	It's weird.
4540303	4549887	On the 3DS this week, Marugo 3D Nanami to Ishiho Nagakubo English Josatsu no Kotsu Riron Hen.
4550468	4551548	What the hell is that?
4551708	4552188	I don't know.
4552328	4556990	It's got a cute anime girl though because you know that's everything.
4558251	4558571	That's it.
4558611	4559771	That's the one screenshot I have.
4560232	4561352	That could just be the box art.
4561372	4562532	The game probably has nothing to do with that.
4563933	4567133	So I don't know what that is, but it's not any big series.
4567834	4571254	Quickly checking to see if they're still putting stuff out on the PSP.
4571314	4571835	They are.
4571995	4573595	PSP getting some releases this week.
4573935	4577596	Battle Robot Tamashi from Bandai Namco this week on the PSP.
4579196	4581097	Dark Sakura, how about the other side of the Atlantic?
4582626	4584747	As soon as I can make my iPad go there.
4586608	4590189	We only have on the 12th, we have Aliens Colonial Marines.
4592310	4596952	And to answer your earlier question about the game, courtesy of Tigerclaw, Lance Henriksen.
4596972	4597452	That's it.
4597852	4601934	I knew it was some sort of Icelandic sounding name.
4603774	4604835	Was he a Stargate guy?
4605155	4606315	Why do I associate him with Stargate?
4606355	4607976	Wasn't he in Atlantis?
4608835	4610256	I associate him with Stargate for some reason.
4610276	4615559	I stopped watching Stargate after season 8, so... There's been a fuck ton of Stargate, too.
4615599	4618660	If you haven't been following... Just the SG-1 series.
4618840	4626384	If you haven't been following Stargate since the original movie that the guy who made Independence Day did all those years ago, there's been a fuck ton of Stargate that's been happening.
4626504	4627465	Just so you know.
4628125	4630546	You know what... But no MMO, frown.
4631647	4632128	You know what?
4632548	4637092	Becky and I used to marathon SG-1 because I have all those box sets I'm probably going to sell.
4637933	4639855	And we both decided that season 4 sucks.
4641156	4642658	I had an ex that was really into Stargate.
4642698	4643258	It's a good show.
4643679	4644339	I'm not going to hate it.
4644459	4645240	Season 7 was good.
4646001	4649845	Alright, a few more news stories for you guys then we'll get into the classic game of the week.
4649945	4650165	Loki.
4650185	4650265	Loki.
4651565	4658988	Alright, so let's talk about the independent console that's coming out, OUYA!
4659448	4670892	OUYA is going to be making its way out for Kickstarter backers in March, but if you didn't get in on that action, then you can actually pick one up at retail.
4670972	4676474	It's going to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and the store that's into everything electronics nowadays.
4677094	4683018	GameStop, you can buy one for $99 there or an extra controller for $49.99.
4684379	4684980	Think about it.
4685100	4694366	If the new Xbox doesn't play used games, there will be more Ouya merchandise at GameStop than there will be Xbox Lube or 720 or whatever they call it.
4696888	4699829	Yeah, they're going to really have to grease you up to get you to buy one of those.
4702250	4710835	And then to go with that, of course, they're saying that, yeah, you may buy an Ouya this year, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be an Ouya 2 next year or an Ouya 3 the year after that.
4710915	4713056	In fact, they're planning on doing a new one each year.
4713596	4715377	And then, of course, they've partnered up with Double Fine and...
4738347	4738948	Well, let's see here.
4739528	4743149	Paul Bettner, who is the creator of Words With Friends.
4743789	4746970	And they're going to be bringing The Cave and Reds to OUYA.
4748111	4748471	I guess.
4748931	4750232	Those are pretty big games.
4750792	4751712	I've never heard of Reds.
4752392	4754653	But The Cave, I'm well aware of, because that just came out.
4755533	4755854	And then...
4758123	4768445	Last but not least, this month, of course, to go along with the whole Kickstarter backers getting their consoles next month, they are going through the approval process right now.
4768885	4770165	And I'm a little disappointed.
4770345	4773886	I mean, two-thirds of this I'm okay with.
4773986	4783128	They're basically looking at games being submitted to them, and they're checking for intellectual property infringement, malware, and excessive pornography.
4783428	4785729	I'm glad that they added excessive in there.
4785809	4787830	So a little, a little titty's okay.
4787930	4789410	A little pornography is alright.
4789430	4793031	So note to OUYA developers, a little titty's okay.
4793932	4795993	I still think there should be excessive pornography.
4796053	4799634	I mean, hell, that should be the title of a game, Excessive Pornography, the game.
4800554	4801414	That would be awesome.
4802775	4806196	Is that, dare I say, is that an OLR dream game, Excessive Pornography?
4806216	4807877	Excessive Pornography, that's the internet, okay.
4809077	4809918	That's just the internet.
4810078	4811300	That's everybody's dream game.
4811320	4812421	That's not an OLR dream game.
4813402	4814683	That's the internet's dream game.
4815724	4821109	The excessive pornography featuring random pictures of low cats for no reason.
4821610	4822811	That's the internet right there.
4824152	4827796	But yeah, so they're supposed to be doing that.
4828076	4831099	And they said the process should begin middle or the end of this month.
4831299	4831780	And of course...
4833446	4834647	I don't know.
4834727	4835128	We'll see.
4835368	4840772	At least I know I have one game spoken for when that comes out.
4842934	4847678	Going to the chat, some strong opinions about the whole yearly upgrades of the Ouya.
4848239	4854824	Ranma in chat says, a new Ouya each year is suicide, to which a lot of people jumped in and said iPhone, iPad.
4854985	4857347	I even said the Nintendo DS called and said you're wrong.
4858768	4859589	New Ouya every year.
4859609	4861271	Is that suicide to admit that this early?
4861451	4863033	Well, no, because here's the thing.
4864074	4870622	Remember, you may be buying this console right now and you're like, oh, they're going to have a new one next year.
4871002	4874026	But everything about this console is meant to be hacked.
4874567	4874767	So...
4875928	4876568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4892816	4893517	each time around.
4893617	4898979	So I don't really have a problem with that if that's going to be the way they're going to go about it because it's optional.
4899019	4901721	I mean, hell, you can hack this thing apart and play emulators on it.
4902541	4905582	What the hell do you need a quad core processor for that shit?
4905783	4906663	I mean, you don't.
4908084	4909965	Comment from RossDLUT in our chat room.
4910385	4911785	The OUYA is an open platform.
4911885	4913886	We're going to see excessive porn on it anyway.
4914427	4914987	Good point.
4915467	4917388	It has access to the internet.
4917728	4918929	Will it have a web browser?
4920416	4921777	Is it connected to the internet?
4921897	4923337	Excessive porn for all!
4923437	4923958	Yay!
4924478	4932562	That is one thing we can look forward to with an always connected Xbox system, is it's always going to have access to pornography on the internet.
4932902	4933462	Xbox!
4933942	4934363	Tits!
4937204	4937884	Can you imagine?
4938285	4939425	Can you imagine?
4939445	4941826	It shows me Britney Spears' greatest hits.
4942386	4943207	That's not what I said!
4944284	4949608	You know, Xbox, pornography, Illumina Room, just like boobs flying at you at every angle.
4949628	4952449	It's like, yeah, this is next gen.
4953150	4960575	Like seriously, okay, if Microsoft could come out at E3 and show that as the demo and then just slip in there, by the way, it won't play used games, but it will totally show you tits.
4960975	4962496	Then people will be like, forgiven.
4962756	4963477	You're forgiven.
4964377	4965738	Everything negative we said about the used games thing.
4965758	4967359	It's not going to play used games, but it can do this.
4968680	4969741	It's like, whoa.
4975264	4976925	Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.
4980246	4981347	DarkSakura, would you buy one?
4981527	4987509	If Illumaroom would not play used games, would it show you all the boobies you could dream of?
4989630	4990390	I'm thinking about it.
4990611	4993832	Katy Perry, can you get up in your face and be knocking that back and forth?
4993872	4997533	That picture of Katy Perry, all over your walls, everywhere.
4999334	5000715	Oh no, that's pretty hard to say no to, Rob.
5002259	5004822	and Sigma the Luma Room because it's all going to be interactive too.
5004842	5006984	You can walk up into that and just like smack.
5009186	5011188	Just put your face all up in it.
5014231	5015932	Achievement unlocked.
5015992	5017294	No one can resist to motorboat.
5020196	5021256	It's like Cobra Triangle 2.
5021916	5022196	All right.
5024097	5025377	One more story for you guys.
5026618	5030859	Back when gaming was so simple, a retro gaming story for you guys.
5030899	5037980	Before we were picturing a Luma Room projecting boobies all over the walls, you didn't have this in these classic games.
5038320	5041241	But this is still pretty cool, a way to make it modern.
5041301	5042961	It's the Capcom Arcade Cabinet.
5043001	5045442	We've been talking about this game for a little bit on the show.
5045562	5047342	Finally, the details coming out about this game.
5047382	5049823	It's going to come out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
5050303	5051664	on February 19th.
5052024	5054644	A teaser trailer went out this week showing the games that will be in it.
5055085	5067769	Black Tiger, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins, Legendary Wings, Commando, Avengers Section Z, and I am really excited about this, Pirate Ship Higemaru is coming out as well.
5067869	5068589	I love that game.
5068609	5069689	It's a fun little puzzler.
5070710	5071850	Reminds me a lot of like Pango.
5072250	5074091	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5088279	5092140	In the trailer, it says that you can play these games online with friends.
5092780	5099522	So finally, somebody getting the retro thing right and making it so that I can play the games online across the internets.
5100623	5101743	Pretty excited about this.
5102183	5105044	I hope the games play well, but it sounds pretty cool.
5105744	5110465	DarkSakura, would this be something you're interested in at all, or no, because you kind of already have the retro stuff?
5110666	5113466	Yeah, I mean, honestly, all those games that you listed are games that we own.
5114247	5114487	So...
5116087	5118868	It's cool though, it's cool for people who don't already have this stuff, yeah.
5119089	5121089	Yeah, the modernization, being able to play online.
5121210	5122350	Yeah, that sounds fun.
5122930	5127132	Casual mode, I think, was advertised too, maybe to make the arcade games a little easier.
5127473	5130094	Maybe so that you can actually beat Ghosts and Goblins, maybe?
5130214	5131615	I'm assuming that's what that means.
5131655	5133075	Well, Dan can beat it.
5133655	5136697	Well, Dan's a freak, and I mean that in the most loving way possible.
5137577	5140401	Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week
5149508	5152889	Which I believe is also a Capcom game, although not one that's been announced.
5153329	5154129	Yes, it is.
5154209	5155369	Oh, it's like you knew.
5156029	5159050	But you ruined how I wanted to introduce it, though.
5159070	5159410	Oh, I'm sorry.
5159430	5164071	Because I wanted you to play the YouTube clip so that you could get the... Well, I gave a hint.
5164111	5164971	I didn't tell you the game.
5164991	5167252	All right, well, play the little opening start on YouTube.
5167332	5170532	And it's not in the Capcom Hits collection, I'll tell you that much.
5170572	5170953	Here we go.
5171693	5174253	Here is a clip from this week's Classic Game of the Week.
5176594	5177174	Mm-hmm.
5179094	5179555	I know, right?
5179895	5180615	LOL Internet.
5181576	5182796	I don't know if... There we go.
5186117	5187338	Yeah.
5187398	5189339	We're getting a little bit of buffering today.
5189499	5190019	I'm sorry.
5190059	5191660	I should have loaded this in advance.
5191740	5193501	I didn't.
5193621	5196802	It's because I missed the cue sound.
5199223	5199543	Anyway.
5200064	5200344	Here it is.
5200404	5200764	It's coming up.
5204716	5206397	That should be enough for people to get what the game is.
5206578	5207698	Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?
5207778	5215304	It's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, also known in the US as Super Pocket Fighter 2 Turbo.
5218847	5222850	Also known as, we had all these art assets from Puzzle Fighter, we needed to make another game out of it.
5225205	5227506	Well, that actually didn't... I think this came out around the same time.
5227526	5228086	It came out in 97.
5228847	5239231	It was a CPS2 arcade machine, and it came out on the PlayStation, which kept the Pocket Fighter title for the American and European release.
5239271	5242652	It came out on the WonderSwan, the Sega Saturn, and the PS2.
5242672	5244473	It was part of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
5245733	5251895	It's basically got all these characters in Super Deformed and they beat the crap out of each other using very cutesy attacks.
5253075	5262838	It also has characters from Street Fighter Alpha, Dark Stalker, Street Fighter 3, and from Red Earth.
5263918	5266959	That game is totally on my list of CPS3 games that I want to play.
5267780	5269040	I've never gotten to play a copy of that.
5269840	5276565	Um, it also has just a whole ton of different characters, um, that make appearances throughout the game.
5276585	5277766	You know, just little cameos.
5278447	5284431	So basically it's standard fighting, um, and they have power-ups that match, um, their, um...
5285832	5289195	The characters that actually came from Red Earth, that system.
5289816	5300124	And then the little orbs that you can catch that are thrown as your opponent to basically mimic the elemental hits in Darkstalkers.
5300705	5306249	So you can turn people to stone, you can freeze them, and then you start with one of each of those.
5306710	5306790	Um...
5308365	5310286	You have two bars and three sub-bars.
5310446	5312388	You have a life bar and a super bar.
5313008	5318112	And then you have your mighty combo, which I always laughed at that.
5318472	5323075	Your sub-bars are basically your level of your special moves.
5323475	5327418	And your levels correspond to different colors.
5327698	5331661	So some people have extra, some don't.
5332121	5334923	But basically every time you hit a character, gems pop out.
5339066	5341307	to, uh, power up.
5342649	5344430	So, that's where it gets Jump Fighter from.
5345151	5347533	And basically, four buttons punch, kick, special, taunt.
5348774	5350875	Which taunt is, of course, the best thing ever.
5352497	5353017	So, um...
5354278	5376593	Anyway, you also have flash combos or costume combos where if you press a combination of punch or kick buttons after striking the opponent with a punch button, then they actually will change into different costumes during the sequence, except for you, and has a very different strong attack at the end.
5377794	5378634	Here's some examples.
5378694	5381276	Chun-Li turns into Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.
5381796	5382997	Felicia turns into Mega Man.
5385241	5389011	And I remember Ibuki had her little schoolgirl outfit and all of that.
5390436	5400140	So the characters in the game, you have Ryu, you have Ken, you have Zangief, you have Chun-Li, you have Sakura, and Ibuki, all from the Street Fighter series.
5400780	5405362	You have Morigen, Sienko, or Lele as she was in Japan, and Felicia.
5405723	5407283	And then you have Tessa.
5408684	5414886	In Japan she was Tabasa, which I think was supposed to be like Tabitha, but why didn't they just call her Tabitha over here?
5415087	5415407	Don't know.
5417509	5432830	and she's the only Red Earth character in the game you also have secret characters you have Gouki or Akuma and he's very powerful and then you have Dan and basically his story is probably the most hilarious one
5433351	5438074	He's looking for students to start a school, so he's trying to get Sakura to be his student.
5438814	5448399	But she left the school after three days and wrote him a letter saying that she's already mastered everything that he could teach her and that his moves are worthless in a fight.
5448419	5449780	She calls him a loser, and he cries.
5451561	5455022	I think all he knocks out are gems of the same color, I want to say.
5455543	5459004	Or maybe that's in Puzzle Fighter, when all he drops are red gems.
5459905	5460105	Anyway...
5463015	5465816	It is just a fun little game.
5465856	5472697	It's one of my favorite fighting games of all time, and it's just completely cracked out.
5472717	5476978	I don't know if I've played this game an awful lot.
5476998	5478018	I think I've played it like once.
5479038	5479378	Oh, I see.
5479418	5483959	There's the little part where she turned into Jill Valentine, and then, of course, the video buffered, but oh well.
5484279	5485299	Yeah, so that's the game.
5486059	5486339	Nice.
5486559	5490440	So there it is, your classic game of the week, Pocket Fighter, or...
5491311	5493073	which I've got two copies of.
5494575	5495916	On different systems, on different systems.
5495936	5497818	As part of your collection that you counted up this week.
5497838	5499180	But my favorite to play is on Saturn.
5500121	5500501	Alright.
5500761	5502483	Because it's awesome with the Saturn controller.
5503284	5504806	That's it.
5504946	5505647	Not that, sorry.
5506408	5509211	I was trying to load something else that's coming up later in the show.
5510171	5511872	Live radio, isn't it a blast?
5511912	5512172	All right.
5513092	5515474	We are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
5515514	5517114	We've got plenty more show to come.
5517655	5523397	The Fugle Question of the Week coming up when we get back, as well as some rapid-fire news and movie and gaming news.
5523417	5525958	And this one sounds like it could be pretty cool.
5526919	5530881	We'll see you when we get back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5530941	5531461	Don't go anywhere.
5537105	5544470	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 492nd episode in progress here as we go into the second half of the show.
5544930	5549293	February the 10th of 2013 and boy the internet's having some lulls tonight.
5549353	5558959	I don't know if it's the snowstorms back east or what but yeah we were having some problems playing off YouTube earlier and Twitter's all clogged up with crap on the Grammys.
5559280	5560660	Should I blame the Grammys for this?
5560861	5562682	I blame the Grammys for everything.
5562722	5565984	I see all these people posting status updates about the Grammys and I'm just like
5566144	5566944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5586055	5589618	They just released the whole show at once, so go watch all 10 episodes or whatever.
5589658	5597405	It kind of breaks the conventional weekly show, so how do you not spoil something that you could have just blown through in a weekend?
5597845	5598966	I don't know how you do it with movies.
5599787	5600467	I guess that's true.
5601348	5602589	It's like a really long movie.
5602769	5603610	It's a miniseries.
5603970	5606452	It's like a Lord of the Rings extended cut.
5608754	5609735	Exactly right.
5612111	5612411	All right.
5613872	5618415	Anyhow, let us move on with some rapid-fire news.
5619455	5620936	All right.
5621276	5621896	Let's see.
5623177	5626019	Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge.
5626359	5628180	Remember that Wii exclusive game?
5628920	5632002	Yeah, it's not a Wii exclusive anymore.
5632282	5636045	This is actually kind of interesting because you remember the Wii version was actually published by Nintendo.
5636425	5642309	However, they will be coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 April 2nd.
5642989	5645291	And it's being published, of course, by Tecmo Koei.
5647552	5648113	And yeah.
5648493	5650534	So they're going to have all the additional stuff in there.
5650614	5655958	I guess you can kind of think of it as like a Game of the Year edition, except your game didn't win Game of the Year.
5656738	5661321	Re-release of the cheaper version edition with extra stuff in it.
5662502	5667207	So, yeah, not so much of that exclusiveness anymore.
5670991	5680762	We may have a glimpse of one of the first next-gen games, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, which, I gotta be honest, looks a lot like Monster Hunter, but
5682045	5683046	What was it?
5683066	5683627	What was it?
5704176	5705056	Cyberpunk or whatever.
5705596	5708578	But apparently the game is supposed to be open world.
5708678	5718884	It's going to be, I guess, they say the world's going to be larger than Skyrim and larger than any of the environments featured in the first two Witcher games.
5720405	5721045	And it looks pretty.
5722746	5727369	I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the subtitle Wild Hunt, but
5729249	5729869	It could be a cool game.
5731030	5732350	And it's due out in 2014.
5732410	5738952	They say for PC and high-end platforms or next-gen consoles, obviously.
5740472	5741693	So, it's always an option.
5741873	5748595	And last but not least, one of the news announcements while we're out was Grand Theft Auto V was delayed to September.
5749295	5752496	Kind of something I alluded to, I think, the last time we talked, maybe.
5753256	5757638	I've had some people ask me on Twitter, Loki, so how are you doing with all this news?
5757658	5758398	How are you coping?
5758418	5758438	I...
5770422	5771003	Are you okay?
5771083	5771843	One day at a time.
5771863	5773324	Do you need one day at a time?
5773584	5781750	We honestly didn't know what we're going to do as far as like... Because it was kind of like, oh, you know, we'll play Modern Warfare 3 for a while.
5782031	5791197	And then, you know, by the time we're getting bored of it, we'll have Grand Theft Auto V. And then now it's delayed another, you know, potentially four months from what we were expecting.
5791217	5793619	And we're like, I don't know what we're going to do now.
5794059	5794580	It's just...
5797327	5797828	Thanks for watching!
5815988	5829976	basically to those of you who were seeing various conspiracy theories about there being some other ulterior motive for this delay rest assured they're all nonsense literally the only reason we delayed the release is because we want the game to be as good as it needs to be
5831577	5833880	Just throwing it out there, could it be too late?
5834441	5840989	Because sometimes when games come out too close to another system being launched, they get cannibalized a little bit.
5841169	5841309	No.
5842170	5843812	Grand Theft Auto V is too big for that?
5843832	5844593	No, it's too big for that.
5844633	5850020	I always kind of say that's why people missed Final Fantasy XII, is it kind of landed in a scenario like that, but...
5850080	5851301	Grand Theft Auto 6 on the next-gen consoles.
5877478	5880040	I can't even fathom what that would be like, but yes.
5880981	5881501	If they sell.
5907319	5916742	But there's some other actual classic games that are part of this, including Time Pilot, Asteroids, Centipede, and yes, Loki, Frogger.
5918063	5919543	A couple Intellivision games in there, too.
5919603	5921724	Shark Shark and Astro Smash, which I thought was interesting.
5921744	5923565	Do you have to wait in line to play those games?
5924685	5925225	Not on your vehicle.
5925245	5926206	Can I play on roller skates?
5926226	5926726	That's for sure.
5927386	5929027	If you want, in the privacy of your own home.
5929047	5932228	For the record, playing Frogger on roller skates is difficult.
5932248	5933168	Yeah.
5933911	5934752	You will not think it is.
5935092	5937695	Playing Spy Hunter on roller skates was awesome.
5937855	5941919	And yes, they did have a Spy Hunter machine at the roller rink when I was growing up.
5943100	5943421	Why?
5943661	5944101	I don't know.
5944121	5951569	The roller rink that I used to go to still had their Frogger when I went back like 10 years ago.
5952426	5955709	What if PlayStation Home is the next-gen console?
5955729	5958512	It's like, this is PlayStation Home.
5958552	5959233	It's in your home.
5959253	5960274	Okay, now you're trolling.
5961555	5962416	All right, next up.
5963277	5964358	Another rumor, folks.
5964438	5965879	We love our rumors, don't we?
5966840	5968042	This one's about Sonic.
5968762	5972546	And apparently the next Sonic game to be announced is supposed to be Sonic Adventure 3.
5973647	5976169	Sonic Adventure 3 sounds probable, doesn't it?
6001872	6004675	Who remembers a classic arcade game by Capcom called Gunsmoke?
6004695	6005696	Didn't I do it in a classic game?
6016221	6016561	Maybe.
6016601	6017102	I don't remember.
6017162	6017562	Hopefully.
6017682	6021866	Or as one of my favorite video review shows calls it, Gun.Smoke.
6021966	6022887	Yeah, Gun.Smoke.
6023027	6025389	Yeah, because not to be confused with the TV show Gun.Smoke.
6025429	6026390	It had nothing to do with that.
6026811	6034938	But Gun.Smoke had a freeware remake done of it, which I'm sure was not legal at all.
6035318	6037460	But, well, somebody did their own little remake.
6037861	6040443	They wanted to keep the NES port of the version intact.
6040803	6043546	They didn't want to rip the assets from the arcade game or whatever.
6044127	6047651	They played the original a whole bunch of times trying to make it just perfect.
6048011	6052156	And there's a whole little, again, here I go playing a YouTube, but hopefully this one will actually work.
6052196	6052897	Not bad.
6052937	6054539	Looks pretty spot on to me.
6054599	6056161	That's all I remember from the NES one.
6059480	6062662	Oh man, I love the boss that throws all the bombs and then he loses his pants.
6085405	6088607	So, was that your series, Rob?
6088807	6089028	Okay.
6089968	6100595	Well, Bethesda put out an announcement that the Rage, the official toolkit for Rage is out on Steam, and it's going to be 35 plus gigabytes.
6101456	6112903	Well, actually, no, it's out, but to quote John Carmack, he's saying, the toolkit release is not something that we consider consumer friendly, but it does let you get a good look inside the construction process.
6114184	6115165	So, pretty cool, huh?
6116886	6141200	Also, EA has zero intention of patching a loot exploit in Dead Space 3 Basically, it lets you pretty much farm for resources that would cost you currency and microtransactions And EA is saying, okay, go for it, we don't care The microtransactions are just convenience
6143511	6162079	and when I saw this, thank you Catastrophic Moggy for giving me this link when we had our lovely, for me, 3am chat but Farmville is going to have an animated series out done by Brett Ratner you know what else he's given us?
6163640	6168562	X-Men Last Stand, That Turd Rush Hour movies, I think were him Red Dragon
6170995	6176021	This sounds like terrible fan rumor stuff, so I hope that's what it is.
6176602	6185953	According to the Wall Street Journal, it will be produced by Ratner in association with 611 Media, a Canadian television company.
6187054	6188095	and producers.
6188215	6192838	Other producers are Kirk Shank, Charles Bishop and Nina Gelb.
6193018	6194819	Did you say the Canadian television company?
6194919	6195199	Yeah.
6195359	6199482	Well, when somebody asked me what about all the bad things Canada did, I will remember this one.
6199502	6200863	But I can always forgive Canada.
6201163	6201423	I know.
6201503	6203144	They did give us You Can't Do That on television.
6203484	6204245	For two reasons.
6204345	6204545	What?
6205086	6205386	Rush.
6206147	6206628	That's true.
6206948	6208650	Because Neil Peart is the best drummer in the universe.
6208810	6210031	And I do love me some Alanis.
6210412	6211052	Haters gonna hate.
6211253	6212814	And Canada's worst driver.
6213976	6215217	Seriously, watch it on YouTube.
6215237	6216198	The show is awesome.
6217159	6221444	And I'm gonna give a preemptive F you to the people who won season 8 just saying you guys don't need to be driving.
6223300	6223641	That's it.
6225082	6227305	Alright, let's move on to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6227325	6231150	We got a ton of responses this week on the Fugle Question of the Week, which is great.
6231170	6232591	We love hearing from all of our listeners.
6233112	6234414	But yes, the Fugle Question of the Week.
6234974	6237898	Take Facebook and Google and smash those words together.
6237918	6238498	You get Fugle.
6239459	6241942	and we ask a question of our fan communities each week.
6242062	6244705	You guys give us answers and we read some of them on the show.
6245105	6246707	I am not going to be able to read them all tonight.
6246807	6248188	You guys were too good this week.
6248769	6255896	So please visit our fan communities at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see the answers in their entirety.
6256436	6259379	We'll start with Google Plus once I, of course, tell you the question.
6259660	6260480	It's a short one tonight.
6262589	6267313	I think we've all heard the rumor about the next Xbox blocking used games.
6267914	6269735	Do you believe this rumor could be true?
6270096	6273859	For that matter, how much do you tend to believe industry rumors?
6279764	6292675	Over on Google+, Techie Q says My stance on game industry rumors has to be to take them with a grain of salt This leads to less heartache if a particular rumor doesn't come true or vice versa Isn't that the truth?
6292715	6297579	There's already people saying I'm not going to buy the next console Based on rumors alone
6300680	6300760	Uh...
6315680	6320403	and E3VL or Evil says on Google Plus, sources are barely creditable these days.
6320844	6327348	Seeing the internet being first on a news site is better than having long wait times to confirm information when it comes to rumors and speculation.
6327728	6335654	If anyone tries to discredit the website later down the line, they can label the article as it was just a rumor, as if it was some magical phrase to get them out of the situation.
6335754	6339737	So, you know, one of those whole, it's become about hits, hits, hits.
6340497	6352002	and certainly the ESA only fosters that attitude when it's all about the hits to get your site validated by them so you may be blessed by the ESA Pope to go to E3.
6353988	6354889	The ESA Pope.
6355109	6356129	That's what it is.
6356169	6362294	You have to email the ESA Pope and say, please, I would like to be blessed to go to your E3 event.
6362334	6367157	Now I'm imagining... You stand in front of the gates and your website is judged.
6367497	6370959	How many hits did ye accumulate in December of last year?
6371500	6374762	And ye are worthy or no reply?
6374822	6376983	Now I'm picturing what his Popemobile looks like.
6377544	6379945	You know, with the glass probably pulled by light cycles.
6380146	6380386	Yes.
6380506	6383508	I actually envision that the ESA Pope is basically Dame Edna.
6384361	6385802	Yes, it's Dame Edna.
6386483	6388604	My hello, my puppets.
6389725	6395108	Oh, it's Orange Lounge Radio is applying to go to E3.
6395649	6396649	Who are they?
6397970	6400812	What does Orange Lounge have to do with a video game?
6401072	6402733	By the way, you mentioned Dame Edna.
6402793	6404174	You know what I found the other day?
6404995	6409538	The picture I did for Extifer of Dame Edna saying Pandarens.
6412279	6412660	Random.
6413513	6417157	Why, there's no game or, you know, video in their title.
6418358	6419839	Game Attack Radio?
6419879	6421140	I've never heard of you!
6425445	6427667	Anyhow, moving on.
6429138	6429639	XBOX USE GAME THING
6446776	6447938	What do you think about the whole unlock fee?
6468792	6477498	It's money-grubbing because all the excuses that they were saying before that, oh, it's going to be all the developers lose out on money.
6477518	6479859	Developers aren't getting paid for that anyways.
6480059	6484322	I mean, you pay the developer and they may have commissions or whatever based on it, but
6484942	6490645	When they're being sold to distributors or retailers or whatever, it doesn't matter if they sell through.
6493286	6500069	You're going to put them out of business if you get rid of used games because that's how they make their money because your margins in your games are terrible.
6500209	6512514	Unless all of a sudden they start giving retailers way better costs on goods, then that's the only thing that's going to really drive new games because if it becomes more profitable to sell a new title than it does used games,
6513254	6535708	then they're going to go that route Brandon C on Facebook five hours ago saying something we brought up here on the show the only way to enforce it would be some sort of always online requirement and Sony and Microsoft coming together to make it happen there's no way Microsoft would block used games without Sony agreeing to do the same so funny enough that point I brought up earlier with the new access of evil huh
6537049	6559887	RedTheHaze replies in part I think people are overreacting to the news because everyone's excited for the new generation and any information even rumors are given a lot of attention gamers should just shut up and finish their backlogs already yeah shut up and go eat your backlog no dessert for you that's actually really good advice kids in China have no backlog
6565120	6566080	I made Bob turn red.
6566120	6566821	That was awesome.
6567421	6568441	Well, that was a witty retort.
6569122	6569762	It's very true.
6573664	6574064	Let's see.
6574424	6581147	Gary Baxter on Facebook replies, I take everything I hear with a grain of salt until someone with real pull in the company confirms it.
6581527	6588850	However, this does sound like Microsoft would do to get more sales on titles that most people would wait and pick up used from the evil G or a pawn shop.
6588870	6592812	But until an official spokesperson says yay or nay, all we can do is wait.
6595620	6598363	Let's see, VXChaseNXV says, it already happened.
6598743	6601245	Hello, non-code based digital downloads.
6601705	6602906	Industry rumors are silly.
6603187	6609912	Peers spin in exactly the same way as positive announcements, but are often able to be traced back to something specific.
6612153	6613494	One more here from DarkCharger.
6631118	6643588	While these are still unsubstantiated rumors, I could totally see a future where all game purchases are tied to a user account or gamertag via a key that ships with the disc or linked via digital download.
6645430	6645970	Good thought.
6645990	6651815	We didn't even name before, which I'm sure we've all got to be thinking about, but what if your Xbox has to be always online?
6652536	6654697	Xbox Live goes down sometimes.
6655098	6655838	Look at tonight.
6655918	6659141	We've got those snowstorms going on that are knocking things out.
6659281	6659661	It's like...
6660442	6663303	What if the internet was too choppy and you couldn't maintain your connection?
6663343	6664063	Are you just hosed?
6664403	6666063	Screw you and your $60 game?
6666463	6673045	Shouldn't they learn from Ubisoft that tried to do this shit with their DRM and how well that worked?
6673545	6682727	Honestly, I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the infrastructure in place to where that's a guarantee that you're going to have an internet connection.
6683407	6686548	I just don't see that that would be a viable option.
6688449	6694027	Now, granted, they could try crazy things if they want, but it doesn't mean it's going to work.
6695393	6696834	All right, I'm going to read one more answer.
6696854	6700355	I was going to end it there, but I got to do this one last answer because I think this is pretty good.
6700395	6703436	I think they're all good, but this one kind of brings up a different point here I want to read.
6704176	6705557	It's SSJ100Matt on Facebook.
6706297	6715160	I'm going to put the tinfoil hat on and say I believe it, only because I think that Microsoft purposely leaked this rumor to gauge the community's reaction and plan their approach from there.
6715701	6716461	I got to stop there.
6717541	6718842	What did they think was going to happen?
6719662	6721824	Oh, yes, the community is going to love this.
6722224	6723305	I mean, really?
6725207	6729030	The problem with if you're going to gauge interest is there's no upside to that.
6729250	6731272	Oh, we're going to get rid of your ability to play used games.
6731652	6733294	Hooray!
6733714	6741321	If it was like, we're going to get rid of the ability for you to play used games, but all the games that are in retail for $20 cheaper than they were now, then that would be okay.
6741721	6744884	I'm okay with not being able to play used games but I can get my games cheaper at launch.
6744904	6747266	I'm fine with that instead of... Yes, yes.
6747466	6748067	Actually, yes.
6748267	6752671	That would be... I would be totally okay with all of this if all games were $19.99.
6755293	6755773	Think about it.
6756674	6760498	Would suddenly this not be such bad news if games weren't $60 anymore?
6760538	6761058	What if Halo 5 was $20?
6763669	6764390	Yeah, that's not a big deal.
6765050	6765931	It's not a big deal, is it?
6766591	6767632	Okay, yeah, you're right.
6767672	6769113	Take away my ability to play used games.
6769453	6774677	If you're willing to put that commitment in, so am I. I usually don't buy games until they drop down that low now.
6775537	6778259	Anyhow, continuing on with the comment here.
6778980	6784543	I think Microsoft has seen enough from companies like EA where they seem to have gotten away with charging for passes for online play in their games.
6784944	6787565	I think it's only a matter of time before we see console makers doing this.
6787886	6791028	But I anticipate Microsoft coming up with a creative way to charge for it.
6791348	6803776	Perhaps they can bundle it with your yearly Xbox Live fee, like a Diamond Club that pays for unlimited use of used or borrowed games in exchange for discounts or specials on the Xbox Live Marketplace, much like PlayStation Plus.
6804237	6812922	That way they'll still get money, encourage gamers to spend more money in the marketplace, and make people like they're not getting charged a second or third time for the same game.
6813243	6816425	Just a thought, but at Microsoft, if you're listening and like that idea, call me.
6817405	6819807	Oh, that's an ugly idea.
6821788	6827771	To the guy sitting in the boardroom, that's a beautiful idea, but SSJ100, Matt, that is an ugly idea, and I'm almost a little ashamed that I read it.
6828011	6828971	Think about what he's saying.
6830412	6836514	Yes, it blocks out used games, but if you're an Xbox Live Diamond member, that restriction is lifted.
6837715	6838555	That is ugly.
6838735	6844678	That would come back to bite him in the ass so fast, it's not even funny.
6845098	6845838	Oh, God.
6846499	6848239	Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if they've already thought of it.
6848459	6849840	Can't you kind of see it?
6852131	6853532	Can't you kind of see it?
6853573	6855875	It's almost worse than just blocking.
6856215	6857096	It is almost.
6858437	6859398	Talk about like...
6862146	6862887	I feel dirty.
6862947	6865207	I need to bathe after reading that.
6865247	6870709	I don't think this is one of the stories we're covering, but the other day, Sony's stock price went down 10%.
6870769	6879031	They can't make these really crazy decisions to pull this kind of crap on their consumer.
6879091	6880231	They have to play it safe.
6880631	6881732	I think the same with Microsoft.
6881752	6882732	They have to play it safe, too.
6883132	6886173	I don't think that they can get rid of used game sales that way, because that's...
6887453	6914666	it's seriously it's a gamble because unless you know both of them are doing it then and and I still think even if Nintendo would have to do it too and also the fact that you have to completely forget the fact that there's all these older consoles out there GameGuru in chat sums it up perfectly live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says so I have to pay $60 a year to not only play games online but to play used games fuck that shit fuck that shit
6916994	6919395	My SNES is looking better and better.
6919435	6922717	Well, you said $60 a year, because $60 a year is for gold.
6922897	6923938	Why stop at $60?
6924218	6926119	This is the diamond plan.
6927499	6928880	Maybe they'll throw in a free movie.
6930281	6931822	Free rental on Xbox movies.
6931842	6934243	Yes, a free rental on an Xbox movie.
6934503	6936084	I feel dirty.
6938123	6939624	Thank you, Fugle Question of the Week.
6939664	6944708	You get your honorary member card along with a bottle of lube to commemorate the Xbox.
6945308	6948871	And, you know, if you get the diamond plan, then they'll throw in a wedge for you to bend over.
6949651	6953114	Suddenly that name of Xbox Lube sounds more and more appropriate.
6953634	6956896	Because if y'all are buying it, you better lube yourself up.
6957317	6958738	It's going the route of Sony.
6958858	6959418	It's Latin.
6959458	6960259	It's Lube.
6963981	6965122	I like that name even better.
6965202	6966383	The Xbox Lube.
6966783	6967103	Lube.
6970376	6971858	Alright, let's get into some real news.
6971918	6977764	Let's stop all this wank and get into, oh, other wank about movies and stuff, right, Loki?
6978263	6982065	Yeah, so let's talk about shit that's never going to happen while I'm still alive.
6983907	6989810	So Valve's looking to make a Portal or Half-Life movie with J.J.
6989950	6990311	Abrams.
6990331	6991071	Yeah, that's right.
6991571	6992172	So J.J.
6992272	6999796	Abrams says, we're going to try to figure out if we can make a Half-Life or a Portal movie together, basically said Gabe Newell.
7000437	7002018	And I guess they've...
7003695	7004215	I don't know.
7005676	7010039	No timetable's been talked about or anything.
7010520	7013401	And let's put it this way, we're not going to see this anytime soon.
7014742	7020966	I mean, I think we'll see Half-Life 3 before we'll see a Portal movie and Half-Life movie.
7021327	7024769	It would be awesome, but also consider the fact that, you know...
7026468	7028189	JJ Abrams is a little busy right now.
7028229	7033253	He's got a Star Trek movie coming out and a Star Wars movie he's working on.
7033373	7036616	How much lens flare will this one have?
7037556	7039378	An amazing amount of lens flare.
7040278	7042140	It'll be crazy.
7042300	7044642	Especially with those portals being all shiny and everything.
7044722	7046583	There's a lot of lens flare that we had there.
7047784	7048825	The potential is staggering.
7049696	7071370	yes um so of course you know brief announcement enough to tease people no and they're not going to give anybody any sort of release dates because they would only have to delay them indefinitely like they do with Half-Life 3 you guys what if Half-Life 3 is a movie that's it that's the catch what if they're already like movies anyway with just some gameplay thrown in here and there
7071857	7072418	New ARG, New ARG
7090347	7090908	Isn't J.J.
7090968	7092168	Abrams kind of busy though?
7092408	7093809	Like, you know, Star Wars?
7093969	7096891	It's kind of a big deal.
7096931	7100413	I know he signed on for the next movie, but isn't that going to be like the next trilogy?
7100433	7101773	I mean, because that could take a long time.
7101793	7103354	Are they just going to say fuck you to all the books?
7104034	7106976	Yes, they are saying fuck you to all the books, which I'm totally okay with.
7107116	7108518	JJ Abrams is only on board to direct episode 7.
7124013	7126955	Which is okay because 4, 5, and 6 had different directors too.
7126975	7129736	Because Lucas did the first one but he didn't do 5 and 6.
7130536	7135999	I will never, ever recognize the quote, first three quote as being canon.
7136119	7137060	No one will, honey.
7137620	7138140	Nobody will.
7138180	7138621	That's alright.
7138641	7143423	For number 8 and 9 they've got Brett Ratner and Joel Schumacher.
7143443	7143963	Go to hell.
7144904	7146505	There'll be nipples on everybody.
7146725	7149526	No, it's, um, fuck what's his name, Uwe Boll.
7151427	7151908	Oh god.
7152008	7157131	I'm gonna make it a zombie movie that's gonna be steampunk and... And Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it.
7157351	7158612	Everybody freeze.
7160433	7161794	Everybody chill.
7162395	7164056	I am your grandfather.
7166457	7167718	Can you feel the ice?
7169960	7170260	You know...
7173535	7175636	I still have a lot of Arnold movies to catch up on.
7175856	7176316	I'm sorry.
7176376	7177456	I don't care how terrible the movie is.
7177476	7178396	That new one flopped.
7179456	7179956	That's fine.
7180157	7182577	Because people are setting their expectations too high.
7182677	7184477	It's a popcorn movie, okay?
7184697	7187598	Was really like Commando that deep of a movie?
7187658	7188378	I mean, come on.
7188558	7193059	Being the governor of California wasn't the best career choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger, let's be real.
7193359	7194700	It seemed like a noble thing to do.
7194720	7196780	Dude, he gives tank rides to the press.
7198220	7199521	I watched a video on that.
7200181	7200961	That's awesome.
7202122	7204002	And he has his own tank that he drives around.
7204402	7205383	Because, you know what?
7205743	7208583	When he was in the military, he was a tank driver.
7208963	7210043	So, that's pretty awesome.
7210504	7215645	BlackWolf in chat says, Star Wars Episode VIII Explosions directed by Michael Bay.
7216125	7218665	Is Michael Bay the director of Independence Day or is that Roland Emmerich?
7218685	7219985	That's Roland Emmerich.
7220125	7221366	That's who needs to direct.
7221586	7224146	Bad Boys would be... You know what?
7224586	7225066	I'm sorry.
7225166	7227727	Independence Day is one of those movies that only gets better with time.
7230068	7230548	Did you watch 2012?
7232769	7234090	No, I've only seen clips of it.
7234491	7235811	It's a long-ass movie.
7236032	7241515	You know a movie I did see was The Day After Tomorrow where they're literally running after ice.
7241936	7242916	It's almost like The Happening.
7242936	7243937	They're running after wind.
7243977	7244257	You know what?
7244397	7249140	I flipped a table when they were running toward the little fire in the building, the fireplace.
7250461	7251462	I just flipped my table.
7251522	7258387	You have to seriously watch 2012 because they escape from an earthquake via plane two or three times.
7260007	7262048	It's like the same scene.
7262068	7263669	It's like, did we just do this?
7264009	7266630	I mean, what's going on?
7267111	7271152	BlackWolfInChat says, fun fact, Independence Day's original script was Stargate 2.
7271553	7274454	I have heard that before, too, that Independence Day started as Stargate 2.
7275174	7275614	I can see that.
7275634	7276155	It makes sense.
7276275	7276595	It does.
7277595	7278856	I mean, obviously, it changed a lot, but...
7279356	7291684	There was also, I think, something in the original script that explained why the Apple thing worked, why they were able to hack it with a Mac, is that they had already been working on breaking down the code on the one ship that they had.
7293565	7295146	They had all this stuff written out.
7295426	7297448	Why are people trying to explain the logic in the movie?
7297628	7298008	I mean, that's...
7298188	7299889	Well, the thing is, they had it explained.
7299969	7306614	I just remember sitting there in the theater when they first showed the preview and the aliens, like, you know, how old were we all when that movie came out?
7306754	7307574	You would have been a little younger.
7307594	7309135	I was in college the first time.
7309195	7310276	I was a freshman in college.
7310476	7312037	I saw that every day.
7313298	7315159	The second, the third, and the fourth.
7315520	7318942	It's like, every day of the movie, it was just like, okay, we're on the second.
7319362	7320103	Okay, we're on the third.
7320223	7320723	We're on the fourth.
7320763	7322064	I'm seeing it every single day.
7322244	7327708	Remember, though, when that trailer first came out with the alien ship came out and it blew up the White House and everybody's like,
7328388	7332131	I think it's a little long from that right now
7354249	7354849	Do you remember what else?
7354869	7356049	What if they have What's-His-Face?
7356429	7359890	I know this is not a tangent you all asked for, but it's Orange Lounge Radio, people.
7360230	7362611	Do you know what made the movie Independence Day?
7362651	7364491	Do you know what made that fucking movie?
7364671	7365451	The dog surviving?
7366151	7368672	Harvey Firestein is in Independence Day.
7369312	7369872	Oh, God.
7369952	7371293	I've got to call my mother.
7372073	7372633	I know.
7377454	7378034	I loved him.
7382642	7385383	Best choice of casting ever.
7388224	7390885	I just like how they were advertising, you don't know who's going to die.
7391845	7394026	And I pretty much pegged everyone who was going to die in that movie.
7396747	7397307	Oh, you're looking.
7399588	7400228	Oh, crap.
7402689	7403189	Let's see.
7403569	7404730	I'm trying to find a clip.
7404790	7405250	I can't find one.
7405270	7406210	Is it when he's in the car?
7406450	7407471	My bed's actually going to load.
7407531	7408011	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
7408031	7408351	Here we go.
7408371	7408631	Here we go.
7408671	7410772	There's at least this one little clip.
7410792	7411092	Here we go.
7411112	7411352	Here we go.
7420890	7421650	Oh, crap.
7423071	7423551	I love him.
7425332	7429074	I don't think I remember from that, you know, was it residents of L.A.
7429274	7439399	are being warned not to fire, or was it like, or use their firearms at the alien spacecraft, or discharge their firearms at the alien spacecraft?
7439539	7440380	Yes, yes.
7440440	7440900	A warning.
7441961	7443902	WhatupG said, he said forget his lawyer.
7443922	7444202	That's right.
7444462	7447023	I gotta call my mother, and I gotta call my lawyer.
7447043	7448304	Ah, forget my lawyer.
7450410	7451531	Alright, we gotta move on.
7451551	7453693	So they can have like RuPaul in the next one?
7455114	7458758	And to answer Dungeon Buster, no, I do not have the Independence Day game.
7459258	7461680	It is not anywhere at all in the collection.
7462681	7465044	Aliens are coming to us from Mars.
7465804	7467986	Well, they need to sashay away.
7470749	7471349	Is that a dragon?
7471369	7473311	Because RuPaul being in... Oh, forget it.
7475851	7476491	DarkSakura.
7476872	7477932	You need to sissy that walk.
7478052	7478333	All right.
7479133	7479634	Moving on.
7479654	7480414	You know what?
7481595	7482515	Is it finally my turn?
7482535	7483116	Because fuck.
7483176	7484657	No, I have to talk about Skylanders real quick.
7484677	7486298	What are we even talking about?
7486778	7487218	Movies.
7487379	7487839	Oh, that's right.
7488239	7488579	J.J.
7488659	7489060	Abrams.
7490100	7490521	Somehow.
7490721	7491721	Thank you, J.J.
7491822	7494183	Abrams, for derailing the show in an epic manner.
7494643	7496344	Now here's a lens flare for you.
7497365	7497865	Ah, blind.
7498126	7498386	Okay.
7499246	7500007	Skylanders.
7500147	7504550	Hey, what a great way to follow up a Harvey Fierstein story than talking about Skylanders.
7505310	7507491	Skylanders swap force is coming out.
7507551	7509713	You thwop them.
7509733	7512094	16 special figures with torsos and bottom halves.
7512114	7513315	You have to do the accent for the whole thing.
7513735	7513855	No.
7514235	7516437	You link the two pieces together.
7516497	7518338	You can combine the pieces in different ways.
7518718	7544448	So it's like, oh god, a whole new collection crap Now you gotta collect heads and feet Instead of just, you know, the figures themselves You can mix and match Although, in theory, it's a neat way to evolve the concept, I guess For what it's worth It's also gonna make you buy a brand new portal Because the old portal is not compatible with the new characters Oh, bastards Bastards That's an $80 purchase right there, buddy
7544688	7546730	It's also being done by Vicarious Visions.
7546830	7549733	It is not being done by Toys for Bob, who did the original.
7550073	7552716	Toys for Bob coming up with a new money-making scheme right now.
7552816	7557881	All they're doing is putting out new characters because there is a thing... They made tons of money, so yeah.
7559186	7562430	Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, Wii, and 3DS.
7562630	7565313	Interesting that it's on Wii U and Wii.
7565754	7569217	The Wii version being done by Beenox, 3DS by nSpace.
7569337	7571600	Because they've been contracted out because they don't care.
7571620	7573121	They know that people buy the characters.
7573182	7574723	They don't care about the game.
7574743	7576245	They just want people to buy characters.
7576705	7584191	If you think Skylanders isn't a thing, like that people are making too big of a deal out of Skylanders, you're probably right.
7584251	7587273	But the reality is, walk into Target or Best Buy.
7587313	7593497	I was at Best Buy last night because, I don't know, we were like, oh yeah, you can actually get those K-Cup coffee things pretty cheap at Best Buy.
7593517	7594398	That's what we were there for.
7595419	7596079	Go to Marshall's.
7596119	7601083	There was an aisle in the video game section, an entire aisle dedicated to Skylanders.
7602429	7603969	It'll blow your mind.
7604530	7607711	Soon, of course, Disney Infinity and all this other stuff will be competing with it.
7607831	7610752	Disney Infinity, can you imagine compared to the Skylanders stuff?
7610772	7612632	They're going to have so much.
7612672	7613672	Entire stores.
7614233	7620915	Anyway, Activision on their earnings call announced 100 million Skylanders toys have been sold.
7621815	7622075	Wow.
7622615	7622976	Oh, I'm sorry.
7622996	7625839	That was actually from their press conference at Toy Fair 2013.
7625899	7627220	Excuse me, not from the earnings call.
7628081	7631605	But yeah, $500 million in sales in the U.S.
7631685	7632626	alone.
7633127	7635349	$195 million of that from Skylanders Giants.
7637251	7637812	It's a thing.
7638613	7640395	Like it or not, it's a thing.
7641124	7666985	yeah it's because people blindly collect those toys and now that they have to buy new characters and version 3's of their characters honestly if I were 8 I'd want it too I mean I'm trying to put it in that perspective is that it's easy for me to sit here and laugh at it but whoever fucking thought of this is a genius and if I was a kid I would fucking want it but I gotta wonder what's gonna happen when Infinity comes out cause that's gonna cut them off at the knees I think I did see the trailer for that and I liked it
7667265	7669847	Well, they're all going to... I mean, it's not going to end there.
7670367	7671628	No.
7671668	7677652	Wait, you don't think Nintendo wants that near-field communication shit to work so they can bring on the fucking Pokemon?
7677672	7678833	They've talked about that before.
7678853	7683776	That's all Nintendo has to fucking do is announce Pokemon for Wii U with actual Pokemon.
7683796	7684677	Collect them all.
7685057	7686238	You will collect them all.
7689300	7690581	Each character is going to be $10.
7690621	7693923	Nintendo's got a lot of stuff they could whip out and put on the table if they wanted to.
7694764	7695244	Believe me.
7696044	7701669	Talk about needing lube When they whip that out Is your body ready for this, bitch?
7702610	7707615	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura By the way, Rob, did you see my suggestion in chat?
7708696	7720887	No Mr. Spanky needs a New York Jewish cousin named Harvey Spanklestein Nobody understands the Mr. Spanky joke anymore There's people who get it Like four or five I miss Mr. Spanky, Rob
7722171	7723732	DDR is not on PC anymore.
7723932	7724692	I know.
7724752	7726593	How old is DDR PC these days?
7726693	7727114	Good lord.
7727714	7729655	I could probably find it on abandonware sites.
7729695	7731056	That's how old DDR PC is.
7731116	7733897	You could probably find it unwrapped and boxed in my house.
7734617	7736999	I mean, no, wrapped and boxed in my house, which is true.
7737839	7740400	So, speaking of Konami, how's that?
7742041	7751907	Anyway, the UK studio dude, David Cox, said that they want to consider putting out Castlevania Mirror of Fate on HD platforms.
7752287	7754768	The game is coming out on the 5th in the US for the 3DS.
7755229	7765354	But he said that the whole game is actually already done in high def, that they actually shrunk it and removed bones and changed animations to make it DS-sized, or 3DS-sized.
7765915	7767856	So, yeah, in fact, the quote right here is...
7771959	7796016	at Mercury S team we have an HD version of the game sitting there in a computer somewhere so I mean I guess all the other Castlevania games have sold very well but the cover art is really pretty but I'm really not sure how well it's going to sell I mean maybe it will, it's a Castlevania game hard to go wrong there sorry Castlevania 64
7799635	7805557	I could see them doing something like this for maybe a Nintendo console because it's a 3DS game.
7805617	7808198	Maybe, hey, there's a perfect Wii U tie-in right there.
7808238	7808698	There you go.
7809458	7815940	I'd actually like to... You can have that little Metroidvania map on your little Wii U... Did they say this is another Metroidvania-style one?
7816120	7816540	Oh, I don't know.
7816600	7818241	I'm just making that up.
7818401	7824823	It's sort of like a port of Lords of Shadows, so it's a hack-and-slash.
7827382	7828123	God of Belmont.
7828483	7829183	God of Belmont.
7829343	7830023	Pretty much, yeah.
7832464	7833324	Whip of War.
7834085	7835325	Can't even follow those anymore.
7836425	7836805	Moving on.
7837005	7837866	I wouldn't buy it, by the way.
7838286	7838686	All right.
7839086	7841207	So Atari, of course, not doing that great.
7841447	7845388	And we've heard that they were talking about declaring bankruptcy and stuff.
7845408	7845988	So they did that.
7846528	7847849	And the U.S.
7848009	7854631	branch of Atari, they closed, I guess, $2 million in debtor in possession financing.
7855571	7859613	and also I guess they're supposed to be expecting some other money coming in.
7860034	7872820	But right now they're looking at restructuring and with that probably going to be selling off assets and properties including all your favorite Atari franchises.
7873100	7873560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7893169	7894050	and do something with that.
7894090	7894970	Remember Sword Quest?
7895230	7895871	Nope.
7895931	7915484	Oh, it was an Atari 2600 series and it never finished but they were like doing like a real, the games were so hard, they were doing like a real contest to give away like these real swords and crowns and shit that were valued at all this money back in the 80s and I think Earth World, Fire World and Water World all came out but the last one, Air World, never did.
7915504	7916184	I remember this.
7916204	7922168	And I think Water World was like right at the death stroke of Atari so I think it's like one of those like hard to find cartridges.
7923450	7927236	Yeah, anyway, sorry, I'm just thinking of all these obscure Atari franchises people ought to gobble up.
7929400	7929681	Anyhow.
7930041	7931363	New Marvel Madness, please.
7932848	7933168	Right?
7934250	7934970	Like 720?
7937473	7938654	Alright, moving on.
7939074	7944660	One place that would not be selling these Atari remake games if things keep going the way they're going is HMV.
7945180	7949024	Not a chain I've heard of, but I think these are big over in the UK, or at least bigger than they are here.
7949044	7950085	I think they're only in the UK.
7950505	7950746	Are they?
7951106	7952187	I want to say I've heard the name before.
7954289	7956830	But maybe because they partner with somebody over here, I don't know.
7956850	7963453	But anyway, HMV, this does affect the UK mostly, which has had a lot of bad news when it comes to game retailers lately.
7964073	7970056	Closing 66 of their 220 stores, which means 930 people out of a job as a result.
7970716	7971717	Really a bummer.
7972457	7974738	These stores closing in the next one or two months.
7975539	7977920	A quote from Joint Administrator Nick Edwards.
7996710	7997210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8015399	8015720	Wow.
8016020	8020466	Down to 500 and down to 500 in the UK too.
8021067	8023671	Can you imagine when we get to the point where GameStop will do that?
8023711	8025393	Because there's a lot of GameStops out there.
8025413	8026515	They're already closing stores.
8026555	8028097	Yeah, some of them are already starting to close.
8029379	8030620	Getting pretty crazy.
8031341	8034303	So anyway, our thoughts to those that were impacted by jobs.
8034383	8039867	Hopefully something, a similar retail operation will come to take their place, we will hope.
8040767	8045630	Anyhow, let's move on and get into some listener feedback in the form of emails.
8046351	8047631	Every week you guys email us.
8049212	8059101	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we sort through the spam and find the emails that were actually from legit listeners and we read some of our favorites here on the program.
8059241	8061402	DarkSakura, pick some out and read them for us.
8061943	8066427	Okay, well I will go with the oldest to newest because we got two weeks worth of emails.
8068068	8073192	This one, well I didn't put a nickname on it so I'm just, oh no, it's HoneyBadger.
8073893	8076435	Hi guys, this is HoneyBadger don't take shit from no one.
8076826	8079147	This is Sam, aka Honey Badger on Steam.
8079667	8082808	I am ecstatic to hear the positive views on PC gaming.
8083248	8090831	The largest complaint and truth I hear from console gamers is instability with games on PC because it's up to the end user to set the graphics options.
8091372	8096293	Of course, if you go over the top with graphics levels your video card can't handle, you get instability.
8096794	8105257	NVIDIA has looked into this and will be releasing a tool that analyzes your specs and has them set per game configuration that will give you the best performance and visual appeal.
8105898	8110933	thanks for this show I hope to see you on Steam PS I want to add Rob and Loki on Steam if that's possible
8111570	8113411	We have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Steam.
8113591	8115611	You can add lots of people that listen to the show.
8115631	8116892	And yes, we're in there too.
8117012	8118612	Just look on me and link from there.
8118892	8119092	Yes.
8119493	8120873	OL Army, I think it's called.
8120893	8121913	There are Orange Lounge Radio fans.
8121993	8123174	And there's a VOG Network one.
8123194	8127495	I really should be pimping that one because we want to, you know, all the VOGgy people.
8127515	8128276	But join them both.
8128556	8129056	Our VOGgies.
8129536	8129756	Yes.
8130176	8132077	Do we have a name for the VOG listeners?
8132317	8132897	VOGLets.
8133377	8133857	VOGLets?
8134177	8134678	VOGLets.
8134998	8135938	Our little VOGLets.
8136418	8137318	We can have a VOG house.
8139299	8161570	but anyhow join those communities and yes Loki and I are in there and of course you know PC gaming it's a part of gaming and sometimes we I mean honestly I play games on my PC more than anything else because World of Warcraft is on PC and there's a lot of stuff you can't deny and especially is great on PC like Path of Exile I talked about earlier you're just not going to see that on consoles
8161690	8162011	Dragon Age 2
8173237	8175658	I can't believe something like that doesn't already exist
8202289	8204852	He explains it and I think, God, why isn't that already out there?
8204872	8205593	It's a great idea.
8205794	8209218	Do you know what we used to do to test our graphics capabilities?
8209679	8211802	We used to use the Final Fantasy XI graphics test.
8212583	8213264	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8213769	8234906	I mean, and that was pretty cute and it was a neat way of Yeah, the benchmark thing The benchmark thing I like that thing a lot too We used to use that to test if we could handle certain games because basically if we could handle Final Fantasy XI we could handle anything else that came out around the same time Yeah, it would show you the frame rate once it ran the whole thing like how many frames were processed But now my graphics card will seriously handle anything Yeah, yeah So I haven't had a reason to check
8235259	8237560	I should run the Final Fantasy XI benchmark just for lols.
8237600	8240381	I bet it would be gorgeous with my current graphics card.
8240401	8243162	There's only so much you can do with that thing, trust me.
8243202	8246803	I kind of am nostalgic now.
8247523	8249784	14 beta starting.
8250004	8250984	I don't need another game.
8251084	8252765	I'm actually kind of considering dropping WoW.
8252805	8254345	I'll just wait for it to go free to play.
8254485	8255926	I'm talking about XIII, of course.
8255986	8256526	You mean XI?
8257166	8257966	Or XI.
8259327	8259747	Moving on.
8259807	8260907	Hey, hey, OLR.
8261047	8261487	Hey, hey.
8262048	8262668	Hey, hey, hey.
8263308	8264389	Hey, hey, hey.
8264570	8264990	Good lord.
8265691	8268914	First off, allow me to elaborate on my Twitter post from last week.
8269095	8270116	I think it's fantastic.
8270136	8271457	This is Rostel UT, by the way.
8272078	8277023	I think it's fantastic to see people giving deep silver shit over the Dead Island Riptide statue fiasco.
8277404	8277944	Oh, that thing.
8278245	8279666	Yeah, I have no idea what he's talking about, but okay.
8280527	8285270	Remember the horrible bust that was the woman all chopped up that they were selling?
8285850	8286551	Oh yeah, that.
8287712	8298938	However, it's disheartening to see that in every comment section and seemingly every YouTube video gamers are giving shit to people who speak out against the promotion either brushing it aside as no big deal or making sexist remarks themselves.
8299439	8306503	You know the ESA loves to talk a great game about how many women play video games but given how uniform the audience reaction tends to be when things like this come up
8306943	8307003	No.
8307023	8307103	No.
8335467	8363978	YouTube commenting is not like a like Google is not trying to change the whole YouTube commenting thing to clear out the cesspool a little bit every time you log into YouTube don't you want to use your real name don't you want to change everything to your real name why aren't you using your real name like literally Google asked me today why aren't you using your real name it's like fuck off I don't want to use my real name and I'm not the problem because I don't comment on YouTubes but Yahoo Yahoo needs to do that too Yahoo comments
8364958	8365438	Oh my god.
8366319	8366819	Oh my god.
8368781	8372284	Well, go back to the comment.
8372504	8380190	I don't think it really would matter how much of the market is female gaming because you still have most of the decisions being made by men.
8380770	8381731	I hate to say it.
8382672	8386935	It goes into more of a sociopolitical realm than just...
8387395	8388336	Who's playing the games?
8388556	8392721	I mean, and yeah, I think it is actually still predominantly guys.
8392901	8395224	But you have a much larger female gaming base now.
8396145	8405615	But it's... And it's really hard to say because, again, like you were talking about, there's that anonymity, you know, that you can say it and get away with it.
8405695	8406176	But, you know...
8408939	8413422	What if that was your mom you were gaming against and you, you know, were saying something?
8413703	8418346	What if it was another fucking human being with feelings and, you know, thoughts and so forth?
8418426	8424451	Like, and the vile things people say on YouTube about, like, these teenage girls that do their vlogs.
8424831	8426832	And they're just being dumb teenage girls.
8426932	8429194	We were all a dumb teenage girl at one point.
8430035	8430515	Yes, we were.
8430535	8431376	Let's be real, right?
8431676	8431836	Yes.
8431916	8434818	And, you know, people are going like, you should just kill yourself.
8435819	8437640	And there's several people who have.
8437881	8438081	Like...
8439130	8439490	Really?
8440451	8440791	Really?
8441412	8449978	Also on a psychological point of view, when you deal with people that young, well, basically you're dealing with people whose brains aren't going to be fully developed until they're 25.
8450319	8451239	And that's not a slight.
8451259	8452160	That is just a reality.
8452180	8453001	That's fact.
8453841	8455943	If you don't believe me, look at National Geographic.
8455963	8456884	They wrote a whole article on it.
8457704	8462488	But anyway, you're dealing with people who are not fully developed.
8462588	8466111	It's basically that level of suggestibility.
8466151	8467773	They don't have a way of filtering anything out.
8467993	8473818	It's all what's in front of you with no long-term consequence that's really pressing.
8474979	8489681	But if you also think of it that way, your gamer base, if you're thinking as mostly teenage and that male demographic between teenage to 27, you're also dealing with a huge number of people whose brains are not fully developed.
8490342	8490822	End of story.
8490882	8491783	Brains are not fully developed.
8492123	8493563	Those neural pathways are not all there.
8494283	8501186	And so as an adult, yeah, I can sit and tell myself, okay, well, they're not using all of their potential.
8501226	8502346	They have no faculties yet.
8503006	8505787	You can stop and tell yourself, yeah, these people are just trolls.
8505807	8506587	They don't know any better.
8508588	8509369	Maybe they don't care.
8509389	8512091	But they need to get the shit scared out of them.
8512191	8512652	But they do.
8512712	8513493	See, that's the thing.
8514774	8521640	This is what I would like to see is that if you have a warning button that instantly turns on whatever camera is connected so you can see their face.
8523539	8523999	That's it.
8524519	8528660	You know, or... Cameras turning on randomly.
8528720	8530381	That's big brother talk.
8530461	8531261	That's not realistic.
8531281	8543184	I know, but I mean, there should be... When you're dealing with the type of brain activity that deals only with immediacy and not long-term consequence, you need to make an immediate consequence.
8544493	8558678	Not to go on a tangent, but you got those people that were on Twitter and these stupid kids that when Obama got re-elected, there were all these people making tweets that were like, I can't believe that N-word got re-elected and saying just idiotic shit on their Twitter, right?
8558978	8562999	And so what happens, these websites go out and just basically dox them.
8563339	8568521	Like, you know, it's this guy that goes to this high school and he's on this scholarship for the college and these kids are like...
8569201	8588523	These kids are losing their scholarships over it and I'm not saying like maybe they shouldn't but it's kind of like they're dumbass kids and the dumbass kids don't need to have their lives ruined necessarily but they need that reality check and the parents could really use the smack on the head too because they didn't just learn it watching the TV's.
8588976	8606663	well honestly though that's a reflection of the caliber of person that these schools are getting and a school has a reputation to maintain too if it's going to come out you know that they're admitting somebody with that particular view set to their school and their school does not share that view set they have the right to deny them
8608368	8612513	RDG Singe in the chat saying, I know a few adults whose lobes never fully developed.
8612594	8614737	RossDLUT pointing out it's not all kids either.
8614817	8615598	Ain't that the truth?
8615638	8616078	That's true.
8616098	8618101	You know, we're talking a lot about teenagers and so forth.
8618141	8622728	But yeah, if a 30-year-old guy is sitting there trolling Twitter with all this stuff, then you know what?
8622768	8624590	It's a little harder to feel sorry for somebody.
8625191	8627272	whose brain is fully developed and should know better.
8627372	8632435	Yeah, well, I mean, you're also dealing with the fact that we are a society of instant gratification.
8632555	8638038	We're, especially now with the anonymity, the nastiest side of people are becoming public.
8638838	8639339	And you know what?
8639419	8643201	If they're going to be, you know, think that their anonymity can hide them, let them be exposed.
8643621	8644761	I have zero problem with that.
8644802	8645602	Let their boss find out.
8647045	8648106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8669739	8699041	everybody has that but I mean in the end you want to think about how you're reflecting on yourself you know I try yeah I get a little bit bitchier than normal on the show because it's sometimes funny but at the same time this is me this is who I am I try not to portray myself in any other way than the person that I am and so on the same token that's all we can ever consider these people that we're interacting with through a video game this is who this person is oh my god who talks like this I don't want to be around this person anymore and
8699301	8700061	How do they have friends?
8701002	8703383	Technist in our chat room, and I think we'll move on after this comment.
8703764	8707666	I think people forget that there is no such thing as true anonymity on the internet.
8708046	8708546	No, it's not.
8708566	8709947	Let's move on.
8710487	8711388	There's the rest of the email.
8712228	8719833	I know logically that I shouldn't be basing an entire group of people on the internet, but that's just exhausting when it's all you see from gamers 90% of the time.
8720293	8721774	Regards, Ross Steele, UT.
8722014	8723415	GamersHateEverything.com
8723956	8726919	DarkSakura, do you have problems with your balls?
8747319	8747759	Let me finish.
8748060	8751662	Just to clarify, of course the ball doesn't ricochet directly from the slot machine into the bumper.
8752002	8754464	It is hit by the right flipper first, then hits the bumper and drains.
8754504	8756465	Timing on the flipper is a major factor as well.
8756865	8764290	To be perfectly honest, I haven't actually touched my Twilight Zone machine except to take a picture of my cat on it in probably six months, so I probably can't answer that question.
8764370	8769493	Although I can say that there are lots of cheap maneuvers, but keep in mind these were meant to make money.
8771314	8772094	Thanks for watching!
8791889	8792589	That's it for Mailbags?
8792749	8793050	That's it.
8793270	8796671	Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to email us in the future.
8796711	8800413	Again, one more time, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Please do email us.
8800793	8803114	We get a lot of lovely emails and we would love a few more.
8803194	8805395	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
8806255	8807936	So I have to actually read something from Becky.
8808116	8808317	Sure.
8808517	8809337	That Julian said.
8809958	8810298	Go for it.
8810498	8813440	Okay, so she's playing the first Mass Effect again.
8813921	8815462	And Julian is her six-year-old?
8815482	8815882	Her five-year-old.
8815922	8816262	Five-year-old.
8816322	8817643	He's going to be six, though, in a couple months.
8817963	8818204	Close enough.
8818224	8818844	Right after my birthday.
8818984	8819424	I was close.
8819464	8819925	I rounded.
8820125	8820345	Yeah.
8821606	8824068	The line from Joker, I want to be there when you make that son of a bitch pay.
8824508	8826049	And Julian says, you're not going to make him pay.
8826069	8826930	You're going to make him die.
8829892	8831393	So I felt that needed to be shared.
8833763	8839406	Alright, let's move on with a few more news stories before we get to... Oh, I'm sorry, we've got FUs of the Week to do.
8840186	8841507	I almost overlooked the FUs of the Week.
8841707	8844328	FU to myself for damn near overlooking the FUs of the Week.
8845029	8847250	It's the part of the show every week where we get angsty.
8847370	8847690	Why?
8847710	8849311	I don't know, cuz.
8865838	8874901	Um, first off, um, F you to people who don't understand what following distance is, and try to get all up in yours and then change lanes into your following space.
8876041	8887985	In California, we have what's called the three-second rule, where we pick a landmark when the car in front of you, when the tail of your car passes it, you count three seconds until you hit that same part with the front of your car, and that's following distance.
8888325	8890865	Well, in Alabama, it's two seconds, but whatever.
8891105	8892806	Um, just because Alabama's fucking...
8893326	8893806	I can say it.
8893926	8895147	I can say Alabama's backwards.
8895187	8895627	I'm from there.
8895947	8896427	I escaped.
8898188	8901809	Also, F you to there being ads now on the AIM app on my iPad.
8902990	8909332	And F you to the winners slash losers of Canada's Worst Driver.
8909952	8912033	Because they were both really awful.
8912173	8914014	And I mean, these people are hazards on the road.
8914034	8914694	They're going to kill people.
8915094	8917875	I mean, literally, they are that stupid.
8917935	8924917	If you are a bad driver, if everyone around you tells you you're a bad driver, and no amount of practice is helping you, stop fucking driving!
8925657	8926217	End of story.
8926537	8928418	That goes to everybody in the world who's a bad driver.
8929498	8930458	Me, I'm a great driver.
8931719	8938121	And I have a thank you to my husband, who greeted me the other night with a three terabyte hard drive.
8939101	8939461	Yeah!
8940721	8941461	You're spoiled.
8941882	8942742	No, I love him.
8944011	8944291	Loki?
8945752	8954615	F you to the lingering part of the stomach bug here that I have, which is making me feel extremely bloated, like I'm full of just like... Pizza?
8955195	8956695	No, I didn't even have that much pizza.
8956715	8959356	I only had like two slices of pizza.
8959376	8960036	You're full of bloat?
8960697	8966919	Yeah, so basically, I mean, it's gonna obviously cause me to lose weight, I guess, which is good, but it's still very uncomfortable.
8967199	8968759	You know it's all water while you're sick.
8968999	8970320	Once you start eating, you'll retain again.
8972834	8973674	Is that it?
8974114	8978796	I want to make sure I'm super vague in how I put this.
8980236	8998382	In response to some things I've seen on Twitter, I just want to say an F you to somebody who tries to call out someone else's faults on things that happened in the past when that person themselves have lots of faults in their past that they have not apologized for and maybe ought to.
8999582	9000163	Just saying.
9002796	9003876	That's all I got to say about that.
9019582	9024967	See, we don't need those Wii U's, you know, because we've got other things to keep us occupied.
9024987	9039300	I know you think you guys are all fancy with your Miiverse channels and stuff like that, but hey, there's Xbox Verse in Japan, and Xbox Verse, I guess it's Hakuverse, and...
9041212	9049142	Apparently, like all things on the internet that are somewhat unregulated, it is full of penises.
9050023	9052406	Penis art, penis art, penis art.
9052746	9053588	TTP.
9054669	9056231	That's a lot of cock on your desktop there.
9057398	9058178	Yeah.
9058658	9059438	Oh, look, Chris Cock.
9060039	9063019	That's... Yes.
9064199	9066120	So, interesting.
9066360	9070921	But hey, it's out there, so that's kind of neat, I guess.
9071581	9074822	I don't know if they've got exactly the website here.
9075182	9075522	Let's see.
9075642	9086364	It's at xbox.verse.jp is where you can check it out, and I'm not sure how you can actually go about posting on there and stuff, but...
9088903	9089244	Xbox.verse.jp
9109064	9117648	There was that whole little story about the particular game too that was causing excessive TP.
9117728	9120770	I'm just surprised there's that big of a community around an Xbox in Japan.
9122411	9130796	The way you hear things online, you would think that there was no fans of Xbox in Japan whatsoever, but I guess it's not doing as terrible as you might think.
9132057	9137483	Well, speaking of penis, I mean, you know, why not another story that has to do with this?
9137683	9145473	And Custom Made 3D is an upcoming erotic game that's coming out with a very special attachment.
9145573	9147875	And it's called... Sorry.
9147895	9148116	Sorry.
9148496	9150517	It's called the Juicy Air.
9150697	9151697	Like, is this trolling?
9151737	9152838	Like, is this story for real?
9153138	9154558	Like, is this for real or am I being trolled?
9154578	9155098	I think it's for real.
9155118	9156199	They have an actual website.
9156299	9156939	Oh, my God.
9156959	9157359	All right.
9157399	9158479	Is it like a cup?
9158620	9159780	Let's go to the website.
9159820	9160280	Here's the thing.
9160380	9161100	It's a cup.
9161220	9171244	It is a wireless masturbation toy that reacts in real time to your stroke speed and depth, making this motion control, you know what?
9171684	9175367	So just pull a sausage out of the fridge and go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9175507	9180231	In-game characters react accordingly too with different characters reacting differently.
9180712	9185956	This peripheral has an analog stick and an action button as well as a right and left click.
9186376	9188678	Suddenly the term clicking your mouse has a whole new meaning.
9191501	9194263	You don't even have to take your hands off your wiener while you're playing.
9195484	9195984	There you go.
9198286	9203368	This story has been met with the response of dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot in chat room.
9205709	9209691	Rdgsinge in our chat room says, are there any special plans for episode 500?
9209872	9211152	Own a cup.
9211372	9214214	Well, after this story, there are now.
9215234	9216315	I'll be staying home.
9219356	9221778	That's our full video review of Custom Aid 3D.
9224545	9230829	I wonder if there's going to be one of those on... Oh, God.
9230969	9231349	Alright.
9232850	9233070	What?
9233571	9235612	Game Guru, talk about playing with your Wii.
9236627	9237808	Yes, there's pictures of it.
9237848	9238849	Look it up yourself.
9239009	9240810	We Jokes are seven years old.
9240870	9241391	What the hell?
9241451	9241711	All right.
9242472	9242852	That's it.
9243112	9246054	Just look up what an Ona Cup is and you'll see what it looks like.
9246074	9248276	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9248336	9251238	Surely you want to follow that story on our Skype line.
9251679	9253760	Penis!
9253780	9255122	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9255262	9258444	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9258604	9259325	All one word.
9261030	9264112	RawSteel UT in chat says, as long as we don't have to see the cup being used.
9264393	9266374	It could just be above the waist shots, that's all.
9271558	9274660	1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9274741	9279064	And while we wait for some calls, there's always last minute stories and Twitter topics.
9281406	9282486	Any last minute stories, Loki?
9282506	9284708	No.
9286810	9287010	No.
9287779	9288620	I don't really have anything.
9288640	9291182	I was looking at... So much for that.
9292203	9293304	I was just trying to look and see.
9293484	9295826	I had something, but it wasn't very important.
9296166	9297287	Oh, yeah.
9298628	9300130	This is kind of just a random tangent here.
9300510	9304253	The phone's blowing up, so write down your thought and we'll come back to it later because I want to get to the phone calls.
9304634	9305594	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9305614	9306015	Who's this?
9306715	9307336	Oh my god.
9307716	9308717	It is a blast from the past.
9308757	9309438	Raven's Dolphin.
9309518	9311159	Holy fucking shit.
9311199	9312520	It's Raven's Dolphin.
9312580	9313381	Oh my god.
9313401	9314242	I love...
9314562	9315923	You live, beware.
9316343	9316963	I live.
9317363	9318384	What a blast from the past.
9318404	9320144	Why is from your grave?
9320865	9322105	I have risen from my grave.
9322205	9325207	I escaped from the mental institution to call you guys.
9325447	9326367	Where the hell have you been?
9327248	9328588	I've been around.
9330189	9332170	Are you still doing your tech and games thing?
9332270	9333190	I am.
9333370	9334011	And guess what?
9334051	9335851	We're celebrating six years this month.
9336251	9339653	It actually became very successful and I want to thank you guys for giving me inspiration.
9339873	9345615	No, I know, it cracked me up, because I would see that all around the internet, the Tekken games thing, and I'm like, wow, that shit really blew up, didn't it?
9345655	9347436	I'm like, good for him, good for you, good for you.
9347576	9349276	Yeah, it worked out very well.
9349336	9352418	We went to Comic-Con, we went to Otakon, we did some things.
9353178	9354858	Did you get blessed by the E3 Pope yet?
9355559	9357619	No, we did not, but I'm not worried.
9357939	9359280	Soon, you'll get there, buddy, you'll get there.
9360679	9361240	It's happening.
9361280	9361740	It's happening.
9361780	9364643	But I came to call you not to talk about me.
9364703	9365864	God, it's you guys.
9366224	9369487	And you guys were talking about the Pokemon thing about gotta catch them all.
9369687	9369927	Yeah.
9370888	9373810	And, you know, the Wii U has built-in RFID chips.
9373830	9374171	It sure does.
9374191	9375572	So they could really easily do it.
9375912	9376313	Mm-hmm.
9376373	9377053	Yes, they could.
9378114	9381077	Weren't they at one point you were supposed to be able to tap your credit card on that?
9381097	9381377	Yeah.
9381457	9382077	See, that's the thing.
9382157	9383599	That was one of the stories that we didn't talk about.
9383859	9385180	They're working on that still.
9385220	9388403	It's not even coming out until, like, fall.
9388883	9391385	It's like, yeah, way to implement all your technology.
9391565	9398690	Yeah, but remember way back when I first talked about the Wii U and how it's like the Winchester Mystery House where you'll find all these doors that go nowhere and shit that's not finished built yet?
9399030	9403053	That's the Wii U. So that part is currently still under construction.
9403233	9404574	We're sort of stuck in the seance room.
9405355	9405835	Sort of.
9406476	9408077	And Ubisoft just locked another door.
9408597	9409117	But anyways.
9409238	9409618	Sure did.
9411179	9412100	Sure did.
9412240	9412340	Oh.
9412720	9413120	Yeah, go ahead.
9413661	9414641	I just have one more thing.
9414681	9415562	I'm going to keep this short.
9415922	9417303	It's about the Rayman Legend thing.
9417343	9417583	Mm-hmm.
9418832	9421613	You know, for me, it was bad PR from Ubisoft.
9421633	9424794	They should have just said it was coming out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox.
9425034	9428115	They should have just said, oh, it's an exclusive and then yanked the thing out.
9428535	9430716	But I want to say I understand why they did it.
9431717	9435038	But I felt like they should have played that way better than they did.
9436098	9437959	Are you a Wii U owner by chance?
9438099	9439199	I am a Wii U owner.
9439319	9440139	I own a PlayStation.
9440159	9440980	I own everything.
9441180	9442560	You know, I'm on Steam now.
9442680	9444681	I bought Mass Effect, so I will be playing it.
9445009	9446691	If I want to be listening to this show, I better be playing it.
9447172	9448814	I feel like we've raised you well.
9448894	9451718	Because I know you were a lot younger when you first started listening to OLR.
9451858	9452319	I'm so proud.
9452339	9453280	You are making us proud.
9453300	9454241	You have to play multiplayer.
9454561	9456204	Wait, are you playing Mass Effect on PC?
9457450	9458311	I only got one and two.
9458371	9461554	I bought it during the Steam sale, so I didn't play a lot of it yet.
9461654	9463576	I will play it, DarkSakura.
9463596	9463936	Don't kill me.
9463976	9464317	I have it.
9464577	9464957	I own it.
9465217	9465998	I'll buy it.
9466018	9468260	Let me know when you get to three so we can play multiplayer together.
9469902	9471964	You're doing better than Bobby Blackwolf in that regard.
9472004	9474846	That's good to know.
9475167	9475927	What was I going to say?
9476348	9476728	I don't know.
9476808	9477489	I don't know what else to say.
9477589	9478810	Oh, yes, you're a Wii U owner.
9478890	9480351	What do you think of the Wii U?
9480431	9481653	How are you feeling about your purchase?
9481673	9481773	No.
9482353	9485915	I have to say, my mom bought it, and I like the thing itself.
9486495	9489676	You know, me, I think my favorite feature is, it's remote.
9491117	9494739	You know what, that TV thing, did you check it out during the Super Bowl?
9495219	9495799	I did.
9496239	9502422	I checked it out when the Broncos were playing, and when they scored that touchdown, and then they lost, and I'm like, I'm done with this.
9502870	9510753	I was waiting for the Beyonce concert last weekend while I was sick, and I had the TV thing going on, and I was like, oh, these guys are throwing a football around before the Beyonce concert.
9511113	9511873	I'll check this out.
9512154	9517416	And it was actually kind of fun to look at the feedback people were giving on me.
9517436	9531401	A lot of it was just dumb internet shit, but it was kind of neat to have that right in front of me as I'm watching this game on the TV, which, believe it or not, there were some pretty lousy things that happened in the game that even I was like, wow, the 49ers are getting their ass kicked.
9531661	9532702	in the first half of this game
9551796	9579669	but my favorite meme that's come out of the whole thing is Tard, Tartar Sauce the grumpy cat saying blackout and then Tartar Sauce holding the plug or the Bane references were all over Twitter of course and that happened but my favorite gif I saw was the one where all the lights go out to bring this call full circle Raven's Dolphin when all the lights go out and then you see the stadium above and it goes out and then Team Rocket shows up that cracked me up that was great that was the winner
9580123	9582725	I'm sorry, that was my favorite part of the whole Super Bowl.
9582765	9584826	It's like people staring at the screen, what are we doing?
9584886	9587208	And then the beats after it were like, thank you, internet.
9587268	9588469	This is why you're awesome.
9588709	9590290	Was this Beyonce's fault?
9590450	9593732	Was Beyonce's performance so fierce that she blew the fucking power?
9593832	9594913	Like, that was my favorite.
9595053	9595814	That's my favorite.
9596394	9597575	That was good, too.
9597635	9599296	And I saw her at the inauguration.
9599376	9600457	She didn't blow out anyone.
9600957	9601177	Alright.
9601457	9603959	Well, Raven's Dolphin, please, pimp your shit.
9604079	9605880	It's six years, you've earned it.
9606741	9608122	Six years, thanks to you guys.
9608602	9609943	The website's called
9610253	9624431	techandgames.com it lives quite well with 833 fans on Facebook doesn't matter that's someone else's stuff I'm not like I didn't create that but you voted each and every one of them so you go boy
9625100	9627861	Yeah, thank you, Rob, for the time, and I know you have other calls.
9628101	9628541	Anytime.
9628721	9629202	Take care, buddy.
9629382	9629882	Good to hear from you.
9629902	9630122	Dude, bye.
9630182	9630742	Don't be a stranger.
9630942	9633403	Bye.
9633483	9636084	Uh, 1877 GameOLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLaundry.
9636104	9640406	Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to cut you off earlier, but when I saw that one popping up, I was like, blast from the past, holla.
9640426	9642327	I don't even remember what I was talking about now.
9643687	9644668	Isn't that how it goes?
9646909	9653192	Let's see, Tiger Claw giving us a gif here in the chat room and I just want to make sure that... Oh, god damn it.
9654113	9655133	This is great live radio.
9655353	9661036	I just want to make sure this is the right one because if it is, I insist that Ranma, our Tumblr administrator... What is the Tumblr?
9661076	9661977	Is it Orange Lounge Radio?
9662057	9666459	OrangeLoungeRadio.Tumblr.com I insist that this go on the Orange Lounge Radio Tumblr.
9666779	9667459	Yes, this is it.
9667479	9667679	Yeah.
9667840	9668300	Perfect.
9668500	9669440	Please repost that.
9669480	9669901	Perfect.
9671021	9672622	Yes, I insist that that be reposted.
9674999	9680144	1877 GameOLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9681845	9683086	Let's go to the phones and take another call.
9683366	9684347	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9684367	9684787	Who's this?
9685368	9686609	Hi, this is Ragenator.
9686709	9688851	Hey, Ragenator in video.
9689131	9689852	I see you.
9690252	9690812	Peekaroo.
9691413	9691833	What's up?
9693735	9697938	Well, I would have talked about this last week if there was a show last week.
9698659	9699460	Yeah, rub it in.
9699680	9700200	I was sick.
9700580	9701421	Rub it in.
9701681	9703503	I wasn't trying to rub anything in, but
9704589	9713854	With all the, since you kind of briefly talked about the topic in today's show, I have a somewhat related question.
9714575	9721058	Now, with all this talk about the Xbox 720, assuming that's what the final name is going to be called.
9721178	9723039	The Lube is the name of the week.
9723099	9724200	The Xbox Lube.
9725641	9727362	Or the PlayStation 4.
9727742	9731404	That kind of begs the question, at this point, do we really need
9732142	9736963	a new system from either Microsoft or the PlayStation 3 or from Sony.
9737263	9738503	I mean, think about it.
9738903	9742164	PlayStation 3 is, at this point, is really hitting stride.
9743224	9749485	And from my viewpoint, Microsoft still has a lot of life left with the 360.
9749685	9757387	I mean, I can't see them really improving graphics all that much with the next systems.
9759357	9761942	and there's a lot of great games coming out.
9763926	9769898	The only thing I can possibly see is doing like a 4K resolution or 8K, but
9770936	9775779	But nobody's, you can't, look at how well that went for 3D on the PlayStation 3.
9776200	9777821	Even that really hasn't cracked yet.
9778181	9786867	I think we can all assume PlayStation 4 is going to do this 4K, super high HD thing because Sony makes TVs and they want to sell a few of those too.
9787207	9791250	But I think, I want to go back to the question you were really asking and ask the panel here.
9791750	9797194	I think that's a great question because we've kind of answered this before a little bit but not since some of this news came up.
9797654	9799755	PlayStation 4 and Xbox Lube.
9800095	9800836	Do we really need it?
9801316	9802317	They're coming this year.
9802857	9803677	Is it necessary?
9803737	9804898	Does the industry need it?
9805058	9807379	Loki, you sell games for a living.
9807459	9808019	What do you think?
9809660	9811001	Are these systems needed right now?
9811541	9817984	No, because I don't think Nintendo... See, I'm surprised that they're not waiting to put these systems out because the Wii U...
9819045	9819225	Vita
9841902	9844303	Well, I don't know what they were trying to beat.
9844323	9847985	The price point's too high, and it's just, there's not any games coming out.
9848105	9861710	I'm kind of, like, you know, part of the reason I said, and I said this at the end of last year, we're making predictions for this year, and I originally predicted we wouldn't have the PlayStation 4, and my reason essentially was, we don't need one, and Sony has the Vita to work on still and so forth.
9861770	9865071	So actually, my opinion really hasn't changed, Ragenator.
9865512	9866212	I don't think we
9866732	9871073	I don't think that it's necessary at all, not yet anyway I think that they should be pushing any type of release until far later
9889935	9890776	You know, we don't need it.
9891076	9894299	We've got a system that... I understand the investor pressure, though.
9894560	9894800	Yeah.
9895260	9903809	But still, you know, I think that they need to keep working on strengthening what they have using the existing technology and then bringing out something really mind-blowing.
9904289	9907472	Ragenator, go ahead and get your thought out now that the call's back and then we can move on.
9908333	9908533	Sure.
9908753	9914199	Yeah, I was going to say, you know, at least with the higher resolution TVs out there and possible...
9915240	9921321	You know, using PS4 and Xbox 360 and 720 to work with those.
9921922	9936125	The trouble is, the adoption rate with the higher resolution TVs is pretty low, and from my perspective, the one problem with the adoption of those high resolution TVs is that
9936929	9942332	There's not really a whole lot of content, if any, for those higher resolution TVs.
9942432	9965405	Now, if broadcast TV and cable companies were to really go balls to the wall and support that stuff, plus now you have higher resolution videos, like, you know, whatever next-gen Blu-ray comes out or whatever, if that supports the high resolution, plus the games, then I can see...
9966337	9977727	Something new coming out or something that we can't even think of right off the bat that next system could potentially do that current systems can't do.
9977847	9983713	You know what, that's a good point because high definition in itself took a long time for us to really adopt.
9984133	9987354	It's still not a big adoption rate because look at Blu-ray.
9987374	9990336	Blu-ray, people aren't replacing their DVD collections with Blu-ray.
9990416	9993637	Even at least high-def TVs right now are pretty much all you can buy.
9993837	9995258	You can't even really buy standard def.
9995578	10002321	Well, you can secondhand, of course, but you can't even really walk into a Best Buy and find a standard def TV maybe way in the back or something.
10002701	10004201	I mean, it's all about HDTV.
10004682	10010924	At least now that's finally catching on where it's really the mainstream, but that took like 10 years to get there, a very long time.
10011244	10012285	But in the middle of that,
10012745	10017268	was the 360 and the PlayStation 3, which was like our first HD gaming.
10017649	10020331	So maybe the 4K thing is a preemptive strike.
10020651	10021291	But I don't know.
10021952	10022913	It could be way too early.
10023193	10025635	Anyway, Ragenator, gotta let you go to get more calls.
10025695	10026735	But thank you so much for the call, buddy.
10027476	10028056	Sure, no problem.
10028116	10028457	Take care.
10029257	10030798	And thanks for the video.
10030818	10035142	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10037463	10042005	RossDLUT saying VHS was around nearly 10 years after DVD.
10042285	10044466	That's true, you have the overlap that happens too.
10044486	10047847	Yeah, but A-Tracks didn't totally last that many years.
10047887	10059652	Also consider that these older generation systems could probably push better graphics because the original Xbox and even the PlayStation 2, some games did output to HD, like 720p and 1080i.
10062833	10065894	Assuming the games support it.
10066154	10067535	Not all of them, but some of them did.
10069515	10069835	All right.
10070716	10076318	While we wait for another call, maybe possibly, let's go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.
10076338	10077838	Actually, I'm going to bring it up on the desktop here.
10077878	10082120	I usually use my iPad for it, but I left that in the other room like a genius.
10083560	10084380	So I'll pull that up here.
10084420	10086521	I know at least there was a couple things from Tigerclaw in there.
10088319	10092547	of course it would help if I sign in as the right account help, someone buy me time
10093523	10097685	I'm broke, so we'll have... Words.
10099246	10101987	And Rob is actually signing into Twitter right now, everybody.
10102187	10107370	I am filling time so that we do not have... Except I can't remember the password to the stinking Twitter account because when you manage... Burrito!
10107550	10109751	When you manage four... The password is not burrito.
10110071	10111892	When you manage four Twitter accounts... Don't tell them that.
10112793	10114914	I'd love to see how many people try to log in with the wrong word.
10115094	10115554	That's true.
10116234	10119396	Log them out of his account because, you know, Twitter hacks and...
10119756	10120056	Yes, it is.
10142921	10144522	We're in the opening.
10145402	10148944	There's a little screen that talks about the Namco Museum and the network features.
10149404	10153366	And look very closely at the high scoreboard, and you'll see some familiar names.
10154247	10159449	And a big thank you to the OLR fans, or fan, who put us in a game.
10159629	10160150	Much thanks.
10160390	10162171	It doesn't get any better than that, right?
10162811	10164452	Like, I can quit now.
10164972	10165853	I made it in a video game.
10165913	10166673	I could die.
10166793	10167673	I can die now.
10168234	10169054	It's like butter.
10169775	10172196	And if you haven't checked it out yet, Bungie Fair Tossing.
10172876	10179498	Yes, especially with this unfortunate news about XNA this week where even though Microsoft hasn't updated it in three years, they basically said they're not going to.
10181058	10186339	Really unfortunate that indie games probably not going to be a thing on the Xbox Lube.
10186759	10187200	I don't know.
10187320	10188580	We're just left to hypothesize.
10188760	10191321	Maybe they've got something newer, bigger, better coming out, I hope.
10191761	10192821	But yes, support XNA.
10193101	10194922	Support the indie games.
10194962	10196763	It's not like indie games are cooked up overnight.
10197223	10201806	A lot of these guys started it a long time ago before they made these announcements about XNA.
10203687	10206529	Support indie games and start with Bungie Ferritossing.
10206549	10207229	That's a good one to pick.
10208650	10210591	A bunch of tweets from Tigerclaw.
10210611	10211712	I'll read a couple of them here.
10212932	10216914	Oh, this one's a My Little Pony story, but it's one... But no one cares, Skip.
10216954	10222597	No, no, no, it's worth reading, because they were actually making a fighting game, My Little Pony MLP Fighting is Magic.
10223298	10241947	Well, surprise, surprise, a cease and desist from Hasbro's legal representatives, and this was posted to their site at main6.com, asking them to stop the distribution of any materials that My Little Pony characters, names, locations, or elements from the show, including YouTube, Twitch, and so forth.
10243127	10249670	They attempted to negotiate Hasbro for the continued use of the property for their voluntary project, but they didn't get an answer.
10250010	10252391	Does this really surprise anybody?
10252932	10259114	If you're going to make a fan game like that or something, just do it on the download, release it, then do a cease and desist.
10259154	10259895	It's on the internet.
10259915	10260675	What are you going to do?
10260855	10262156	Don't hype it up.
10262916	10267098	If you're trying to recruit people, I guess that's one thing, but try to do it on the download because the more you hype it up...
10267478	10276143	The more visibility it's going to get, and then the company has an obligation to protect their trademarks and so forth to put the C&D out there.
10276383	10282227	And I don't think fighting ponies was what they wanted to have happen.
10283528	10287030	Obi-Wan Jabroni on OLR says, Hey, OLR, give me a shout-out.
10287070	10288231	It's fucking 5 a.m.
10288311	10288511	here.
10288951	10289391	Where are you?
10289572	10290092	It's 5 a.m.
10290152	10291133	Is that the UK?
10291513	10292614	Are you maybe in the military?
10293294	10294695	That could be the Mideast.
10294756	10295096	I don't know.
10295376	10298979	But shout out to you for it being pretty late.
10299099	10302742	I could do a shout, but then Rob's landlord would get complaints from the neighbors.
10304763	10307585	You can go listen to this week's Horde House and get a scream and shout.
10307645	10308406	That's all I'm going to say.
10309006	10310448	Let's go to one more call here on Skype.
10310768	10311729	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10311749	10312109	Who's this?
10313018	10313978	Hey, this is Actdeft.
10314078	10317039	It's like I say My Little Pony and then all of a sudden, look who's on the line.
10317079	10318040	What's up, Actdeft?
10319020	10325522	Well, BlackBull's gonna hate me for this, but yeah, I wanna talk about the Fighting This Magic game.
10326402	10330323	I'm only letting you do it because it's relevant to gaming talk right now.
10332244	10339146	This thing getting pulled was good news for you guys because it gives you an excuse to talk about it and be relevant, so go for it while you can.
10340037	10345640	Yeah, well, oh, Black Wolf.
10346401	10353285	Anyways, yeah, I'm pretty, well, sad that it got the cease and desist letter.
10353965	10359189	Though, yeah, it was eventually going to happen because it got a lot of media attention.
10360029	10369615	An article went up on GameSpot, and it also was competing to be the eighth game featured on the EVO tournament this year.
10372626	10397644	And like I said, it caught a lot of attention And it was almost finished They were pretty much on the final stage of development Well that means it's going to leak to the internet anyway And they'll just say, oh our computer was hacked And the finished version leaked to the internet Like that'll happen Didn't that happen to the Chrono Trigger thing that Square Enix shut down?
10397784	10398785	I'm almost positive it did
10399305	10401507	The music from that came out.
10401727	10403748	Once it hits the internet, it's never coming off.
10403788	10408932	If they were that close to finishing it, it'll leak in its beta form.
10408952	10415856	They'll find a way to do it where they will be able to wash their hands of any legal ramifications.
10416557	10426103	Surely you can see with all this attention, wasn't it getting to be a little too big for something that they really... If they didn't have Hasbro's sign-off on it, is this really that surprising?
10427628	10428088	No, it isn't.
10428788	10438012	Like I said, it was eventually going to happen, though most of us were expecting the game to be released.
10439532	10444194	We're actually looking forward to playing it because it was already leaked before.
10445114	10447496	So it's already out on the internet.
10447516	10450179	You can get it on the Pirate Bay and other sites.
10450359	10451120	Oh, well then shit.
10452121	10452941	You can't shut that down.
10453001	10456565	Yeah, but it's a pretty early build of it.
10456685	10460468	So it's somewhat buggy and it isn't complete.
10461329	10488006	but yeah even then it looked like a pretty good game it was like a regular game even a good fighting game and it was featured on EVO on their indie showcase last year so yeah it was like I said many people even in the fighting community were expecting a lot of it so yeah I just want to make sure it was still a good fighting game without the marijuana right?
10489457	10490558	I don't do drugs, so yeah.
10490818	10491558	Okay, alright.
10491818	10492358	Good answer.
10492398	10494019	Very good answer.
10494579	10495640	Winners don't do drugs.
10496020	10496920	Alright, yes, that's right.
10496960	10499862	Winners don't do drugs, and that is the real message here.
10499902	10504704	Alright, I gotta let you go before Black Wolf pulls the plug on the show, so take care, buddy.
10505664	10506365	You too, thanks.
10506525	10506745	Bye.
10509795	10511936	Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10512156	10514137	I think My Little Pony Call will do that.
10515797	10516757	Just fucking with you guys.
10517818	10520659	Let's do one more tweet because TigerCloud said a bunch of stories.
10520679	10522560	I want to do at least one more of these here.
10523640	10524200	We'll do this one.
10524240	10525060	It's a pinball story.
10525441	10526621	Pinball is always relevant.
10527281	10528582	Very cool pinball actually.
10528722	10532163	Star Wars pinball announced by Zen Studios.
10532816	10533977	Hell yes to this.

10593600	10597224	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us and supporting us through another week.
10597284	10601709	We are an independently produced show, literally done out of somebody's dining room.
10603090	10603871	Where we don't dine.
10603931	10605492	We have radio stuff set up anywhere.
10605512	10606393	I dine sometimes.
10606413	10606573	I snack.
10629571	10630451	My head still hurts.
10630471	10631072	I feel way too full.
10658934	10659695	Still feeling bloaty?
10660615	10661095	Sorry to hear it.
10661155	10662136	Uncomfortably so.
10663397	10663717	All right.
10663757	10666139	Better than how you were feeling yesterday, though.
10666419	10667539	Better than Friday, yes.
10667579	10667800	Yes.
10667920	10668180	All right.
