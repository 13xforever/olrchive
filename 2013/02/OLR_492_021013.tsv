7000	14000	Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, February 10th, 2013, a Wii U exclusive game is pushed back to go multi-platform.
20000	23000	Controversial rumors surround the next Xbox.
23000	27000	And could J.J. Abrams make a Portal movie after Star Wars?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio back on this February 10th for our 492nd episode after a week off last week.
47000	50000	I'll tell you why and give you all our sorry excuses in a minute.
50000	55000	But first, say hello to the well-rested and ready to go back for another week of OLR,
55000	57000	my co-hosts DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57000	58000	And I'm unemployed.
58000	61000	And you're unemployed. Funemployed is the preferred term.
61000	70000	Oh no. Not really having a lot of fun because I had what also caused the show to...
70000	76000	Yes. And if I didn't say it, my name is Rob Roberts. I can't remember if I introduced myself or not.
76000	77000	No you're not.
77000	80000	So, yes I am. How dare you question me?
80000	84000	Anyway, there is no question that we are also joined every week by the one and only...
84000	86000	Who wants to die for art?
86000	91000	Who wants to die for art? Oh, Loki. Techmaster Loki definitely doesn't want to die for art.
91000	92000	No I don't.
92000	94000	But he almost did over this weekend.
94000	95000	I didn't almost die.
95000	97000	And he's dying for that pizza he's eating right now.
97000	101000	Well, see that's the thing is my stomach hasn't stretched out I guess.
101000	104000	It only takes like a day for it to go back I guess.
104000	110000	And so I even got a small and I'm only able to eat half of it right now.
110000	111000	That's good.
111000	115000	Yeah, that's portion control right? Even though you want to eat the whole thing.
115000	116000	Yep.
116000	120000	It's alright I've already done my part. You know, sickness. Drop five pounds.
120000	124000	Speaking of sickness, it's a big part of the reason why we weren't here last week.
124000	129000	I actually got really sick. I was out of work on a Friday and a Monday.
129000	134000	And no I was not just trying to extend my weekend. I actually had the worst of it on Saturday and Sunday.
134000	137000	It's just the head cold from hell. I don't know what else to say about it.
138000	139000	Might have been a flu or something.
139000	142000	So I obviously didn't want these two coming over and getting sick.
142000	144000	Except I already had it.
144000	145000	Yeah I think you were sick anyway.
145000	147000	I was actually sick for about seven days.
147000	149000	I was like yeah I'll just come over anyway.
149000	152000	Yeah I know. Loki was like god dammit I'll come over. I'll just do the show by myself.
152000	156000	And we gotta talk about the news that's going on. It's such a busy week in gaming.
156000	160000	I'm like I know. I know it sucks to lose this week but let it go Loki.
160000	162000	So finally let it go.
163000	169000	And last week was also this little football game. A lot of people seem to care about what's going on.
169000	173000	And I know our local sports ball team lost which made a lot of people really unhappy.
173000	174000	I wore my team colors that day.
174000	175000	Did you?
175000	176000	I wore my N7 shirt.
176000	179000	And hid in the back room playing Mass Effect 2.
179000	182000	Here's a question for you.
183000	192000	Would you play a football game on Xbox if it was Turians vs. Humans vs. Corians or whatever?
192000	197000	I sincerely doubt that's ever going to happen. Yeah I would play it.
197000	200000	Really it's not going to happen in a company that owns both of those franchises?
200000	201000	That's right.
201000	203000	I really don't think it's going to happen.
203000	208000	Dark Sakura presents Turian Ball actually.
208000	209000	No.
209000	212000	Turian Balls might be a whole different type of game that Dark Sakura would want to present.
212000	220000	But anyway let's get into that face though. I wish this were a video show. It's not. It's Orange Laundromat Radio.
220000	224000	I was picturing it but all of my favorite fan artists have other plans.
227000	231000	How many X-rated Mass Effect fan art sites have you looked up in your time Dark Sakura?
231000	232000	Technically only one.
232000	233000	Oh.
233000	235000	But there's a few tumblers that I follow.
235000	237000	Oh I see. I see.
238000	241000	But if you don't go to their main page then it doesn't count.
241000	244000	Because it's just they got reblogged and there's nothing you can do about it right?
244000	247000	Oh well. Oops.
247000	248000	No.
248000	250000	Alright.
250000	255000	Before we get into how was our gaming weeks. You know one of the big things that did come up the week that we were off.
255000	258000	Loki I don't know if you heard about that one. I'm sure you did.
258000	261000	Sony kind of came out of nowhere and announced that they were going to.
261000	263000	They did an announcement of an announcement.
263000	266000	And you know how much do we hate this shit in the gaming industry.
266000	268000	But it's a little different this time.
268000	270000	Technically it's an announcement of a conference.
270000	280000	Well okay. But we let Sony slide a little bit because all the rumor and all the buzz is that this big thing they're going to be doing on February 20th is the big unveil of the PlayStation 4.
280000	282000	Because if it's not it's going to be very disappointing.
282000	284000	Right? It's kind of like they have to.
284000	288000	It's like hey we got PlayStation Home. I don't fucking care.
288000	301000	Well it's funny because when that was all unfolding I was at work and I was like on one of my 15 minute breaks at work like trying to furiously catch up on Twitter and I saw what some of the other indie podcasters I follow were saying on it and like OMG PlayStation 4.
301000	309000	And I said why are we getting off. What if this isn't like a PlayStation Vita conference like a Nintendo Direct style. Here's the upcoming Vita games.
309000	311000	Like why are we all so quick.
311000	314000	Why are we all so quick to assume it's PlayStation 4.
314000	329000	But then what ended up Forbes or Wall Street Journal or one of those more financial magazines or excuse me newspapers went with a rumor which they don't typically tend to do unless they really put a lot of stock in it that yes it's going to be PlayStation 4.
329000	339000	And you know I I've said on Orange Lawn Radio I don't believe that Sony is under any obligation to put PlayStation 4 out this year.
339000	347000	We've talked you know we talked at the end of last year about what might be the big shocker next year and I even kind of said that PlayStation 4 might not happen this year.
347000	353000	But you know I'm OK being wrong. It happens. Oh my God games analysts sometimes don't know that yet.
354000	362000	I mean it's true. But come on you're right. Sony has even if it's Vita Vita Vita Vita and then little tiny teaser about PlayStation 4.
362000	369000	They will have said something about PlayStation 4 which they have to do at this point. Right. No I think they have to.
369000	372000	Sony doesn't have to say what Sony doesn't want to say.
372000	380000	But the disappointment would be so huge now that everybody's hyped it up like if if it wasn't PlayStation 4 Sony would have already said stop getting your hopes up.
380000	387000	The fact that they haven't come out and made a very clear statement it's not PlayStation 4 would have troll says a lot troll.
387000	391000	I don't think it's a troll. Sony's not in a position to do something like that.
391000	395000	But now that you're looking you know going up to this February 20th conference it makes a lot of sense.
395000	402000	They're trying to get around the typical convention cycle of release your news to E3.
402000	415000	They purposely are doing this ahead of Microsoft a couple weeks after one of their execs even said we have no reason to show our cards before Microsoft which is a very interesting sort of turnaround.
415000	421000	It's also the week before destination PlayStation where they meet with all their retail partners and stuff like that.
421000	426000	So perhaps you know this is ahead of that and game developers conferences in March too right.
426000	437000	So you know they might they might have some things to say or show about that because certainly you've got to have the third party support and get the other developers on board pretty early as another company is learning the hard way this week.
437000	440000	We'll get into that later.
440000	451000	It's very interesting now because Sony will be the talk of everything between February and whenever Microsoft finally announces whatever they're doing which could be E3 at this point.
451000	456000	Although why not announce it a little earlier. It won't be because that's not how they did the 360.
456000	459000	That's true it's not how they did the 360.
459000	468000	I don't know I just have another thought about Sony keeping quiet for the sake of raising that speculation and gathering interest.
468000	478000	Because I mean that even if they don't mention anything more than like a little teeny thing about the PS4 they're building all the suspense and getting people interested in what they're going to say.
478000	488000	Oh yeah it's definitely it's definitely the hype machine is in full force now and that's you know what 2013 is going to be is it's going to be the year of the as somebody called it this week Gen 4 consoles.
488000	492000	I think Sony themselves called it Gen Gen 4 consoles in an unrelated discussion.
492000	494000	So what's the Nintendo minus five.
494000	499000	I know right. It's like oh I see the console generations didn't start till Sony got to the table.
499000	502000	I think it's in reality what we're getting into the ninth generation.
503000	510000	I know that the Magnavox it was the Odyssey the Fairchild were considered Gen 1.
510000	512000	Atari was Gen 2.
512000	525000	So because yeah the Odyssey the Magnavox Odyssey came out in 79 and the Fairchild Channel F I think came out right around the same time or right before that maybe.
525000	533000	And then there were the eighth generation Texas Instruments systems came out in 81 so did the 2600.
533000	542000	Well all this numerology aside and you know whoever gets to come out there with their big wand and say I dub this the eighth generation of games.
542000	545000	This is definitely all about you know this year is going to be about what's next.
545000	551000	And for this for the second or third time in this show's history talking about next gen gaming.
551000	553000	So it's going to be a very exciting year.
553000	560000	One of the thing though I think and I wanted to touch on this is I find it very interesting that Sony is kind of going to the Web.
560000	561000	They're taking their case to the Internet.
561000	566000	I find it a move very inspired in part by what Nintendo Direct is doing.
566000	572000	And you know Sony got a lot of shit the year they unveiled the PlayStation 3 and rightfully so.
572000	574000	That press conference was a hot mess.
574000	577000	I mean we made fun of it on this show for years and years.
577000	582000	Giant enemy crabs five hundred ninety nine U.S. dollars Ridge Racer Africa.
582000	585000	That was a no Africa was the next year was it.
585000	587000	Yeah I think you know I don't think it was.
587000	589000	Well whatever it was a fucking mess.
589000	595000	I mean it was a it was an awesome mess and we loved it as gamers but Sony doesn't want to make that same mistake twice.
595000	605000	So why not have a nice polished pre-edited presentation that they deliver directly to the Internet's which I also think is fascinating is that.
605000	609000	E3 is losing some of its relevance in that regard.
609000	611000	Now I'm I'm not out here saying E3 is dead.
611000	612000	Oh my God.
612000	614000	And you know E3 has its place.
614000	615000	It's important.
615000	628000	Yes but it's very interesting that E3 is not going to have the big reveals of either of these consoles although certainly some of the big game announcements and some of the specifications release dates prices.
628000	631000	A lot of that probably won't come out tell E3.
631000	636000	Don't expect you're going to know the release date and the price of this machine on February 20th.
636000	637000	Not going to happen.
637000	644000	I feel very confident in saying that because Sony does kind of want to size up what their competition is doing before they're ready to announce something like that.
644000	652000	And just the price of parts can can fluctuate that much in the time period between February and when this thing actually gets released.
653000	663000	So anything that you are looking forward to or not out of this particular event on the 20th because it's only 10 days away at this point.
663000	665000	No I'm not even really considering anything.
665000	667000	I just can't.
667000	668000	I don't know.
668000	671000	It'd be nice to see what they had planned for the Vita already.
671000	674000	You know as I mentioned on Twitter I got rid of mine.
674000	680000	So yes someone was interested in making an offer on it before someone put it on eBay.
680000	682000	Yeah I noticed that all came up.
682000	683000	That was in the two week break.
683000	685000	You sold your Vita during two week break.
685000	686000	Yeah.
686000	693000	So you know there there's really nothing coming out for the Vita and the PlayStation 3.
693000	698000	It's just not really not a whole lot of stuff that excites me about that.
698000	700000	So I don't know.
700000	704000	I mean it would be interesting to see what they have the offer what's going to be unique.
704000	708000	Once again it's going to have to be something that's like kind of this big wow factor thing.
708000	710000	That's that's really what did it for the Wii.
710000	719000	The Wii may not have been technologically superior but it was like hey look you're going to be able to play games a completely different way than you've ever played games before.
719000	721000	And that's why it took off.
721000	729000	Now that everybody kind of has the same type of thing it's I mean they tried it with the Wii U and it just didn't quite have the same.
729000	733000	No now you're going to be able to play games using this tablet and the TV.
733000	737000	Well you kind of people were used tablets is on new thing.
737000	738000	It's I don't know.
738000	740000	It didn't have the same splash.
740000	751000	I just really hope that this you know new console you know I think we've heard a lot about not necessarily this console may not be so much about the technological aspect of it but kind of the way it integrates itself.
751000	761000	The gaming you know a true entertainment box and that whole you know social gaming becoming more prevalent and Gaikai integration you know how is that going to be a factor and so forth.
761000	771000	One thing I really fear though is that I really fear all the execs sitting in the boardroom and we all know just about every bad decision made in gaming starting in a boardroom somewhere right.
771000	775000	And I'm really worried that everybody's just tapping into Facebook.
775000	777000	We've got to have a piece of Facebook gaming.
777000	778000	Facebook is gaming.
778000	779000	That's what people want.
779000	784000	People want Facebook and they want the mobile games and the OUYA and that that's what the people want.
784000	791000	And we've got to have like a one button integration that goes to Facebook and so forth and we've got to have games playable on Facebook that are on the PlayStation 3.
791000	795000	And I'm just like God I hope not because that really feels like a step backwards to me.
795000	800000	If we go all like Farmville on PlayStation 3 that can be one element of it.
800000	802000	But I really hope that's not the focus.
802000	806000	I don't think that they're going to do that because they've been kind of more you know core audience.
806000	814000	Once again you know in this the same thing what I've been reading all these you know oh there's rumors that the Xbox is not going to be able to play used games.
814000	817000	Oh there's rumors that the PlayStation 3 is not going to be able to play used games.
817000	823000	Well then you know I guess I'll just have to get an Xbox you know because the PlayStation doesn't you know it's not going to be able to play used games.
823000	826000	Hey no one's forcing to buy a new console.
826000	827000	No one is forcing.
827000	832000	In fact here's the thing is if people don't like it enough and they don't buy the console guess what they have to do something else.
832000	842000	Publishers will make games for the consoles that are actually selling and are out there if you know the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox whatever the next system is going to be called.
842000	849000	Flop or if they're just not selling well you're going to still be able to get awesome new games on the current platforms that you have now.
849000	853000	And then they'll have to come out and retool something until it's to what you like.
853000	858000	So that's the thing is no one's forcing you at gunpoint to buy a new console for the next generation.
858000	863000	So I don't understand why anybody should feel you know like that this is your own choice.
863000	866000	Just listen to what their options are and then make a decision.
866000	875000	Or hey trust me if you decide not to buy a new console there's plenty of games you know seven generations worth of games that you can go play.
877000	882000	Going to the chat room of course we always do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
883000	888000	We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
888000	892000	And a big thank you to all those of you that have turned up live tonight.
892000	899000	I know we have a lot of competition going on tonight with the silly Grammys on TV which I think are one of the worst of all the award shows.
899000	902000	But people still seem to want to watch it anyway so there's that.
902000	908000	Walking Dead is going on right now the premiere which you know okay at least I can understand that one a little more.
908000	910000	But that is why you have the DVR.
910000	919000	But anyway for whatever reason people it's a little thinner in chat tonight but we do appreciate those you guys that have turned out tonight to say hello.
919000	923000	And leave some of the comments at live.vognetwork.com.
923000	930000	WhatupG says Jack Trenton said that they didn't believe in not making a system where you couldn't play used games on.
931000	939000	I you know I know we're going to get into this a little more later in the show but I just don't think Sony or Microsoft for that matter is that stupid.
940000	944000	But I mean again every bad decision comes from a boardroom somewhere.
944000	947000	It's incredibly ballsy to try something like that.
947000	951000	I think that's a good way to put it. That would be a ballsy move.
951000	955000	That's basically saying hey you know buy sell trade retailers we don't need you.
955000	961000	And when they say buy sell trade retailers we mean GameStop and they need GameStop.
961000	964000	And that's just going back to what you said Loki.
964000	969000	It just encourages people not to buy it and so publishers are stuck making games for the systems we already have.
969000	974000	It's got to be everybody's on board or not. And even then if everybody's on board with it people will go elsewhere.
974000	979000	I mean at this point they're not the only companies making consoles.
979000	985000	I mean granted you know there's going to be you know the Ouya which is Android based and stuff and that may not be what you're looking for.
985000	989000	But it's open. It's more open than these consoles are.
989000	995000	So if they try to do something like that which they're not I just don't see it working out for them.
995000	999000	Act Deaf in our chat room and the PSP didn't catch up at all.
999000	1003000	The Vita seems like it's going the way of the PSP or worse.
1003000	1006000	Is the Vita host at this point? Do you think Sony?
1006000	1010000	I mean I know you just sold yours this week so maybe I can already tell your perspective.
1010000	1014000	But has Sony written the Vita off? Is the Vita done for?
1014000	1017000	I don't think they've written it off but they sure didn't start off very well.
1017000	1022000	Because the problem was they outsourced a lot of their big games for the Vita.
1022000	1026000	Like the Resistance game which should have been one that should have been a system seller right there.
1026000	1029000	It's going to be an awesome first person shooter that will really shut off the Vita.
1029000	1030000	And it was terrible.
1030000	1035000	And then you have that same company for whatever reason also do Call of Duty.
1035000	1038000	Which you know Call of Duty should have been a system seller right there.
1038000	1042000	You have a portable first person shooter Call of Duty game that's going to be fucking awesome.
1042000	1046000	You're going to be able to take it on the road and have the console quality experience on the road.
1046000	1051000	And it sucks because you have the same company that made the really terrible first person shooter Resistance game do that.
1051000	1058000	And now you know they had even like Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which was supposed to be alright.
1058000	1063000	But I don't think it was you know it's I don't know if it sold systems.
1063000	1069000	But now they're kind of you know the thing was now the next game that's supposed to be this.
1069000	1072000	Oh this is really going to define the system is Killzone.
1072000	1075000	Which that's cool that it's a first person shooter in Killzone.
1075000	1078000	But I just I'm not a big fan of the Killzone franchise.
1078000	1083000	So for me looking at the outlook of what's coming out for the Vita there just wasn't anything there for me.
1083000	1087000	That's why I got rid of it because I just had nothing I wanted to play on it.
1087000	1092000	What happened about what happened with things like Final Fantasy 10 remake?
1092000	1094000	Oh well that that's still way the hell down there.
1094000	1096000	And who cares it's a remake of Final Fantasy 10.
1096000	1101000	Well the whole HD part there's some parts about that that are relevant to my interests.
1101000	1106000	Whatever I mean I just I played 10 already.
1106000	1113000	I agree that you can't you know you can't support your system with nothing but remakes Nintendo.
1113000	1117000	But you know it's it's it helps.
1117000	1123000	It's just not I mean that's that's nice in addition to other things but it just wasn't what I was looking for.
1123000	1128000	And granted maybe I should have tried you know like Little Big you know Little Big Planet or something like that.
1128000	1132000	But I don't even touch Little Big Planet anymore on the PlayStation 3.
1132000	1136000	So I just didn't see myself buy another Little Big Planet game not to play.
1136000	1141000	And I tried PlayStation you know All-Stars Battle Royale and they just it wasn't my thing.
1141000	1147000	I mean I'm not even really a huge fan of Smash Brothers but at least Smash Brothers seemed like I don't know it was kind of more fun.
1147000	1153000	I guess I can identify not really identify the characters but you know the characters were a little bit more.
1153000	1154000	I don't know how to really put it.
1154000	1159000	It's just like I don't really have any I guess any attachments to any of these characters in the Sony game.
1159000	1164000	I guess it's like you know Jack and Daxter. Cool. I haven't really played any of those games or Sly Cooper.
1164000	1169000	You know I I don't really care about that series. There just wasn't a lot of stuff there.
1169000	1172000	Now if they announce Grand Theft Auto and it was coming out in March that'd be a whole different story.
1172000	1177000	I'd probably be still keeping that system or it just if they announce hey Grand Theft Auto is coming to the Vita.
1177000	1183000	Yeah I'd be still sticking on to that but it's just nothing that I really wanted for it was coming out.
1183000	1191000	And it was kind of the same problem with the 3DS because remember the 3DS was when they were talking about 3DS it was like hey Saints Row DJ Hero coming to the 3DS.
1191000	1199000	I was like fuck yes. That is that sold the system for me Saints Row on the go and and DJ Hero that'd be pretty awesome.
1199000	1202000	And then neither one came out so I was like ah fuck that.
1202000	1204000	Yeah that was disappointing.
1204000	1208000	But really overall what it is is it's just I don't have time for portable gaming anymore.
1208000	1215000	It's like I don't go anywhere. I don't need a portable system. So there's really no need for me to have this.
1215000	1222000	Some comments from chat. Tiger Claw says Sly Cooper is awesome and Act Def says Loki you should totally play Sly Cooper for real.
1222000	1230000	Well then cool I can pick it up on my PS3 but I'm not it once again it's just I didn't I don't need a portable system anymore.
1230000	1235000	It's what it is. I just don't need it because I don't I don't ever find myself like commuting.
1235000	1239000	Or something like that like on a train for a long distance time where I you know kill time.
1239000	1244000	I just don't have any of that so I'll stick to console gaming for now.
1244000	1249000	All right well we'll see what develops in the Sony front in about 10 more days.
1249000	1254000	Meanwhile let's talk about what we have been playing in gaming the past couple weeks while we've been gone.
1254000	1258000	What a little segment we call how is your gaming week. Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?
1258000	1263000	Busy actually. I played some Mass Effect 2 of course.
1263000	1268000	I actually don't think I logged into WoW at all which is weird.
1268000	1272000	And I started Dragon Age 2 which I really like the game.
1272000	1276000	I liked it when I played it before it just you know killed my hand to play on the Xbox.
1276000	1281000	So I'm playing it on PC and I'm having a really good time with it.
1281000	1286000	And we have had another addition to our gaming family.
1286000	1292000	Dan got a new driving wheel and has set up a three monitor rig which I think I put photos of before.
1292000	1299000	But he also found out that Borderlands 2 will work with it so it was funny watching him play three monitors.
1299000	1301000	Oh wow I didn't know Borderlands 2 did that set up that's awesome.
1301000	1306000	Yeah and what else was it that I was playing?
1306000	1314000	Oh yeah we got another Super Nintendo that came with a box of games and among them was Pocky and Rocky 2.
1314000	1318000	Which goes for oh unboxed a good 90 bucks on eBay.
1318000	1320000	It's a pretty rare Super Nintendo game.
1320000	1321000	It's got a whole batch for 50.
1321000	1322000	Where did you find all this?
1322000	1323000	Goodwill.
1323000	1324000	Oh really?
1324000	1325000	Yeah.
1325000	1326000	Wow.
1326000	1327000	You know what else I got at Goodwill?
1327000	1329000	An earring Magic Ken.
1329000	1330000	In the box.
1330000	1331000	That's awesome though.
1331000	1332000	For 10 bucks.
1332000	1336000	You found such a gaming motherlode I guess of sorts.
1336000	1343000	Since we've already got a bajillion other Super Nintendos we're gonna sell this one with a copy of Super Mario World.
1343000	1346000	We'll put it up on Craigslist and I'll share the link later.
1346000	1348000	Dan's also selling his old driving rig.
1348000	1352000	And I got a copy of Mega Man X out of it cause you got dupes so I can't complain.
1352000	1358000	Well we've got a bunch of other dupes too but Dan and I sat all that night that first night and played Jeopardy together.
1358000	1365000	Like the deluxe Jeopardy and he's like I don't know what area to pick now I know all this other stuff what about this?
1365000	1367000	I was like just pick the French Revolution.
1367000	1371000	And then I started answering all the questions in the French Revolution cause you know me I'm a stupid history nerd.
1371000	1374000	And he was like oh my god you knew all those.
1374000	1378000	I was like yeah you married a smart woman hi.
1378000	1384000	And like Wheel of Fortune we played Wheel of Fortune and Super Tech Mobile.
1384000	1388000	But the best Super Nintendo board game was Clue and I have it.
1388000	1389000	It was awesome.
1389000	1391000	It was kind of not like the board game actually.
1391000	1397000	We had it like it came with like what else came in that pack was some Super Scope stuff like Yoshi's Island.
1397000	1399000	Not Yoshi's Island Yoshi's Safari.
1399000	1401000	The Super Bazooka was so cool.
1401000	1408000	We don't have a Super Scope though so that's gonna probably be on our list cause I liked Yoshi's Safari.
1408000	1411000	The Super Bazooka was so awesome that little game that came with it was pretty cool.
1411000	1412000	I liked Blastress.
1412000	1413000	Yeah Blastress.
1413000	1416000	Yeah we've got like a bajillion Super Scope 6 copies now.
1416000	1418000	And another Mario paint even though we have no mouse.
1418000	1420000	We have the mouse pad we have no mouse.
1420000	1425000	And what else Battle Clash not Battle Clash.
1425000	1426000	Battle Chess?
1426000	1429000	No not Battle Chess it was another Super Scope game that's like.
1429000	1431000	I know what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah.
1431000	1432000	Yeah.
1432000	1433000	The other Super Scope 6 game.
1433000	1435000	Or Metal something.
1435000	1436000	Yeah.
1436000	1438000	Yeah something tank thing.
1438000	1440000	I'm sure somebody in chattel yelled out but yeah.
1440000	1443000	We also what else came in that collection?
1443000	1446000	I said Wheel of Fortune right?
1446000	1449000	No Wheel of Fortune came with it.
1449000	1453000	Killer Instinct also came with it.
1453000	1454000	What'd you find?
1454000	1455000	Battle Clash.
1455000	1456000	Battle Clash that's it.
1456000	1458000	Was the game I think you were thinking of.
1458000	1462000	There was also this is the long list of games that supported the Super Scope.
1462000	1467000	Battle Clash, Bazooka Blitzkrieg, The Hunt for Red October had bonus games in it.
1467000	1470000	Lamborghini American Challenge had mini games.
1470000	1474000	Lemmings 2 The Tribes had calibration.
1474000	1478000	Metal Combat, Falcon's Revenge, Operation Thunderbolt I remember that one.
1478000	1480000	I think we got that one too.
1480000	1484000	T2 the Arcade Game, 10 Star, X Zone, and Yoshi Safari.
1484000	1489000	And that of course is besides the Super Scope 6 game in the game itself.
1489000	1494000	We got something like I want to say 12 games or so with the system.
1494000	1501000	So Dan and I also sat down because he took a few days off and I'm fun employed.
1501000	1506000	We catalogued all of our games that we have at our house right now.
1506000	1513000	And this isn't including what we've loaned out or what's not at the house given that would be our Atari.
1513000	1517000	All of our Atari games which would be 2600, 5200, 7800.
1517000	1520000	We did get links though with links at the house.
1520000	1523000	Our Cliccovision Intellivision and Odyssey.
1523000	1525000	Odyssey 2 collection.
1525000	1530000	So we catalogued 1279 individual games.
1530000	1532000	And we had dupes of some of them.
1532000	1534000	That's a lot of games.
1534000	1539000	Now some of the games are also duped in that too but we also counted in the box and out of the box.
1539000	1542000	And special editions and regular editions are separate.
1542000	1545000	So I would say independent skews. How does that work?
1545000	1547000	Fair enough.
1547000	1550000	Even though you're not a Best Buy but that works.
1550000	1554000	I forgot that we had two copies of Cyberbots.
1554000	1559000	But Dan and I are actually starting to think about selling off some of our dupes.
1559000	1564000	So we're giving friends and OLR listeners first crack.
1564000	1567000	So I'll let you guys know when that's happening.
1567000	1571000	Alright. Very retro-tastic week it sounds like. It's awesome.
1571000	1574000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?
1574000	1576000	What have you been sick?
1576000	1578000	Let's see what did I do.
1578000	1581000	I played a bit of Minecraft I built.
1581000	1584000	I'm not really sure what it is. Small bridge I guess.
1584000	1586000	Oh yeah I played that too.
1586000	1589000	I just noticed our dynamic map is not working correctly.
1589000	1593000	It's showing someone else's world which is not of my interest.
1593000	1602000	I actually played a little bit of Saints Row the third today because I had left some of my games at work and I wanted to play those.
1602000	1604000	Saints Row happened to be in my bag.
1604000	1610000	Then I realized I don't have my save game anymore because I only have one more thing I have to do.
1610000	1615000	100% all the achievements. Well actually 100% all the activities.
1615000	1622000	And I can't find my save for Saints Row anymore.
1622000	1624000	I have no idea where it's at.
1624000	1628000	It's on a memory card somewhere and I think I deleted it actually so.
1628000	1631000	Damn. That kind of sucks.
1631000	1633000	I really don't want to play that game again.
1633000	1637000	I mean maybe later on but it's not.
1637000	1641000	I just don't want to do all those activities again because some of those are really annoying.
1641000	1644000	And then let's see what else.
1644000	1649000	I also played a little bit of Forza Horizon just mainly working on some decals.
1649000	1655000	I played a small bit. Well we played some Borderlands 2 this week.
1655000	1661000	And just kind of going through all the missions again because New Game Plus it wouldn't.
1661000	1665000	Wanted to do all the side missions but we're just kind of doing that right now.
1665000	1668000	Did the Minecraft easter egg which is kind of fun.
1668000	1673000	And what else did I do? Let's see.
1673000	1678000	Skyrim. More Skyrim. My modded game on PC.
1678000	1681000	It's getting really buggy.
1681000	1685000	Probably because I'm not supposed to put 87 mods on it.
1685000	1688000	I actually removed some because I had 90 something there at one point.
1688000	1692000	But yeah lots of mods in that game.
1692000	1695000	It's awesome because the game is so large.
1695000	1701000	Once again I don't know. I can't remember what's part of the game and what's a mod.
1701000	1707000	At least some of this stuff. I mean obviously The Realm of Chuck Norris wasn't in the original Skyrim.
1707000	1709000	But it's fun.
1709000	1713000	And I did try the Dovah Bear mod and it got annoying.
1713000	1718000	Because Dovah Bear like most of the other NPCs in some games it just kept walking in front of me.
1718000	1724000	And like trapping me in places because it just wouldn't get out of my way.
1724000	1728000	And I wanted to attack things and just stand there growling.
1728000	1732000	And I'm like fuck it you know by the time you're done doing your little growling animation.
1732000	1735000	And you know finally go try to attack something.
1735000	1738000	I'm just going to go kill it instantly because I'm super powered anyways.
1738000	1740000	So I don't fucking need you Dovah Bear.
1740000	1743000	So I got rid of that mod.
1743000	1746000	But yeah that's pretty much my game week.
1746000	1749000	And of course sold the Vita. So that was it.
1749000	1751000	My gaming week.
1751000	1754000	Last week when I was sick I played a lot more Ni No Kuni.
1754000	1757000	Which I talked about on a previous episode of the show.
1757000	1761000	Still enjoying it even though I'm about to that 15-16 hour mark.
1761000	1764000	And of course I've taken a pretty big break the past few days.
1764000	1768000	But I don't know. I played a lot of console games when I was sick.
1768000	1771000	So I've kind of not been wanting to do that because I haven't been sick since Monday.
1771000	1775000	But I do still intend on finishing Ni No Kuni at some point.
1775000	1778000	I'm doing a lot of PC gaming this week. Warcraft of course.
1778000	1780000	Because there's a lot going on on that front.
1780000	1784000	But there's another PC game I've actually spent quite a bit of time with.
1784000	1786000	That I've been getting into quite a bit.
1786000	1789000	And I think this game is pretty rad.
1789000	1792000	And would you believe it? It's a free game.
1792000	1795000	Which really surprises the hell out of me.
1795000	1797000	Because the quality of it is pretty darn good.
1797000	1799000	Path of Exile is the name of the game.
1799000	1802000	And I don't know if you guys are familiar with this game at all.
1802000	1805000	Path of Exile is a free game.
1805000	1809000	And it is put out by Gear Grinder Games.
1809000	1811000	I might have messed that up. Sorry.
1811000	1813000	I don't have the notes in front of me.
1813000	1817000	But it's got microtransactions in it.
1817000	1823000	But they are very big on saying that they want to do ethical microtransactions.
1823000	1827000	They don't want to do the type of microtransactions that would hold you back in a Zynga game.
1827000	1829000	Like an energy meter running out or something.
1829000	1834000	They sell cosmetics, spell effects, pets.
1834000	1837000	And if you look at their marketplace, that is the kind of stuff they're selling.
1837000	1842000	Along with extra character slots and extra stash things and so forth.
1842000	1847000	The money factor is not holding the game back, whatever.
1847000	1851000	Which I believe technically the game is still considered open beta right now.
1851000	1853000	And probably will be in beta for a long time.
1853000	1855000	Kind of like Gmail is.
1855000	1859000	Path of Exile is a Diablo clone of sorts for lack of a better term.
1859000	1861000	That's the best way I could explain it to you.
1861000	1864000	If you've played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2 or even Diablo 3.
1864000	1867000	You pretty much get the gist of what Path of Exile is going to be like.
1867000	1870000	And it does have the fully online integration.
1870000	1873000	Where you can get other people to join your game while you're going.
1873000	1877000	And you can party up to take on mobs that will be of an increased difficulty.
1877000	1879000	Let's see.
1879000	1884000	Also, there are six classes in the game.
1884000	1894000	And everything is kind of based around the three kind of guiding stats of intelligence, strength, dexterity.
1894000	1897000	And so you have one class that's very focused in each of those areas.
1897000	1900000	Like I play a witch, which is the intelligence focused class.
1900000	1903000	But then there's other classes that are like strength meets dexterity.
1903000	1906000	Strength meets intelligence, which I think is like the Templar.
1906000	1907000	And so on and so on.
1907000	1910000	And everything is very dictated by the colors that go along with those stats.
1910000	1912000	Because you get gems that are those colors.
1912000	1914000	Most items have sockets in them.
1914000	1917000	All the abilities are driven by gems.
1917000	1926000	And where this game gets really interesting is that you get gems that modify abilities if you have them in a connected socket.
1926000	1929000	Like for example, let's say I have a blue gem that makes fire.
1929000	1931000	And I do like a little fire bolt.
1931000	1935000	Well, when I beat a quest later on, I might get another gem that's called Fork.
1935000	1941000	And if I put Fork and I tie it in a socket that adjoins with the fire spell.
1941000	1943000	I will get a fireball that forks.
1943000	1945000	So it splits up.
1945000	1951000	So it's pretty cool because it kind of gives it this way of like developing your own spells in a way.
1951000	1954000	There is no gold in the game.
1954000	1957000	Which I found very interesting at first.
1957000	1959000	But everything is basically barter.
1959000	1964000	The scrolls of Identify and the scrolls of Town Portal kind of become your currency.
1964000	1966000	Which is really interesting to me.
1966000	1972000	The way you level up your characters is basically Final Fantasy X's Crystallarium.
1972000	1974000	I can't really explain it any better.
1974000	1978000	But it's this gigantic map where you move through all these different talents.
1978000	1981000	And I think the level cap in the game is like 100.
1981000	1985000	So you can imagine this leveling chart is gigantic.
1985000	1989000	And there are so many ways that you could screw up your build.
1989000	1994000	Because one of the tiny drawbacks is that there are very few ways to respec.
1994000	1998000	You can respec a little bit limited one point or two.
1998000	2002000	But if you screw up your class, you're stuck with it and you'll have to roll again or whatever.
2002000	2005000	But yeah.
2005000	2007000	Did I mention this game is free?
2007000	2010000	So how can I sit here and really complain about it at all?
2010000	2012000	The graphics are really good.
2012000	2014000	They're optimized very well.
2014000	2020000	Especially because I even have problems in games like Diablo 3 and Warcraft sometimes.
2020000	2024000	But the graphics are optimized very well in Path of Exile.
2024000	2032000	And I guess the only maybe little drawback I would say is that I feel like the camera is always zoomed in too much.
2032000	2038000	And although you can zoom in a little bit to kind of see your character a different way for screenshots or whatever.
2038000	2042000	You can't zoom out enough which can kind of be a bitch in multiplayer modes.
2042000	2047000	But that is one tiny ass gripe in the scope of what is really a great game.
2047000	2053000	That if you're a fan of Diablo or Torchlight or any of that stuff, this game is free.
2053000	2062000	And I will be honest to god surprised if this game can pull it off and sustain itself on this model.
2062000	2066000	That's the only thing. I kind of look at this and go, how can this company not be bankrupt in a year?
2066000	2074000	But I've been enjoying it enough where I almost just want to kick them 20 bucks just to say, well done.
2074000	2075000	Applause.
2075000	2079000	I'll just buy something stupid like more character slots or something just to support the game.
2079000	2083000	Like I actually kind of want to do that. It's weird, huh?
2083000	2088000	But I want to support a company that I think is doing a pretty awesome thing here.
2088000	2093000	Yeah, so Path of Exile. I recommend it. I do.
2093000	2096000	Even though the game is still in beta and so forth, it's fun.
2096000	2101000	And hopefully we'll only get better with time as it gets out of beta.
2101000	2104000	So, well done.
2104000	2109000	That was pretty much my gaming week. So we'll move on to some housekeeping news.
2109000	2113000	You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook and Google Plus.
2113000	2117000	So please find us on social media. We appreciate it.
2117000	2121000	Also want to give a shout out to our friends at Automate Jam Session.
2121000	2127000	It's one of the other shows you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
2127000	2130000	They are about to hit 100 shows this week.
2130000	2136000	So congratulations to Rama, Ari Rockefeller, the whole gang over there at Anime Jam Session.
2136000	2141000	By the way, to celebrate their 100th episode, they're switching to a live show.
2141000	2146000	They're going to be live at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights from here on out.
2146000	2150000	So, grats to all those folks at Anime Jam Session. Winner is you.
2150000	2154000	And good luck. Live radio is a lot of fun, especially when your internet starts cutting out.
2154000	2158000	It's a good thing that Blizzard didn't wait a few more days. You wouldn't even really host.
2158000	2161000	Especially if you try to open your mouth to say something and you belch into the microphone.
2161000	2165000	That's always fun too. Especially if the microphones start smelling like it.
2165000	2172000	Alright, that does it for housekeeping. Let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.
2172000	2175000	It's been pretty damn busy, hasn't it, Logie?
2175000	2181000	Yes. So one of the announcements this week was that Rayman Legends has been delayed.
2182000	2191000	Oh no. It was originally supposed to be one of the bigger Wii U releases for people that bought the Wii U.
2191000	2194000	It was one of the games that they were kind of touting at even E3.
2194000	2200000	And the other bit of news that goes along with that, not only has it been delayed in September,
2200000	2206000	but now it's not going to be exclusive to the Wii U anymore. It's also coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
2206000	2209000	Because they want to make money.
2209000	2217000	Exactly. Because they said that the reason that they have the delay is because it's not done yet.
2219000	2228000	And they said, well, we could put out the Wii U version now and then do the other ones later in September,
2228000	2232000	but we usually release all of our stuff simultaneously.
2233000	2238000	It's not a standard practice. We just do this on a case-by-case basis.
2238000	2244000	Basically, here's what it is, folks. If you think about it, this is going to be a game that they're going to want to market.
2244000	2253000	Why would you double your marketing spend so that the Wii U people, the very few of them that may buy this game, get advertised too?
2253000	2260000	So basically, it's better just to wait, put the extra polish on the Wii U version of the game, put it out on the other consoles,
2260000	2264000	make some additional content, market it all at the same time in September.
2264000	2271000	What does suck, though, about that is what the hell is now coming out for the Wii U?
2271000	2281000	Because, honestly, that was going to be the only game for the Wii U in February, so now you have two months with no Wii U games.
2281000	2284000	When's Pikmin out, March?
2284000	2286000	No, Pikmin got delayed.
2286000	2288000	Oh boy. Not good.
2288000	2290000	There's no first-party title.
2290000	2296000	The LEGO game is the only first-party title that they have for...
2296000	2301000	I mean, it's not really Nintendo that they're, I guess, publishing it.
2301000	2308000	There's a lot of stuff in March, but let me put it this way. I looked at the list of stuff coming out for the Wii U.
2308000	2312000	There's maybe about eight games until the end of the year so far that have been announced.
2312000	2317000	And I'm including all of the, like, Zelda HD and all that stuff.
2317000	2322000	I mean, there's literally not a lot to go around right now.
2322000	2334000	Well, then, to play Devil's Advocate, yes, I can see where the audience for this Rayman game will expand quite a bit by delaying the game and doing it on 360 and PlayStation 3.
2334000	2343000	I get that, but at the same time, you had a captive audience of fans waiting for something to really justify their system's purchase, waiting for something big on the system.
2343000	2349000	And I think you had a lot of people that were ready to buy this game two weeks before they pulled the plug.
2349000	2353000	I mean, there's a lot of people really not happy with Ubisoft.
2353000	2358000	Like, Ubisoft personally went to Nintendo's house and punched them in the balls.
2358000	2361000	That is how some people are really taking this news.
2361000	2368000	Yeah, but Ubisoft right now is pulling in profit hand over fist, so I don't really think that it's going to hurt them that badly.
2368000	2373000	Okay, well, entertain my point for a minute here, whether I really believe this or not.
2373000	2380000	What about the concept that there was a captive audience in the Wii U audience, and now, in September, you're going to get your game notice in September?
2380000	2388000	I mean, Rayman, yes, it has its fans, and it's always going to appeal, especially as, like, a kid-friendly type of game, where I've seen a lot of people on the internet saying,
2388000	2394000	well, now it's got to go up against Grand Theft Auto. How short-sighted of a statement is that? I'm sorry.
2394000	2398000	If you were one of those people saying that, I'm smacking you upside the head, wake up call.
2398000	2400000	Do those two games really have the same audiences?
2400000	2401000	Counteradvocate.
2401000	2403000	Hello. Yeah, I know.
2403000	2408000	Family, where it's a decision between buying something for the kids or buying something for the grown-ups.
2408000	2416000	However, all that being said, when you're at September, you're knocking down the Christmas season's door, and those games are going to be a dime a dozen.
2416000	2417000	Those family games.
2417000	2425000	So, why wasn't the opportunity seized to really have Nintendo fans' full, undivided attention?
2425000	2429000	A smaller audience? Yes. A loyal audience? Clearly.
2431000	2433000	Loki, any thoughts on that?
2434000	2443000	Once again, I just think it just comes down to money, and it's because they're going to spend less money in marketing that.
2443000	2451000	I mean, they could just put it out the Wii U version without any marketing, but then, you know, they're not going to make a whole ton of money off of that.
2451000	2459000	I mean, granted, they've already kind of marketed it with demos and stuff like that, but once again, you have to consider what the install base of the Wii U is.
2459000	2465000	It's not very large, and what percentage of those people are going to buy Rayman Legends?
2465000	2472000	Being that it's the only game in two months, maybe quite a few of them, but it's still not a big chunk.
2472000	2480000	I mean, if you could guarantee all of them would buy it, maybe that might be worth it, but it's just not going to happen.
2480000	2486000	They know third-party attachment rates on these things are not good.
2487000	2494000	I want to share a point, and I will credit this to Bobby, because it's something he said on his show, so please support Mr. Bobby Black Wolf.
2494000	2498000	Bobby Black Wolf Show, 5 o'clock here at VOG, 8 o'clock Eastern.
2498000	2506000	He talked about how Nintendo gets this rap all the time, where it's all about the first-party games.
2506000	2512000	And, you know, Nintendo does great for first-party and their stuff, but they don't do enough for third-party.
2512000	2520000	So, here they go, they put out their system, and the reason why they have this big blank slate is that they wanted the third-parties to be able to carry this.
2520000	2527000	It's that they didn't want to flood the market with their own stuff, because they wanted the third-parties to have a chance to shine, to have a chance to sell their games.
2527000	2533000	And, to be fair, ZombiU has done very well in that category, also an Ubisoft game.
2533000	2539000	But, you know, the system's launch was Mario and Nintendo Land, and there's not going to be anything else until Christmas.
2539000	2543000	So, third-parties, here you go, here's your chance to shine.
2543000	2549000	And, instead of taking that chance, Ubisoft has literally shit on them.
2549000	2554000	Like, literally taken a dump all over that offering from Nintendo.
2554000	2559000	I mean, whether it's a good business decision or not, that's pretty much what happened.
2559000	2562000	Because Nintendo did put a lot of stock and investment in this whole, you know,
2562000	2571000	we got Rayman Legends coming, dah-dah-dah, and we got an exclusive demo, dah-dah-dah, only to get the literally shit on by Ubisoft with this.
2573000	2582000	So, I mean, can we really complain about how Nintendo doesn't support third-parties when this is how the third-parties respond?
2583000	2589000	Well, okay, I'm sorry, but, you know, to play, I guess, devil's advocate there,
2589000	2595000	I don't really think that the whole blank space right here is to allow for third-parties.
2595000	2598000	I think it's that Nintendo's development is fucked up.
2598000	2604000	And that's because they had stuff for first quarter that they were going to put out first-party titles, and they're just not fucking done yet.
2604000	2608000	And it's not a matter of them, oh, we're being gracious to these third-parties.
2608000	2617000	They have nothing coming out. They're probably, like, panicked that, oh, there's two months where there's no games for our system coming out at retail.
2617000	2625000	I mean, that's not good. That doesn't look good, especially since the support for the Wii has dropped off immediately.
2625000	2630000	It wasn't like the PlayStation 2 and stuff were, hell, you know, there is still PlayStation 2 games coming out last year.
2630000	2638000	I mean, a couple, but that's still many years after the system's done, versus the Wii U comes out?
2638000	2644000	Nothing this year. Like, there's, like, three games for the Wii coming out, and that's it.
2644000	2650000	It's just nothing. Just drop down to nothing, and there's nothing for your new system either.
2650000	2654000	It's just like they said, fuck you guys, we're just going to go the other platforms.
2654000	2660000	I've been playing Devil's Advocate a lot. Here's my honest opinion. Here's what I really think.
2660000	2663000	Now that I've shared all this other stuff, here's what I really think.
2663000	2667000	The Ubisoft decision, from a purely business and nothing else perspective, it does make sense.
2667000	2673000	And so, as disappointing as that is, as a Wii U owner, honestly, I probably wasn't going to buy the game anyway.
2673000	2676000	Rayman was not the system seller for me anyway.
2676000	2682000	I think Nintendo is in a situation exactly like the 3DS situation,
2682000	2687000	and it's really ridiculous that they're in that situation yet again, but I think the only way out of it,
2687000	2691000	I mean, the 3DS is in a great place now, and Nintendo is essentially going to have to repeat history.
2691000	2695000	They're going to have to eat shit. They're going to have to cut the price of the Wii U.
2695000	2699000	That's the only thing now, and we're going to get another one of those E3s this year,
2699000	2702000	where Reggie comes out on stage and says, you fucking want games? Bam.
2702000	2706000	Here's a game. Here's a game. Here's a game. Here's a game. Fuck you, I'm out.
2706000	2711000	That's going to be their E3 this year. It's going to be just like the year that this all went down with 3DS.
2711000	2715000	And that'll be that. And then a year from now, we're all going to sit here going,
2715000	2722000	how did we ever doubt Nintendo and the Wii U? Will the Wii U be the force to be reckoned with the Wii was?
2722000	2733000	No. But if these, I mean, who's to say these other consoles are going to necessarily be a force to be reckoned with either?
2733000	2739000	We're all assuming that PlayStation 4 and Xbox, whatever it's called, are going to be these, you know,
2739000	2743000	consoles that are the forces to be reckoned with. However, if it serves me right,
2743000	2748000	we've had a lot of nasty rumors going around about both of these consoles and things they might do
2748000	2755000	and missteps they might make of their own that could really piss people off in convincing them to spend $500 on these new consoles.
2755000	2759000	And if that happens and you're the soccer mom come Christmas time,
2759000	2762000	do you want to buy one of these $500 consoles that doesn't play used games?
2762000	2767000	Or do you want to buy this other console that has the Nintendo name on it, that has Mario's face on it,
2767000	2775000	that just had its price slashed by 50 bucks to play games that albeit are not that much better technologically than the ones that are out now?
2775000	2785000	Believe it, believe it, that could happen all over again. History could very well repeat itself.
2785000	2790000	Even though we're all sitting here laughing at Nintendo right now, don't count them out.
2790000	2795000	It is way too early and Nintendo is far too stubborn to let it go.
2795000	2801000	I also have the special superpower of Lucky Bitch Powers because seriously,
2801000	2807000	I mean, have you not noticed that just when things seem, you know, about to be down for Nintendo,
2807000	2815000	they pull something out of their ass or something turns around or just one little thing will work in their favor and it all turns around, right?
2815000	2818000	Lucky Bitch Powers.
2818000	2825000	We'll see though. A lot can happen between now and E3. It's going to be a very interesting year. Can't wait.
2826000	2832000	A note for our live listeners. We are aware that the show is cutting out a little bit here and there and a lot of you are having to reload.
2832000	2839000	We're sorry about it. The same problem was affecting Bobby's show tonight so we actually think it does not originate with us
2839000	2846000	and, you know, I know we had some lullsy internet-related issues here at the studio that were causing problems for live listeners.
2846000	2852000	We actually think it's because our provider is located in the Northeast where there was just that big blizzard
2852000	2856000	so it would make sense that that is wreaking havoc when the show is being relayed to all of you.
2856000	2860000	So we're really sorry about it but it's a little bit out of our control.
2860000	2862000	Blame God.
2862000	2867000	It's really the problem is our choice to go with blizzard cooling for our server.
2867000	2869000	Exactly, right?
2869000	2874000	Should have gone with, you know, water or air. No, blizzard! It's better.
2874000	2877000	Alright. Did you get all that Rayman stuff out that you went to sell?
2877000	2879000	Yeah, they're going to have an exclusive demo.
2879000	2885000	Great. Hey, good luck, Nintendo man, that they know how to show appreciation.
2885000	2888000	They're going to have you guys put out another...
2888000	2892000	Ubisoft's going to put out another demo, another exclusive Rayman Legends demo.
2892000	2894000	At some point.
2894000	2902000	Ross Steele in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the third parties aren't going to go back to Nintendo.
2902000	2904000	It's not going to happen.
2904000	2906000	I think that's a bold as fuck statement.
2906000	2913000	There... I don't know. I mean, there's some other stuff that we may talk about later on that...
2913000	2917000	Well, why don't I throw this out there as far as third parties go.
2917000	2924000	Activision, interesting little development during their earnings call where Bobby Kotick was asked about, you know,
2924000	2929000	Skylanders and so forth, how the console sales with that all goes.
2929000	2932000	He said, quote, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U.
2932000	2937000	We're concerned about the install base for six to eleven years old, six to eleven year olds.
2937000	2943000	So, of course, this caused all the blogs to run with Activision is concerned about Nintendo because he did use that.
2943000	2945000	You know, we're concerned.
2945000	2947000	OK, we'll see.
2947000	2952000	I don't think I wouldn't worry about this too long term, but it does show.
2952000	2958000	Nintendo really has to show a clear future on how that console is going to print money very soon.
2958000	2963000	Here's one for you, since I see it's on our show.
2963000	2965000	EA.
2965000	2969000	There's no EA sports games for the Wii or Wii U this year so far.
2969000	2970000	Yeah, I noticed that.
2970000	2972000	And that's up through August through Madden.
2972000	2974000	No Tiger, no.
2974000	2976000	And it even goes with 2K.
2976000	2977000	No MLB game.
2977000	2980000	There's no NCAA and no Madden.
2980000	2982000	I mean, that's.
2982000	2985000	Interesting that they just completely Madden.
2985000	2992000	I mean, it must have flopped big time on, you know, the Wii U for the launch.
2992000	3000000	I don't know if FIFA I could see FIFA being on there, but right now, no Wii U titles sports wise.
3000000	3004000	And who knows, maybe they'll continue with other franchises of theirs.
3004000	3011000	Let's not forget, though, despite the fact we say all the third parties are abandoning ship, which I think it's a little early to say that for sure.
3011000	3020000	Remember, one place where Wii U and Nintendo themselves have really endeared themselves and don't count out what this base can do for your console is indies.
3020000	3024000	There's a lot of indie developers that are really liking what Nintendo is doing right now.
3024000	3026000	Don't count them out.
3026000	3033000	And just because EA doesn't put out any sports games this year on the Wii does not mean that they're not going to put any sports games for next year.
3033000	3036000	Just right now, they don't have Madden coming out.
3036000	3040000	And let's be honest, maybe Madden just doesn't sell very well on the Wii.
3040000	3048000	I mean, I know we haven't, as far as a retail perspective, didn't sell much of it. It's always PS3, Xbox 360 heavy.
3048000	3052000	Maybe people have all started realizing that it's the same game every year.
3052000	3054000	Nope, they haven't figured that out yet.
3054000	3056000	Still number one selling sports game.
3056000	3060000	Rama in our chat room suggests Tecmo Bowl for Wii U, please.
3060000	3062000	It could be an interesting time for somebody.
3062000	3064000	Then they tried that for the Wii and how well did that sell?
3064000	3065000	Yeah, that's true.
3065000	3068000	This could be an interesting time for somebody else to come in and do their knockoff game.
3068000	3071000	I mean, it couldn't be NBA or NFL officially, but...
3071000	3077000	You have to know there's no football game that's as good as Super High Impact. End of story.
3080000	3081000	High Impact Wii U.
3081000	3083000	No Super Garris Ball.
3083000	3084000	Anything is possible.
3084000	3085000	Yeah, Super Garris Ball.
3085000	3086000	Guys.
3086000	3088000	Mega Man Soccer.
3088000	3090000	Even I think the joke is getting old.
3090000	3095000	Which is funny. When we were cataloging our games, I completely forgot that we had Mega Man Soccer.
3095000	3099000	I don't know if you noticed on Twitter, someone was saying that they...
3099000	3104000	Oh, was it like a Mass Effect spoof of... was it...
3104000	3107000	Gangnam Style or something like that?
3107000	3112000	Yeah, what was that wallpaper that everyone's been... their phone wallpaper now?
3112000	3114000	No, no. It wasn't that.
3114000	3119000	I was replying to someone's tweet and it was about something that had to do with Mass Effect.
3119000	3123000	And like, oh, I'm surprised there hasn't been a... you guys should do a Mass Effect...
3123000	3129000	Oh, it was like, you guys should do a Mass Effect parody song to Gangnam Style or something like that.
3129000	3134000	And I was like, I'm sure someone's already done that to Mass Effect.
3134000	3138000	And sure enough, they had like a Mass Effect Gangnam Style.
3138000	3141000	I think it was like Garris Style or something like that.
3141000	3147000	There is this wallpaper for a phone circulating that's Garris and Caden.
3147000	3149000	Yeah, it was Garris Style.
3149000	3151000	It's just a still.
3151000	3157000	Yeah, I'm kind of spent on Gangnam Style after the Pistachio commercial.
3157000	3163000	Wait a minute, were you watching a football game on TV? Yes, you were. You wouldn't have seen that.
3163000	3164000	No.
3164000	3166000	Aha! Aha! Objection!
3166000	3168000	Hulu.
3168000	3170000	Oh, fine.
3170000	3172000	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
3172000	3173000	Girl, don't even.
3173000	3175000	Oh, I will.
3175000	3180000	Well, there is a developer called AK Studios.
3180000	3183000	A-C-K-K, which makes me think of Bill the Cat now.
3183000	3185000	They've put out an announcement.
3185000	3190000	They're working on a 3D RPG that is inspired by Earthbound and The World Ends With You.
3190000	3192000	And it's going to be on the Wii U eShop.
3192000	3194000	It's codename is Project Y2K.
3194000	3197000	Aren't they like 13 years too late for that name?
3197000	3201000	But there is a teaser up for it.
3201000	3212000	And basically they're saying that basically right now it's concept art, finalized script and storyline, and graphics and gameplay engine.
3212000	3216000	I forgot this story was on our show roll tonight. What did I just say?
3216000	3219000	What did I just say about indies and the Wii U?
3219000	3224000	That it could make for a very interesting marriage. That's all I'm saying.
3224000	3227000	If Nintendo finally actually puts its stock in this.
3227000	3232000	Isn't it more like Wii U leaving one mistress for another Nintendo?
3232000	3234000	Well, it would be quite the change for Nintendo.
3234000	3245000	Because remember three years ago fans had to start a letter writing campaign to get games like Xenoblade, which should have been an obvious put that out here in the States please.
3245000	3251000	And Last Story, which has done well for XSeed.
3251000	3253000	And now Pandora's Tower.
3253000	3261000	Maybe Nintendo finally could be doing this turnaround where they're like, maybe gamers here want this shit. This could be a niche for us.
3261000	3263000	So they're changing their polygamy for a harem.
3263000	3265000	However you want to phrase it.
3265000	3267000	I'm just trying to think of a good analogy.
3267000	3269000	That'll work.
3269000	3270000	I want a harem.
3270000	3272000	Who doesn't want a harem?
3272000	3274000	Except you'd have to pay for all of this, nevermind.
3277000	3279000	Alright, moving on then I guess.
3279000	3284000	Let's see, we've talked crap about Sony, we've talked crap about Nintendo. Who are we leaving out, Loki?
3284000	3286000	We're going to talk about Microsoft.
3286000	3294000	As we get close to E3, and I'm sure it's just not going to quit until they make their final announcements.
3294000	3299000	Let's talk about random Xbox next generation rumors.
3299000	3305000	So starting off, the next Xbox will always be online and will use Blu-ray.
3306000	3308000	That works so well.
3308000	3316000	Kind of a big duh with the Blu-ray because either it's going to be Blu-ray of their own proprietary format, obviously something that's going to be...
3316000	3320000	Butch, Microsoft can't use Blu-ray, Loki. That's a Sony product.
3320000	3322000	That's stupid.
3322000	3324000	That doesn't make any sense. You're talking crazy.
3326000	3334000	They can totally do that. I'm surprised actually they don't use HD DVD because that's technology that they have access to and no one's using it for anything.
3334000	3346000	Sony was also one part of Blu-ray and I also want to remind everybody, Microsoft kind of sucks some dick to get Final Fantasy XI on its console early on which had this whole play online front end.
3346000	3350000	Who owns play online? I'm dropping the mic now.
3351000	3364000	Anyways, so yeah, there's rumors going around that it's supposed to be always online which I guess is supposed to somehow tie in with maybe, I don't know, the way you use games work.
3364000	3373000	I mean, some way to, I guess, cut into the second hand game market by authenticating your games or something.
3373000	3379000	I don't really know. There's no real specifics on that, on why that's even an important fact down there.
3379000	3395000	The other one is, of course, that there's going to have some sort of, they say, natural speech detection and speech attacks which I know they've been trying to do that kind of crap with the Kinect and I always think it's very, like, useless.
3395000	3401000	I mean, just like, oh, I plug in the Kinect and Kinect, I want you to do this, you know, or Kinect.
3401000	3403000	Yeah, but you have functional hands.
3403000	3415000	I understand that, but I'm saying that they try to, they're trying to improve on this front right here and, you know, to play devil's advocate, that's really only benefiting a small percentage of their market base.
3415000	3426000	I'm talking about, like, as far as, I don't really know how much further they're going to go with this as far, how this is going to play into the next gen console other than, like, you know.
3427000	3434000	I believe this is actually, you know, even though this is all rumors and we should take it with a grain of salt, I believe this part, the text-to-speech part, is absolutely true.
3434000	3450000	And I think the proof is in something that's actually going on in the 360 right now. There's, in the Kinect channel or whatever it is, you go into the Kinect thing, there's an app you can download that is nothing but, and maybe somebody in chat can help me fill in the gap here with the name of it,
3450000	3461000	but it's something where you actually launch it up and it attracts, like, you can earn achievements and avatar gear if you're willing to do this Kinect experiment where you just read phrases.
3461000	3468000	And you're just reading phrases over and it'll make some background noise sometimes and it's things about, like, movies and all this stuff.
3468000	3479000	So, like, they're trying to collect different accents and the way people talk through this channel. They're trying to collect all this information, which is really weird when you consider, well, they've already implemented a lot of this.
3479000	3485000	So they're gearing for something else. So I think the proof is there that this is happening.
3485000	3501000	They're trying to get it more user-friendly instead of saying, like, Xbox, play DVD or play, you know, Xbox search X-Files, play, you know, it's like you can say, where can I find the X-Files? Or where can I watch X-Files?
3501000	3503000	You should talk like GLaDOS.
3503000	3519000	I would believe that, you know, they're gonna show, like, a video or something of the new Xbox where somebody walks in as they're getting home from work, hanging up their jacket or whatever, and somebody's walking in going, Xbox, play last night's episode of The Walking Dead.
3519000	3528000	And the Xbox will just magically turn on and maybe it powers on your TV too or something, I don't know, through an infrared communication. And then there it goes. It starts playing The Walking Dead.
3528000	3531000	And so they're gonna, that'll be like a thing.
3531000	3546000	Oh, and I hope that we get another one of those stupid demonstrations where they're saying in front of the Kinect and like, oh, I'm virtually trying on outfits. Or, oh, I'm gonna scan in my skateboard logo or whatever so it can appear on my object in game.
3546000	3560000	Oh, wait, all that shit that they promised us for the Kinect and never fucking came through with? I guess, you know, getting a vague color for my car, which, by the way, with that fucked up camera was always like a whitish-pinkish color no matter what the lighting in the room.
3560000	3572000	I guess that's much better. Oh, by the way, the whole internet connection thing was, of course, supposed to be that whole, oh, it's not gonna play these games because it's gonna be always connected to the internet and it's gonna be tied in.
3572000	3583000	Basically, they're saying like you have a one-time code you use and that's it. And then your disk is useless, I guess. It doesn't make any sense. It's not gonna happen.
3583000	3597000	I mean, once again, like I said, you're not being forced to buy a new console and they're not gonna cut out, I mean, seriously, if they cut out GameStop, who's gonna sell their console? Yes, I understand there's other retailers out there that sell consoles, but...
3597000	3599000	They all want to sell used games, too.
3599000	3611000	But those GameStops aren't going out of business because those guys aren't selling consoles. All they're saying is, hey, you know what, you should buy a PS4 instead. Why? Because it plays better games. Oh, and because you can sell your games back.
3611000	3626000	To go back to another point is, you know, talking about the little demos showing all the stuff that they are saying it's gonna do that it doesn't do. Think back to when the Xbox 360 was in previews at E3.
3626000	3636000	We all sat on that floor with the pounding noise that was awful. But it was talking about a lot of things that really didn't happen until more recently.
3636000	3647000	You know, so I think that it's not necessarily that it is going to do all this. That they want it to do all this and it will eventually do all that. You can't expect instant gratification.
3647000	3657000	You know, oh, we're gonna have all this. Well, it's gonna happen right away. No, it's not. You have to keep in mind, you know, what happens in reality and, you know, keep on top of the technology.
3657000	3662000	And so help me keep Peter Molyneaux out of E3.
3663000	3671000	I'm gonna put my tinfoil hat on for a minute and just do a what if. I don't really think this, but I think it's worth going down an avenue exploring here for a little bit.
3671000	3682000	Because like you say, Loki, if the Xbox doesn't play used games and the PlayStation 4 does, then Microsoft might as well seal its own fate right now because they won't be sold in GameStop.
3682000	3694000	But what if, tinfoil hat, what if Sony and Microsoft are in cahoots. We've heard about the rumors about the trademark or whatever that the Sony discs would be tied to the console.
3694000	3706000	So we've had this rumor about Sony already. What if Sony and Microsoft have had secret meetings and it's not unheard of that competitors will have meetings about mutually beneficial topics.
3706000	3716000	Because maybe EA brought them both to the table or somebody else. Okay, so what if they have both decided that used games will not be playable on the consoles? Then what happens?
3716000	3728000	Then what happens? Then you have people, and this is just, it's really only gonna, it's perception, because let's be honest here, like a lot of the games I buy, I may not necessarily sell used later on.
3728000	3739000	It's just perception in that sense, but there's really nothing forcing me, it's gonna, if buying games, let's say that you can't afford to buy brand new games.
3739000	3746000	And I understand that. Let's say you're on a tight budget and you need to trade in those old games to make up the money to buy the new games.
3746000	3756000	Okay, so you can't do that anymore because that option's gone. So what are you gonna do? You're gonna have to train yourself to now wait six months for them to drop the price of the game.
3756000	3766000	Still buying it new, but you're not buying it full price. And that's what's gonna happen. See, that's the problem. You can get rid of your second hand sales, but you're still gonna have to drop the price of that game at some point.
3766000	3779000	And now they're just buying it brand new at that same cost. So I don't see why, what's the point in, I don't understand where they're hurting their sales right now, when it's just gonna hurt them down the road anyways, when they start writing off the inventory.
3779000	3787000	Well, in my whole little tinfoil hat scenario, I agree now with RossTealUT in our chat room. Nintendo would be the only winner in that pact.
3787000	3796000	Absolutely. Go back to what I said at the beginning of the show where Nintendo can dig themselves out of this hole if Sony and Microsoft fucked themselves, and this would be one way to do it.
3796000	3808000	Now, I'm gonna take the tinfoil hat off, put it on the table. Here's what I really think. I don't necessarily think these rumors are false, just like I don't think that the rumors about the PlayStation 4 disc protection or whatever is false.
3808000	3819000	However, Microsoft's had a real problem with dev kits. And where do most of these rumors start? They start from disgruntled devs and so forth. Loki, did you not buy a dev kit on eBay?
3819000	3821000	Not eBay, but yeah.
3821000	3830000	Okay. Now, here's the thing. I don't think Microsoft really wants you to have one of those. And it seems to me like a lot of that shit's been floating out there randomly where anybody could get it.
3830000	3844000	So my thought is, maybe the dev kits always require you to be online, and the dev kits will always be reading or talking to, you know, Microsoft or what have you, to make sure that these games don't leak early.
3844000	3855000	Because what Microsoft's really trying to combat is not the used game market, but day zero piracy, because that is what hurts the most, is the piracy that gets out there before the game even goes on sale.
3855000	3860000	You mean like Halo 4 being linked to, like, what, four weeks early, two weeks early?
3860000	3877000	Ding, ding, ding, absolutely, Loki. That is absolutely it. And I would even say it would be realistic to see that perhaps a game goes on sale digitally just a couple days before it goes on sale in tangible form, not much to GameStop chagrin and so forth.
3877000	3884000	That's a direction I could see, like, where they go down the line again, and it is all about combating piracy.
3884000	3888000	That I would see and would understand if that's what they're doing.
3888000	3903000	And to require an online only console, it's just not going to happen anyways, because not everyone has internet. I mean, even now, our internet, especially high speed internet, not everyone has high speed internet or has reliable high speed internet.
3903000	3905000	I mean, there's a lot of things that can go wrong.
3906000	3921000	27% of Xbox is never online, according to an Ars Technica article that cited a 2010 study. Granted, in three years a lot can happen, but we could still really, it's got to be above 10%, which is, you know, a number that can't be ignored.
3921000	3934000	Yeah, so I mean, and let's just say now I understand that some of those may have gone online at some point, but doesn't mean that they're always online. Like, I know, like, sometimes my Xbox doesn't have an internet connection, depending on where I'm using it and stuff.
3934000	3948000	And that would kind of suck that, oh, I can't play a game on this because, because of some reason, I don't know, if they really want to combat piracy or something, what they could do if you're going to do a one time code thing is have it like a PC game.
3948000	3961000	Like I have my Grand Theft Auto games and stuff where I can revoke that code at some point, say I want to trade it in or whatever, and I revoke that code and then that way, okay, you don't have that code, you can't really play this game on the system.
3961000	3963000	That could be one way to do it.
3963000	3969000	I mean, they'd be trying to hose the rental market because the rental market wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of that one.
3969000	3972000	Yeah, but they don't really care about the rental markets.
3972000	3978000	Interesting. Interesting. All right, well, we will see in the coming months.
3978000	3984000	And if it all sucks, if all the consoles suck, there's always Steam and Steam's going to have those same games that are on consoles.
3984000	3990000	I mean, obviously not the Microsoft first party or Sony first party, but you're going to have a lot of those multiplatform games.
3990000	3998000	By the way, don't expect Sony or Microsoft to be very forthcoming about this in their press conferences or whatever, you know, Sony is doing on February 20th.
3998000	4004000	These questions will have to be asked point blank and they will be asked by journalists at E3.
4004000	4008000	And that is where the answer will be found is when those interviews come out. We shall see.
4010000	4018000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, error.
4018000	4023000	Meanwhile, let's talk about somebody else that's in some trouble right now, Zynga.
4023000	4027000	Oh boy, it's just been bad news after bad news after bad news.
4027000	4032000	And, you know, we've had a lot of financial reports lately and apparently another one came out here.
4034000	4043000	Zynga did pretty bad in 2012. They posted a $209.4 million loss.
4043000	4047000	That's not as bad as 2011 when it was a $404.3 million loss.
4047000	4051000	But keep in mind, they've closed some places since then. They've had to make some cutbacks.
4052000	4057000	So, yeah, I don't know if they're going to be shutting down other games or what or what the future holds.
4057000	4062000	But they're still losing money. Maybe the Facebook thing is over.
4062000	4069000	This is, well, I guess maybe not over, but it's not the huge thing that people once thought it was.
4069000	4076000	Which, again, I would caution Sony and Microsoft in their whole trying to capture that market and so forth.
4076000	4083000	Look at what's happening to Zynga. It's kind of a fad. Don't marry Facebook. It's only going to get ugly.
4085000	4088000	You can't play catch up. You just have to come up with something new.
4091000	4095000	Why marry Facebook when you can make your own Facebook?
4095000	4099000	And I have a hard time believing Microsoft doesn't want to make their own.
4099000	4103000	Maybe not necessarily like, you know, the exact same thing that Facebook does.
4103000	4110000	But what if they could take some of the parts of Facebook and kind of make Xbox Live a new version of that?
4110000	4121000	I don't know. I could see where they maybe want to make their own thing as opposed to just trying to marry something that's already out there.
4121000	4123000	But then again, it didn't work so well for Apple, so I don't know.
4123000	4126000	We here at Microsoft are now going to partner with the new MySpace.
4127000	4135000	Well, the new MySpace, as funny as that joke is to make, the new MySpace is really about music and not so much like games or anything else.
4135000	4139000	I mean, it's really about music and artistry, because that's kind of what MySpace turned into when everybody left it.
4139000	4144000	It was all artists trying to promote themselves. So, you know, it's kind of like they were all each other's friends.
4144000	4147000	MySpace now is trying to compete with Pitchfork.
4147000	4151000	And Pinterest. But it's like a Pinterest of music is what it is.
4151000	4153000	It's a pinfork.
4153000	4157000	I was lucky enough to get invited to the thing as in preview or whatever.
4157000	4161000	And it looked nice, but there was nothing there for me.
4161000	4166000	I was honestly only there to see how I could pimp Orange Lawn's radio and, you know, the podcast stuff I do.
4166000	4169000	Like, you know, what's in it for me? Then couldn't find it.
4169000	4174000	So not really on it.
4174000	4176000	Anyhow, let's move on.
4176000	4178000	Dark Saga.
4178000	4181000	Well, we know of that game company, right?
4181000	4183000	Sure. Flower, Journey.
4183000	4188000	Well, this is just a little interesting. More put it in here, yeah, just for the interest side of it.
4188000	4192000	And to help people keep things in perspective.
4192000	4196000	When Journey shipped, they were bankrupt.
4196000	4199000	They could not pay their employees.
4199000	4206000	They, you know, really just went ahead and shipped out the game, you know, with a prayer that they wouldn't lose more.
4206000	4211000	And as it turned out, you know, that's put them back up, you know, in the top and kept them alive.
4211000	4218000	So it's just, you know, you think of all these companies that are pretty much, we've been saying sinking ship, sinking ship,
4218000	4225000	but really all it takes is that one shining, you know, gemstone out there that's gonna, you know, bring them back.
4225000	4228000	Just thought this would be a good one for perspective.
4228000	4235000	Yeah. Along with that, you know, the old tale about Final Fantasy and why it was called Final Fantasy.
4235000	4238000	And I'm talking about the original NES version.
4238000	4243000	It was called Final Fantasy because it was going to be SquareSoft's last game because they were pretty much out of money.
4243000	4246000	And then, hooray, Final Fantasy ended up being a cash cow.
4246000	4249000	And so, you know, they've moved on very well since then.
4249000	4252000	But yeah, this is kind of a similar sort of story, so.
4252000	4256000	So just, you know, want to put it out there. Indie developers, don't give up.
4256000	4258000	You know, you never know what's going to happen.
4258000	4259000	You never know what's going to happen.
4259000	4261000	Just don't make shit and you'll be okay.
4261000	4264000	Some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
4264000	4269000	Going to the last story a little bit, Technus wants to clarify, Microsoft already has a deal with Facebook.
4269000	4272000	That's why you see Bing Maps and Bing Translate on Facebook.
4272000	4279000	I don't know what the limit of exclusivity it would be to that.
4279000	4282000	I know it's a hard word to pronounce, isn't it? Exclusiveness.
4282000	4284000	Exclusivity?
4284000	4289000	That still doesn't stop Microsoft from necessarily doing their own thing.
4289000	4290000	What does Facebook get out of it?
4290000	4292000	Maybe the Skype integration thing?
4292000	4297000	Because that was something they were really hyping up for their messenger and chat was that, you know, their Skype.
4297000	4298000	So yeah, I guess you're right.
4298000	4301000	Microsoft and Facebook already have some ties.
4301000	4303000	Doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't do their own thing.
4303000	4309000	Nor could Sony, although I don't, like, based on history, I don't think Sony would pull it off very well.
4309000	4311000	But you never know. I might be surprised.
4311000	4314000	Sony might have bought a company that fell off my radar that could do it.
4314000	4316000	So, who knows?
4317000	4323000	I am also, like, just totally, like, mass hypothesizing, making shit up.
4323000	4327000	But who wouldn't want to get, like, a Facebook for gamers?
4327000	4333000	I mean, that would seem like, and I think there are some startups out there kind of trying to capitalize on that a bit.
4333000	4335000	But nobody's really struck gold with that idea yet.
4335000	4339000	I wouldn't believe that the publishers themselves aren't trying to do that a little bit.
4339000	4340000	Look at Miiverse.
4340000	4343000	Kind of moving that direction a little bit.
4343000	4345000	As much as Nintendo can.
4346000	4352000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming to a game store near you very soon.
4352000	4354000	Loki, we'll start with you on the US dates.
4354000	4361000	This week, the big game coming out would be Aliens Colonial Marines on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC.
4361000	4366000	Also, Brain Age concentration training out on the 3DS.
4366000	4368000	Actually, I think today.
4368000	4370000	Brain Age is still a thing?
4370000	4372000	I thought that was just, like, a fad.
4372000	4374000	They were just trying.
4374000	4376000	Well, people buy it.
4376000	4381000	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on 3DS this week.
4381000	4384000	Omerta, City of Gangsters on Xbox 360.
4386000	4389000	And I want to say that I think that's it.
4389000	4391000	Because there wasn't that much coming out this week.
4395000	4397000	Technic... I guess it's...
4397000	4399000	What's today here?
4400000	4402000	I guess technically within the week.
4402000	4409000	Next Sunday, they're going to be having the Zombie U Nintendo Wii U 32GBi Deluxe set.
4409000	4414000	It's going to be a Zombie U and a digital copy of Nintendo Land.
4415000	4417000	So you're not going to have much of that hard drive left over.
4418000	4422000	I like how Ubisoft waited for that to go to the factory before they fucked Nintendo.
4424000	4425000	Anyhow.
4425000	4427000	Yeah, hey, let's make this deal.
4428000	4430000	Oh, and fuck you, huh?
4430000	4433000	I know. That's business. That is business.
4434000	4436000	Going to Japan, checking out the Japanese releases.
4436000	4439000	On Valentine's Day, which happens to be release day in Japan.
4439000	4443000	PlayStation 3, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II.
4443000	4446000	Price drops for Dragon's Dogma and Lollipop Chainsaw.
4446000	4450000	Because Lollipop Chainsaw is getting the Valentine's edition on February 14th.
4450000	4452000	Even though it's a steaming festering pile of poo?
4452000	4454000	Yes, even though it's a steaming festering pile of poo.
4454000	4456000	That's an opinion.
4456000	4459000	Lots of stuff on the Xbox 360. Who would have thought I said that?
4459000	4461000	Of course, most of this is price reductions.
4461000	4466000	Lollipop Chainsaw connects Star Wars, Gears of War 3, Disneyland Adventures,
4466000	4471000	Forza 4, Dragon's Dogma, Dance Central 2, all of those getting price reductions this week in Japan.
4472000	4477000	And as far as new stuff goes, Aliens, Colonel Marines, Combat Wings,
4477000	4482000	The Great Battles of World War II, and Giga Force come out this week in Japan.
4482000	4483000	Those are all new things.
4483000	4484000	You know what?
4484000	4485000	On the 14th? What?
4485000	4488000	About that, Aliens, Colonial Marines, I actually want that game.
4488000	4489000	Yeah? Why's that?
4489000	4492000	Because, and God, why can't I never remember his damn name?
4492000	4495000	The guy who played Bishop is reprising his role.
4495000	4496000	Oh, that's cool.
4496000	4499000	But you know who else? He voiced Admiral Hackett.
4499000	4502000	Of course. Oh, you. Oh, you.
4502000	4509000	PlayStation Vita in Japan this week gets Sakura no Pet na Kanojo in regular and limited editions.
4509000	4512000	And Silent Hill Book of Memories gets its Japanese release.
4512000	4513000	Girls' Pets?
4513000	4515000	Just in time. Better than girls' butts.
4515000	4520000	Just in time for Valentine's Day Silent Hill game on the Vita.
4520000	4525000	Absolutely nothing on the Wii U, but Tank Tank Tank is out in the near future,
4525000	4528000	although I thought that was going free to play or something was happening.
4528000	4530000	I don't know. It's on my list for some reason for next week.
4530000	4533000	They have like a demo or something that's coming out that you can...
4533000	4534000	Like a retail version.
4534000	4539000	Unlock parts of the demo or something if you pay money. I don't know. It's weird.
4540000	4550000	On the 3DS this week, Marugo 3D Na Nami Tu Ishiho Na Ga Kubo English Jo Satsu no Kotsu Riron Hen.
4550000	4552000	What the hell is that? I don't know.
4552000	4555000	It's got a cute anime girl, though.
4555000	4558000	Because, you know, that's everything.
4558000	4560000	That's it. That's the one screenshot I have.
4560000	4563000	That could just be the box art. The game probably has nothing to do with that.
4563000	4567000	So I don't know what that is, but it's not any big series.
4567000	4571000	Quickly checking to see if they're still putting stuff out on the PSP.
4571000	4573000	They are. PSP getting some releases this week.
4573000	4577000	Battle Robot Tamashi from Bandai Namco this week on the PSP.
4579000	4581000	Dark Sakura, how about the other side of the Atlantic?
4582000	4585000	As soon as I can make my iPad go there.
4586000	4590000	We only have on the 12th, we have Aliens Colonial Marines.
4592000	4596000	And to answer your earlier question about the game, courtesy of Tiger Claw, Lance Henriksen.
4596000	4601000	That's it. I knew it was some sort of Icelandic sounding name.
4603000	4606000	Was he a Stargate guy? Why do I associate him with Stargate?
4606000	4608000	I think, wasn't he in Atlantis?
4608000	4610000	I associate him with Stargate for some reason.
4610000	4612000	I stopped watching Stargate after season 8, so.
4613000	4615000	There's been a fuck ton of Stargate, too.
4616000	4618000	Just the SG-1 series.
4618000	4624000	If you haven't been following Stargate since the original movie that the guy who made Independence Day did all those years ago,
4624000	4627000	there's been a fuck ton of Stargate that's been happening. Just so you know.
4628000	4630000	But no MMO frown.
4631000	4637000	You know what, Becky and I used to marathon SG-1 because I have all those box sets I'm probably gonna sell.
4638000	4640000	And we both decided that season 4 sucks.
4641000	4644000	I had an ex that was really into Stargate. It's a good show. I'm not gonna hate it.
4644000	4645000	Season 7 was good.
4646000	4650000	Alright, a few more news stories for you guys and then we'll get into the classic game of the week. Loki.
4651000	4655000	Alright, so let's talk about the independent console that's coming out.
4656000	4657000	Ouya!
4658000	4670000	Ouya is gonna be making its way out for Kickstarter backers in March, but if you didn't get in on that action, then you can actually pick one up at retail.
4671000	4677000	It's gonna be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and the store that's into everything electronics nowadays, GameStop.
4678000	4683000	You can buy one for $99 there or an extra controller for $49.99.
4684000	4694000	Think about it. If the new Xbox doesn't play used games, there will be more Ouya merchandise at GameStop than there will be Xbox Lube or 720 or whatever they call it.
4696000	4700000	Yeah, they're gonna really have to grease you up to get you to buy one of those.
4701000	4710000	And then to go with that, of course, they're saying that, yeah, you may buy an Ouya this year, but it doesn't mean that there's not gonna be an Ouya 2 next year or an Ouya 3 the year after that.
4711000	4719000	In fact, they're planning on doing a new one each year because they can take advantage of better, faster processors and falling prices and that kind of stuff.
4720000	4729000	They figure, hey, you know what? If there's consoles coming out there that, or I should say tablets that are making new iterations each year, why not the Ouya, I guess?
4730000	4732000	So I guess we can expect some more of those.
4733000	4743000	And then, of course, they've partnered up with Double Fine and, well, let's see here, Paul Bettner, who is the creator of Words with Friends.
4744000	4750000	And they're gonna be bringing the Cave and Reds to Ouya, I guess. These are pretty big games.
4751000	4755000	I've never heard of Reds, but the Cave I'm well aware of because that just came out.
4755000	4768000	And then, last but not least, this month, of course, to go along with the whole Kickstarter backers getting their consoles next month, they are going through the approval process right now.
4769000	4773000	And I'm a little disappointed. I mean, out of some, like two-thirds of this, I'm okay.
4774000	4783000	They're basically looking at games being submitted to them and they're checking for intellectual property infringement, malware, and excessive pornography.
4783000	4785000	I'm glad that they added excessive in there.
4786000	4788000	So a little, a little titty's okay.
4789000	4790000	A little pornography is alright.
4791000	4793000	So no to Ouya developers, a little titty's okay.
4794000	4799000	I still think there should be excessive pornography. I mean, hell, that should be the title of a game, Excessive Pornography, the game.
4800000	4801000	That would be awesome.
4802000	4806000	Is that, dare I say, is that an OLR dream game, Excessive Pornography?
4807000	4809000	Excessive Pornography, that's the internet, okay. That's just the internet.
4810000	4812000	That's everybody's dream game. That's not an OLR dream game.
4813000	4814000	That's the internet stream game.
4815000	4821000	The Excessive Pornography, featuring random pictures of low cats for no reason.
4822000	4823000	That's the internet, right there.
4824000	4831000	But, yeah, so they're supposed to be doing that and they said the process should begin in the middle of the end of this month.
4832000	4841000	And of course, I don't know, we'll see once, at least I know I have one game spoken for when that comes out.
4842000	4847000	Going to the chat, some strong opinions about the whole yearly upgrades of the Ouya.
4848000	4851000	Rama in chat says, a new Ouya each year is suicide.
4852000	4857000	To which a lot of people jumped in and said iPhone, iPad, I even said the Nintendo DS called and said you're wrong.
4858000	4861000	New Ouya every year, is that suicide to admit that this early?
4861000	4870000	Well, no, because here's the thing. Remember, you may be buying this console right now and you're like, oh, they're going to have a new one next year.
4871000	4873000	But everything about this console is meant to be hacked.
4874000	4879000	So, they could sell you, hey, we have an upgraded processor, boom, put it in your console.
4880000	4884000	Or go buy that. Or, hell, hey, we're going to use Tegra 4 now or something like that.
4885000	4887000	If you want to put a Tegra 4 chip in there, here's the board to do it.
4887000	4893000	And they can sell you parts. It may not cost you as much as buying a brand new console each time around.
4894000	4897000	So, I don't really have a problem with that, if that's going to be the way they're going to go about it.
4898000	4901000	Because it's optional. I mean, hell, you can hack this thing apart and play emulators on it.
4902000	4906000	What the hell do you need a quad-core processor for that shit? I mean, you don't.
4907000	4913000	Comment from RossDielUT in our chat room, the Ouya is an open platform. We're going to see excessive porn on it anyway.
4914000	4915000	Good point.
4915000	4917000	It has access to the internet.
4918000	4919000	Will it have a web browser?
4920000	4921000	Is it connected to the internet?
4922000	4924000	Excessive porn for all! Yay!
4925000	4932000	That is one thing we can look forward to with an always connected Xbox system, is it's always going to have access to pornography on the internet.
4933000	4934000	Xbox! Tits!
4937000	4938000	Can you imagine?
4939000	4940000	Can you imagine?
4941000	4942000	It shows me Britney Spears' greatest hits.
4943000	4944000	That's not what I said!
4945000	4949000	Xbox pornography and Lumen Room and just like boobs flying at you at every angle.
4950000	4952000	Yeah! This is next gen!
4953000	4957000	Like seriously, okay, if Microsoft could come out at E3 and show that as the demo and then just slip in there.
4958000	4960000	By the way, it won't play used games, but it will totally show you tits.
4961000	4963000	Then people will be like, forgiven. You're forgiven.
4964000	4965000	Everything negative we said about the used games.
4966000	4967000	It's not going to play used games, but it can do this.
4968000	4969000	It's like, whoa!
4969000	4970000	Whoa!
4975000	4977000	Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.
4980000	4981000	Dark Sakura, would you buy one?
4982000	4987000	If Aluma Room would not play used games, would it show you all the boobies you could dream of?
4989000	4990000	I'm thinking about it.
4991000	4993000	Like Katy Perry can get up in your face and be knocking that back and forth.
4994000	4997000	That picture of Katy Perry, all over your walls, everywhere.
4999000	5001000	Oh no, that's pretty hard to say no to, Rob.
5002000	5007000	And see, with Aluma Room, because it's all going to be interactive, you could walk up into that and just like, smack.
5009000	5011000	Just put your face all up in it.
5014000	5015000	Achievement unlocked.
5016000	5017000	No one can resist motorboat.
5020000	5021000	It's like Cobra Triangle 2.
5022000	5025000	Alright, one more story for you guys.
5026000	5028000	Back when gaming was so simple.
5029000	5030000	A retro gaming story for you guys.
5031000	5034000	Before we were picturing Aluma Room projecting boobies all over the walls.
5035000	5037000	You didn't have this in these classic games.
5038000	5040000	But this is still pretty cool, a way to make it modern.
5041000	5042000	It's the Capcom Arcade Cabinet.
5043000	5045000	We've been talking about this game for a little bit on the show.
5046000	5047000	Finally, the details coming out about this game.
5048000	5051000	It's going to come out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on February 19th.
5052000	5054000	A teaser trailer went out this week showing the games that will be in it.
5054000	5056000	Black Tiger, 1943.
5057000	5062000	Ghosts and Goblins, Legendary Wings, Commando, Avengers Section Z.
5063000	5064000	And I am really excited about this.
5065000	5067000	Pirate Ship Higemaru is coming out as well.
5068000	5069000	I love that game, it's a fun little puzzler.
5070000	5071000	Reminds me a lot of like, Pingo.
5072000	5074000	But anyway, the games individually will be four bucks.
5075000	5077000	But if you want to get a bundle of three games, it will be ten dollars.
5078000	5081000	Except the very first pack is like, discounted or whatever, five dollars.
5081000	5085000	That is Avengers 1943 and Black Tiger.
5086000	5087000	Here's the best part.
5088000	5092000	In the trailer, it says that you can play these games online with friends.
5093000	5095000	So finally, somebody getting the retro thing right.
5096000	5099000	And making it so that I can play the games online across the internets.
5100000	5101000	Pretty excited about this.
5102000	5103000	I hope the games play well.
5104000	5105000	But it sounds pretty cool.
5106000	5107000	Dark Sakura, would this be something you're interested in at all?
5108000	5110000	Or no, because you kind of already have the retro stuff?
5111000	5113000	Honestly, all those games that you listed are games that we own.
5114000	5116000	So, um, it's cool though.
5117000	5119000	It's cool for people who don't already have this stuff, yeah.
5120000	5121000	The modernization, being able to play online.
5122000	5123000	Yeah, that sounds fun.
5124000	5125000	Casual mode I think was advertised too.
5126000	5127000	Maybe to make the arcade games a little easier.
5128000	5130000	Maybe so that you can actually beat ghosts and goblins, maybe?
5131000	5132000	I'm assuming that's what that means.
5133000	5134000	Well, Dan can beat it.
5135000	5137000	Well, Dan's a freak. And I mean that in the most loving way possible.
5138000	5139000	Yeah.
5139000	5144000	Uh, let's go. Speaking of classic games, I don't even need a segue this week.
5145000	5146000	We're already talking about classic games.
5147000	5148000	So let's go to the classic game of the week.
5149000	5152000	Which I believe is also a Capcom game, although not one that's been announced.
5153000	5154000	Yes it is.
5155000	5156000	Oh, it's like you knew.
5157000	5159000	But you ruined how I wanted to introduce it though.
5160000	5161000	Oh, I'm sorry.
5162000	5163000	Because I wanted you to play the YouTube clip so that you could get the...
5164000	5165000	Well, I gave a hint. I didn't tell you the game.
5166000	5167000	Well, play the little opening start on YouTube.
5167000	5170000	And it's not in the Capcom Hits collection. I'll tell you that much.
5171000	5174000	Here we go. Here is a clip from this week's classic game of the week.
5179000	5179000	
5180000	5181000	LOL internet. I don't know if...
5182000	5183000	There we go.
5186000	5188000	Yeah. We're getting a little bit of buffering today.
5189000	5191000	I'm sorry. I should have loaded this in advance.
5191000	5192000	Advance again.
5195000	5197000	It's because I missed the cue sound.
5199000	5200000	Anyway, I'll do it.
5201000	5202000	Here it is. It's coming up.
5204000	5206000	That should be enough for people to get what the game is.
5207000	5208000	All right. What is it, Darkseid?
5209000	5215000	It's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, also known in the US as Super Pocket Fighter 2 Turbo.
5216000	5219000	Also known as we had all these art assets from Puzzle Fighter.
5220000	5221000	We needed to make another game out of it.
5222000	5226000	Well, Matt, I think this came out around the same time. It came out in 97.
5227000	5228000	It was a CPS2 arcade machine.
5229000	5237000	And it came out on the PlayStation, which kept the Pocket Fighter title for the American and European release.
5238000	5242000	It came out on the Wonderswan, the Sega Saturn, and the PS2 as part of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
5242000	5244000	It's basically got all these characters in Super Deformed.
5245000	5248000	And they beat the crap out of each other using very cutesy attacks.
5249000	5259000	It also has characters from Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalker, Street Fighter 3, and from Red Earth.
5260000	5263000	That game is totally on my list of CPS3 games that I want to play.
5264000	5265000	I've never gotten to play a copy of that.
5265000	5272000	It also has just a whole ton of different characters that make appearances throughout the game.
5273000	5274000	You know, just little cameos.
5275000	5276000	So basically it's standard fighting.
5277000	5285000	And they have power-ups that match the characters that actually came from Red Earth, that system.
5285000	5296000	And then little orbs that you can catch that are thrown as your opponent to basically mimic the elemental hits in Darkstalkers.
5297000	5298000	So you can turn people to stone. You can freeze them.
5299000	5302000	And then you start with one of each of those.
5304000	5306000	You have two bars and three sub-bars.
5307000	5308000	You have a life bar and a super bar.
5308000	5314000	And then you have your mighty combo, which I always laughed at that.
5315000	5319000	Your sub-bars are basically your level of your special moves.
5320000	5323000	And your levels correspond to different colors.
5324000	5327000	So some people have extras, some don't.
5328000	5331000	But basically every time you hit a character, gems pop out.
5331000	5337000	And then you pick up the gems to power up.
5338000	5340000	So that's where it gets gem-biter from.
5341000	5342000	And basically four buttons.
5343000	5344000	Punch, kick, special, taunt.
5345000	5347000	Which taunt is of course the best thing ever.
5348000	5353000	So anyway, you also have flash combos or costume combos.
5353000	5361000	Where if you press a combination of punch or kick buttons after striking the opponent with a punch button,
5362000	5368000	then they actually will change into different costumes during the sequence, except for you.
5369000	5372000	And has a very different strong attack at the end.
5373000	5374000	Here are some examples.
5375000	5377000	Chilly turns into Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.
5378000	5379000	Felicia turns into Mega Man.
5379000	5383000	And I remember Ibuki had her little schoolgirl outfit and all of that.
5384000	5387000	So the characters in the game, you have Ryu.
5388000	5395000	You have Ken, you have Zangief, you have Chun-Li, you have Sakura and Ibuki, all from the Street Fighter series.
5396000	5400000	You have Morigen, Sienkou, or Lele as she was in Japan, and Felicia.
5401000	5405000	And then you have Tessa in Japan, who is also in Japan.
5405000	5410000	Tabasa, which I think was supposed to be Tabitha, but why didn't they just call her Tabitha over here?
5411000	5412000	I don't know.
5413000	5417000	And she's the only Red Earth character in the game.
5418000	5419000	You also have secret characters.
5420000	5423000	You have Gohki, or Akuma, and he's very powerful.
5424000	5425000	And then you have Dan.
5426000	5429000	And basically his story is probably the most hilarious one.
5430000	5433000	He's looking for students, he's looking for students, he's looking for students.
5433000	5437000	He's looking for students to start a school, so he's trying to get Sakura to be his student.
5438000	5444000	But she left the school after three days and wrote him a letter saying that she's already mastered everything that he could teach her,
5445000	5448000	and that his moves are worthless in a fight, and she calls him a loser.
5449000	5450000	And he cries.
5451000	5454000	And I think all he knocks out are gems of the same color, I want to say.
5455000	5458000	Or maybe that's in Puzzle Fighter, when all he drops are red gems.
5459000	5460000	Anyway.
5460000	5472000	It is just a fun little game. It's one of my favorite fighting games of all time, and it's just completely cracked out.
5475000	5478000	I don't know if I've played this game an awful lot. I think I've played it like once.
5479000	5483000	Oh, I see. There's the little part where she turned into Jill Valentine, and then of course the video buffered, but oh well.
5484000	5485000	Yeah, so that's the game.
5486000	5489000	Nice. So there it is, your classic game of the week, Pocket Fighter.
5490000	5495000	Which I've got two copies of. On different systems, on different systems.
5496000	5497000	As part of your collection that you counted up this week.
5498000	5499000	But my favorite to play is on Saturn.
5500000	5500000	
5501000	5502000	Because it's awesome with the Saturn controller.
5503000	5504000	And that's it.
5505000	5509000	Not that, sorry. I was trying to load something else that's coming up later in the show.
5510000	5511000	Live radio, isn't it a blast?
5512000	5517000	Alright. We are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come.
5517000	5523000	The Frugal Question of the Week coming up when we get back, as well as some rapid fire news and movie and gaming news.
5524000	5526000	And this one sounds like it could be pretty cool.
5527000	5531000	We'll see you when we get back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.
5537000	5539000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5540000	5544000	Live with our 492nd episode in progress here, as we go into the second half of the show.
5544000	5551000	February the 10th of 2013. And boy, the internet's having some lols tonight. I don't know if it's the snowstorms back east or what.
5552000	5555000	But yeah, we were having some problems playing off YouTube earlier.
5556000	5560000	And Twitter's all clogged up with crap on the Grammys. Should I blame the Grammys for this?
5561000	5562000	I blame the Grammys for everything.
5563000	5566000	I see all these people posting status updates about the Grammys and I'm just like judging you all.
5567000	5568000	Because the Grammys aren't even that good.
5569000	5572000	But whatever. People feel the need to watch it for whatever reason.
5572000	5577000	The Walking Dead stuff I get. Unless people are spoiling it. In which case, you're an asshole.
5578000	5579000	You shouldn't spoil TV shows like that.
5580000	5584000	But now what do you do now that we have shows like, what's that called? That House of Cards? It's on Netflix.
5585000	5589000	Where it's like, they just released the whole show at once. So go watch all 10 episodes or whatever.
5590000	5597000	It kind of breaks the conventional weekly shows. So how do you not spoil something that you could have just blown through on a weekend?
5598000	5599000	I don't know how you do it with movies.
5599000	5603000	I guess that's true. It's like a really long movie. It's a miniseries.
5604000	5606000	It's like a Lord of the Rings extended cut.
5608000	5609000	Exactly, right?
5612000	5618000	Anyhow, let us move on with some rapid fire news.
5619000	5620000	Alright.
5621000	5622000	Let's see.
5623000	5628000	Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge. Remember that Wii exclusive game?
5629000	5631000	Yeah, it's not a Wii exclusive anymore.
5632000	5635000	This is actually kind of interesting because remember the Wii version was actually published by Nintendo.
5636000	5642000	However, they will be coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 April 2nd.
5643000	5645000	And it's being published of course by Tecmo Koei.
5645000	5650000	And yeah, so they're going to have all that additional stuff in there.
5651000	5656000	I guess kind of think of it like a Game of the Year edition except your game didn't win Game of the Year.
5657000	5661000	Re-release of the cheaper version edition with extra stuff in it.
5662000	5667000	So yeah, not so much of that exclusiveness anymore.
5668000	5673000	We may have a glimpse of one of the first next gen games.
5674000	5681000	The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt, which I got to be honest looks a lot like Monster Hunter, but whatever.
5682000	5688000	It's going to be the cover of the next Game Informer and it is also a next gen title they announced.
5689000	5694000	Especially running on CD Projekt's Red Engine 3, which I guess will be used for that game.
5695000	5698000	I don't know if that's going to be the same engine that they're going to run on.
5699000	5704000	The, what was it, Cyberpunk or whatever.
5705000	5708000	But apparently the game is supposed to be open world.
5709000	5713000	It's going to be, I guess, I think you could say the world is going to be larger than Skyrim.
5714000	5719000	And larger than any of the environments featured in the first two Witcher games.
5720000	5721000	And it looks pretty.
5722000	5729000	I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the subtitle Wild Hunt, but it could be a cool game.
5730000	5733000	And it's due out in 2014.
5734000	5739000	They say for PC and high end platforms, or next gen consoles obviously.
5740000	5741000	So that's always an option.
5742000	5748000	And last but not least, one of the news announcements while we're out was Grand Theft Auto 5 was delayed to September.
5748000	5752000	Kind of something that I alluded to I think the last time we talked maybe.
5753000	5756000	That Grand Theft Auto they were looking at to see if it was ready.
5757000	5759000	And if it was ready it was going to be coming out at the end of May.
5760000	5762000	If not, it's going to be pushed and it got pushed.
5763000	5767000	I've had some people ask me on Twitter, Loki, so how are you doing with all this news?
5768000	5769000	How are you coping?
5770000	5771000	Are you okay?
5771000	5772000	One day at a time.
5773000	5776000	We honestly didn't know what we were going to do as far as like...
5776000	5785000	Because it was kind of like, oh, we'll play Modern Warfare 3 for a while and then by the time we're getting bored of it we'll have Grand Theft Auto 5.
5786000	5791000	And now it's delayed another potentially four months from when we were expecting it.
5792000	5794000	We're like, I don't know what we're going to do now.
5797000	5798000	It was tough.
5799000	5800000	But obviously it's for polish.
5801000	5806000	Some people were like, oh, they're delaying it so they can get our next gen consoles.
5807000	5809000	Dad, your next gen consoles are coming out in September.
5810000	5811000	No, no, that's stupid.
5812000	5825000	And they even said, you know, basically to those of you who were seeing various conspiracy theories about there being some other ulterior motive for this delay, rest assured they're all nonsense.
5825000	5830000	Literally the only reason we delayed the release is because we want the game to be as good as it needs to be.
5831000	5833000	Just throwing it out there, could it be too late?
5834000	5840000	Because sometimes when games come out too close to another system being launched, they get cannibalized a little bit.
5841000	5841000	
5842000	5843000	Grand Theft Auto 5 is too big for that?
5843000	5844000	No, it's too big for that.
5845000	5849000	I always kind of say that's why people missed Final Fantasy XII because it kind of landed in a scenario like that.
5850000	5855000	I think if anything, if you think about it, it could cannibalize the sales of the next gen consoles because look at it.
5856000	5861000	Like if they don't have a strong lineup for the next gen consoles, they'd be like, well, I don't need to buy a new Xbox.
5862000	5870000	I can just have a regular Xbox 360 and play Grand Theft Auto 5 that just came out or the next Assassin's Creed game or, you know, all these big titles that are coming out in the fall.
5872000	5875000	Some folks in the chat room saying Grand Theft Auto 6 on the next gen consoles.
5876000	5879000	I can't even fathom what that would be like, but yes.
5880000	5881000	If they sell.
5882000	5889000	Well, how about some more classic stuff? Another old school gaming compilation announced this past week, PlayStation Home Arcade.
5890000	5891000	It's something available on the Vita.
5892000	5898000	What happens is that you can buy these arcade games that you can play on the Vita and then you also get them in your PlayStation Home in those little cabinets.
5898000	5903000	And some of the games that are actually free are things that you see free in PlayStation Home.
5904000	5906000	Like what is the Icebreaker or something like that? I don't know what it's called.
5907000	5916000	But there's some other like actual classic games that are a part of this, including Time Pilot, Asteroids, Centipede, and yes, Loki, Frogger.
5917000	5921000	A couple of television games in there too, Shark Shark and Astro Smash, which I thought was interesting.
5922000	5923000	Do you have to wait in line to play those games on?
5924000	5925000	Not on your Vita.
5926000	5927000	Can I play on roller skates?
5928000	5929000	And the privacy of your own home.
5930000	5932000	For the record, playing Frogger on roller skates is difficult.
5933000	5934000	You will not think it is.
5935000	5937000	Playing Spy Hunter on roller skates was awesome.
5938000	5942000	And yes, they did have a Spy Hunter machine at the roller rink when I was growing up.
5943000	5944000	Why? I don't know.
5945000	5951000	The roller rink that I used to go to still had their Frogger when I went back like 10 years ago.
5951000	5958000	What if PlayStation Home is the next gen console? It's like, this is PlayStation Home. It's in your home.
5959000	5960000	Okay, now you're trolling.
5961000	5965000	Alright, next up. Another rumor, folks. We love our rumors, don't we?
5966000	5973000	This one's about Sonic, and apparently the next Sonic game to be announced is supposed to be Sonic Adventure 3.
5973000	5981000	Hmm. Apparently there were some registered domains back in July, and people were speculating on this.
5982000	5991000	But apparently, I don't know what this latest rumor is that's going on, but the game was going to be revealed for current gen and next gen platforms on February 2nd and 3rd.
5992000	6001000	That never actually happened, though. This is all, of course, internet speculation, but, I mean, Sonic Adventure 3 sounds probable, doesn't it?
6001000	6009000	It sounds like it has a good enough chance as any of the other Sonic games that they put out, in which case it's like a coin toss, whether it'll do well.
6010000	6013000	Who remembers a classic arcade game by Capcom called Gunsmoke?
6014000	6015000	Didn't I do it in a classic game?
6016000	6017000	Maybe. I don't remember. Hopefully.
6018000	6021000	Or as one of my favorite video review shows calls it, Gun.Smoke?
6022000	6026000	Yeah, Gun.Smoke. Yeah, because not to be confused with the TV show Gunsmoke. It had nothing to do with that.
6026000	6037000	But Gun.Smoke had a freeware remake done of it, which I'm sure was not legal at all, but, well, somebody did their own little remake.
6038000	6043000	They wanted to keep the NES port of the version intact. They didn't want to rip the assets from the arcade game or whatever.
6044000	6052000	They played the original a whole bunch of times trying to make it just perfect, and there's a whole little, again, here I go playing a YouTube, but hopefully this one will actually work.
6052000	6058000	Not bad. Looks pretty spot on to me. That's what I remember from the NES one.
6059000	6062000	Oh man, I love the boss that throws all the bombs and then he loses his pants.
6063000	6072000	What I remember about the NES one, though, was the slow-mo, because you could hit start over and over again and make it run in that slow-mo mode, and even the NES Advantage had that little button on it that was just, hit start as fast as you can.
6073000	6075000	Hey, bullet time before bullet time.
6076000	6080000	That's the only way you could beat Gun.Smoke, by the way. Unless you're Dan or something.
6080000	6083000	Oh, my man. He is so awesome.
6084000	6088000	So, was that your series?
6089000	6100000	Well, Bethesda put out an announcement that the Rage, the official toolkit for Rage is out on Steam, and it's going to be 35 plus gigabytes.
6100000	6112000	Well, actually, no, it's out, but to quote John Carmack, he's saying the toolkit release is not something that we consider consumer friendly, but it does let you get a good look inside the construction process.
6113000	6115000	So, pretty cool, huh?
6116000	6123000	Also, EA has zero intention of patching a loot exploit in Dead Space 3.
6123000	6138000	Basically, it lets you pretty much farm for resources that would cost you currency and microtransactions, and EA is saying, okay, go for it. We don't care.
6139000	6141000	The microtransactions are just convenience.
6142000	6159000	And when I saw this, thank you Catastrophic Moggy for giving me this link when we had our lovely, for me, 3 a.m. chat, but Farmville is going to have an animated series out done by Brett Ratner.
6160000	6165000	You know what else he's given us? X-Men Last Stand, That Turd.
6166000	6167000	Rush Hour movies, I think were him.
6168000	6169000	Red Dragon.
6169000	6171000	So, yeah, and actually...
6172000	6176000	This sounds like terrible fan rumor stuff, so I hope that's what it is.
6177000	6186000	According to the Wall Street Journal, it will be produced by Ratner in association with 611 Media, a Canadian television company.
6187000	6192000	And other producers are Kirk Schenk, Charles Bishop, and Nina Gelb.
6193000	6194000	Did you say the Canadian television company?
6195000	6195000	
6195000	6199000	Well, when somebody asked me, what about all the bad things Canada did, I will remember this one.
6200000	6201000	But I can always forgive Canada.
6202000	6203000	I know, they did give us You Can't Do That on television.
6204000	6205000	For two reasons.
6206000	6207000	Rush.
6208000	6209000	That's true.
6210000	6211000	Because Neil Peart is the best drummer in the universe.
6212000	6213000	And I do love Misa Milanis, Haters Gonna Hate.
6214000	6216000	And Canada's Rush Driver. Seriously, watch it on YouTube. The show is awesome.
6217000	6222000	And I'm going to give a pre-emptive F you to the people who won season 8, just saying you guys don't need to be driving.
6223000	6224000	That's it.
6225000	6230000	Alright, let's move on to the Frugal Question of the Week. We got a ton of responses this week on the Frugal Question of the Week.
6231000	6232000	Which is great. We love hearing from all of our listeners.
6233000	6234000	But yes, the Frugal Question of the Week.
6235000	6238000	Take Facebook and Google and smash those words together, you get Frugal.
6239000	6241000	And we ask a question of our fan communities each week.
6242000	6244000	You guys give us answers and we read some of them on the show.
6245000	6246000	I am not going to be able to read them all tonight.
6247000	6248000	You guys were too good this week.
6248000	6255000	So please visit our fan communities at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see the answers in their entirety.
6256000	6259000	We'll start with Google Plus once I, of course, tell you the question.
6260000	6261000	It's a short one tonight, but a good one.
6262000	6267000	I think we've all heard the rumor about the next Xbox blocking used games.
6268000	6269000	Do you believe this rumor could be true?
6270000	6273000	For that matter, how much do you tend to believe industry rumors?
6273000	6278000	We get a lot of rumors. How do you feel about this one and do rumors carry a lot of weight with you?
6279000	6286000	Over on Google Plus, Tech EQ says, my stance on game industry rumors has to be to take them with a grain of salt.
6287000	6291000	This leads to less heartache if a particular rumor doesn't come true or vice versa.
6292000	6297000	Isn't that the truth? There's already people saying I'm not going to buy the next console based on rumors alone.
6298000	6302000	It's a little early to call that, don't you think?
6303000	6308000	I think that's also kind of going back to what we were talking about in part A where, you know,
6309000	6311000	Rayman Legends and how all the fans are pissed off about it right now.
6312000	6314000	Come September they're going to just buy the game anyways.
6315000	6320000	E3VL or Evil says on Google Plus, sources are barely creditable these days.
6321000	6327000	Seeing the internet being first on a news site is better than having long wait times to confirm information when it comes to rumors and speculation.
6328000	6331000	If anyone tries to discredit the website later down the line, they can label the article as,
6331000	6335000	it was just a rumor, as if it was some magical phrase to get them out of the situation.
6336000	6339000	So, you know, one of those whole, it's become about hits, hits, hits.
6340000	6348000	And certainly the ESA only fosters that attitude when it's all about the hits to get your site validated by them.
6349000	6352000	So you may be blessed by the ESA Pope to go to E3.
6353000	6354000	The ESA Pope.
6354000	6361000	Well, that's what it is. You have to email the ESA Pope and say, please, I would like to be blessed to go to your E3 event.
6362000	6366000	And then they judge, you are, you stand in front of the gates and your website is judged.
6367000	6374000	How many hits did you accumulate in December of last year and ye are worthy or no reply?
6375000	6379000	Now I'm picturing what his Pope mobile looks like, you know, with the glass and probably pulled by light cycles.
6380000	6383000	Yes. I actually envisioned that the ESA Pope is basically Dame Edna.
6384000	6386000	Yes, it's Dame Edna.
6387000	6397000	Why hello my puppets. Oh, it's Orange Lounge Radio is applying to go to E3. Who are they?
6398000	6400000	What does Orange Lounge have to do with a video game?
6401000	6404000	By the way, you mentioned Dame Edna. You know what I found the other day?
6405000	6410000	The picture I did for Xtaphir of Dame Edna saying pandarens.
6412000	6413000	Random.
6414000	6417000	No game or, you know, video in their title.
6418000	6421000	Gamer tag radio. I've never heard of you.
6425000	6431000	Anyhow, moving on. That's a Twitter joke, by the way. He'll appreciate that joke. I know.
6432000	6435000	Moving on, going to Facebook and talking about rumors over there.
6436000	6441000	Critical Myth from our friends over at the Critical Myth show, Monday, Wednesday, Fridays here on VOG.
6441000	6446000	Critical Myth says, I think they will attempt it, talking about the Xbox use game thing,
6447000	6449000	and have some way of linking a game to your Xbox Live account.
6450000	6459000	But I also think that they will come to an agreement with the evil G and other used game outlets to make the online pass concept into a game unlock fee.
6460000	6464000	So basically you buy it new, no fee, get it used, pay to play.
6465000	6467000	What do you think about the whole unlock fee?
6468000	6477000	It's money grubbing because all the excuses that they were saying before that, oh, it's gonna be, you know, all the developers lose all their money.
6478000	6484000	Developers aren't getting paid for that anyways. I mean, you pay the developer and they may have commissions or whatever based on it,
6485000	6490000	but when they're being sold to, you know, distributors or retailers or whatever, it doesn't matter if they sell through.
6491000	6497000	It's just, you're gonna put them out of business if you get rid of used games, because that's how they make their money,
6498000	6500000	because your margins in your games are terrible.
6501000	6505000	Unless all of a sudden they start giving, you know, retailers way better costs on goods,
6506000	6512000	then that's the only thing that's gonna really drive new games, because if it becomes more profitable to sell a new title than it does used,
6513000	6515000	then they're gonna, you know, go that route.
6515000	6519000	Brandon C. on Facebook five hours ago was saying something we brought up here on the show.
6520000	6526000	The only way to enforce it would be some sort of always online requirement and Sony and Microsoft coming together to make it happen.
6527000	6530000	There's no way Microsoft would block used games without Sony agreeing to do the same.
6531000	6533000	So, funny enough, that point I brought up earlier with the...
6534000	6535000	The new axis of evil, huh?
6536000	6539000	Yeah. Red the Haze replies in part,
6539000	6545000	I think people are overreacting to the news because everyone's excited for the new generation and any information,
6546000	6547000	even rumors, are given a lot of attention.
6548000	6550000	Gamers should just shut up and finish their backlogs already.
6551000	6554000	Yeah. Shut up and go eat your backlog.
6555000	6558000	No dessert for you. That's actually really good advice.
6559000	6560000	Kids in China have no backlog.
6565000	6567000	I made Bob turn red. That was awesome.
6567000	6570000	Well, that was a witty retort. It's very true.
6573000	6576000	Let's see. Gary Baxter on Facebook replies,
6577000	6581000	I take everything I hear with a grain of salt until someone with real pull in the company confirms it.
6582000	6588000	However, this does sound like Microsoft would do to get more sales on titles that most people would wait and pick up used from the evil G or a pawn shop.
6589000	6593000	But until an official spokesperson says yea or nay, all we can do is wait.
6594000	6601000	Let's see. VX Jason XV says, it already happened. Hello, non-code based digital downloads.
6602000	6610000	Industry rumors are silly. Peers spin in exactly the same way as positive announcements, but are often able to be traced back to something specific.
6611000	6613000	One more here from Dark Charger.
6614000	6618000	It wouldn't be all that surprising. Online passes were already signs of things to come.
6618000	6623000	The next generation is bound to do even more to cripple our out and out eliminate the used market as we know it.
6624000	6630000	The key we'll really boil down to is implementation. If it's clunky, inconvenient, or overly restrictive, it's going to be a non-starter.
6631000	6643000	While these are still unsubstantiated rumors, I could totally see a future where all game purchases are tied to a user account or gamertag via a key that ships with a disk or linked via digital download.
6644000	6651000	Good thought. We didn't even name before, which I'm sure we've all got to be thinking about, but what if your Xbox has to be always online?
6652000	6659000	Xbox Live goes down sometimes. Look at tonight. We've got those snowstorms going on that are knocking things out.
6660000	6666000	What if the internet was too choppy and you couldn't maintain your connection? Are you just hosed? Screw you and your $60 game?
6666000	6673000	Shouldn't they learn from Ubisoft that tried to do this shit with their DRM and how well that worked?
6674000	6682000	Honestly, I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the infrastructure in place to where that's a guarantee that you're going to have an internet connection.
6683000	6686000	I just don't see that that would be a viable option.
6687000	6694000	Now, granted, they could try crazy things if they want, but it doesn't mean it's going to work.
6694000	6700000	Alright, I'm going to read one more answer. I was going to end it there, but I've got to do this one last answer because I think this is pretty good.
6701000	6703000	I think they're all good, but this one kind of brings up a different point here I want to read.
6704000	6705000	It's SSJ100Matt on Facebook.
6706000	6715000	I'm going to put the tinfoil hat on and say, I believe it, only because I think that Microsoft purposely leaked this rumor to gauge the community's reaction and plan their approach from there.
6716000	6719000	I've got to stop there. What did they think was going to happen?
6719000	6723000	Oh, yes, the community is going to love this. I mean, really?
6724000	6729000	The problem with if you're going to gauge interest is there's no upside to that.
6730000	6731000	Oh, we're going to get rid of your ability to play used games.
6732000	6733000	Hooray!
6734000	6741000	If it was like, we're going to get rid of the ability for you to play used games, but all the games that are going to retail for $20 cheaper than they were now, then that would be okay.
6742000	6746000	I'm okay with not being able to play used games, but I can get my games cheaper at launch. I'm fine with that.
6746000	6753000	Yes, yes, actually, yes. I would be totally okay with all of this if all games were $19.99.
6754000	6762000	Think about it. Would suddenly this not be such bad news if games weren't $60 anymore? What if Halo 5 was $20?
6763000	6764000	Yeah, that's not a big deal.
6765000	6771000	It's not a big deal, is it? Okay, yeah, you're right. Take away my ability to play used games. If you're willing to put that commitment in, so am I.
6772000	6774000	I usually don't buy games until they drop down that low now.
6774000	6784000	Anyhow, continuing on with the comment here. I think Microsoft has seen enough from companies like EA where they seem to have gotten away with charging for passes for online play in their games.
6785000	6790000	I think it's only a matter of time before we see console makers doing this, but I anticipate Microsoft coming up with a creative way to charge for it.
6791000	6803000	Perhaps they can bundle it with your yearly Xbox Live fee, like a diamond club that pays for unlimited use of used or borrowed games in exchange for discounts or specials on the Xbox Live Marketplace, much like PlayStation Plus.
6804000	6813000	That way, they'll still get money, encourage gamers to spend more money in the marketplace, and make people like they're not getting charged a second or third time for the same game.
6814000	6820000	Just a thought, but at Microsoft, if you're listening and like that idea, call me. Oh, that's an ugly idea.
6821000	6827000	To the guy sitting in the boardroom, that's a beautiful idea, but that is an ugly idea, and I'm almost a little ashamed that I read it.
6827000	6836000	Think about what he's saying. Yes, it blocks out used games, but if you're an Xbox Live diamond member, that restriction is lifted.
6837000	6838000	That is ugly.
6839000	6844000	That would come back to bite him in the ass so fast. It's not even funny.
6845000	6846000	Oh, God.
6847000	6848000	Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if they've already thought of it.
6849000	6850000	Can't you kinda see it?
6851000	6853000	Can't you kinda see it?
6854000	6855000	It's almost worse than just blocking.
6856000	6857000	It is almost.
6858000	6859000	Talk about like...
6860000	6861000	Well, let's just...
6862000	6863000	I feel dirty. I need to bathe after reading that.
6864000	6871000	Here's the thing, and I don't think this is one of the stories we're covering, but the other day, Sony's stock price went down 10%.
6872000	6880000	They can't make these really crazy decisions to pull this kind of crap on their consumer. They have to play it safe.
6880000	6886000	I think the same with Microsoft is they have to play it safe, too. I don't think that they can get rid of used game sales that way, because that's...
6887000	6891000	Seriously, it's a gamble, because unless both of them are doing it, then...
6892000	6895000	And I still think even if Nintendo would have to do it, too.
6897000	6902000	And also the fact that you have to completely forget the fact that there's all these older consoles out there.
6903000	6905000	Game Guru in chat sums it up perfectly.
6905000	6907000	Live.vognetwork.com. Game Guru says,
6908000	6914000	So I have to pay $60 a year to not only play games online, but to play used games. Fuck that shit. Fuck that shit.
6917000	6918000	My SNES is looking better than mine.
6919000	6921000	Well, you said $60 a year, because $60 a year is for gold.
6922000	6928000	Why stop at $60? This is the diamond plan. Maybe they'll throw in a free movie.
6929000	6931000	Free rental on Xbox movies.
6931000	6939000	Free rental on an Xbox movie. Oh, I feel dirty. Thank you, Frugal Question of the Week.
6940000	6944000	You get your honorary member card along with a bottle of lube and commemorate the Xbox.
6945000	6948000	And, you know, if you get the diamond plan, then they'll throw in a wedge for you to bend over.
6949000	6956000	Suddenly that name of Xbox lube sounds more and more appropriate, because if y'all are buying it, you better lube yourself up.
6956000	6960000	It's going the route of Sony. It's Latin. It's lube.
6963000	6966000	I like that name even better. The Xbox lube.
6970000	6977000	Alright, let's get into some real news. Let's stop all this wank and get into, oh, other wank about movies and stuff, right, Loki?
6978000	6982000	Yeah, so let's talk about shit that's never gonna happen while I'm still alive.
6983000	6990000	So Valve's looking to make a Portal or Half-Life movie with J.J. Abrams. Yeah, that's right.
6991000	6999000	So J.J. Abrams says, we're gonna try to figure out if we can make a Half-Life or a Portal movie together, basically said Gabe Newell.
7000000	7009000	And I guess they've, I don't know, no timetable's been talked about or anything.
7009000	7013000	And let's put it this way, we're not gonna see this anytime soon.
7014000	7020000	I mean, I think we'll see Half-Life 3 before we'll see a Portal movie and Half-Life movie.
7021000	7027000	It would be awesome, but also consider the fact that, you know, J.J. Abrams is a little busy right now.
7028000	7033000	He's got a Star Trek movie coming out and Star Wars movie he's working on, so.
7034000	7036000	How much lens flare will this one have?
7036000	7043000	An amazing amount of lens flare. It'll be crazy, especially with those Portals being all shiny and everything.
7044000	7046000	There's a lot of lens flare to be had there.
7047000	7048000	The potential is staggering.
7049000	7053000	Yes. So of course, you know, brief announcement, enough to tease people.
7054000	7060000	No, they're not gonna give anybody any sort of release dates because they would only have to delay them indefinitely like they do with Half-Life 3.
7061000	7066000	You guys, what if Half-Life 3 is a movie? That's it. That's the catch.
7067000	7071000	What if they're already like movies anyway with just some gameplay thrown in here and there?
7072000	7081000	What if the source code for Half-Life 3 has been hidden in all the other Valve games that they put out in some secret encrypted code and then if you decrypt it all and put it together you can play Half-Life 3.
7082000	7085000	It's been in front of your eyes the whole time and he's just laughing maniacally.
7086000	7087000	New ARG, new ARG.
7087000	7094000	Isn't J.J. Abrams kind of busy though? Like, you know, Star Wars, it's kind of a big deal.
7095000	7101000	I know he's signed on for the next movie, but isn't that gonna be like the next trilogy? I mean, because that could take a long time.
7102000	7103000	Are they just gonna say fuck you to all the books?
7104000	7106000	Yes, they are saying fuck you to all the books, which I'm totally okay with.
7107000	7109000	I'm totally okay with after like the first seven of them.
7110000	7114000	Can you imagine trying to keep everything in line with how many books there are? It'd just be insane.
7114000	7117000	No, it's not gonna be, it's gonna be a totally new thing and I'm okay with that.
7118000	7126000	J.J. Abrams I believe is only on board to direct episode seven, which is okay because four, five, and six had different directors too.
7127000	7129000	So, Lucas did the first one but he didn't do five and six.
7130000	7135000	I will never, ever recognize the quote, first three quote as being canon.
7136000	7137000	No one will, honey. Nobody will.
7137000	7142000	That's alright, for number eight and nine they've got Brett Ratner and Joel Schumacher.
7143000	7144000	God, I hell.
7145000	7146000	There'll be nipples on everybody.
7147000	7149000	No, it's um, fuck what's his name, Ewey Bowl.
7150000	7151000	Oh god.
7152000	7154000	I'm gonna make it a zombie movie that's gonna be steampunk and...
7155000	7156000	And Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it.
7157000	7161000	Everybody freeze. Everybody chill.
7162000	7163000	I am your grandfather.
7164000	7166000	Can you feel the ice?
7167000	7175000	You know, I still have a lot of Arnold movies to catch up on and I'm sorry, I don't care how terrible the movie...
7176000	7177000	That new one flopped.
7178000	7182000	That's fine because people are setting their expectations too high. It's a popcorn movie, okay?
7183000	7186000	Was really like commando that deep of a movie? I mean, come on.
7186000	7190000	Being the governor of California wasn't the best career choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger, let's be real.
7191000	7192000	It seemed like a noble thing to do.
7193000	7195000	Dude, he gives tank rights to the press.
7196000	7198000	I watched a video on that. That's awesome.
7199000	7201000	And he has his own tank that he drives around.
7202000	7207000	Because, you know what, when he was in the military, he was a tank driver. So that's pretty awesome.
7208000	7213000	Uh, Black Wolf in chat says, Star Wars Episode VIII Explosions directed by Michael Bay.
7213000	7216000	Is Michael Bay the director of Independence Day or is that Roland Emmerich?
7217000	7218000	That's Roland Emmerich.
7219000	7220000	That's who needs to direct.
7221000	7222000	Bad Boys would be. You know what?
7223000	7226000	I'm sorry, Independence Day is one of those movies that only gets better with time.
7227000	7229000	Have you? Now, did you watch 2012?
7230000	7232000	Uh, no. I've only seen clips of it.
7233000	7234000	It's a long ass movie, but...
7235000	7239000	You know what movie I did see was The Day After Tomorrow, where they're literally running after ice.
7240000	7242000	It's almost like The Happening. They're running after wind.
7243000	7248000	You know what? I flipped a table when they were running toward the little fire in the building, the fireplace.
7249000	7250000	I just flipped my table.
7251000	7257000	You have to seriously watch 2012 because they escaped from an earthquake via plane two or three times.
7258000	7262000	It's like the same scene. It's like, didn't we just do this?
7263000	7265000	I mean, how would, what's going on?
7265000	7270000	Black Wolf and Chat says, fun fact, Independence Day's original script was Stargate 2.
7271000	7273000	I have heard that before too, that Independence Day started as Stargate 2.
7274000	7275000	I can see that.
7276000	7277000	It makes sense. It does.
7278000	7279000	I mean, obviously it changed a lot, but...
7280000	7285000	You know, there was also, I think, something in the original script that explained why the Apple thing worked.
7286000	7291000	Why they were able to hack it with Mac is that they had already been working on breaking down the code on the one ship that they had.
7292000	7294000	They had, like, all the stuff written out.
7295000	7297000	Why are people trying to explain the logic in the movie? I mean, that's...
7298000	7299000	Well, the thing is, they had it explained.
7300000	7303000	I just remember sitting there in the theater when they first showed the preview and the aliens...
7304000	7306000	Like, you know, how old were we all when that movie came out? Well, you would have been a little younger.
7307000	7308000	I was in college the first time.
7309000	7314000	I saw that every day. The second, the third, and the fourth.
7315000	7318000	It's like every day of the movie, it was just like, okay, we're on the second.
7319000	7320000	Okay, we're on the third. We're on the fourth.
7321000	7322000	We're going to be an alien every single day.
7323000	7328000	Remember, though, when that trailer first came out with the alien ship came out and it blew up the White House and everybody's like, fuck yeah!
7329000	7335000	Like, I remember that to this day. Everybody's sitting there in the theater going, fuck yeah!
7336000	7343000	I have to say, though, for as crappy as that movie was, they did actually do a few cinemagraphic innovations.
7344000	7346000	Too bad it didn't help the rainings.
7346000	7351000	TigerKlonChat saying, I read the director wants to make Independence Day 2 and 3 at some point.
7352000	7353000	I think it's a little long from that right now.
7354000	7355000	God can only hope. Do you remember what else?
7356000	7357000	What if they have what's-his-face?
7358000	7359000	I know this is not a tangent you all asked for, but it's Orange Lawn's radio, people.
7360000	7364000	Do you know what made the movie Independence Day? Do you know what made that fucking movie?
7365000	7366000	The dog surviving?
7367000	7368000	Harvey Fierstein is in Independence Day.
7369000	7371000	Oh, God, I've got to call my mother.
7372000	7373000	I know!
7377000	7378000	I loved him.
7382000	7385000	Best choice of casting ever.
7388000	7390000	I just like how they were advertising, you don't know who's going to die.
7391000	7394000	And I pretty much pegged everyone who was going to die in that movie.
7396000	7397000	Oh, you're looking.
7399000	7400000	Oh, crap.
7402000	7405000	Let's see. I'm trying to find a clip. I can't find one.
7406000	7411000	Oh, here we go. Here we go. There's at least this one little clip. Here we go. Here we go.
7420000	7421000	Oh, crap.
7422000	7423000	I love him.
7423000	7424000	I love him.
7425000	7438000	I think I remember from that, you know, was it residents of L.A. are being warned not to fire or was it like or use their firearms at the alien spacecraft or discharge their firearms at the aliens?
7439000	7440000	Yes. Yes. No warning.
7441000	7443000	What up? G said he said forget his lawyer. That's right.
7444000	7448000	I got to call my mother and I got to call my lawyer. I forget my lawyer.
7450000	7451000	All right. We got to move.
7451000	7453000	So they can have like RuPaul in the next one.
7454000	7461000	And to answer Dungeon Bester, no, I do not have the Independence Day game. It is not anywhere at all in the collection.
7462000	7467000	Aliens are coming to us from Mars. Well, they need to sashay away.
7470000	7471000	Is that a dragon?
7471000	7473000	RuPaul being in. Oh, forget it.
7475000	7478000	Dark Sakura, you need to sissy that walk. All right.
7478000	7479000	All right. Moving on.
7481000	7482000	Is it finally my turn? Because, fuck.
7483000	7484000	No, I have to talk about Skylanders.
7485000	7486000	Who are we even talking about?
7487000	7488000	Movies. Oh, that's right.
7489000	7490000	J.J. Abrams somehow.
7491000	7494000	Thank you, J.J. Abrams, for derailing the show in an epic manner.
7495000	7496000	Now here's a lens flare for you.
7497000	7498000	Ah, blind.
7499000	7504000	Skylanders. Hey, what a great way to follow up a Harvey Fierstein story than talking about Skylanders.
7504000	7511000	Skylanders Swap Force is coming out. You swap them. 16 special figures with torsos and bottom hats.
7512000	7513000	You have to do the accent for the whole thing.
7514000	7518000	No. You link the two pieces together. You can combine the pieces in different ways.
7519000	7526000	So it's like, oh, God, a whole new collection crap. Now you've got to collect heads and feet instead of just, you know, the figures themselves.
7526000	7534000	You can mix and match. Although, in theory, it's a neat way to evolve the concept, I guess, for what it's worth.
7535000	7539000	It's also going to make you buy a brand new portal because the old portal is not compatible with the new characters.
7540000	7542000	Oh, bastards. Bastards.
7543000	7544000	That's an $80 purchase right there, buddy.
7545000	7552000	It's also being done by Vicarious Visions. It is not being done by Toys for Bob, who did the original Toys for Bob coming up with a new money-making scheme right now.
7552000	7557000	All they're doing is putting out new characters because there is a thing. They made tons of money.
7558000	7565000	Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, Wii, and 3DS. Interesting that it's on Wii U and Wii.
7566000	7571000	The Wii version being done by Binox, 3DS by N-Space because they've been contracted out because they don't care.
7572000	7576000	They know that people buy the characters. They don't care about the game. They just want people to buy characters.
7576000	7583000	And if you think Skylanders isn't a thing, like that people are making too big of a deal out of Skylanders, you're probably right.
7584000	7592000	But the reality is, walking to Target or Best Buy, like I was at Best Buy last night because, I don't know, we were like, oh yeah, you can actually get those K-Cup coffee things pretty cheap at Best Buy.
7593000	7594000	That's what we were there for.
7595000	7596000	Go to Marshalls.
7597000	7603000	There was an aisle in the video game section, an entire aisle dedicated to Skylanders. It'll blow your mind.
7603000	7607000	Soon, of course, Disney Infinity and all this other stuff will be competing with it, but my God.
7608000	7612000	Disney Infinity, can you imagine compared to the Skylanders stuff? They're going to have so much.
7613000	7620000	Entire stores. Anyway, Activision on their earnings call announced 100 million Skylanders toys have been sold.
7621000	7626000	Wow. Oh, I'm sorry, that was actually from their press conference at Toy Fair 2013. Excuse me, not from the earnings call.
7627000	7635000	But yeah, 500 million in sales in the US alone, 195 million of that from Skylanders Giants.
7636000	7640000	It's a thing, like it or not, it's a thing.
7641000	7643000	Yeah, it's because people will blindly collect those toys.
7644000	7647000	And now that they have to buy new characters and version 3s of their characters.
7648000	7655000	Honestly, if I were 8, I'd want it to. I mean, I'm trying to put it in that perspective, is that it's easy for me to sit here and laugh at it.
7656000	7660000	But whoever fucking thought of this is a genius. And if I was a kid, I would fucking want it.
7661000	7665000	But I got to wonder what's going to happen when Infinity comes out, because that's going to cut them off at the knees, I think.
7666000	7667000	I did see the trailer for that and I liked it.
7668000	7670000	Well, they're all going to, I mean, it's not going to end there.
7671000	7677000	Wait, you don't think Nintendo wants that near field communication shit to work so they can bring on the fucking Pokemon?
7678000	7684000	They've talked about that before. That's all Nintendo has to fucking do, is announce Pokemon for Wii U with actual Pokemon.
7684000	7686000	You will collect them all. You will collect them all.
7689000	7690000	Each character is going to be $10.
7691000	7695000	Nintendo's got a lot of stuff they could whip out and put on the table if they wanted to. Believe me.
7696000	7697000	Talk about needing lube.
7699000	7700000	When they whip that out.
7701000	7702000	Is your body ready for this, bitch?
7703000	7704000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.
7705000	7707000	By the way, Rob, did you see my suggestion in chat?
7708000	7709000	No.
7710000	7713000	Mr. Spanky needs a New York Jewish cousin named Harvey Spanklestock.
7714000	7716000	He understands the Mr. Spanky joke anymore. That's the problem.
7717000	7718000	There's people who get it?
7719000	7720000	Like four or five.
7721000	7722000	I miss Mr. Spanky, Rob.
7723000	7724000	Because DDR is not on PC anymore.
7725000	7726000	I know. How old is DDR PC these days?
7727000	7728000	Good lord.
7729000	7731000	I could probably find it on abandonware sites. That's how old DDR PC is.
7732000	7737000	You could probably find it unwrapped and boxed in my house. I mean, wrapped and boxed in my house, which is true.
7738000	7741000	So, speaking of Konami, how's that?
7741000	7751000	Anyway, the UK studio dude, David Cox, said that they want to consider putting out Castlevania Mirror of Fate on HD platforms.
7752000	7754000	The game is coming out on the 5th in the US for the 3DS.
7755000	7757000	But he said that the whole game is actually already done in high def.
7758000	7765000	That they actually shrunk it and removed bones and changed animations to make it DS sized, or 3DS sized.
7765000	7778000	So, yeah, in fact, the quote right here is, at Mercury S-Team we have an HD version of the game sitting there in a computer somewhere.
7779000	7787000	So, I mean, I guess all the other Castlevania games have sold very well, but the cover art is really pretty.
7788000	7790000	But I'm really not sure how well it's going to sell.
7791000	7793000	I mean, maybe it will. It's a Castlevania game.
7794000	7796000	Hard to go wrong there. Sorry, Castlevania 64.
7799000	7805000	I could see them doing something like this for maybe a Nintendo console, because it's a 3DS game.
7806000	7808000	Maybe, hey, there's a perfect Wii U tie-in right there.
7809000	7810000	There you go.
7811000	7813000	You can have that little Metroidvania map on your little Wii U.
7814000	7816000	Did they say this is another Metroidvania style one?
7817000	7818000	Oh, I don't know. I'm just making that up.
7818000	7825000	It's sort of like a port of Lords of Shadows, so it's a hack and slash.
7827000	7828000	God of Belmont.
7829000	7830000	Pretty much, yeah.
7832000	7833000	Whip of War.
7834000	7835000	Can't even follow those anymore.
7836000	7837000	Moving on.
7837000	7838000	I wouldn't buy it, by the way.
7839000	7841000	So Atari, of course, not doing that great.
7842000	7846000	We've heard that they were talking about declaring bankruptcy and stuff, so they did that.
7846000	7854000	And the U.S. branch of Atari, they closed, I guess, $2 million in debt or in possession financing.
7855000	7859000	And also, I guess, they're supposed to be expecting some other money coming in.
7860000	7864000	But right now, they're looking at, I guess, restructuring.
7865000	7872000	And with that, probably going to be selling off assets and properties, including all your favorite Atari franchises.
7873000	7881000	So I'm guessing that they're going to basically be selling off this stuff and still sticking around to make new things?
7882000	7883000	Or are they just going to go away?
7884000	7885000	That's the only thing I didn't understand about it.
7886000	7889000	So yeah, you can possibly buy Pong, combat, all that fun stuff.
7890000	7894000	You know what somebody needs to buy is Sword Quest and do something with that. Remember Sword Quest?
7895000	7895000	
7895000	7900000	Nope. Oh, it was an Atari 2600 series that never finished, but the games were so hard.
7901000	7909000	They were doing a real contest to give away these real swords and crowns and shit that were valued at all, this money back in the 80s.
7910000	7915000	And I think Earthworld, Fireworld, and Waterworld all came out, but the last one, Airworld, never did.
7916000	7922000	And I think Waterworld was right at the death stroke of Atari, so I think it's one of those hard to find cartridges.
7922000	7929000	Yeah, anyway, sorry, I'm just thinking of all these obscure Atari franchises people ought to gobble up. Anyhow.
7930000	7931000	New Marvel Madness, please.
7932000	7935000	Right? Like 720.
7936000	7944000	Alright, moving on. One place that would not be selling these Atari remake games if things keep going the way they're going is HMV.
7945000	7948000	Not a chain I've heard of, but I think these are big over in the UK, or at least bigger than they are here.
7949000	7950000	I think they're only in the UK.
7950000	7956000	Are they? I want to say I've heard the name before, but maybe because they partner with somebody over here, I don't know.
7957000	7963000	But anyway, HMV, this does affect the UK mostly, which has had a lot of bad news when it comes to game retailers lately.
7964000	7971000	Closing 66 of their 220 stores, which means 930 people out of a job as a result. Really a bummer.
7972000	7974000	These stores closing in the next one or two months.
7974000	7977000	A quote from joint administrator Nick Edwards.
7978000	7983000	This step has been taken in order to enhance the prospects of securing the business's future as a going concern.
7984000	7990000	We continue to receive strong support from staff and are extremely grateful to them for their commitment during an understandably difficult period.
7991000	7996000	All other key stakeholders remain very supportive and I continue to be hopeful of securing a future for the restructure business.
7997000	8000000	So hopefully closing these stores will allow the rest of them to get stronger, we'll see.
8000000	8007000	But I know over here in the US, Blockbuster, I didn't even realize they still had as many stores as they did, but they're closing a lot more.
8008000	8010000	The one in Thomas, I think, just started their big sale.
8011000	8015000	Yeah, and remember when Blockbusters used to be on every corner and now it's like, wow.
8016000	8020000	Down the 500 and down the 500 in the UK too.
8021000	8025000	Can you imagine when we get to the point where GameStop will do that? Because there's a lot of GameStops out there.
8026000	8026000	
8027000	8028000	Yeah, some of them are already starting to close.
8028000	8030000	Getting pretty crazy.
8031000	8039000	So anyway, our thoughts to those that were impacted by jobs, hopefully something, a similar retail operation will come to take their place, we will hope.
8040000	8045000	Anyhow, let's move on and get into some listener feedback in the form of emails.
8046000	8047000	Every week you guys email us.
8048000	8056000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we sort through the spam and find the emails that were actually from legit listeners.
8056000	8061000	And we read some of our favorites here on the program. DarkSakura, pick some out and read them for us.
8062000	8066000	Okay, well I will go with the oldest to newest because we got two weeks worth of emails.
8067000	8073000	This one, well I didn't put a nickname on it so I'm just, oh no, it's Honey Badger.
8074000	8075000	Hi guys, this is...
8076000	8077000	Honey Badger don't take shit from no one.
8078000	8082000	This is Sam, aka Honey Badger on Steam. I am ecstatic to hear the positive views on PC gaming.
8082000	8090000	The largest complaint and truth I hear from console gamers is instability with games on PC because it's up to the end user to set the graphics options.
8091000	8095000	Of course, if you go over the top with graphics levels your video card can't handle, you get instability.
8096000	8105000	Nvidia has looked into this and will be releasing a tool that analyzes your specs and has them set per game configuration that will give you the best performance and visual appeal.
8106000	8108000	Thanks for this show, I hope to see you on Steam.
8109000	8110000	PS, I want to add Rob and Loki on Steam if that's possible.
8110000	8116000	We have an Orange Launch Radio community on Steam. You can have lots of people that listen to the show and yes, we're in there too.
8117000	8118000	Just look on me and link from there.
8119000	8127000	Yes, O.L. Army I think it's called. There are Orange Launch Radio fans and there's a VoG network one. I really should be pimping that one because we want to, you know, all the VoG people, but join them both.
8128000	8129000	Our VoGies?
8130000	8131000	Yes, do we have a name for the VoG listeners?
8132000	8133000	VoGlets.
8134000	8135000	VoGlets, VoGlets, our little VoGlets.
8136000	8137000	We can have a VoG house.
8137000	8153000	But anyhow, join those communities and yes, Loki and I are in there. And of course, PC gaming, it's a part of gaming and sometimes we, I mean honestly, I play games on my PC more than anything else because World of Warcraft is on PC.
8154000	8161000	And there's a lot of stuff you can't deny and especially is great on PC like Path of Exile I talked about earlier, you're just not going to see that on consoles.
8161000	8172000	I've gotten to where I really prefer Dragon Age 2 on PC because of the whole tap and auto attack. The fact that I don't have to map certain attacks just to my trigger buttons, I can actually map them onto my number pad.
8173000	8183000	And that's not to say I dislike consoles because certainly I love consoles too. I own them all and there's certain things that consoles do that PCs don't do well when it comes to the optimization and so forth.
8183000	8191000	So you know what, there's room for both though. I think most people, despite the whole console versus PC wars, most people probably play on both no matter what they say.
8192000	8193000	Although, Mass Effect series, much better on PC.
8194000	8200000	Whatever, alright. The other thing I wanted to throw out there, the optimization thing, I can't believe something like that doesn't already exist.
8201000	8205000	Like it's one of those things, he explains it and I think, God, why isn't that already out there? It's a great idea.
8206000	8211000	Do you know what we used to do to test our graphics capabilities? We used to use the Final Fantasy XI graphics test.
8211000	8212000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
8213000	8214000	And that was pretty cute and it was a neat way of...
8215000	8215000	
8216000	8216000	
8217000	8217000	
8218000	8224000	We used to use that to test if we could handle certain games because basically if we could handle Final Fantasy XI we could handle anything else that came out around the same time.
8225000	8228000	Yeah, I would show you the frame rate once it ran the whole thing, like how many frames were processed.
8229000	8231000	But now my graphics card will seriously handle anything.
8232000	8232000	
8233000	8234000	So I haven't had a reason to check.
8235000	8236000	I should run the Final Fantasy XI benchmark just for lolz.
8237000	8239000	I bet it would be gorgeous with my current graphics card.
8239000	8240000	Let's not go down this path again.
8241000	8242000	There's only so much you can do with that thing, trust me.
8243000	8245000	I kind of am nostalgic now.
8246000	8247000	14 beta starting.
8248000	8251000	I don't need another game, I'm actually kind of considering dropping lolz.
8252000	8254000	I'll just wait for it to go free to play, I'm talking about 13 of course.
8255000	8256000	You mean 11?
8257000	8258000	Moving on.
8259000	8260000	Hey, hey, O-L-R.
8261000	8262000	Hey, hey.
8263000	8264000	Hey, hey, hey.
8264000	8265000	Hey, good lord.
8266000	8268000	First off, allow me to elaborate on my Twitter post from last week.
8269000	8271000	I think it's fantastic, this is RawStillUT by the way.
8272000	8276000	I think it's fantastic to see people giving deep silver shit over the Dead Island Riptide statue fiasco.
8277000	8278000	Oh, that thing.
8279000	8280000	Yeah, I have no idea what he's talking about, but okay.
8281000	8285000	Remember the horrible bust that was the woman all chopped up that they were selling us?
8286000	8287000	Oh yeah, that.
8288000	8291000	However, it's disheartening to see that in every comment section and seemingly every YouTube video,
8291000	8298000	gamers are giving shit to people who speak out against the promotion, either brushing it aside as no big deal or making sexist remarks themselves.
8299000	8302000	You know the ESA loves to talk a great game about how many women play video games,
8303000	8306000	but given how uniform the audience reaction tends to be when things like this come up,
8307000	8314000	I wonder if that stat is being buttressed by Facebook and mobile and the market for full featured games is still mostly male.
8314000	8322000	Is there really any hope for the gaming industry to make the moves necessary to bring women into the AAA game market?
8323000	8327000	And more importantly, will the traditional gaming market continue to greet women with come ons and sexist garbage?
8328000	8331000	Wait, people say stupid shit on the internet when they can hide behind their monitor?
8332000	8333000	No.
8334000	8335000	Get out!
8336000	8342000	YouTube commenting is not like a, like Google is not trying to change the whole YouTube commenting thing to clear out the cesspool a little bit.
8342000	8346000	Every time you log into YouTube, don't you want to use your real name?
8347000	8348000	No.
8349000	8350000	Don't you want to change everything to your real name? Why aren't you using your real name?
8351000	8352000	Like literally, Google asked me today, why aren't you using your real name?
8353000	8358000	It's like, fuck off. I don't want to use my real name and I'm not the problem because I don't comment on YouTubes.
8359000	8361000	I comment on YouTube, but only on CookieMyDog.
8362000	8365000	Oh my god, Yahoo needs to do that too. Yahoo comments? Oh my god.
8366000	8367000	Oh my god.
8367000	8380000	Well, um, go back to the comment. Yeah, well, if you, I don't think it really would matter how much of the market is female gaming because you still have most of the decisions being made by men.
8381000	8388000	I hate to say it, you know. It goes into more of a, I would say, socio-political realm than just who's playing the games.
8389000	8395000	I mean, and yeah, I think it is actually still predominantly guys, but you have a much larger female gaming base now.
8395000	8405000	But it's, and it's really hard to say because, again, like you were talking about, there's that anonymity, you know, that you can say it and get away with it.
8406000	8413000	But, you know, what if that was your mom you were gaming against and you, you know, were saying something?
8414000	8418000	What if it was another fucking human being with feelings and, you know, thoughts and so forth?
8418000	8426000	Like, and the vile things people say on YouTube about like these teenage girls that do their vlogs and they're just being dumb teenage girls.
8427000	8434000	We were all a dumb teenage girl at one point. Let's be real, right? And, you know, people are going like, you should just kill yourself.
8435000	8440000	And there's several people who have. Like, really? Really?
8440000	8450000	Also in a psychological point of view, you know, when you deal with people that young, well, basically you're dealing with people whose brains aren't going to be fully developed until they're 25.
8451000	8452000	And that's not a slight. That is just a reality.
8453000	8457000	That's fact. If you don't believe me, look at National Geographic. They wrote a whole article on it.
8458000	8466000	But anyway, you know, you're dealing with people who are not fully developed. It's basically, you know, that level of suggestibility.
8466000	8473000	They don't have a way of filtering anything out. It's all what's in front of you with no long term consequence to that's really pressing.
8474000	8489000	So, you know, but if you also think of it that way, your gamer base, if you were thinking as mostly teenage and, you know, that male demographic between teenage to 27, you're also dealing with a huge number of people whose brains are not fully developed.
8490000	8493000	End of story. Brains are not fully developed. Those neural pathways are not all there.
8493000	8502000	And so, you know, as an adult, yeah, I can sit and tell myself, okay, well, they're not using all of their potential. They have no faculties yet.
8503000	8509000	You know, you can stop and tell yourself, yeah, these people are just trolls. They don't know any better, you know, or maybe they don't care.
8510000	8511000	But they need to get the shit scared out of them.
8512000	8521000	But they do. See, that's the thing. What I, this is what I would like to see is that if you have a warning button that instantly turns on whatever camera is connected so you can see their face.
8521000	8542000	That's it, you know, or the cameras turning on randomly. That's big brother talk. That's not, I know, but I mean, there, there should be, when you're dealing with the type of brain activity that deals only with immediacy and not long term consequence, you need to make an immediate consequence.
8542000	8557000	Not well, I mean, not to go like on a tangent, but you got those people that were on Twitter and these stupid kids that when Obama got reelected, there are all these people making tweets that were like, I can't believe that and word got reelected and saying just, just idiotic shit on their Twitter.
8558000	8568000	Right. And so what happens, these websites go out and just basically doc some like, you know, it's this guy that goes to this high school and he's on this scholarship of the college and these kids look at anonymous.
8569000	8585000	These kids are losing their scholarships over it. And I'm not saying like maybe they shouldn't, but it's kind of like they're dumb ass kids and the dumb ass kids don't need to have their lives ruined necessarily, but they need that reality check and the parents could really use the snack on the head too.
8586000	8588000	Because they didn't just learn it watching the TVs.
8589000	8606000	Well, honestly, though, that's a reflection of the caliber of person that these schools are getting. And a school has a reputation to maintain too. If it's going to come out, you know, that they're admitting somebody with that particular view set to their school and their school does not share that view set, they have the right to deny them.
8607000	8615000	R.D.G. Singe in the chat saying, I know a few adults whose lobes never fully developed. Rasteel UT pointing out it's not all kids either. Ain't that the truth?
8616000	8627000	That's true. You know, we're talking a lot about teenagers and so forth. But yeah, if a 30 year old guy sitting there trolling Twitter with all this stuff, then you know what? It's a little harder to feel sorry for somebody whose brain is fully developed and should know better.
8627000	8645000	Yeah. Well, I mean, you're also dealing with the fact that we are a society of instant gratification. We're especially now with the anonymity, the nastiest, the nastiest side of people are becoming public. And you know what? If they're going to be, you know, think that their anonymity can hide them, let them be exposed. I have zero problem with that. Let their boss find out.
8646000	8654000	You know, that's why I don't put anything on the Internet that I would not tell, you know, an employer. I mean, there's certain things I wouldn't tell an employer.
8655000	8669000	I don't know, because I say things on this show I wouldn't necessarily want like co-workers to hear. It's not that I'm like embarrassed about it or anything, but it's just kind of like, you know, I have my professional side, then I have my side where I let it all hang out. You know, it's kind of like it's not okay for those worlds to cross.
8669000	8687000	Everybody has that. But I mean, in the end, you want to think about how you're reflecting on yourself. You know, I try. Yeah, I get a little bit bitchier than normal on the show because it's sometimes funny. But at the same time, this is me. This is who I am. I try not to portray myself in any other way than the person that I am.
8687000	8700000	And so on the same token, that's all we can ever consider these people that we're interacting with through a video game. This is who this person is. Oh, my God. Who talks like this? I don't want to be around this person anymore. How do they have friends?
8701000	8707000	TechNist in our chat room, and I think we'll move on after this comment. I think people forget that there is no such thing as true anonymity on the Internet.
8708000	8709000	No, it's not. Let's move on.
8710000	8721000	There's the rest of the email. I know logically that I shouldn't be basing an entire group of people on the Internet, but that's just exhausting when it's all you see from gamers 90% of the time. Regards, rawstealut.
8722000	8723000	Gamershateeverything.com.
8724000	8730000	OK. We also have a two part to email question from Robert M.
8731000	8741000	Dark soccer on the actual Twilight Zone table. Do you have the problem of the ball exiting the slot machine, ricocheting directly off the outside of the right town square bumper and draining immediately down the middle?
8742000	8747000	I must need to manage my tilting better. And then dark soccer. Do you have problems with your balls? Let me finish.
8747000	8756000	Just to clarify, of course the ball doesn't ricochet directly from the slot machine into the bumper. It is hit by the right flipper first, then hits the bumper and drains. Timing on the flipper is a major factor as well.
8757000	8764000	To be perfectly honest, I haven't actually touched my Twilight Zone machine except to take a picture of my cat on it in probably six months, so I probably can't answer that question.
8765000	8770000	Although I can say that there are lots of cheap maneuvers, but keep in mind these were meant to make money.
8771000	8780000	Putting in natural drains, magnets, that's going to happen. But wait until you have the Powerball, because then sometimes you don't have to worry about the magnets when you're running with Powerball.
8781000	8786000	You know, I had a fun time playing a Twilight Zone that was all Powerballs. That was pretty great.
8787000	8790000	Nice. The ceramic balls that don't, you know, because of the magnets.
8791000	8793000	The end. That's it for mailbags? That's it.
8793000	8800000	Alright, mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. If you want to email us in the future, again one more time, that's mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. Please do email us.
8801000	8805000	We get a lot of lovely emails and we would love a few more. Mailbag at orangelauntrady.com.
8806000	8808000	So I have to actually read something from Becky.
8809000	8810000	Sure. That Julian said. Go for it.
8811000	8813000	Okay, so she's playing the first Mass Effect again.
8814000	8816000	And Julian is her six year old? Five year old.
8817000	8819000	He's going to be six though in a couple months. Close enough. Right after my birthday.
8820000	8821000	I was close. I rounded. Yeah.
8821000	8824000	It's the line from Joker. I want to be there when you make that son of a bitch pay.
8825000	8827000	And Julian says, you're not going to make him pay. You're going to make him die.
8830000	8831000	So I felt that needed to be shared.
8833000	8839000	Alright. Let's move on with a few more news stories before we get to. Oh, I'm sorry. We got FUs of the Week to do.
8840000	8844000	I almost overlooked the FUs of the Week. FU to myself for damn near overlooking the FUs of the Week.
8845000	8849000	It's the part of the show every week where we get angsty. Why? I don't know. Cause.
8851000	8864000	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here. This is fucked up.
8865000	8871000	First off, FU to people who don't understand what following distance is.
8872000	8875000	And try to get all of the end years and then change lanes into your following space.
8875000	8880000	In California, we have what's called the three second rule. When you pick a landmark, when the car in front of you.
8881000	8886000	When the tail of your car passes it, you count three seconds until you hit that same part with the front of your car.
8887000	8890000	And that's following distance. Well, in Alabama, it's two seconds, whatever.
8893000	8896000	I can say it. I can say Alabama is backwards. I'm from there. I escaped.
8897000	8901000	Also FU to there being ads now on the AIM app on my iPad.
8902000	8909000	And FU to the winners slash losers of Canada's Worst Driver.
8910000	8914000	Because they were both really awful and I mean these people are hazards on the road. They're gonna kill people.
8915000	8921000	I mean, I'm literally, they are that stupid. If you are a bad driver. If everyone around you tells you you're a bad driver.
8922000	8926000	And no amount of practice is helping you, stop fucking driving. End of story.
8927000	8930000	That goes to everybody in the world who's a bad driver. Me, I'm a great driver.
8931000	8939000	And I have a thank you to my husband who greeted me the other night with a three terabyte hard drive. Yeah.
8940000	8941000	You're spoiled.
8942000	8943000	No, I love him.
8944000	8945000	Loki?
8946000	8954000	FU to the lingering part of the stomach bug here that I have, which is making me feel extremely bloated. Like I'm full of just pizza.
8955000	8959000	No, I didn't even have that much pizza. I only had like two slices of pizza.
8960000	8966000	Yeah, so basically, I mean, it's gonna obviously cause me to lose weight, I guess, which is good, but it's still very uncomfortable.
8967000	8970000	You know, it's all water while you're sick. Once you start eating, you'll retain again.
8972000	8973000	Is that it?
8974000	8975000	Yeah, that's it.
8976000	8982000	I want to make sure I'm super vague in how I put this in response to some things I've seen on Twitter.
8983000	8998000	I just want to say an FU to somebody who tries to call out someone else's faults on things that happened in the past when that person themselves have lots of faults in their past that they have not apologized for and maybe ought to.
8999000	9000000	So, just saying.
9002000	9003000	That's all I got to say about that.
9004000	9006000	Doesn't that go back to the cardinal rule of everything?
9007000	9008000	Don't be a dick.
9009000	9010000	But some people don't know how.
9010000	9018000	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about a few more news stories before we get to Twitter and Skype line.
9019000	9024000	See, we don't need those Wii U's, you know, cause we've got other things to keep us occupied.
9025000	9032000	I know you think you guys are all fancy with your Miiverse channels and stuff like that, but hey, there's Xboxverse in Japan.
9032000	9037000	And Xboxverse, I guess it's a Hakuverse.
9038000	9048000	And apparently, like all things on the internet that are somewhat unregulated, it is full of penises.
9049000	9051000	Penis art, penis art, penis art.
9052000	9053000	TTP.
9054000	9056000	That's a lot of cock on your desktop there.
9057000	9058000	Yeah.
9059000	9060000	Oh look, Chris cock.
9060000	9061000	That's...
9062000	9063000	Yes.
9064000	9066000	So, interesting.
9067000	9070000	But hey, it's out there, so that's kind of neat, I guess.
9071000	9074000	I don't know if they've got exactly the website here.
9075000	9083000	Let's see, it's at xbox.verse.jp is where you can check it out.
9084000	9086000	And I'm not sure how you can actually go about posting on there and stuff.
9086000	9093000	But it's interesting, there's a sweaty picture of Gabe Newall, looks like, on my desktop now.
9094000	9096000	I'm not really sure what that's from.
9097000	9098000	But, cool.
9099000	9101000	I had to look, it was actually pretty amusing.
9102000	9105000	So, yeah, xbox.verse.jp.
9108000	9113000	There was that whole little story about the particular game too that was causing excessive...
9114000	9115000	Tintin, yeah.
9117000	9120000	I'm just surprised there's that big of a community around an Xbox in Japan.
9121000	9127000	The way you hear things online, you would think that there was no fans of Xbox in Japan whatsoever.
9128000	9131000	But I guess it's not doing as terrible as you might think.
9132000	9137000	Well, speaking of penis, I mean, you know, why not another story that has to do with this?
9138000	9145000	Custom Made 3D is an upcoming erotic game that's coming out with a very special attachment.
9146000	9147000	It's called...
9148000	9149000	Sorry.
9150000	9153000	It's called The Juicy Air. Like, is this trolling? Like, is this story for real?
9154000	9155000	Like, is this for real or am I being trolling?
9156000	9157000	I think it's for real, they have an actual website.
9158000	9159000	Oh my god, alright.
9160000	9161000	Let's go to the website.
9162000	9163000	It's a cup.
9164000	9171000	It is a wireless masturbation toy that reacts in real time to your stroke speed and depth, making this motion control... you know what?
9171000	9175000	So just pull sausage out of the fridge and go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9176000	9180000	In-game characters react accordingly too with different characters reacting differently.
9181000	9185000	This peripheral has an analog stick and an action button as well as a right and left click.
9186000	9188000	Suddenly the term clicking your mouse has a whole new meaning.
9191000	9194000	You don't even have to take your hands off your wiener while you're playing.
9195000	9196000	There you go.
9197000	9202000	This story has been met with the response of... in chatroom.
9203000	9208000	rdgsinge in our chatroom says, are there any special plans for episode 500?
9209000	9210000	On a cup.
9211000	9212000	Well, after this story there are now.
9213000	9214000	I'll be staying home.
9219000	9222000	That's our full video review of SMA3D.
9223000	9224000	I wonder if there's gonna be one of them.
9224000	9226000	I wonder if there's gonna be one of those on...
9227000	9229000	Res Trans Vibrator 2.0.
9230000	9231000	Oh, God. All right.
9232000	9233000	What?
9234000	9235000	Game Guru, talk about playing with your Wii.
9236000	9238000	Yes, there's pictures of it. Look it up yourself.
9239000	9242000	Wii jokes are seven years old. What the hell? All right, that's it.
9243000	9245000	Just look up what an Ona cup is and you'll see what it looks like.
9246000	9250000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Surely you want to follow that story on our Skype line.
9251000	9252000	1-877-

9260000	9264000	rostielut in chat says, as long as we don't have to see the cup being used.
9265000	9266000	It could just be above the waist shots, that's all.
9270000	9274000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
9275000	9279000	And while we wait for some calls, there's always last minute stories and Twitter topics.
9281000	9282000	Any last minute stories, Logie?
9283000	9289000	No. I don't really have anything. I was looking at...
9290000	9291000	So much for that.
9292000	9295000	I was just trying to look and see. I had something, but it wasn't very important.
9296000	9299000	Oh, yeah. This is kind of just a random tangent here.
9300000	9304000	Let me ask you, the phone's blowing up, so write down your thought and we'll come back to it later because I want to get to the phone calls.
9305000	9306000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9307000	9309000	Oh my God. It is a blast from the past. Raven's Dolphin.
9309000	9312000	Holy fucking shit. It's Raven's Dolphin. Oh my God.
9313000	9314000	I live.
9315000	9318000	You live. Beware. I live. What a blast from the past. How are you?
9319000	9320000	Wise from your grave.
9321000	9324000	I have risen from my grave. I escaped from the mental institution to call you guys.
9325000	9326000	Where the hell have you been?
9327000	9328000	I've been around.
9329000	9332000	Are you still doing your tech and games thing that just blew up?
9333000	9335000	I am. And guess what? We're celebrating six years this month.
9335000	9339000	It actually became very successful and I want to thank you guys for giving me inspiration.
9340000	9345000	No, I know. It cracked me up because I would see that all around the internet, the tech and games thing, and I'm like, wow, that shit really blew up, didn't it?
9346000	9347000	I'm like, good for him. Good for you. Good for you.
9348000	9352000	Yeah, it worked out very well. We went to Comic Con. We went to Otacon. We did some things.
9353000	9354000	Did you get blessed by the E3 Pope yet?
9355000	9357000	No, we did not, but I'm not worried.
9358000	9359000	Soon. You'll get there, buddy. You'll get there.
9359000	9365000	It's happening. It's happening. But I came to call you not to talk about me, God. It's you guys.
9366000	9369000	And you guys were talking about the Pokemon thing about gotta catch them all?
9370000	9370000	
9371000	9375000	And, you know, the Wii U has built-in RFID chips, so they could really easily do it.
9376000	9380000	Yes, they could. Weren't they at one point you were supposed to be able to tap your credit card on that thing?
9381000	9388000	Yeah. See, that's the thing. That was one of the stories that we didn't talk about. They're working on that still. It's not even coming out until fall.
9389000	9391000	It's like, yeah, way to implement all your technology.
9392000	9398000	Yeah, but remember way back when I first talked about the Wii U and how it's like the Winchester Mystery House where you'll find all these doors that go nowhere and shit that's not finished built yet?
9399000	9402000	That's the Wii U. So that part is currently still under construction.
9403000	9404000	We're sort of stuck in the seance room.
9405000	9408000	Sort of. And Ubisoft just locked another door. But anyway.
9409000	9411000	Sure did. Sure did.
9412000	9413000	Yeah, go ahead.
9414000	9417000	I just have one more thing. I'm going to keep this short. It's about the Rayman legend thing.
9417000	9427000	For me, it was bad PR from Ubisoft. They should have just said it was coming out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox. They should have just said, oh, it's an exclusive and then yanked the thing out.
9428000	9434000	But I want to say I understand why they did it. But I felt like they should have played that way better than they did.
9435000	9437000	Are you a Wii U owner by chance?
9438000	9446000	I am a Wii U owner. I own a PlayStation. I own everything. I'm on Steam now. I bought Mass Effect, so I will be playing it. If I want to be listening to this shit, I better be playing it.
9447000	9451000	I feel like we've raised you well. I know you were a lot younger when you first started listening to OLR.
9452000	9453000	I'm so proud. You are making us proud.
9454000	9456000	Wait, are you playing Mass Effect on PC?
9457000	9465000	I only got one and two. I bought it during the Steam sale, so I didn't play a lot of it yet. I will play it. Dark Soccer. Don't kill me. I have it. I own it. I'll buy it.
9466000	9468000	Let me know when you get to three so we can play multiplayer together.
9469000	9473000	You're doing better than Bobby Black Wolf in that regard. That's good enough.
9474000	9481000	What was I going to say? I don't know. I don't know what else to say. Oh, yes. You're a Wii U owner. What do you think of the Wii U? How are you feeling about your purchase?
9482000	9489000	No, I have to say my mom bought it and I like the thing itself. Me, I think my favorite feature is it's a remote.
9490000	9494000	You know what? That TV thing, did you check it out during the Super Bowl?
9495000	9502000	I did. I checked it out when the Broncos were playing and when they scored that touchdown and then they lost. I'm done with this.
9503000	9510000	I was waiting for the Beyonce concert last weekend while I was sick and I had the TV thing going on and I was like, oh, these guys are throwing a football around before the Beyonce concert.
9511000	9524000	I'll check this out. It was actually kind of fun to look at the feedback people were giving on me. A lot of it was just dumb internet shit, but it was kind of neat to have that right in front of me as I'm watching this game on the TV.
9525000	9532000	Which, believe it or not, there were some pretty lullsy things that happened in the game that even I was like, wow, the 49ers are getting their ass kicked in the first half of this game.
9533000	9537000	I kept hearing all of the men not use their inside voice while I was in the back room playing Mass Effect.
9538000	9549000	One of my favorites was when the blackout happened. I love the memes with the WWE with Undertaker and they're creating Beyonce as She-Hulk. I'm like, okay, that's funny.
9550000	9558000	Beyonce as She-Hulk was great. But my favorite meme that's come out of the whole thing is Tard, Tardar Sauce, the Grumpy Cat.
9559000	9559000	
9560000	9562000	Saying blackout and then Tardar Sauce holding the plug.
9563000	9570000	Or the Bane references were all over Twitter, of course, and that happened. But my favorite gif I saw was the one where all the lights go out.
9571000	9578000	To bring this call full circle, Ravenstaufen, when all the lights go out and then you see the stadium above and it goes out and then Team Rocket shows up, that cracked me up.
9579000	9579000	
9580000	9580000	
9581000	9588000	I'm sorry. That was my favorite part of the whole Super Bowl. It's like people staring at the screen, what are we doing? And then the beats after it were like, thank you, internet. This is why you're awesome.
9588000	9595000	Was this Beyonce's fault? Was Beyonce's performance so fierce that she blew the fucking power? Like, that was my favorite. That's my favorite.
9596000	9600000	That was good, too. And I saw her at the inauguration. She didn't blow on anyone.
9601000	9605000	Well, Ravenstaufen, please, pimp your shit. It's six years, you've earned it.
9605000	9621000	Six years thanks to you guys. The website's called techandgames.com. It lives quite well with 833 fans on Facebook. It doesn't matter. That's someone else's stuff. I'm not like, ugh. I didn't create that.
9622000	9624000	But you've earned each and every one of them, so you go, boy.
9625000	9627000	Yeah, thank you, Rob, for the time and I know you have other calls.
9628000	9629000	Anytime. Take care, buddy. Good to hear from you.
9630000	9630000	
9631000	9631000	
9631000	9640000	Hi. 1877 Game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundry. Sorry, Loki. I didn't mean to cut you off earlier. When I saw that one popping up, I was like, blast from the past. Holla.
9641000	9642000	I don't even remember what I was talking about, though.
9643000	9655000	Isn't that how it goes? Let's see. Tigerclaw giving us a GIF here in the chat room, and I just want to make sure. Oh, God damn it. This is great live radio.
9655000	9662000	I just want to make sure this is the right one, because if it is, I insist that Rama, our Tumblr administrator. What is the Tumblr? Is it OrangeLaundryRadio?
9663000	9664000	OrangeLaundryRadio.tumblr.com.
9665000	9668000	I insist that this go on the OrangeLaundryRadio Tumblr. Yes, this is it. Perfect.
9669000	9673000	Please repost that. Perfect. Yes, I insist that that be reposted.
9674000	9683000	Alright. 1877 Game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundryRadio. If you want to give us a call, let's go to the phones and take another call.
9683000	9685000	Hi, you're on OrangeLaundryRadio. Who's this?
9686000	9687000	Hi, this is Raginator.
9688000	9692000	Hey, Raginator in video. I see you. Peek-a-roo. What's up?
9693000	9698000	Well, I would have talked about this last week if there was a show last week.
9699000	9701000	Yeah, rub it in. I was sick. Rub it in.
9701000	9713000	Well, I wasn't trying to rub anything in, but since you kind of briefly talked about the topic in today's show, I have a somewhat related question.
9714000	9721000	Now, with all this talk about the Xbox 720, assuming that's what the final name is going to be called, and...
9722000	9724000	The Lube is the name of the week. The Xbox Lube.
9725000	9736000	Or the PlayStation 4. That kind of begs the question, at this point, do we really need a new system from either Microsoft or the PlayStation 4?
9737000	9742000	I mean, think about it. PlayStation 3 is, at this point, really hitting stride.
9743000	9750000	And, from my viewpoint, Microsoft still has a lot of life left with the 360.
9751000	9758000	I mean, I can't see them really improving graphics all that much with the next systems.
9759000	9770000	And there's a lot of great games coming out. The only thing I can possibly see is doing like a 4K resolution or 8K, but...
9771000	9777000	But nobody's... You can't... Look at how well that went for 3D on the PlayStation 3. Even that really hasn't cracked yet.
9778000	9786000	I think we can all assume PlayStation 4 is going to do this 4K super high HD thing, because Sony makes TVs, and they want to sell a few of those, too.
9787000	9797000	But I want to go back to the question you were really asking, and ask the panel here. I think that's a great question, because we've kind of answered this before a little bit, but not since some of this news came up.
9798000	9804000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox Lube. Do we really need it? They're coming this year. Is it necessary? Does the industry need it?
9805000	9811000	Loki, you sell games for a living. What do you think? Do they need it? Are these systems needed right now?
9811000	9818000	No, because I don't think Nintendo... See, I'm surprised that they're not waiting to put these systems out, because the Wii U...
9819000	9827000	It's just not doing that well right now. It's not like stealing the thunder from them as much as like the Wii kind of did when that first came out, and everyone was trying to get their hands on it.
9828000	9838000	But at the same time, I think the sales for their software and hardware are kind of slowing, so they need to put something else out. Especially Sony. Sony, all their stuff is kind of slowing down right now, so they need to...
9838000	9841000	But they can't support the systems they're putting out, Vita.
9842000	9848000	Well, I don't know what they're trying. The Vita price point's too high, and there's not any games coming out.
9849000	9858000	I'm kind of... Part of the reason I said, and I said this at the end of last year when making predictions for this year, and I originally predicted we wouldn't have the PlayStation 4, and my reason essentially was, we don't need one.
9859000	9867000	And Sony has the Vita to work on still, and so forth. So actually, my opinion really hasn't changed, Raginator. I don't think we need PlayStation 4.
9868000	9870000	I'll go back to something I sort of touched on.
9871000	9879000	Hold on a sec, Raginator, because Dark Soccer wants to jump in, too. Oh, great, his call bugged out anyway. I swear to God I didn't click a button, but Dark Soccer, your thought while we reconnect.
9880000	9892000	Well, I don't think that it's necessary at all. Not yet, anyway. I think that they should be pushing any type of release until far later. We don't need it. They've got a system that...
9893000	9894000	I understand the investor pressure, though.
9894000	9903000	Yeah. But still, you know, I think that they need to keep working on strengthening what they have using the existing technology, and then bringing out something really mind-blowing.
9904000	9907000	Raginator, go ahead and get your thought out now that the call's back, and then we can move on.
9908000	9928000	Sure. Yeah, I was going to say, you know, at least with the higher resolution TVs out there, and if possible, you know, using PS4 and 720 to go work with those, the trouble is the adoption rate with the higher resolution TVs is pretty low.
9928000	9942000	And from my perspective, the one problem with the adoption of those higher resolution TVs is that there's not really a whole lot of content, if any, for those higher resolution TVs.
9942000	9971000	Now, if Rock, SKD, and cable companies were to really go balls to the wall and support that stuff, plus now you have higher resolution videos, like, you know, whatever next-gen Blu-ray comes out or whatever, if that supports the higher resolution, plus the gains, then I can see something new coming out, or something that we can't even think of right off the bat.
9972000	9977000	That next system could potentially do that current systems can't do.
9977000	9984000	That's, you know what, that's a good point, because high definition in itself took a long time for us to really adopt. High definition...
9984000	9990000	It's still not a big adoption rate, because look at Blu-ray. Blu-ray is still not... People aren't replacing their DVD collections with Blu-ray.
9990000	9996000	Yeah, but even at least high-def TVs right now are pretty much, like, all you can buy. Like, you can't even really buy standard def... Well, you can't secondhand, of course.
9997000	10002000	But you can't even really, like, walk into a Best Buy and find a standard def TV, you know, maybe way in the back or something.
10002000	10011000	I mean, it's all about HDTV, at least now that's finally catching on where it's really the mainstream, but that took, like, ten years to get there, a very long time.
10011000	10017000	But in the middle of that was the 360 and the PlayStation 3, which was, like, our first HD gaming.
10017000	10023000	So maybe the 4K thing is a preemptive strike, but I don't know, it could be way too early.
10023000	10027000	Anyway, RageNator, gotta let you go to get more calls, but thank you so much for the call, buddy.
10027000	10028000	Sure, no problem.
10028000	10030000	Take care, and thanks for the video.
10030000	10036000	One 877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10036000	10045000	RasteelUT saying, VHS was around nearly ten years after DVD. That's true, you have the overlap that happens, too.
10045000	10048000	Yeah, but Atrex didn't totally last that many years.
10048000	10062000	I also consider that, I mean, these older generation systems could probably push better graphics, because the original Xbox and even the PlayStation 2, some games did output to HD, like 720p and 1080i.
10062000	10068000	You know, assuming the games support it. Not all of them, but some of them did.
10069000	10076000	Alright, while we wait for another call, maybe possibly, let's go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.
10076000	10083000	Actually, I'm gonna bring it up on the desktop here. I usually use my iPad for it, but I left that in the other room like a genius.
10083000	10088000	So I'll pull that up here. I know at least there was a couple things from Tiger Claw in there.
10088000	10091000	Of course, it would help if I sign in as the right account.
10091000	10093000	Help, someone buy me time.
10093000	10098000	I'm broke, so I won't have, no. Words.
10098000	10103000	Rob is actually signing into Twitter right now, everybody. I am filling time so that we do not have to-
10103000	10106000	Except I can't remember the password to the stinking Twitter account, because when you manage-
10106000	10107000	Burrito!
10107000	10111000	When you manage for Twitter, the password is not burrito. When you manage for Twitter accounts-
10111000	10115000	Don't tell them that. I'd love to see how many people try to log in with the wrong word.
10115000	10116000	That's true, huh?
10116000	10119000	Log him out of his account because, you know, Twitter hacks and-
10119000	10120000	Nah.
10120000	10128000	Alright, I see a bunch of stories here from Tiger Claw, but first, let me do a tweet from YYR who is surfing around the PlayStation Network and said,
10128000	10136000	Hey, this is on sale right now on PSN. It's the Namco Museum. That's right, I saw that for sale in the PlayStation 3 store.
10136000	10142000	Why is this important? Namco Museum is the PlayStation 3 game where we have a cameo. Remember this cameo?
10142000	10143000	Yes, it is.
10143000	10149000	We're in the opening. There's a little screen that talks about the Namco Museum and the Network features.
10149000	10154000	And look very closely at the high scoreboard, and you'll see some familiar names.
10154000	10159000	And a big thank you to the OLR fans, or fan, who put us in a game.
10159000	10160000	Much thanks.
10160000	10166000	It doesn't get any better than that, right? Like, I can quit now. I made it in a video game.
10166000	10167000	I can die.
10167000	10168000	I can die now.
10168000	10169000	It's like butter.
10169000	10172000	And if you haven't checked it out, you have bungee fair tossing.
10172000	10178000	Yes, especially with this unfortunate news about XNA this week where even though Microsoft hasn't updated it in three years,
10178000	10186000	they basically said they're not going to. Really unfortunate that indie games are probably not going to be a thing on the Xbox lube.
10186000	10191000	I don't know, we're just left to hypothesize. Maybe they've got something newer, bigger, better coming out, I hope.
10191000	10197000	But yes, support the indie games. Because it's not like indie games are cooked up overnight.
10197000	10202000	A lot of these guys started it a long time ago before they made these announcements about XNA.
10202000	10208000	So, support indie games and start with bungee fair tossing. That's a good one to pick.
10208000	10212000	A bunch of tweets from Tigerclaw. I'll read a couple of them here.
10212000	10216000	This one's a My Little Pony story, but it's one-
10216000	10217000	But no one cares, Skip.
10217000	10223000	No, no, no. It's worth reading. Because they were actually making a fighting game, My Little Pony, MLP fighting is magic.
10223000	10231000	Well, surprise, surprise. A cease and desist from Hasbro's legal representatives, and this was posted to their site at main6.com,
10231000	10240000	asking them to stop the distribution of any materials that My Little Pony characters, names, locations, or elements from the show,
10240000	10242000	including YouTube, Twitch, and so forth.
10242000	10250000	They attempted to negotiate Hasbro for the continued use of the property for their voluntary project, but they didn't get an answer.
10250000	10252000	Does this really surprise anybody?
10252000	10260000	If you're going to make a fan game like that or something, just do it on the down low, release it, then do a cease and desist, it's on the internet, what are you going to do?
10260000	10265000	Don't hype it up. I mean, if you're trying to recruit people, I guess that's one thing, but try to do it on the down low,
10265000	10273000	because the more you hype it up, the more visibility it's going to get, and then the company has an obligation to protect their trademarks and so forth,
10273000	10282000	to put the C&D out there. So, and I don't think fighting ponies was what they wanted to have happen.
10282000	10288000	Obi-Wan Jabroni on OLR says, hey, OLR, give me a shout out. It's fucking 5 a.m. here.
10288000	10295000	Where are you where it's 5 a.m.? Is that the UK? Are you maybe in the military? That could be the mid-east, I don't know.
10295000	10299000	But shout out to you for it being pretty late.
10299000	10304000	I could do a shout, but then Rob's landlord would get complaints from the neighbors, so.
10304000	10309000	You can go listen to this week's Hoard House and get a scream and shout, that's all I'm going to say.
10309000	10313000	Let's go to one more call here on Skype. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10313000	10314000	Hey, this is Acdeft.
10314000	10319000	It's like I say My Little Pony and then all of a sudden, look who's on the line. What's up, Acdeft?
10319000	10326000	Well, Black Wolf's going to hate me for this, but yeah, I want to talk about the fighting this magic game.
10326000	10330000	I'm only letting you do it because it's relevant to gaming talk right now.
10330000	10337000	This thing getting pulled was good news for you guys because it gives you an excuse to talk about it and be relevant.
10337000	10339000	So go for it while you can.
10339000	10353000	Yeah, well. Oh, Black Wolf. Anyways, yeah, I'm pretty, well, sad that it got the cease and desist letter.
10353000	10359000	Though, yeah, it was eventually going to happen because it got a lot of media attention.
10359000	10370000	An article went up on GameSpot and it also was competing to be the eighth game featured on the EVO tournament this year.
10370000	10381000	And like I said, it caught a lot of attention and it was almost finished.
10381000	10386000	They were pretty much on the final stage of development.
10386000	10388000	Well, that means it's going to leak to the Internet anyway.
10388000	10393000	And they'll just say, oh, our computer, our computer was hacked and the finished version leaked to the Internet.
10393000	10397000	Like that'll happen. Didn't that happen to the Chrono Trigger thing that Square Enix shut down?
10397000	10399000	Most positive it did.
10399000	10401000	There was music from that came out.
10401000	10403000	Yeah. Once it hits the Internet, it's never coming off.
10403000	10408000	If they were that close to finishing it, it'll leak in its like beta form or something.
10408000	10414000	You know, they'll find a way to do it where they will be able to wash their hands of any legal ramifications.
10414000	10421000	But, I mean, surely you can see with all this attention, wasn't it getting to be a little too big for something that they really...
10421000	10426000	I mean, if they didn't have Hasbro's sign off on it, is this really not surprising?
10426000	10431000	No, it isn't. Like I said, it was eventually going to happen.
10431000	10444000	Though most of us that were expecting the game to be released, we're actually looking forward to playing it because it was already leaked before.
10444000	10450000	So it's already out on the Internet. You can get it on the Pirate Bay and other sites.
10450000	10453000	Oh, well then shit. You can't shut that down.
10453000	10461000	It was a pretty early build of it, so it's somewhat buggy and it isn't complete.
10461000	10466000	But, yeah, even then it looked like a pretty good game.
10466000	10471000	It was like a regular game, even. A good fighting game.
10471000	10476000	And it was featured on EVO on their Indie Showcase last year.
10476000	10483000	Yeah, like I said, many people, even in the fighting community, were expecting a lot of it.
10483000	10489000	I just want to make sure. It was still a good fighting game without the marijuana, right?
10489000	10491000	I don't do drugs, so yeah.
10491000	10494000	Okay, alright. Good answer. Very good answer.
10494000	10496000	Winners don't do drugs.
10496000	10500000	Alright, yes, that's right. Winners don't do drugs. And that is the real message here.
10500000	10505000	Alright, I gotta let you go before Black Wolf pulls the plug on the show, so take care, buddy.
10505000	10507000	You too. Thanks. Bye.
10509000	10512000	Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10512000	10515000	I think My Little Pony Call will do that.
10515000	10517000	Just fucking with you guys.
10517000	10520000	Let's do one more tweet, because Tigerclad said a bunch of stories.
10520000	10523000	I want to do at least one more of these here.
10523000	10525000	Ooh, we'll do this one. It's a pinball story.
10525000	10527000	Pinball is always relevant.
10527000	10529000	Very cool pinball, actually.
10529000	10532000	Star Wars Pinball announced by Zen Studios.
10532000	10534000	Hell yes to this.
10534000	10538000	Zen Studios is partnering with LucasArts for a Star Wars pinball.
10538000	10543000	This is awesome. Did you see this little table shot here that has like...
10543000	10545000	Oh, that's neat.
10545000	10548000	Yeah, a little Boba Fett and C-3PO. It's awesome.
10548000	10552000	What is this coming to? This is going to be Pinball FX2.
10552000	10558000	And it'll be available on Live Arcade, Windows 8, PlayStation Network, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Cross Buy.
10559000	10561000	Isn't this supposed to be on Wii U at some point, too?
10561000	10564000	I think so. That's awesome.
10564000	10567000	Congrats to Zen Studios. That's a hell of a partnership to land there.
10567000	10569000	Good job, you guys.
10569000	10573000	All right. That's going to do it for our Twitter topics tonight.
10573000	10575000	Again, twitter.com... Excuse me.
10575000	10578000	Yeah, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us tweets in the future.
10578000	10580000	And that does it for the Skype line tonight.
10580000	10583000	If you didn't get through and you have something you want to say, please email us.
10583000	10586000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10586000	10588000	Or tweet us for next week.
10588000	10593000	Since there was no last minute stories, I believe that brings us to another close of an episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10593000	10597000	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us and supporting us through another week.
10597000	10599000	We are an independently produced show.
10599000	10602000	Literally done out of somebody's dining room.
10602000	10605000	Where we don't dine. We have radio stuff set up anywhere.
10605000	10607000	I dine. Sometimes.
10607000	10609000	Yeah, you bring Panda Express in there once in a while.
10609000	10611000	He brings pizza. It works out.
10611000	10614000	But anyway, all we ask... We don't ask for your money or anything like that.
10614000	10617000	All we ask... Help spread the word. Help grow our family.
10617000	10622000	Give us a nice review on whatever website you found this through. Be it iTunes or what have you.
10622000	10625000	And just tell a friend about Orange Lounge Radio.
10625000	10627000	Help us get some word of mouth out there.
10627000	10631000	And grow our community of awesome people that chat with us every Sunday night.
10631000	10634000	And interact with us throughout the week as they listen on the podcast.
10634000	10637000	And leave comments on VOG Network and so forth.
10637000	10639000	Anyhow, I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10639000	10642000	And we'll start tonight with Dark Sakura. Final thought.
10642000	10644000	My head still hurts.
10644000	10646000	My final thought is...
10646000	10651000	Why is my Balthier doll just sitting over there lying on its side like that?
10651000	10653000	He needs to be fixed promptly.
10653000	10655000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10655000	10658000	I feel way too full.
10658000	10661000	Still feeling bloaty? Sorry to hear.
10661000	10663000	Uncomfortably so.
10663000	10665000	Alright, better than how you were feeling yesterday though.
10665000	10667000	Better than Friday, yes.
10667000	10670000	That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10670000	10672000	Have a great, safe week everybody.
10672000	10674000	And we'll be back to do it all again next week, alright?
10674000	10676000	See you then. Good night.
10697000	10703000	Do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network.
10703000	10706000	But you know they were all still true.
10706000	10708000	See you next week.
10727000	10736000	Thanks for watching!
