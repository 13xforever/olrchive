Tonight, February 17, 2013, Bungie reveals details on their next game, Nintendo unveils more 3DS titles than the new Nintendo Direct, and as the first glimpse of the PlayStation 4 leaked to the internet,
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February the 17th, 2013.
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
Blarg.
Blarg, yarg, how you doing?
I'm tired, actually.
Thank you for the coffee.
I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time, and then what came out?
The cafe.
You were just saying it, you know, with an accent.
The cafe.
I love coffee.
Yeah, I love coffee, too.
I'm drinking it, and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit, because...
I went to San Francisco yesterday.
How was San Francisco?
It was gay.
What did you do in San Francisco?
I'm sure the weather was great.
What did you do in San Francisco?
The weather was fantastic.
Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.
And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara, and well, there was beer involved, and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.
I have been there.
I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.
And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone was like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?
And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japantown.
I was like, I'm not here for the con.
I'm just wearing my jacket.
Did you do a deadpan just like that?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I love the random impromptu anime convention.
DarkSakura approaches.
Quick, throw an anime convention.
Well, I saw people putting on armor in the Japan town.
Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?
Okay, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.
I saw people putting on armor.
I was like, it's not the Cherry Blossom Festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.
Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?
Sure enough, I run into somebody wearing a blue trench coat and a button-up shirt, and I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?
He's like, yeah, and there's my doctor over there.
I was like, so is there a convention going on?
He's like, oh yeah, and it sucks.
I don't even remember what the convention was called.
Where was that?
Was it at the... It was at Miyako, over at the Kabuki Hotel.
Interesting.
You know, that's where they're going to be having the Gamer Expo, but they call it Gamer X now or something because they can't call it GamerCon because of legal stuff.
But that's where they're having that, so...
It seemed like a pretty good venue, but I mean, I want to go to that one.
But it was cosplay central all over Japantown and assholes with cameras.
That's the other thing I call them, assholes.
And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.
There's people who know how to behave, how to usher people aside when they're taking their photos.
This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband.
Looking for the girls with the biggest tatas.
I'm going to put this in my spank bank.
Backing up into... Techmaster Loki, everybody.
Backing up into people and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.
I ran into him again and I just said, look where you're going, ass face or something.
Thanks for watching!
I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.
I don't keep up with the con circuit anymore.
How do I know all this?
Say hello to Tech Master Loki, officially, everybody.
Hello.
How you doing?
I'm doing fine.
You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?
No.
Good.
Don't do that.
I can remember.
You had to think for a minute.
It's been a while since I've been to a con.
No, I don't think I have.
It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.
I don't even remember the last con I went to.
It was probably like ASAP.
I remember the last con job I pulled.
What's a con job?
It sounds hot.
Con?
Con artist?
Oh, okay.
It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.
Okay.
Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.
Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.
He's a familiar guy.
You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show or ever listened to Horde House and hear his emails and tweets and all that.
Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.
It is Flaco Jones, everybody!
Hello, everybody.
How are you doing?
I'm doing great.
As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.
Yeah, I love that.
It's just reminding me of Nino Cooney and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.
You're sticky and smell of caramel.
Yes.
Can I smell you?
It's all this English candy.
Yes, it's all the Sill candy, which much love to Sill.
I don't know if Sill listens to Orange Launch Radio, but I hope she won't mind.
I've been giving some of the candy away.
It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.
Sill, EJ, Raven, Rob
and still offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing so she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain like the Smarties over there which are like totally different than Smarties here and like Aero bars which we don't have here at all Jelly Babies which I'd never had which were pretty good
I can't eat jelly babies.
It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.
But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town, but she sent stuff that I've never seen there.
Like the Bubblies, I've never seen them there.
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty cool.
And oh my god, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.
She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs.
I had one yesterday.
Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.
So I have a return package.
I don't want to spoil just in case Syl is listening.
It might spoil by the time it gets there.
I do have a return package we're sending and all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.
So if you know Syl...
And we're sending her a token of our love.
That's right.
In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Syl that we're sending.
So we'll send that over there soon.
All right.
Flaco, what's new with you?
What have you been up to?
When was the last time you were on the show?
A couple months ago, right?
I was on the year-end show.
That's right.
So December 30th or something.
That's right, the last show of the year.
Because you ruined one of the shows in June.
Yes.
and hopefully tonight's show will be better
Thanks for watching!
I like that I have this reputation with this show.
I'm the number one fan of Horde House and the number one curse on OLR.
Exactly, exactly.
So you have two young ones at home.
How old is your little girl now?
She's almost one.
She turns a year next month.
So you have a less than a year old at home.
Yes.
How do you juggle that with game playing?
I play very late at night early in the morning and you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni something like that I can actually play when they're up they don't get bothered by it too much my son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon you know he doesn't like the battles he gets bored of that which I guess a lot of people do
Tree, Tree, Tree, Tree
yeah so we put we you know we load up that game when we start playing it and he just he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game
Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I'm using those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff, whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?
I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.
Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.
It's interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve.
And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.
I think they will.
It'll just be different.
They're holding back on it right now.
They just want to save it.
You think so?
Yeah.
Holding back on it.
They can do it now.
Or Oliver will be able to have the Illumaroom that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.
Yes.
Just in time for that phase.
Boobs everywhere.
Just in time for that phase.
I thought you just called the motorboat room Akuma JP in our chat room By the way, hi chatters We're always joined with the live chat room Because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network VOG Network.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Akuma JP in chat says Sky sounds old, ha ha ha
Well, jerk, keep this in mind.
OLR is on our 11th year this year.
So if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.
We didn't start this show when we were 18.
We were more like 23 or 24.
So you do the math.
You know what?
The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.
And what's that?
Because I'll be 37.
In a row?
I rest my case.
And I'll be 35.
So Jamie's the old one.
Come on, Akuma.
Redirect your jokes appropriately.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Vintage.
This rack took years to grow.
And I'm two weeks older than Rob.
I know.
I feel like the young kid.
If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.
I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.
I guess I just hang out with youngins.
That's the deal.
AkumaJP in our chatroom says so you are old lol bonk you're only as old as you feel honestly and I will say this with all honesty we will talk about video games in a minute here but obviously I still play video games which a lot of people think is a youthful activity although I don't think so I think because we all grew up in a generation that was at least had Atari 2600 like video games has always been a part of our lives so like you know I can't imagine like not playing video games at this point right but
But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.
Really.
I have to agree with that for myself as well.
I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20-year-olds.
That's totally not the case.
But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time know that I was really sick when I was 29.
I missed two or three weeks of OLR because I'd been in the hospital.
I had to have surgery.
So it was one of those things where they had to screen me because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer.
I remember chatting with him when he graduated college That makes me feel old
Yeah, I know, right?
I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.
I'm like, my nieces can like drink.
It's weird.
I remember when they were born.
But now you can take them out drinking.
The other day, we got an email to the show that was like, I've been listening to you since I was 13.
I'm like, oh my God.
He's like, I'm in college now.
Oh my God.
Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?
Not many.
Gunsmoke, The Simpsons, Doctor Who.
There's only a few.
So we're awesome.
Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room and live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.
Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.
What the hell was that?
Like, they say that that kind of stuff happens all the time, but like... It happened in San Francisco, right?
Like, later on.
Yeah, but it like totally wasn't the same thing.
It didn't like shatter windows and stuff.
It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.
It's just, you know, probably somebody's science project out there.
In Russia, meteors shatter you.
Yeah, yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook, little pictures in Soviet Russia.
I was busy being asleep.
Yeah.
Well, you don't live in Russia.
I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.
Well, no, no, no, no.
I mean, I actually didn't see the news until I got up like late today because I've been sick most of the day.
So I was like, meteor?
Fuck.
Sleep.
No, I just, I watching the videos online like blew my mind.
Like you can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass and of course the car alarms is always the best part.
Somebody get Bruce Willis' Armageddon.
I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia.
They have these dash cams going.
Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.
And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never phased by any of this.
There's no like, oh my god!
Right?
It's like, what?
You're just like, oh, that's weird.
Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die.
Oh, well.
Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in, I don't know, Philadelphia or something?
Yeah, and there's a camera going.
I can just imagine it right now.
Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said, and it was just a small thing.
The guy's driving on the freeway and he's like,
Curse Worfs, oh my god did you see that?
It's just like okay.
Oh my god thanks Obama.
I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.
I was driving home really late at night and there was a big green streak across the sky but it didn't explode like that one so obviously it wasn't even close to the size but I thought it was pretty cool.
I was like oh wow that thing just comes streaking across and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.
If it had been in my neck of the south it would be the fuck is that?
Hand me a beer.
Shit, that means we're going to get in another hurricane.
Porkchop in our chatroom says, I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.
I guess, I'm assuming they're in public cars.
Yeah, so I thought maybe it's a police car.
No, apparently they're really, from what I read, they're really into dash cams because, I guess, in traffic courts and stuff, they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.
They have to have physical evidence.
Holy moly.
And so, because of altercations like that, you know, any sort of car accident, they want to have something documented, so that's why they do it.
What did... Because, you know, Nelly was born in Russia.
Did she have anything to say about it?
No.
All the stuff?
No.
Thank God it didn't happen here.
It's probably... I'm glad it didn't hit.
She was born in the Ukraine, so it's... Oh, okay.
A little different.
A little different.
Interesting.
Well, I don't know what that has to... Yeah, Rob.
Everything Slavic is not Russian.
Thank you.
Are you sure?
It was in the 80s.
I thought Canada was a state.
Anyhow.
I don't know what that had to do with video games, but as far as nerd news goes, it was one of those things where I watched it and I was like, oh my god.
You make a Burning Legion joke.
Yes, I saw that on Twitter.
Someone catched a Meteo.
Codeman in chat says it was Team Rocket.
Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.
There was a gif of the lights going out and the Team Rocket shows up.
I guess it was Goku.
All right.
That was a big Kamehameha.
Let's get into video games and the video games that you have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar.
That was awesome.
Yeah, you inhaled that thing.
I love Mars bars.
It's good.
Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.
So I played, I beat Mass Effect 2 again.
And I started on Mass Effect 3 and got Flycam working.
But now, you know, we got that patch 1.5.
And none of my cheats work anymore.
So I just figured out how to put in keybinding commands using the Coalesced Editor.
And now all I have to do is hit 0 for God Mode.
But really, I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.
I played WoW for an hour.
I would actually log on and play more WoW, but I would like people to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to, you know, plug it.
Yes, I know that Mars bars are Milky Ways, but they're not the regular Milky Ways.
They taste better.
They're different-er.
They're actually from Mars.
They are.
You don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid, so having it say Mars with the packaging on it and everything makes me stupendously happy.
So, now if I can find whatchamacallits, I'd be even happier.
I played...
God, I played something else.
I don't remember what it was.
Oh yeah, Dan had a friend over and they played through Contra Hardcore and then played through Ghouls N' Ghosts, which was pretty fun because my friend and I left and then we came back and they were still playing Ghouls N' Ghosts like hours later.
So I'm like, what playthrough were you on?
Oh, just the beginning of the second playthrough.
really, so yeah and then I got now this isn't a game but it's related to a game, I found the Mass Effect Paragon Lost for like 16 bucks brand new so I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money, let's buy it it didn't suck the only thing that I really didn't like about it was how the kroken were drawn I did not care for the character design and it got me in the feels so I was like, damn you Bioware so yeah
Damn those feels.
Damn those feels.
Damn the battle tits.
Full speed ahead.
Okay.
All right.
Let's move on to Loki.
How was your gaming week, Loki?
I didn't play a whole ton this week.
I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim, I'm sure.
I started some of the kind of DLC stuff, or not DLC stuff, the mod quests, I guess, if you will.
There's one that's kind of extensive where you hire a boat and you can actually go to a bunch of different islands and stuff.
And it was neat, I guess.
I mean, it's pretty well done.
And they voice acted everything, so that's a little weird hearing people that don't sound like the five different NPCs that are in the game.
They have voice, all the characters, it's ridiculous.
Um, so I played a little bit of that, and then, um, a little bit of Borderlands, and, um, more Call of Duty.
We actually bought Map Pack 4, or Content Pack 4, so now we have a few more maps that I've already kind of gotten sick of, but we gotta do something because Grand Theft Auto V's not coming out in May like we had hoped it was, so, gotta have something to tide us over.
Um,
And then I just got done playing DDRX2 on my PC.
Even though, yes, that's an arcade game.
But it runs on a PC, so I played it anyways.
And it isn't the versus second mixing.
That's three, I guess.
But it's X2.
It's cool.
It looks like Step Mania, I guess.
It looked a lot to me like the PlayStation 3 version of the game.
Like they just adapted that engine.
Or the Wii.
DDR2 on the Wii.
I'm surprised they don't release like a PC version.
It runs on a PC.
There's no work to be done.
Literally, no work to be done.
Licensing would be the only thing.
I guess, but just put Konami Originals in there.
Done.
Put it on Steam.
There you go.
Money.
It's rolling in.
So there's that.
And then my wife has been taking over the Xbox because she's been playing Fable 3.
Really?
Yeah.
That's not even the best Fable game.
Well, she played Fable 2 all the way, and so she's playing Fable 3.
Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games, is getting into Fable, or is into Fable.
Yeah, she is into Fable.
Huh.
Does she play good or bad?
She's playing good.
Okay.
That game is...
It just makes me realize how much Peter Molyneux is full of crap.
He's just talking about all these different enhancements.
Oh, this is the first time ever in the game, and the dog is awesome, blah, blah, blah.
It's like, okay, you're so full of shit, it's not even funny.
By the way, folks, is anyone still curious about Curiosity?
Because I'm pretty sure everybody's fucking forgotten about this game.
Curiosity.
No, you know who hasn't forgotten about Curiosity is Alan.
Because I'll be sitting there on my iPad and then he'll walk into the room and he'll be like, have you checked on the cube, Rob?
Have you checked on the cube?
What's in the cube?
Did you find what's in the cube yet?
Touch, touch.
Break the cubes.
He does it just like that too.
Break the cubes, Rob.
I don't know what you would even, what that's going to be.
I think it's going to just be like whoever finally, the last person to give that game up is going to be the winner pretty much.
Well, I was going to ask you about this, because there was that new Alien game that came out this week from Gearbox, and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet, except for one site.
Apparently really liked it, but whatever.
And then I went on this Twitter thing.
Now, I don't know shit about this game, really, but I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's jock?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
Well, I'm like, and people are like, oh, we're going to sue, and I'm just like, well, game companies have been doing this shit for years, and you just brought up Peter Molyneux.
Like, he's the master of this shit.
He makes up shit all the time.
Exactly.
He's trying to sue him.
I know nothing, like, I mean, he's not really working, he's not really attached to any more Fable games or anything like that, as far as I'm aware.
There was Fable, it's not on rails.
I seriously don't even know the name of the game.
It's just Fable.
It's not on rights.
The Journey.
Fable, The Journey.
Fable, The Book, The Game, The Series, The Movie.
I don't know.
But yeah, even the whole Gearbox thing.
Well, there's two jokes I made about it.
First off, Gearbox, you've got Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox and Borderlands Gearbox.
Well, this is made by Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox.
And then the second thing is, yeah, just because they showed more fancy features and stuff like that, that may have been running on a PC version or something like that, that come time to actually implement that on a console, oh, we don't have the memory bandwidth to do all these fancy things, we've got to scale it back a bit.
or, oh, we don't have enough processing power or the frame rates, you know, shit or whatever.
And so maybe that's why.
But then again, why wouldn't they just allow that to kind of run, you know, unleashed on the PC?
Probably because it's a console port.
I don't know.
Who cares?
Bad games happen all the time.
Are you really surprised that, like, a movie-tying game is bad?
Really?
I mean, everybody's shocked that this movie-tying game is bad?
I mean...
It doesn't really matter.
It's just... Yeah, we all really kind of hope that the games are good as Borderlands.
Hell, I thought, you know, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be awesome because it's done by the guys at Borderlands.
No.
No, it's the team that did Duke Nukem Forever, clearly.
Yeah.
Ross Steel UT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Differences is great, but when there's literally one that looks shady, even with a game that doesn't get well received, there's always at least a group of people who like the game.
Well, yeah, I mean, you know, one guy liked the game, but I can think of other games where there's been that one voice that passionately defends it.
Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as what they...
I can't believe I am the one defending a big name site
I'm usually the first one to criticize that stuff
There was more evidence and there was stuff that came out about that and all the shady dealings.
And the guy himself basically said, yeah, there was some stuff going on where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff.
I mean, I don't know.
I just think the internet should just get over it.
Okay, there was one person that said it was good.
Well, you know what?
Somebody out there probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2.
Somebody out there probably liked Yaris.
It was free.
I like Silent Hill Revelations, the movie.
Nobody else likes that.
I want it.
I need to see it.
You and Osfer, actually.
Osfer would defend that.
So there you go.
It's something about being high on the leaderboards on VOG.
Actdeft would probably like it, too.
He did like it, I think.
Oh, my God.
If you're going to mark games down just because of glitches and stuff like that, then Earth Defense Force 2017 should have gotten a 1 out of 10 because that thing is glitchy as hell.
There is no physics, no physics whatsoever, or at least no realistic physics.
It's just crap.
The AI is completely retarded.
So yeah, it happens.
Ross Deal UT in chat says and it wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with the game it took seven fucking years to make and had eight devs on it Lincoln just came out a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think 18 years to make that's why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd because she was cast in it like 10 years ago and you know had to defend the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated for an Oscar
Sometimes things get trapped in development hell.
It doesn't necessarily mean they turn out bad.
Like Duke Nukem Forever.
Well, but that's not helping my case, actually.
L.A.
Noire, I think, was in development hell.
Thank you.
That's a better one.
I got good reviews.
Thank you.
Grand Theft Auto V just got delayed.
Yeah, but that hasn't been announced very long.
I mean, it's not like Grand Theft Auto V coming out in 2001.
It's like, wait a second.
We're missing some numbers here.
All right, let's move on with Gaming Week, so we're going to be here for an hour.
I'll talk about my Gaming Week real quick, and then we'll go to Flacco.
I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week because I've been having long hours at work, and when I come home, I'm like, I have to raid and wow or something.
But I did play one new game, and it was something where it went on sale this weekend, and so I get a text message from Shane.
Hey.
Hey.
You should get Pokemon Black 2.
Black 2 has the sassier Pokemon and it's on sale right now at Best Buy.
So you should get it.
I get a text an hour later.
Did you get it yet?
Text an hour later.
You know you can order it online.
You can just go pick it up after work before it sells out.
And it's like, you know, he keeps texting me like, did you buy the Pokemon yet?
Why haven't you bought Pokemon?
Why won't you take a good deal?
You can talk about it on OLR.
So finally it's like, shut up!
Alright, I'll buy the game!
So Jamie, are you going to get in the Pokemon now pretty soon?
Because you guys are all fucking like
Gateway, Game Addicts or something.
Yeah, okay, say that now.
Let me see it.
You want to see it?
No, I want to see the box.
It's actually super cute.
I don't care.
Alright, so here's the thing.
It's on the DS.
Not the 3DS, but the DS.
Well, then I could play it, but I don't care.
I've been having fun with it.
You know what?
Here's what I like compared to Pearl.
It moves at a faster pace.
It gives you all this shit up front, and you don't have to go forever and grind more.
And I feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon at the beginning than there was in Pearl.
And it's just kind of little quality of life improvements.
Here's where the game...
Kind of, like, goes crazy, though, is that there's all these, like, online things.
Like, I can't figure out half this shit with the online.
Like, some of it's in the manual, and some of it I tried to go online.
I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me, but it's just, it's so weird.
Like, you can use your little online gear to put your Pokemon to sleep, and then you go on the website, and you register for the website, and then you link your DS to the website, and then you can...
Do that Pokemon that you just put to sleep you can have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville but you can also play these little online games so your Pokemon can send you things back in the regular game once you tell your Pokemon to wake up and then you launch your game again and you hit the button to tell it to wake up and go find where it was.
Like it's like oh my god, it's like an 18 step process.
My brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment you said put them to sleep.
Laughter
Sorry, Pikachu.
The fact that there's just all these bells and whistles that are buried like five menus deep is just, I don't know.
I feel like Pokemon kind of needs a better interface.
Like it would be better if they could streamline a lot of that.
Maybe the new 3DS version X and Y will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks good.
So it'll be cool to see that.
but yeah, I mean, don't let my little rant get you wrong especially for the core game about finding the new Pokemon and challenging the gym leaders and all that it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace than the other games do so you'll get pretty immediate rewards out of it there's a medal system in the game since Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did their own little thing with medals and you can have your little title when you go online you know what?
I found my copy of Pearl
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Oh, I should say this, too.
I'm playing Pokemon Black 2, and I didn't play Black 1, and I'm doing just fine.
So, like, the sequel thing, not an issue.
And I can appreciate that.
They always reference, like, all the people that you talk to are like, two years ago, this happened.
Two years ago, this happened.
So I guess that's kind of its way of catching you up.
So that's kind of cool, I guess.
What is this that you're showing me?
That internet meme is seriously 15 years old.
I know, I think it's great that someone still remembers it.
She's showing me the pictures of the cats.
Oh, is that in chat room?
Yeah, the pictures of the cats playing Pokemans.
It says, my Pokemans, let me show you them.
I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago.
I'm saving it.
All right.
Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?
It was pretty good.
I got to play a lot of games this week.
Or not a lot of games, but a lot of two games.
And the first one was Unfinished Swan.
I kind of bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because I played the demo, which is basically just the first level, and really liked it.
And my wife kept pestering me.
She's like, why don't you just buy this game?
We love playing the demo, but then we have to stop.
And
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And we ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday.
We'd go back and forth.
I'd watch a little of the game.
We'd play some more of that.
I tweeted about that, and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer of the game.
So I didn't hashtag anything, but I guess you can have stuff come up.
This tweet deck, I think, allows you to run one feed for your Twitter, but you can also run a search, and it'll pop right up there.
Yeah.
Okay, do you remember when we had Ronnie from Big Brother 11 on Horde House a couple weeks ago?
Yeah.
Okay, so we got him, this was really Shane and X4's doing, I can't take credit.
We got him addicted to Frog Fractions, which is that Flash game, and if you haven't heard of it, it's hilarious.
But Shane and X4 won't shut up about that game, so they were talking about it on the show.
So I sent Ronnie the link, and I said something like, here's Frog Fractions, you're welcome, I've ruined your life or whatever, something like that.
DarkSakura.com
So yeah, so I played that, and mainly, I'd gotten all the trophies, except for, we still needed the, the hardest trophy to get in the game was to do the first level only using three paintballs.
And the point of the game is you splatter paint around, at least the first part of the game, you splatter paint around to see where you're going, and it's kind of like a puzzler, it's kind of built like a shooter though, you know, because you just have like, you're just shooting paintballs all over the place.
Can you make dirty noises while you're doing it?
Because the way you describe it, where you're like shooting paint everywhere, you can make these really disgusting noises, like,
Thanks for watching!
But yeah, so we did that.
My wife talked me through it.
She found a guide online, and it's like, walk backwards until you hit a wall.
Walk left until you hit a wall.
Walk straight.
You'll hear leaves cracking under your feet.
Because you're pretty much a due-level blind.
Everything's completely whited out.
So we got that trophy, and that was our 100% for that.
So that was really cool.
And the other game I played, of course, was Ni No Kuni.
I passed the 31-hour mark last night, and I played a little bit more today.
Did it go downhill after 15 hours?
No, I have no idea what that was about.
I don't know, maybe my hours are different than other people's because I've been doing everything.
So I guess you can't really get... Can you hit a wall if you're just doing everything?
I don't think so.
I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to speed through it really fast, and then you kind of hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough, maybe you haven't gone out there.
Because it is pretty grindy, though I found it's not super grindy for me because if I do the quests, in the process of doing the quests, I fight enough battles that I level up and...
It's not really felt grindy to me, but I could see how people would think it's too grindy.
But I don't mind that.
I mean, Secret of Mana is really, really grindy, and there's no question that you just have to go out and grind, grind, grind to get your party up.
Old school Final Fantasy games were very, very grindy.
I spent an hour trying to get... What is that town?
Alma Moon?
The one with the milk, right?
Yeah.
Were you trying to get the babanas?
The big banana guys?
I had to search for the banana guys for an hour.
An hour!
And then finally, I trapped one.
And then here's the hilarious part, right?
Because for that quest, you have to get the banana and the turban monkey, right?
Yeah.
So I go, and I'm like all excited.
So I go to turn in the banana, and he's like, Oh, you got the bananas, but you didn't get the turban monkey.
Well, what I didn't realize is that the Turban Monkey had evolved.
Really?
Because I had him in my party.
So the Turban Monkey evolved.
So I had to go get another one.
They don't evolve unless you give them a treat.
Well, he was in my party.
I wanted him to evolve.
I didn't realize that would fuck up the whole thing.
That's so adorable.
I'm going to feed you.
He was so hungry.
I wanted him.
I don't evolve very quickly.
Don't feed him after midnight.
Yeah, I fed him after midnight, and that was my mistake.
Yeah, well, that's pretty bad.
I could have screamed.
I could have screamed.
That's why I haven't played in a week and a half.
I'm still punishing the game.
Well, see, when I do those quests, I usually go out and just do that.
Because I consider that kind of one of my grind sessions.
Because I know those... I think it's only come up one at a time in a different town.
And that's the first thing I'll do.
I'm like, oh, this is a good time to grind.
Because this one quest requires a lot of grinding.
So I'll go out and I'll go tame the three pets.
And then I'll bring them back.
And I bring them back right away.
So I didn't realize...
I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway, but I didn't know that was something that would mess it up.
So now it's good to know.
You don't ever evolve your... I have only evolved the main ones that I use.
I don't evolve a lot of them.
I evolve them all.
Well, if you hold on to them a little bit, their stats get better and the stats carry over.
I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability.
I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not going to miss anything by evolving them, but then I'll...
All of all of them.
and you do the Coliseum stuff.
I already did the first round of the Coliseum and I beat that.
It was really hard, but I got through that.
The Fencer puppy is really good, right?
Little Fencer?
Or is it a kitty?
Fencer kitty?
The kitty, yeah.
I have that.
He's pretty good.
I still like my Might.
I look online and people say, oh, the Mighty Might's not that good.
But I don't know.
I really like him.
He's got a shield.
He defends really well.
He blocks a lot of attacks.
I still use him as my main guy's tank.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I've heard it's pretty good.
And I looked online, most of the dragons are really good.
So I'm going to work on that one.
you reminded me about names have you really just sat there and read some of the suggested names because every Pokemon that you can pick in the game has like four suggested names and some of them are so fucking funny like the Turban Monkey thing one of the suggested names was Turbangela I died I died some of them are so funny
I need to look at that now.
I look at the first one and I always change it.
No, always cycle through because there's four for each one.
I named him Toad Bandit because he looked kind of like Toad, but with a bandit mask on.
So you're Toad Bandit.
Okay, so though, I have to ask this because this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones.
Is it when you rename them, they keep that name like forever through all of their evolutions?
But does it still let you know what they originally are?
You know he's talking Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon, right?
I'm sorry.
I was thinking of Pokemon.
It's really a lot.
It's pretty much the same fucking thing.
I've never played Pokemon, but now I'm kind of interested because I'm like, this game's really fun.
Maybe I would like Pokemon because I like getting my familiars.
I like feeding them.
The combat is the totally different part.
I'm sorry.
I look down for a moment and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like, Pokemon?
To answer your question, even though you didn't ask about this, you can rename them, but it will say what the name of their kind of general familiar is.
So if you need to look something up on that, you can.
For anyone else who's interested in that.
And that was my gaming week.
Nino Cooney, lots of it.
There you go.
Nino, lots of Cooney.
All right.
Housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR.
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and on Google Plus as well.
Please consider joining our fan communities.
and I'll see you next time.
Yeah, so today Bungie revealed Destiny and they had like a little kind of behind the scenes development video that showed actual, I'm pretty sure no actual gameplay.
Or if there was, it was so insignificant that I didn't remember.
but basically Destiny is this always on persistent kind of first person shooter adventure I guess where you take on these guardians of kind of one of the last civilizations in the solar system and you kind of
Venture out to different planets and stuff like that and fight aliens and all sorts of stuff.
I think originally the description was kind of like a single player co-op and multiplayer game all mixed together all at once.
It should be interesting.
I'm not sure exactly how you're going to interact with other people.
This reminded me, it sounded a lot like Phantasy Star, I guess.
You know, whereas that was, you know, Phantasy Star Online.
That's a good way of putting it.
That is kind of what it sounds like, where it's like you have this central hub type of thing, but you can go out with friends, and I guess they were showing... I actually did watch one of the four-minute videos they put out where they showed how the iPhone, and I'm assuming Android as well, would integrate with it, where you could, like, send messages, like, let's meet up on Venus or something like that.
I don't know.
Let's meet up on Uranus.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Let's do some grinding on Uranus.
Dark side of Uranus.
It looks neat.
Definitely a huge franchise.
They've got a 10-year plan with it.
They're just going to...
Wait, wait, wait.
10-year plan?
The game announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, right?
I think it's going to be probably Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and then probably whatever next-gen consoles also.
So their 10-year plan is how to get you to buy it three times.
Is that really what the 10-year plan consists of?
It's got to be, right?
Uh...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I would imagine there's versions of Destiny in development for these PlayStation 4s and Xbox next to the one.
Yeah, I think that there will be, but it's definitely not going to be just next-gen.
They can't.
I mean, Activision's smart enough to know, hey, we're not going to gamble on next-gen right away.
We're going to...
They're going to do it like, okay, we're going to put out the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen stuff at the same time.
That way, if you want the next gen version of the game, you will have it.
If you want a current gen version of the game, you can have that too.
Because they know that there's a huge install base already.
Why cut out all that money?
And none for Wii U buy.
That's hard to say with Activision.
I mean, because they've got... They have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit and they even have a few games coming out.
Although...
I mean, I don't know how excited I'd be getting about re-releasing the amazing Spider-Man.
That was the Xbox 360 version.
Now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that.
They have a Wii U version for The Walking Dead.
And even though they did Call of Duty and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U, they're still supporting the Wii.
Actually, Activision is a pretty strong supporter of the Wii U right now.
Maybe followed up by Ubisoft, although a lot of their games aren't coming to the Wii U. I would see a Wii U version of this coming out.
Especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version, why not?
It would work.
Did you find the lack of PC interesting?
Because I sure did.
Yeah, a little bit.
Because the PC is the thing that could evolve over those 10 years.
And the PC is the one thing that will still be here.
As people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes.
But this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it.
Who's to say that there's not going to be a PC version for it?
This is just kind of like, hey, we're announcing this thing.
Really say which consoles it's going to be on.
So they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC.
It's just, I don't know.
What did you think about all this?
Like, when you watch the, you know, announcements and all that, now that it's kind of out there, what do you think?
Because I have an opinion that others might not agree with, but what do you think, Loki?
It looked neat, but I don't know really much about it yet.
I mean, I'm not going to be like, oh my god, Bungie made it, I gotta go buy it!
Because I didn't buy, I didn't really buy Halo, I bought Halo 3.
That was the only Halo game I ever owned.
And I was just kind of like, okay, this is hard.
I mean, it's just not like, I don't lose my shit over Bungie games.
I'm gonna be blunt, a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass.
Like, honestly.
Like, this whole, like, the video I watched and everything, this whole pomp and circumstance of, this is our big ambition, and da-da-da-da-da.
And, like, I really felt like half that video was like, well, you know, we made Halo, and, you know, we gotta follow up to that, and Halo was this, and we've poured all our company into this since Halo, and Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo.
Like, they had to name check Halo.
But here's the thing that gets me about that.
Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong Halo 2, one of the greatest video games ever made but here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison is that Halo 4, which Bungie didn't do was better than Halo 3 Yes
Absolutely.
In many ways it was better than Halo 3.
Better than Halo 2?
Eh, I don't know.
Gaming was a lot different with all those years in between and Halo 2 really pushed so many things forward in a different way.
But, you know, Halo 4, they didn't have anything to do with and it was a better game than what they did at the end of the run.
Sorry.
I'm not the only one thinking it, okay?
So, when they talk about all this Destiny stuff and how much of their Halo influence and all this has to do, I'm kind of like...
Now, are they saying that they had one foot out the door when ODST and all this stuff was being done and they were already working on Destiny or what?
What stock am I putting into this?
Because really, I felt like all we heard about today was an idea.
And although some of it's interesting, like the iPhone integration.
I don't think.
You know what this felt like?
This felt like a Kickstarter video.
Like at the very end... Oh my god, yes!
That's a great comparison.
At the very end, they're gonna like, okay, and now we need you to back this.
Go pre-order it.
We need you to go pre-order it and back the game.
Yes!
That is a great comparison.
That is really what it felt like.
It felt like somebody's Kickstarter video.
And it's like, you know, and there was very little gameplay in it.
There was some gameplay in the trailer that I saw.
I sort of remember it, but it was, you know.
The gameplay I saw was nothing new.
Nothing new.
But granted, it was three seconds of gameplay.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, here's the thing I'm wondering, though, because if you have this coming out, and this is supposed to be like a first-person shooter, let's just say, where are they going to put this as far as in comparison to Call of Duty?
I mean, if it's going to release with a next-gen console or something like that or around that time, I mean, you're going to... It's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter.
You're going to have Grand Theft Auto in September.
You're going to have some massive games in November.
You're going to have another Call of Duty game.
You're going to have... It's just, where are they going to put a game of this...
I guess I don't know it's Activision it's gonna be weird to see them splitting their resources as far as marketing goes between Destiny and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kind of like well Call of Duty is just not quite you know what it used to be we're just gonna kind of back burner that a little bit and just kind of release something that's a slight upgrade and people will buy it and then we'll focus all of our money into this because this is our 10-year deal thing
I'm looking at some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
Codeman says, this is the first I've heard of this game.
Is that bad?
No, because when you really need to hear about the game is just before the game comes out, those week one sales.
But this is their efforts to get more people talking about it.
Success, here we are, and now you've been educated on it.
Well, and here's the thing, too.
It's like, why announce it now?
It's like a really weird time to announce it.
Why not?
Yeah.
why not it's an empty floor until E3 why is Sony doing a big announcement next week there's not a lot of other stuff video game things for people to be writing about Sony I think needs something you know because right now you know they don't have any PlayStation I mean they kind of announced their slate of PlayStation 3 titles with The Last of Us and then they've got you know a couple games that I don't think a lot of people care about like Puppeteer and uh was it the uh
Beyond Two Souls, which Beyond Two Souls looks alright, but let's be honest, that's not going to be this huge... It's still kind of niche, the genre.
And then their Puppeteer game, which I gotta be honest, their kids' titles aren't doing very well, or the children's titles, I guess, or younger skewed titles.
Um, so, I think they have to really come out with, you know, here's what our game plan is, you guys, you know, stick with us, you know, especially with the Vita, because, holy crap, Vita, there's nothing really announced other than, we know there's that new game from Media Molecule, there's gonna be the Killzone shooter game, and...
There could be some type of ace in the hole with the next PlayStation.
We don't know how the next PlayStation will interface with the Vita.
Could it do a Wii U type of thing?
Because apparently now everybody feels like they have to copy Nintendo.
I know we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even a little bit later in the show, but my bar for the PlayStation 4 right now is set so fucking low.
That's good, though.
That's a good place for Sony to be in, isn't it?
Don't they want... I mean, if the bar's low, that's actually good news.
Yeah.
Because they could really kick your ass with these... But I don't... Here's the thing.
I'm setting the bar so low because I don't think they're going to hit that even.
I mean, it's just... I don't expect anything from them.
I just... I'm expecting to be kind of like...
Okay, cool.
Well, here's the other thing too, is remember guys, it's February and the console won't be out until November, I'm sure is a safe bet.
If it's not delayed.
Right?
So, you know, don't expect them to say a lot.
maybe we'll get some pictures maybe we'll see a couple of the games but don't expect price don't expect release date don't expect all the bells and whistles expect an idea of what Sony thinks the next generation of gaming is please god do not be Facebook
Just don't.
I don't know.
Social game, I really just... I'm going to get irritated if I hear that word too much.
At the same time, I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need some more memes.
Seriously.
We need more memes.
Well, this is why it's a pre-recorded thing.
Namco?
Namco?
I'm expecting a Ridge Racer.
I'm expecting a Ridge Racer game.
It's been a while.
I need a new Ridge Racer game.
Alright, I'm going to move on with news from a company we always expect great things from, which had a surprising announcement this week that they actually let some people go.
It's Valve.
Yeah, apparently up to 25 people were affected by these changes.
Now, a lot of this is very vague, but some of this came from a tweet.
Hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet that said, Yep, got fired today.
Time for new exciting projects.
So, you know, that was somebody at Valve and was working on hardware.
And the Internet did some more research and found out that part of what she'd been working on was living room PC controllers.
Also affected thanks to internet research Director of Business Development Jason Holtman had left the company Some employee pages on Valve site actually changed pretty significantly Very interesting Gabe Newell did end up commenting on this to Engadget Quote, we don't usually talk about personnel matters for a number of reasons There seems to be an unusual amount of speculation about some recent changes here So I thought I'd take the unusual step of addressing them
No, we aren't canceling any projects.
No, we aren't changing any priorities or projects we've been discussing.
No, this isn't about Steam or Linux or hardware or whatever game.
We're not going to discuss why anyone in particular is or isn't working here.
So, it could have nothing to do with layoffs.
Maybe something, I mean, it could be a personnel issue, although, I mean, that's a hell of a speculation.
If, let's just say that he was working on, you know, controllers,
I don't think they really need to work on a controller because it's already kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller.
Why do we need another controller?
Well, this holds the Steam Box.
Steam Box would come with its own controller, obviously.
Yeah, but whatever.
I mean, just use another third-party controller.
I don't think they really need to make another controller.
Just use an existing controller or support any controller.
here's the other thing you know as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes happen at really weird times for reasons because the project is done and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one to another and it's not like the business is always constant there's not projects that go on forever unless I guess maybe Bungie's feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever but if Destiny doesn't do very well if that flops that's gonna be that will hose the whole company but anyway that's neither here nor there um
Projects start and projects end.
And if there's not a new project to go to when one project ends, people are let go.
It sucks, but it happens.
That's the game industry.
So it's just weird to hear it coming from Valve because it's like, dude, shouldn't you be working on Half-Life 3?
But who knows what they have up their sleeve.
I don't know.
There could be no Half-Life 3.
We will be waiting forever.
If you want to sell a million of those Steam boxes, just announce two exclusives.
Announce one exclusive.
Anything that ends in three coming out of Valve.
I'm talking Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3.
Any of those gets the lead on the Steam box, Steam box will sell more than we do.
Or just do the Orange Box 3, Half-Life 2, Episode 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3, and...
You'll outsell Wii U in like a day.
And maybe like Garry's Mod X3.
I don't know.
Alright.
Let's move on.
DarkSakura.
How about something that's a little less frustrating as soon as I can get a stupid iPad to work?
Okay, so there have been some leaks.
And people are kind of, oh, okay, you know, taking it a little bit in stride.
But there is a few issues that are coming out with the DualShock 4 release image.
Who all here has seen it?
So I don't.
Well, the controller itself, and the photo, by the way, also shows that that might be a dev kit for the Orbis dev kit.
But they're saying that, you know, just on the items pointed out on the controller itself is that there's the two-point multi-touch pad, the move tracking light on the controller itself, the loudspeaker, and a headphone socket.
And then they're talking about what they're seeing on the...
What I'm guessing to be the Orbis dev kit would be a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive, two USB 3.0 slots, and just a number of other things.
They're basically saying that...
It's going to be some pretty hardcore material and they have a lot of high hopes for the controller.
Now, honestly, I think that that might be a little too much in the controller.
I'm actually wondering how much it's going to weigh.
And I don't think it's going to come out with all of the things that they're trying to pump into it.
But it's interesting.
It does raise some questions.
I think it's actually not multi-touch on that touchpad.
It's just single.
It's the rear touchpad from the Vita, isn't it?
Sort of, yeah, because the rear one's multi-touch.
You can pinch and stuff like that.
But what's kind of different about it, though, is they're saying that it's basically going to be used for interfaces and basic stuff.
I don't even know why you need it, to be honest.
And then, of course, they are reshaping the trigger buttons on there.
They say they're supposed to be a little bit more springy, like the Xbox 360 stuff.
Surely you've all seen the gif of where the little move light is actually a siren and then the little screen is flashing used game, used game, used game.
That's the purpose of the screen.
The little loudspeaker.
So Popo can come get you.
It looks like the analog sticks, they've got a little difference on the top.
It's kind of got a little bit of lip on the edge of the actual sticks themselves so that your thumbs don't fall off of them like they do on the PS3 ones.
The one thing that they're saying with this one is actually that they were saying that there wasn't a corresponding touch on the back.
This is on the front of the controller is where the touch is showing.
Well, that's good because the rear touch on the Vita... Especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller, that would just be irritating.
and then the other things there's a share button on there that was spotted in the upper left hand corner of the touchpad area that actual speaker spot they're saying might actually be a microphone kind of similar to what's on the Vita I guess
or could it maybe pick finally it picks up your voice like there's a built-in cross voice chat thing on PlayStation like there should have been all along it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it had like a built-in you know headset in there where you put your um you know headphones wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your opponent
That's one thing.
I think it's one goldmine that Wii U is missing.
We've got this virtual console and all this stuff.
Why can't I play games online with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?
Well, here's the thing.
The problem, though, is I don't think that would work because if you think about it, there's no camera on the actual controller itself.
That you can see.
No, I don't think there's actually a camera on there.
You would see a camera on that.
Here's what I want to know.
They've got that little bar at the end that's basically supposed to be the move stuff.
How the fuck are you supposed to do that as a move controller?
It doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable at all.
I remember you can use the DualShock 3 for the nunchuck portion, if you will.
I bet there's a way you grip it sideways.
You can probably grip it sideways and use your fist.
I understand that you could probably grip it sideways, but your fingers would want to go over that light because you'd be holding onto the middle of it, and your hand's going to want to go over that sensor in the middle.
I just don't think that's a good design.
either that or they're going to have a separate move related something and this is going to be more for just like a gestural almost like the six axis was supposed to be I think it's going to be more like that because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve six axis in a way
um maybe instead of we need to remember very important you know this is a prototype big word there this will change this is not what the controller is going to look like so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that maybe it could be grippy I'm I'm making shit up there could be other things we don't see on it now these things can and will change they always always do so that's not the final look of that controller
I still don't understand what they're going to use that touchpad for.
The share button idea, I guess it's kind of neat, but once again, that also kind of scares me because that gets into the whole social gameplay stuff where, oh, I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook.
You guys can watch me beat up this hooker.
Well, you're getting the Ouya, aren't you?
Doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?
Yeah.
So maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works.
The touchpad on the front of the Ouya, I believe, is multi-touch, and I think that's meant for playing, like, other Android games that would not use the controller.
Like, you could actually use that to play Angry Birds or something like that.
Yeah, that just seems funky.
Even this seems funky to me, because I'm like, how do you translate on a tiny little screen what's going to happen on the...
That is tough, yeah.
It's not as easy as looking at a touch screen where, okay, I can see where my finger is.
I know where I'm hitting, but having it translate.
Although you say that, but then we all use touch pads, so we seem to figure out a way around that.
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Black Wolf, host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show, name checks Uno in a comment to me.
And I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking about have a video camera so other people can watch.
I mean, Uno was a huge selling game.
I don't know if it was because of the camera feature.
Was.
What up, G?
Sony just show what they want the PS4 controller to be and then change big time like the Boomerang did Boomerang is an excellent example of how things can and will change or a perfect example the Zapper controller that they showed at E3 for the Wii that looked fucking amazing and then they put out a piece of plastic shit so works in reverse too it could alright let's move on with more news
Speaking of Nintendo, they had some announcements.
And it's very exciting if you're a 3DS owner.
Lots of news for you guys, including game announcements.
They announced a brand new Mario & Luigi Dream Team.
Kind of a new game in that franchise.
Also, that's supposed to be coming out for the 3DS.
I don't know if that was supposed to be an eShop title.
I don't think it was.
I think that's actually a retail title.
They have a special deal now if you haven't bought a 3DS.
If you buy the 3DS XL and Luigi's Mansion or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, you get a free game including Super Mario 3D Land or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask and Star Fox 64 3D and some other games you probably don't want.
Mario Golf World T coming to the 3DS this summer so that's kind of exciting there's a new Mario game Mario and Donkey Kong game more puzzle stuff that's going to be coming to the 3DS eShop as well as a new Dylan's Rolling Western The Last Ranger that's going to be coming out on March 11th which actually that's supposed to be kind of a pretty cool game as well
The Harmony Knight or whatever it was.
Yeah, Harmo Knight and Kersplush.
Kersplush is a really weird premise.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a rock thrown down a well?
No.
Well, now you can.
Doom Plague in chat says, was Fire Emblem on that list?
No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem at the Nintendo Direct.
Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out.
I think that just came out.
Yeah, it just came out.
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS coming out.
And last but not least, the most important news.
June 9th, North America, June 14th in Europe, Animal Crossing New Leaf coming out.
The better question is though, what do they have for the Wii U?
And not a whole lot actually.
The Wii U, a couple announcements.
One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of DLC that's going to be coming out for New Super Mario Bros.
U. So that'll be coming out later on.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what?
It's neat because it's something different.
You can't really get anywhere else.
And it is pretty smooth.
Or on the Vita.
It's a pretty smooth experience.
Don't they have Google Maps on the Vita?
Oh, it's different.
Because the whole, like, fact it's got the gyroscope and that you can kind of look around.
That you can do it on the Vita?
I'll have to show it on the Vita.
I think you just get the normal maps.
I don't know if it does the whole sensor.
I know they have the gyroscope stuff.
Or even with phones, I think you can do that.
Not on, like, Google Earth on iPhone.
No, this operates very differently.
and it's all set up so that there's places already bookmarked to go take a look at and stuff the interface is interesting I mean it's neat it's the type of thing you would see as a demo but like you know it's not exactly going to sell any systems or make people feel like ooh there's all this new value in my system I like how they said free for a limited amount of time like someone's really going to buy this one I don't know if I would have paid money for it unless it was really really cheap
Super Luigi DLC DLC
I don't know what the price is on that.
Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more.
I guess we'll see.
Should be careful what I say, but I can't imagine it's going to be as much as you think it is.
Also on the Wii U, a new Miiverse community for Zelda!
I actually watched the Nintendo Direct and they did kind of make a little bit of a deal about this where they're like, it's the first Miiverse community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk about Zelda.
You know it's just going to be a bunch of people with their really creative artwork and so forth.
Um, which I guess it's neat, but it's weird to me that like, it's like, that this is a big deal.
Like, oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have a game behind it.
What a fucking concept.
That's stupid.
And the other thing too is like, Daryl, look at, oh, we love your amazing artwork.
Couldn't you think, you know, of an idea of, hey, how about we put some places where you can showcase that artwork?
We'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since I could, I'm pretty much going to guess this.
Well, Loki, it's, it's showcased when you turn the system on.
That's all built into the whole closet.
I understand that, but I'm just saying, though, that this is basically the equivalent of a forum.
How hard is it to create a sub-forum in a forum?
Apparently really difficult for Nintendo engineers.
Let's also not forget, though, that this forum is coming to iPhones, which was a pretty big announcement of the last Nintendo Direct.
So they're kind of setting the stage for that.
But, again...
I like Miiverse, and there's a lot about it I do like, and I've talked about that before when I talked about the Wii U in general, but I don't think this is a game changer.
It's a logical next step.
Here's my worry, or maybe theory or something...
This whole thing, they're all like, oh, there's a lot of news that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans and 3DS fans.
This is so that you guys know there's stuff coming.
There wasn't really anything for the Wii U, though.
It was all 3DS, which makes me wonder, how far away are we from an announcement that the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U gamepad?
Because they have a ton of shit coming out for the 3DS and nothing coming out for the Wii U. It makes perfect sense to say, hey,
Two birds, one stone.
There you go.
They won't be in 3D, but no one uses the 3D feature anyways.
We'll just have the top screen up on the TV, bottom screen up on your gamepad.
Done.
eShop.
What gets me is that they did this whole thing about it's the year of Luigi, and they really went all out.
They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie, and every little shot of one of their talking heads had a little Luigi doll back there.
But I was like, okay, the only Luigi stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion, which we already knew that was a thing, and that was going to be coming.
And then they say, oh, Luigi's a character in the golf game, and then this Luigi DLC, which is cool, yes, but...
to brand it all as the Year of Luigi.
I was kind of like, yay.
You know what you need is a Waluigi versus Luigi game.
Or just, you know, I don't know, just say we've got Luigi content.
Whatever, whatever.
Well, that makes me wonder then when is this new Super Luigi content coming out?
If it's the Year of Luigi, it's not going to be first half of the year.
So you could be waiting for this crap until fourth quarter.
I got it.
A new Mario is missing.
Did we say the year of Luigi?
We meant the decade of Luigi.
I mean, I'm just... The eventually.
Once again, it's just, you know, I would have thought that, especially after all these announcements of delays, even some delays by Nintendo, like of their first party titles, that they would have said, hey, you know what?
I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles being delayed.
Here's what we have coming so that, you know... But they had nothing.
They had nothing...
Doom Plague mentions in our chat room the part of the Luigi thing was also a new Mario and Luigi game where you're inside Luigi's dream.
Okay, yes, I forgot about that, but that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting character to me.
You are inside his dream.
I don't want to be inside Luigi.
How are you Luigi inside Luigi?
You're not.
Luigi-ception there.
It's like Mario Inner Space.
So again, it's not like, okay, so it's just, these were all things that existed where like, stretch people, we need a theme, people.
What's the theme, people?
I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street.
Let's, you know, go inside the dream.
The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard.
The Pikmin versus Garden Gnomes.
Lego City Stories, Luigi seen Legos.
Luigi likes Legos.
Luigi likes Legos.
Crap.
Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
They're both green.
Yes.
Yes.
Green.
We'll go with that.
The Legend of Luigi.
All right.
Let's move on with more news.
Then we'll get to release dates.
DarkSakura.
And is cheaper and has more games, to be fair.
But, still, you know, their goal was supposed to be, I think, over $100,000.
Well, well over that, really.
But they've completely undersold.
And so now, they're...
They had announced that it sold 3.06 million worldwide as of December.
But now their forecast of 5.5 million has gone down to 4 million worldwide.
And I bet it's going to go down again at the end of this month.
I don't see any more systems.
There's no games.
There literally is no Wii U games coming out this month.
None.
I think that they're really probably looking to the handheld market to uphold their console market it gets me though that everybody is crying that it's the death of Nintendo and now Nintendo will be forced to do Mario games on the 360 ha ha ha
The unfortunate thing is that this is the exact same fucking thing as the 3DS.
Exact same thing.
The 3DS launched with a couple of good games, then literally nothing.
We got Ping Pals was a big release on the 3DS.
That was not on 3DS.
No, that was regular DS.
I don't know.
Still, you had shit on the 3DS for a long time and then finally they dropped the price and like a couple years later, the 3DS is bomb.
And hopefully Nintendo can make magic work twice.
I think the only danger part is that Nintendo is going to have to work that magic twice and they may have to drop the price of the Wii U in order to do it.
Well, maybe then I'd get one.
Yeah, I think that's awesome.
Nevertheless, they don't have a 3DS, you know, so...
Special Year of Luigi Green Wii U I don't want to see a green Wii U I'm wondering what they're going to do with the price Especially when these new consoles launch Because it's going to be tough If they're having trouble getting people to be interested in it now When you have all that buzz of all these awesome games Especially if, God forbid, that Destiny or something like that is not on the Wii U
Grand Theft Auto is on the Wii U. Destiny is on the Wii U. Madden is on the Wii U. I mean, people are going to be like, well, why do I need a Wii U?
Yeah, but if Zelda is on the Wii U. I mean, that's all it took for the 3DS.
It's Wind Waker though.
I'm not even talking about Wind Waker.
I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.
Yeah, new Zelda game is not coming out this year.
I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year other than Wind Waker HD.
But that would be enough for some people, though.
Something else to think about, though, is that, well, yeah, what if, okay, all they would have to do, Wind Waker HD comes with one playable HD Zelda level.
Flying off shelves.
Fly it.
You won't be able to find that shit anywhere.
Watch.
It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders because it had the Metal Gear 2 thing.
Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo in it that actually wasn't bad and got a sequel.
I don't play Xbox.
Crackdown.
Crackdown, thank you.
Or what was it?
Alundra.
Didn't it have like the Final Fantasy 7 demo?
Tobal, number one.
Tobal, Tobal.
I know I was saying Alundra.
Yeah, Tobal.
How many people bought that and all the Dragon Ball fans?
I think Tobal had an 8 demo actually in
Yeah, that was it.
It was the eight demo.
But anyway.
But, I mean, there's a lot of people who will go out and... Or, um... Oh, shoot.
Um...
Was it one of the games had a Xenogears demo with it too?
Yeah.
And there's people who will just buy a game to get the demo of something that they want more.
Here's the thing, honestly, and one reason I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now is because once these 3DS games are out, it is all hands on fucking deck for the Wii U. Everybody at Nintendo, first and second parties...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If we're still sitting here next January telling the same tale, then I'll entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo better be cooking up a Mario game for the PlayStation 4.
In the end, as long as there are people who have little kids they want to play games, they're going to go for a Nintendo system.
Nintendo has that level of brand recognition and the association that they're working as a kid-friendly, family-friendly system.
until the kid falls over and drops the tablet and breaks it.
Yeah, I mean, I agree.
They are owning the handheld market, but they may just not be a console... But they weren't!
They weren't!
Yeah, they weren't, but they may just not be a console company anymore.
I mean... Too early.
I mean, I'm not... I don't want to say I'm Nintendo defending and all this stuff.
I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this.
It is pretty shitty...
that this is having a worse month.
I mean, these numbers are so bad.
It is worse than any month, like the 360.
I don't even think Sega's done that badly.
Or PlayStation 3.
I wouldn't go that far.
Or PlayStation 3 has on record.
I mean, it's bad.
What were Dreamcast sales like in their first couple months?
You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point, though.
I mean, it's just a different culture now.
But I mean, there have been people that were drawing comparisons between Sega's last days and Nintendo's.
which is redonkulous I'm sorry it's just that that whole like nay saying whatever like that's like the anti fanboy it's no better but what did game what how well did GameCube do it was third place and Nintendo did fine yeah as long as they're making enough money to keep costs up in the company as long as they're turning a profit or at least breaking even
Yeah, and the handhelds are going to do that for them just fine.
So they'll make it just fine.
They'll be around.
It's not going to be like Sega.
Sega didn't have that handheld.
Sega also had some stupid marketing.
Yeah.
They also had, especially for the Saturn.
Really, really bad piracy.
That was the downfall of the Dreamcast.
Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast had an entire CD, you know, spindle of every single burn game.
And then had their boot discs to play their imports.
yep yeah
no comment it's not even close to some people had Parapara on their Dreamcast Rob I don't think that system's done I just think that right now the way they're they're not doing a lot to basically the thing is they're not doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U that they should buy a Wii U that's my thing is that they need to have some sort of like here's what's coming out soon not yeah we're working on a Smash Bros.
game
Yeah, you know what?
You could have just launched this system and not said anything and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros.
game.
Hell, fuck!
Just say, hey, we're working on an F-Zero game.
That would sell a few more systems.
Rob would buy another system.
There you go.
Hell yeah.
But I want to see the receipts.
You already bought a system, Rob.
I did buy a system.
I'll buy another for F-Zero.
I will.
I need two gamepads.
Two tablet controllers, yeah.
That's right, one for each hand.
Such a consumer whore.
And how.
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, package.
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U.
That's true.
Loki.
This week we've got a couple big games coming out.
The first one being Crysis 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
We've got a PSP title.
Yes, there's actually a PSP game coming out still.
Axis Games putting out visual novels for some reason on the PSP.
Um, Hakuoki, Warriors of Shinsengumi on the PSP.
I want to play that.
And possibly at the end of this week, although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2, the add-on content pack for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
In case you didn't buy the content stuff or pre-order the game or
or your console isn't online which you'll also be missing out on the next gen systems.
I'm planning on picking one of these up because it allows me to install it in multiple systems and I've got two systems that we play on so it's a lot.
Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?
Yes, I'm sure.
It's all on disk.
Alright, then I can move on to Japan.
On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, some price reductions.
The best series for Ace Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z, Ultimate Blast, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Ryuga Gotoku of the End, and Saint Seiya Senkai.
As far as new games go, on February 21st, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance comes out in Japan.
That's pretty awesome.
Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?
Uh, yeah Going into the, it's not new Oh, it's a re-release, okay I was like, what?
Also, how did I miss this?
Mass Effect 3, also on a price reduction this week in Japan Don't you want to play Mass Effect with all Japanese Garrus?
I don't know if they did the voiceovers again, if the subtitles are I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos to see if the voice is nearly as hot It might be subs, it might not be dubs, we don't know
Well, that just looks like the US trailer.
Yeah, it doesn't.
So it's probably just subs.
Oh, well.
Anyhow, let's look at other systems.
How about anything on the Xbox 360?
Price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon.
You have that to look forward to on the 360.
But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think the Wii U's bad here.
Yeah, exactly.
And that's another thing people tend to forget, is that, you know... Oh, well, forget it.
On the Vita, yes, the Vita in Japan, CL No Surge, Ushina Waeta Hoshi Isasagoshi Reincarnation.
Also, Next Rev Shaoshi Shiken comes out.
Both new games on the Vita this week.
Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week.
Did you know that?
I want!
Right?
On the Wii U in Japan this week, there is a game, Tank, Tank, Tank, but we've talked about how that game Tank, Tank, Tank before.
On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Magi, Hajimari no Meikyuu comes out from Bandai Namco.
Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
In the UK we have a few things.
On the 21st we have Metal Gear Solid Rising.
And then on the 22nd there is Crisis 3 and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC.
And I think that's it.
Let me check my calendar.
Because I completely forgot what the last day of the week is.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
We're done.
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki So, we keep hearing a lot about this Xbox Entertainment and this TV initiative that they're doing Well, apparently what they're working on is supposed to be this interactive TV and they're saying similar to how they had the interactive presentations of the Grammys or the Oscars or something like that that it would be some sort of
I would pay for that feature.
Right?
Well, not for... No, if it was like Bieber.
Throwing tomatoes would be funny, though.
It would.
And having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends.
Release the bees on the beaver.
That's right.
Push B for Beyonce.
Or they could have eye tracking or something like that.
Who can stare at Katy Perry's breasts the least?
What?
Go!
Damn it!
Lost!
Or like camera switching.
Like, you know, like during a football game or something.
Enhance!
Enhance!
Enhance!
Yeah, during the Grammys, there's one on the stage and one on, you know, like Chris Brown and Adele fighting.
And then there's another one on Katy Perry's breasts.
And you can just watch that cam the whole time, every time she applauds.
Yes.
Rewind.
Rewind.
Ragenator in chat says, Push A if you want to release the Kraken.
Amazing.
How about just one versus a hundred as a network?
A lot of shows.
Could that be the interactive TV?
Because that would be awesome.
Game shows would rule.
But I'm not going to hold my breath because that's too good.
Right now, I would just like to see whatever it is that they're going to come out with and actually have it functioning without them saying, here's what we're going to do.
Because as far as I'm aware, and I know the new season hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit working with goddamn Game of Thrones.
So why am I supposed to believe that any of this stuff is going to actually work?
With smart glass?
Yeah.
And where's my goddamn interactive map on Android?
How about that smart glass?
How about it?
Smart glass is fucking useless on Android.
I can't, like, do anything with it.
Guess what?
Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you install it on.
It doesn't do anything.
Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?
No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3.
Woohoo!
Smart Glass is the fucking future, everybody.
the directional pad I've already got three fucking ways or connect why do I need like another way I'm sorry you know what Microsoft is Microsoft is the Fox TV of gaming I don't mean Fox News I mean Fox TV because like they announce this big feature and make a pomp and circumstance of it and then they cancel it after two episodes like seriously they put it in the Friday death slot like XNA Firefly right am I right one versus a hundred Wonderfalls am I right
Game Room What other Fox shows?
The Cleveland show, is that still on the air?
That is still on the air, actually.
But Game Room did last a good year or so before they pulled the plug on it.
Running Wild.
What was the show about the town with the lake?
Eureka?
Two episodes or something.
Eureka was on sci-fi.
I only caught a little bit of that.
Actually, now it's NBC, apparently.
would be the network to compare it to.
What was that show with the spies and they had like a house or something?
I don't remember that.
It's like that stupid, I don't know.
The Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a TV show?
No, not Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Yeah, NBC did that one.
Yeah.
That was another J.J.
Or where Jamie gets her name, the Bionic Woman.
That came in with.
Oh my gosh, yeah.
That was an NBC.
Hey, I love the Bionic Woman.
Thank you, Tiger Claw Dollhouse.
Game room is Dollhouse.
Dollhouse.
Hey, thank you.
Give that a second.
Season.
Shadow Next Gen.
They gave that too much.
Game Room got 13 game packs and it had about 100 games well on its way to that thousands of games they promised at CES.
Thousands of games.
Thousands of games in my imagination.
Technist Sarah Connor Chronicles.
You guys are good.
That was actually a decent show.
Would it last like, what, three seasons?
Two seasons?
That's better than, you know, we're talking Firefly level stuff.
It had Shirley Manson in it.
Yeah, I was going to say, anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week.
I'm gay and I still drool over her.
She's hot.
One more story for you guys.
I don't know how to transition into this story because I'm not gay for GameStop, that's for sure.
How about a big burp?
GameStop, power to the players.
GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013.
Supposedly, even though they're closing 250, they're going to open 60 to 70 more.
But that's just, you know, location moving and as neighborhoods build up, there'll be new ones.
And purchased.
40 are coming from UK retailer Game.
So some of those GameStops will be in the UK.
A quote from the CFO, Rob Lloyd, if you care, during the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco, quote, "...closing 250 stores enables us to deal with the very small percentage of stores that we have that are unprofitable, but also to close marginally profitable stores and actually make more money by moving customers to other nearby stores."
We've been successful at that for two years and we'll continue that program in 2013.
Yeah, I think it's because a lot of these they took over like, you know, the EB games and stuff like that in the same mall.
Yeah, or like literally you have like a GameStop and then across the street another GameStop.
They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while.
Ugh, yeah, so, I mean, I think if you, you know, again, if you're in an unprofitable location or a redundant location, then you're probably in trouble, but I imagine most stores will be okay.
But you know, then CNN, or Fox News, since I mentioned them earlier, picks up a story like this and, oh, console gaming is dead, y'all.
console gaming is dead.
GameStop is closing their doors.
They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out that their games that they sell are causing people to become murderers.
See?
It's proof right there.
No, it's mobile phones.
Everybody wants to play Smurf Village.
Haven't you heard?
Mobile phone.
It's Temple Run.
That's gaming.
Smurf Village is just code for terrorism, okay?
See, now I have... The terrorist of one.
Okay, this is the mental image I'm seeing now is the Clicovision Smurfs with, you know, AKs shooting Gargamel in the face.
My childhood has been raped.
Well, all I have to say to this news is LOL bye.
I'm sorry to the people that work there.
I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living, but the corporation itself is kind of terrible.
So I hope that where the ashes land from old GameStops, a new indie retailer will emerge.
One can at least dream.
Hey, playing trade, now is your chance to actually become like GameStop since you think you are anyways.
Don't they have a very similar logo, too?
That's GameTrader.
Yeah, they actually think that they're like a GameStop, and they kind of try to push themselves that way.
They're like, oh, we've got all these stores.
They actually haven't expanded in a long time.
All right, let's take a step back to a simpler time, you guys.
Let's go back to a time where GameStop actually had competition.
Or back when GameStop wasn't even GameStop yet.
Babbage's.
Funkoland, Software Etc.
Back before they were just all swallowed whole by GameStop.
It's the classic game of the week.
DarkSakura, take us back to simpler times.
The game of the week is Sinistar.
Sinistar came out by Williams in 1982 and it was a pretty neat little game.
Kind of, though, for me, I'm not very good at it, but I'll just keep going.
Basically, you are in a spacecraft and you have to create Cinnabons.
Cinnabon?
I love Cinnabon!
I love Cinnabon!
Cinebombs
You have to shoot at planetoids and get the crystals that are released.
And you have to use the bombs to defeat Sinistar, who is this huge spacecraft with a skull face.
And, um, it's constantly under construction as you're going through the game.
So it's sort of like the Death Star, but without being the Death Star.
Yeah, beware, I live.
That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid.
I hunger for Cinnabons!
That does sound pretty awesome.
Wow.
This guy wants his fuckin' Cinnabon.
Wow, so is this like actually CineStar or is this like, you know, recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live?
This is the guy that goes to the airport to get Cinnabon, okay?
Okay, can I get back to the review, please?
So once Sinistar is formed, as we heard, the digitized voice pops up, who's actually a radio personality, John Doremus.
And it's played through an HD 55516 CVSD decoder.
Ooh.
Says, I hunger coward.
And then it tells you run, run, run, but how would you run in space?
Would it just be fly like a little bitch?
I don't know.
Anyway.
So, um, if, uh, basically it just eats you.
All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinebombs to satiate the Sinistar.
He needs that cinnamon sugary goodness.
So you move from zone to zone and keep, you know, beating Sinistar because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker.
So also, you know, of course, the CineStar can be repaired by its little drone fuckers unless you satiate him with tasty CineBombs.
So yeah, there were different ports.
There was the Atari 2600, the 8-bit computers...
They were almost done, but there was the video game crash, and they're like, no.
So we actually got it on the Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for SNES, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC.
It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures on Xbox, GameCube, and PS2, and then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play for the PSP in 2005.
Okay.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
As far as other versions that have come out, there was a pseudo-sequel on the PC in 1999 called Sinistar Unleashed.
It had nothing to do with the original creators, but it was supposed to be a pretty neat little game.
And then Sinistar got re-released for the Midway's Greatest Arcade.
Hits on the Game Boy Advance without the cool features.
There's also a lot of other little... Because, I mean, Sinistar is really just, you know, a big part of classic gaming.
Like in...
There was... I'm trying to see if I can find it.
Yeah, for Team Fortress 2, the heavy weapons guy says, I live and run, cowards.
And then Sinistar is in one of the Dresden Files books.
A group of students at the College of William and Mary did a musical version called Sinistar the Musical.
I have to find this now.
And then they used the voice of Sinistar in an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!
The Abridged Series.
Which is a web series that I've been introduced to.
So yeah, Sinistar.
This sequel.
Beware!
When he wants Cinnabons, he wants over 9,000!
Couldn't help myself.
Let's listen to some of the voice.
Let's listen to some pain.
Oh!
Oh!
You throw those Cinebombs at him.
You go ship.
I need to play this now.
This sounds awesome.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
Beware, I live.
Cinestar.
Available in arcades everywhere.
If you can find them in business.
If you live in 1982.
So it's available in Bobby's Arcade.
Yes.
You had to have caught Bobby's show to get the reference.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
And geez, Ranchan, you're fast on the posting.
He's managing the tumblers very well.
He's managing the tumbler quite well.
Do you want to give a shout out to the OLR Tumbler?
The OLR Tumbler is orangeloungeradio.tumbler.com And while you're at it, look at my Mass Effect one.
Isn't your Mass Effect one more popular than the Orange Lounge Radio one?
Yes.
So you don't need the help.
I'll repost it.
I'll show some promo love.
You'll tumble it?
When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game.
That's not going to happen.
I think for the last episode of OLR that'll happen.
Last episode.
We're not going to have a last episode.
We're going to do this until we're dead.
Well, then there would be a final episode, wouldn't there?
Yeah, but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly.
This is morbid.
I don't like where this is going.
Beware!
I die!
Give me Cinnabons!
Rob ate one too many Cinnabons.
Be dead.
Let's remember with the theme from Mass Effect.
All right.
That does it for the Classic Game of the Week.
I've said that three times now, so I swear we're done with Part A. Don't go anywhere, because this show is so much fun.
We've got plenty more coming in Part B, including the Fugle Question of the Week, a very interesting patent name, something that Sony did, and, oh God, somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news.
Yep, there is news, and yes, it is legit.
Information on Mass Effect.
Coming up after this break, more of Orange Lounge Radio up next.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
In progress, our 493rd episode, February the 17th of 2013.
And if you've never been to Orange Lounge Radio as we are live, you should join us sometime Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where you can hear such live antics as Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break when some quiet music is playing so people can hear what we're saying.
Just barely though.
Oops.
Oh well.
See, at least we weren't talking any smack.
Yeah, it was just more Nino Cooney talk.
Yeah, it was Nino Cooney talk and Rob, coffee.
And birthday cake Oreos.
That's really all you missed.
All right.
There you go.
Actdeft says, it's the Flacco Jones curse taking its course.
Well, if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's going to get, I guess I'll take it.
I'll take that.
That's not so bad.
Unless, like, I was talking smack or something.
Like, I was sitting here going, like, oh, that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight, I can't even.
Just kidding.
Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week.
I played Aliens Colonial Marines.
It's all his fault.
He didn't warn me.
Why, Bobby?
Why?
I would never.
I would never.
All right.
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
Rapid fire news time.
Loki.
Loki.
So EA and Zynga settled their lawsuits over the Ville, which was ripping off Sims Social, and of course we don't know any of the details of what they settled for, but it's settled and that's over.
Boo!
I was hoping for a long, drawn-out fist fight.
I wanted it to be Judge Judy solved.
I wanted it to go to Judge Judy.
I don't know.
Don't sit there and tell me you didn't know what you're doing.
Halo 2 on PC, the multiplayer support has been extended thanks to, you know, begging from fans.
Originally, it was going to be cutting the servers off on, was it a...
February 15th, but apparently now it's been extended to June and they're investigating further options to support the fans of the Halo 2 on PC.
So that's good.
That's good news for the dozens and dozens of people still playing Halo 2 on PC.
Hey, who do you think has more?
More people playing Halo 2 on PC or more people that listens to OLR?
What do you think?
OLR.
Really?
I was going to go for Halo.
Actually, yeah, I mean, with all, you know, all kidding aside, Halo 2, I mean, it's the only place you can play it since, you know, they shut down the Xbox 360, or excuse me, Xbox regular one because of 360 infrastructure that they never really followed through on.
Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than 100 people on our friends list?
Oops.
Oops.
And then finally, Sniper Elite has a brand new game in their franchise, and going the route of most other game franchises out there, they've decided to add zombies.
So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is going to be coming out exclusively on PC.
It'll be out on Steam for $15, and that's at the end of this month on the 28th.
and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite, it's a World War II sniper game.
In the second Sniper Elite game, you actually got to shoot the balls off of Hitler if you wanted to.
They even had the cool Mortal Kombat x-ray mode thing where you could see the testicles explode.
Oh, that's so lovely.
Thank you for that.
And in case you didn't get that game, they actually are re-releasing the Sniper Elite V2 with the Kill Hitler...
DLC in there, which it should really be teamed up with Danger 5, you know, because their mission is to kill Hitler.
Orange Lounge Radio is apparently the show this week where people can hear about exploding Hitler's balls.
I thought I only had one.
Anyhow.
Is that it?
Please be it.
That's it.
Okay, that's it.
Let's move on to something a lot less offensive.
It is Bit.Trip, the Bit.Trip series.
Bit.Trip soundtracks for $20.
And when you pre-order with that $20, the Bit.Trip Runner 2 Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, you will get six Bit.Trip soundtracks for free.
Although they're not really free because you're paying $20 for it.
But pretty cool, you know, if you are a fan of Bit.Trip Runner.
So in other words, if you're not Bobby...
I was going to say, is that like kind of how they try to sell you two pieces of crap on TV and really the whole trick is just to get you to pay twice as much for more than one that you need?
The trick is to get you to pre-order a bit, trip around or two and boost its numbers.
But the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good.
If you like the 8-bit music and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff, you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks.
In fact, I imagine most of you have acquired the soundtracks if you're a fan of the series.
But wouldn't it be nice to get them legally?
And you can do that here for $20.
Pre-ordered.
Let's see.
Also, I guess apparently you can get some of the soundtracks for $1, and then $10 you get the Runner 2 soundtrack as well.
Well, look at that.
Good times.
There is a game coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive version of said game.
It's Need for Speed Most Wanted.
This game came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 last year, but it's coming out on the Wii this year.
and it's going to have some new stuff in it such as the whole you can actually have the off TV mode on the gamepad but then there's something about on the gamepad you can actually help somebody that's playing on the big screen you can guide them you can help them or you can either hinder them they're calling it a co-driver father and son mode is something that they've called it amongst the Criterion developers you can literally have a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your shit up on that gamepad
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'll be taking over.
Into the wall.
There you go.
So let me see a quote from Alexander Ward, creative director.
Quote,
You know, when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Wii U, I got the impression that you were going to have two people playing at the same time.
One on the gamepad, one on the TV.
I think you can do that.
That sounded a lot better.
I think you can do that, too.
Oh, good.
I think this is another mode.
They should really have it just like passenger mode, where your gamepad is like the side window, and you can roll it up and down, and that's it, and the wind blows in your face, and that's all you can really do, is just look out the window and roll the window up and down.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Dan, coffee!
And every time we drove by a Starbucks, which when you're on Highway 99 is every five miles, Dan, coffee!
So Rob, where's your phone?
Finally, shut up.
So finally, finally we get to a Starbucks.
We're like halfway to Disneyland.
We finally pull over at a Starbucks and she gets her coffee and I proceed to leave my cell phone in the sandwich shop except, oh, it was actually in my back pocket the whole time.
Now you know when knowing is half the battle.
Aren't you glad she asked me to tell that story?
I didn't ask you to tell the story.
It's just that people don't get it.
So I could delay this news.
The 3DS has become the best gaming machine out there is a attention-grabbing headline that was run on Kotaku this week.
Wait, how many articles do they write about hating Aliens Colonial Marines?
I can't remember.
Was it in the double digits?
Because I think it was.
I honestly I was this story was something that was shared with us in the show role thread by somebody else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview with somebody but no it actually is just a whole story written about hey the 3D remember when the 3DS was fucked and now look at all this stuff it's just basically regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News that had already been run but now under the guise of this is why the 3DS is the best fucking game system
Considering that they're talking handheld game system, there's really only a couple to choose from, one of them being the 3DS and one of them being the Vita.
No one's really going to make the argument that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system out there.
I'm tapping my finger.
Do I want to go there?
Do I want to go behind door number four on OLR?
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
No.
Unless it has reach around, then it's shit.
I have another rant brewing.
Do I want to go there?
Do it, Rob.
Do it.
Do it.
Drama.
Let's go there.
This website is such shit.
Why does everybody keep reading it?
Here I am talking about it, and it's going to be more people checking it.
I fucking can't why do we keep bringing this fucking shitty website up all of the time and why does their attention grabbing antics work all of the time I can't anymore I do not want any stories from this website ever again on our show we are better than this done banned I'm serious do not link this website ever again for a new story there are better places on the internet to get your gaming news
They just grab all the stories from other people anyway.
Just go to the site, click the link that they got, and then use that one.
I am taking a stand here.
I am not giving these fuckers hits anymore.
It is ridiculous.
Rob.
Yes.
Coffee.
I think I might need another cup.
How about some more news stories, DarkSakura?
Sega!
Yay, I love you, Sega.
Sega has a line of PCs.
It's called the Sega Note PC Laptop.
And they have different styles.
There's the generic Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn, and the Dreamcast.
And they're anywhere between $1,000 to $2,100.
And they'll come with the 64-bit version of Windows 8, a 1920x1080 display, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and a Pentium 2020M processor.
So, yeah, and it will be obsolete in five seconds.
Moving on.
How about some Square?
Square actually registered Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain domains.
So maybe we're going to see some re-releases or reboots, but there's Wolfensteinspiel.com and WarFornosGoth.com So, who knows?
I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game.
I hope it's done in Wolfenstein 3D fashion.
The 3D ones never were very good.
I love the little sound they make.
Like, with the digitized voices.
What?
I'm just remembering.
You know that that game, actually, when they did the re-releases with that one, it's actually, like, banned in Switzerland.
Tina Turner cannot play Wolfenstein now in her new home country.
I love that woman.
I'm sure she's crushed.
And then, last but not least, you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been trying to ignore because Axl Rose pretty much has been?
Well, yeah, it got thrown out of fraud court, so not a big deal anymore.
Axl sucks.
It's all good.
He's attached to what?
That new BandFuse game that's coming out.
You know, BandFuse, the one that's going to try to do the same thing that what PowerGig tried to do.
You remember PowerGig, right?
I do remember PowerGig.
Yes, yes.
So BandFuse, the new Mastiff music game is going to be coming out.
It's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing.
But I think the difference with this one was it's real guitar and you can sing.
That's really it.
You know what?
You could do that with Beatles Rock Band.
Well, that's not a real guitar, though.
No, but no one cares.
But it's also probably going to sell immensely more than band fees.
Was that it?
That was...
I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit.
I was chatting with chatter.
I was participating.
Think of another one.
My extended hate boner was spewing into the chat room.
Your hate boner.
Tonight's show has been brought to you by the words hate and boner.
When you hear the words hate boner used in tandem, be sure to make a special noise.
Let's go to a segment that never makes us make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners have to say in the Google Question of the Week.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus community.
You can participate with a question that we ask of our fan communities each week on the program.
Starting off with this week's question.
It was announced today that the new game Destiny will require a persistent internet connection.
On previous episodes, OLR and Bobby have talked about other games that require an always online internet connection, such as Diablo 3 and the new SimCity.
It's the MMO!
New SimCity, we're not so forgiving though.
But Destiny kind of falls in that weird kind of middle part where it's like, well, clearly online is a big component of it, but you're going to have to always be connected.
So I was curious if our listeners kind of gave it a pass or no.
We only had one response on Google+, so I'll read that.
From Redertainment, the one guy still using Google+.
We need a high-profile game with a wide and vocal audience to have an always-on internet connection mandate.
That way, when some part of it fails, leaving people unable to play the game they paid money for, the general public will rage out about it.
When the public rages out about it, assuming these companies actually give a shit about what the public wants, these companies will finally see... Ooh, now it's going into FU music.
How appropriate.
These companies will finally see what a mistake the always-on internet connection mandate is.
Redertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to introduce you to a game called Diablo 3.
This actually happened.
You couldn't log in to Diablo 3 for like a week.
Or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off after like an hour and...
Speaking of hate boner, the internet really had a big one for Diablo 3 because of the always online.
Because you might remember Diablo 2, you could play LAN and you could play offline.
There's actually a game that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny that's going to be similar to this.
SimCity.
Well, yeah, SimCity.
I'm talking about more along the lines of Destiny.
Like if an online first-person shooter game that's kind of like an MMO type thing.
Defiance from Trion Games.
That's going to be coming out in April and it's online only.
Isn't Trion an MMO company?
They are an MMO company.
However, this is a game that it's buy-to-play type thing.
And it's on consoles.
It's on PC and PS3, Xbox 360.
So...
This is something similar to that, obviously not as grand as Destiny.
But I see this actually has an online port.
Once again, it was very vague on everything.
Why is it that we need this port?
Online world and stuff.
Are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth?
Are we going to have battles and stuff like that?
Is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into?
Or is it just like, oh, well, I need to see my friend just cleared this spot so now the enemies are easier here or something.
I don't know.
I don't really know what they're doing.
But it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there versus SimCity where you just interact with your friend's towns or cities that they make.
Diablo 3, despite everybody raging on it and everything, still sold, what, 11 million?
I don't think that's going to tell them, oh, I got the message, no more Always Online.
Yeah, right?
Well, and if that were the case, we wouldn't be seeing it now like a fucking trend, right?
Like Destiny, SimCity, the game Loki just talked about and all these other things.
Yeah.
All right.
I just got a text message from the person that linked me that story originally that I blew up at.
I'll just say it's Jason.
He doesn't mind me saying that, I'm sure.
He says, in their defense, it was an opinion piece, not news.
But LOL, I was the straw that broke the camel's back.
I was just like, congratulations.
You are the catalyst.
Let me just put it this way.
This is a website.
Rob chose the red ending.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We're not going back down this road.
No.
Close the door.
Lock it.
Done.
All right.
Moving on.
All right.
What do you want to do?
One sentence.
I just want to say Gawker figured out animated GIFs a couple months ago, and they've been running with it ever since.
You know the GIF format has been on the internet since like the early 90s, right?
I understand that, but now they literally have posts.
They're like, hey, look at this.
These are some animated GIFs I made based off of, you know, this trailer just came out.
You know, I think it's funny that GIF is still associated with CompuSurf.
So they got a Tumblr account or started reading Oh No They Didn't because those are the things I associate with the animated GIF.
I get my best animated GIFs ever from Oh No They Didn't, which is a LiveJournal community and pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal.
That and Russian Meteorite sightings.
Anyhow.
Fugl, hello, always online connections, and some of our answers from Facebook, which really had a lot of answers on it, so I can't read them all, so please visit our Facebook community and read them all in their entirety, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
Fabrice A. says, very annoying, and they are punishing the wrong people.
Some people have a crappy internet connection, or even no internet connection at all, so they can hardly play.
People who bought the game legally and suffer one of the previous problems can't play, and
People who play illegally don't have any of those problems because the DRM is absent.
FlamingToilet says, I would think that the fiasco with PSN going down for two months a couple years ago would have taught game makers that requiring an always-on internet connection is a very bad idea.
But they're always going to think it's never going to happen to us.
How many games were unplayable or almost unplayable during that time because there was no network to connect to?
thank you Flaming Toilet for reminding us never forget PlayStation Network fucking went down like it ate shit literal shit for two months horrible
Cell Agent Why Not says, we're sorry, your game is not available at this time.
Please hang up and try again.
Lulz.
You remember that crap that actually happened with me in Mass Effect 3?
When they were having the origin issues?
Yes.
And I couldn't connect, but I also couldn't play my single player game because it wouldn't verify my DLC.
Right.
Christopher K. replies and says...
DarkSakura.com
A good point that this indirectly brings up is that we've heard about Destiny's 10-year plan and so forth.
What happens after 10 years?
What happens when they want to pull the servers and so forth?
Where's that $60 investment in the game I made?
And I heard...
Damn, I wish I could remember where I heard about this, but I remember hearing about one of the reasons why $60 games and people are willing to pay that $60 price is the equity that you're getting in those games.
The fact that you can turn around and sell those games for a value later.
And when you talk about robbing people of the ability to sell used games...
There's now no equity and there's nothing worth investing $60 in.
But if you were going to turn off used games and then have it be $30, maybe that wouldn't feel like such a blow because the games overall are cheaper.
And this could actually be a great thing for everybody if the games are really cheap.
I still think $30 or $40 might be too much.
My point is, though, I can still plug in an Atari 2600 and appreciate the games I grew up on.
Let's say, for whatever reason, Destiny is a game that Flacco gets his kids to start playing, which I doubt, but just humor me for a minute here.
What if they want to revisit that game in their 30s and they can't because the 10 years is up, the servers are down, the plug's been pulled?
What now?
That's really sad.
It's sad.
It's sad.
well and a lot of there are games that are like that a lot of these games that were online only or something like that I mean they're just completely useless now like I don't know I can't think of anything that you would have but yeah I mean they pull servers all the time so it's very possible I mean I'm sure there's some MMOs especially some of these Sony MMOs that went offline I'm not I know there's a few that we mentioned before like even like PlayStation 2 games and stuff like that but
and even big MMOs go down.
Say if you bought a boxed copy of The Matrix Online or something like that.
You can never play Tabula Rasa.
Yeah?
You can never play it.
Star Wars Galaxies.
Yeah, that's right.
You will never experience the pre-New Galaxy experience, or the post, for that matter, ever again in your life.
I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon.
Right?
Because it's gonna get killed, right?
The WoW killer is coming out, Flaco.
The WoW killer.
Elder Scrolls Online, it's the WoW killer, Flaco.
Now Destiny's the WoW killer.
I keep seeing that in the chat all night.
They're both killing WoW.
Miss Scarlet killed Wow in the conservatory with a lead pipe.
Hate boner.
Back to Fugl Burr replied and said In the case of Destiny, it appears to be justified by what they're trying to do with the gameplay which at least makes me a little more understanding about it However, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?
Get out of our head I feel like always on DRM is a decision made by focusing too much on the short term If this trend continues, future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history when servers inevitably retire or entire publishers go bankrupt I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant but it fits right in, doesn't it?
RedTheHaze says, no problem with me if it's required by multiplayer, but if single player requires it, I might not get it.
Not everyone has internet, and the US is far from number one when it comes to internet.
Gary B replies and says, makes the decision about buying a game a no-brainer.
No offline mode, no purchase.
Where I live, I have two options for internet dial-up, which is slow and terrible, or satellite, which is expensive and terrible.
So whenever I hear that a game is always online, I just stop caring.
I wanted to see if I could Facebook stalk this guy and figure out where he lived, but he has his thing locked down.
Is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?
Let's be fair, even some of these always online games where it's a persistent world and stuff, here's the other thing that turns me off about that stuff.
I don't have a lot of time to play games sometimes.
Or I will go play an online game for a while and then not come back to it for a long time.
Like Final Fantasy XI, which I played all of twice when I bought it the last time.
Um, but the same thing is like, I don't know if this is going to be something like I got to keep logging in or else, you know, I'll get behind in some sort of quest or whatever the fuck is going on.
You know, it might also be something that kind of turns me off to it because like, you know, I don't have the time to dedicate to like an MMO or something like that.
Last comment I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our Facebook to read them all.
Facebook.com slash Orange Sounds Radio.
JLinks says, Being a connoisseur of mainly MMOs and FPSs, I'm used to games with required internet connections to play.
This falls more into a to-each-their-own niche to me.
While I could play FPSs offline in single player, I didn't make that the main reason I bought the game.
If the game's good and I have the methods available to play it, I'll buy it.
Simple as that.
That's our comments from Facebook and Google+.
Thank you guys who all responded.
Sorry I didn't read everybody's, but it's only a three-hour show.
Let's get to a few more news stories and pretty soon Skype calls.
Loki.
I swear to God that Sony is trolling us because there is no way that, like, I just can't believe that they would actually do this.
But apparently there is a patent that they have
And I know this is going to come as a shock to you guys.
They actually have a tablet that they have patented.
And I need to check this out right now to see what it's called.
But they're calling it the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.
There is no way that that is called the iPad.
That's a European patent thing that they're showing me here.
It doesn't really help me very much.
17 pages.
Let's see, 17 pages.
I think it looks like it's made out of, like, particle board or something like that.
This is weird.
But basically, it's a tablet device.
Looks thin.
It's got, looks like a directional pad, you know, face buttons, possibly a speaker, and one analog stick.
Shame on you, Sony.
Have you not learned from the PSP one analog stick?
That's more than the iPad's got.
Well, still, though, I mean.
I like how the big square sharp corner design reminds me of the NES.
Will I be able to install MAME on this?
I don't know.
So they don't really say... I want to make sure that it's actually called the iPad or not.
I had heard that name too, for what it's worth.
I think that someone's making that up.
I don't honestly think that they would do that.
Oh my god, no, they actually have it called the iPad.
It makes sense, the PlayStation 9, but again, take it with a jar of salt.
It was the iToy.
A gallon of salt.
No, no, it's in their patent information.
They refer to it as the iPad, like E-Y-E-Pad.
That's a patent, that's a lawsuit right there.
Holy fuckballs, really?
I-Toy
That's true.
I understand why they're using the iPad and the PlayStation 9 and all that stuff.
It makes sense to me.
However, Apple's going to go, no, fuck you.
You can't call it the iPad.
Apple, this really is a whole come at me, bro, move at Apple.
But again, huge salts.
You know, I don't know.
It seems unnecessary to have both this and the little thingy built into the controller.
I don't understand.
Well, here's some of the stuff.
Let me just read some of the cool things that they're saying that this thing has.
They're saying that it's going to have stereoscopic cameras on it.
So you're going to be able to, I guess, record 3D or something like that.
Kind of like the 3DS.
Yeah.
They're saying that there's some sort of weird prism thing going on with their touchpad and stuff.
It's going to have six axis built into it.
At least that's what they're... I mean, everything has six axis built into it.
So I guess we'll have to hear more about it if this is going to be part of the PlayStation 4.
Is this story coming from my favorite website?
Because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit.
No, it's a
The Maybe Patent
We don't know if it's real, right?
Is it coming from the official patent website?
Or is it... Do they have a link there or something?
Well, they've got it from... It's actually linked from... Or it's embedded from the European patent applications.
Eh, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it.
It's true, but... It also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games.
I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily a tie-in to the PlayStation 4.
Let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit, so why would they not maybe want to come up with a hybrid PlayStation tablet?
Well, they're saying, like, here's one of the things, is therefore, in addition to the convenient joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis controller provides the PS3 with data and all that stuff.
Now they're talking about PS3 a little bit.
I don't know.
We'll see.
It's just...
It seems a little weird, but they could do it, I guess.
I mean, they tried to put out some PlayStation-branded tablets that all looked really weird, but who knows?
We'll see.
Maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday.
It's right around the corner.
Yeah, I think they're just covering their bases, like all these patent applications.
iPad, I mean, really?
They're not really going to release it.
Just call it like the PlayStation tablet or something like that, you know?
Something, Sony PlayStation tablet, not iPad.
Calm down, it's the name and a patent, it's not the final name.
Just call it a thingy and be done with it.
That's right.
Anyhow, one other rumor going around about new consoles that just won't die is the fact that used games are not going to be playable on it.
And you can bet that Electronic Arts EA is just cheering about this.
After all, they're the ones that started the online pass shit, aren't they?
Well, anyhow, the chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen, had a talk with Gamasutra, and Gamasutra asked him about the whole used games and these rumors.
In response, quote,
I hate this word.
Liquidity.
Thanks for watching!
Could this be a sign of things to come if EA is openly, or at least one of their executives is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad thing?
Or are they just setting this up for when the banhammer comes down on this pretty soon with the used games?
Any thoughts on EA's comments, Loki?
DarkSakura, do you have anything?
I think they're already making their money on used games with the whole online passes.
I mean, I think they were touting before that they made a ton of money on online passes.
So to them, that's just money in their pockets, I guess.
I was actually going to say something along similar lines.
I mean, they've found a way to keep making a profit on it.
And that is a really, you know...
With a lot of cases in the used market, the people who are getting rid of their used games are trying to get the new mechs better.
We've even traded in some of our games, some of our crappy ones, to get new games.
Especially, it's even better for EA, as an example, if someone trades in one of their competitor's games to get one of theirs.
That whole liquid market thing is pretty...
That's pretty accurate.
And also considering that EA is also one of these companies that puts out yearly releases of their sports games, and they probably know that people aren't going to want to hold on to their copy of Madden 13 or something like that.
Madden 25, the dumbest new... What are they thinking there?
Okay, we're going to go 13 to 25, and then next year it's going to be 15, and then in a few years we're going to have 25 again.
If it's the 25th year, I get it.
It's not...
Call it like Madden 25th anniversary, not Madden 25.
It's stupid.
Anyways, that's not the point.
The point is that they release games each year and that they know that people are going to need to trade these in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them because they're essentially useless after...
E.A.
is kind of full of dicks right now
Here was the rest of the quote.
Um, what?
I do believe the consumer likes it.
Um, didn't I just read some foogle answers that didn't seem to go that direction?
They like the always-on connectivity?
And they've done some polls on certain websites that basically have said the same thing.
In fact, actually, GameStop did a poll.
Was it over 60% of people that use GameStop or whatever don't like...
Not having to use games.
This worries me when that sentence comes out of a game maker's mouth, is how out of touch are you?
See, people in the boardroom think they know what we want, but clearly they don't.
But by telling us in an interview, this is what gamers want, then the more gullible will run with it and the CNNs will say, oh, well, these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers want, according to Electronics Art.
Why don't you try talking to a gamer?
Well, and see, that's the thing.
They have a habit of trying to manipulate the data that they find to suit their own purposes.
Anything can be changed.
And they have to get an unbiased source if they're going to have accurate information.
But all they want is for people to tell them the same things that's going to support the outcome that they look for.
The legend of Zaku in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com gives a Homer Simpson quote.
Facts are meaningless.
You can create facts for something that is remotely true.
Interesting note to end that on.
Let's move on, DarkSakura.
Well, how about something else EA's managed to fuck up?
I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?
Okay, EA come close to really royally fucking up the Mass Effect series.
And yes, we warned you, there is Mass Effect news.
BioWare is basically saying don't call it Mass Effect 4 because it's implying that it is another addition to the trilogy.
They're saying that basically the trilogy is over, this is another game in the universe.
And the comparison here is, and I'll read the quote from Priestley.
It says...
Mass Effect 4 Modern Warfare
I have no idea.
But they are talking about it's being in development with Bioware Montreal and that's the same office that of course gave us this superb multiplayer.
And Mass Effect 2, which is the crown.
The thing that would make me happy about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them production timeline and actually put out a good quality product with great writing the way that Mass Effect 2 was.
That would just completely tickle me to no end.
Of course I'm going to play it.
Sadly, that won't happen.
I know, right?
That's so sad.
The problem is that, yeah, I'm an addict.
I'll still play it.
I love the universe.
Even with the pieces of shit that are involved in Mass Effect 3...
I still play the game.
I've probably played it more than two just because I like how it plays better.
If it keeps using the newer incarnations of the Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.
As long as it's fun to play and I get more lore, I'm happy.
The multiplayer is so good, too.
It is.
We should play again, but you don't play on PC anymore, and that makes me sad.
I kind of do mix and match now.
Well, then come play online with me.
Meh.
So anyways, there's yet another rumor going along with the PlayStation 4, Orbis, whatever you're going to call it.
So that is coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that because they purchased Gaikai, they're going to be using that streaming service to stream PlayStation 3 games to the new PlayStation.
Basically saying that there's not going to be really any backwards compatibility with the old system, which makes sense.
I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility and
A lot of it is being offered as downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.
Basically saying that this is also going to coincide with physical releases for PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.
I can see this as an evolution of that whole PlayStation Plus game library thing, because right now you have to download and install everything, which takes fucking forever.
Whereas this, you could be just like, okay, I want to play Saints Row 2.
Go and then just load it up and stream it.
The hour-long game trials too.
Like you have to actually download the entire game to play for an hour and then just delete it.
So once again, we'll see you.
I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.
They spent so much money on that, obviously it's going to be integrated somehow.
I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week too.
That seems something obvious that they could talk about.
They could almost do that with the PlayStation 3.
I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that is PlayStation 4.
I think that they could do this, hey, you guys, you know how you have that online game library right now?
Well, guess what?
We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff instantly.
It makes sense because part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2 inside of it as well so it could run all the games.
And then when they started cutting that out and getting the price down, that disappeared.
So maybe they're trying to not wow us with a $599 US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4, probably more like $499.
but uh you know it's not gonna be don't expect it to be that that low but uh this is one way they'll they'll be able to save some money on the console and maybe not have it be so expensive is that they're gonna use the streaming technology to emulate some of the older games I hope though that it's just an option that you can also like okay you can stream it or you can download it because once again if you know their service goes to shit then that's gonna suck not being able to play your game because you can't stream it anymore you know
I would assume that you'd be able to download it as well.
I hope that you could do that.
ShadowNextGen with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com PlayStation Network is in no way good enough to do streaming gameplay like that.
Even with Gaikai, is PlayStation Network ready for that kind of bandwidth?
It's a fair question.
Let's put it this way, though.
We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with some of the demos with FIFA and stuff like that through a web browser and stuff.
I think they could probably handle it.
Is it going to look good, though, coming through your bandwidth?
You know, like, through your internet connections?
Is it going to look all fucking pixelated and shit?
I don't know.
That's... We'll just have to see, I guess.
Alright, kind of a follow-up story of sorts.
You remember when we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan and how it's going to this free-to-play model on the Wii U?
That hasn't arrived in America yet, but guess what?
It's going to happen in Europe as well.
Europe will be the next region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.
The base download will have Monster Battle, Free For All, and Team Versus, and you can play them up to three times.
The first add-on is My Kong, which will cost €1.99 in Euros through February 28th.
Interesting.
I want to fight the bees.
I hear the game's not very good, but I mean, it's a fun arcade game.
As much as I love the game, I really don't see it translating well.
Everyone has the things.
I think the free-to-play model is certainly interesting.
Anybody interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?
Do you think they will roll this out to the States next?
Anybody?
They'd have to, I think.
I think that they'll eventually roll it out to the States.
I'd be interested to see the... I guess I'm a little bit...
Namco has tried doing this whole free-to-play type approach for some of their games.
It didn't work out so well with Ridge Racer on the Vita.
Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.
That was pay $30, $40 and get nothing.
Get a demo and then buy extra crap for it.
So that kind of sucked, but we'll see.
$2 is not that bad for an add-on.
Let's go to the mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here on the show.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com where you can send us emails every week.
We have one email this week and I'll go ahead and read it.
It just came in like an hour ago.
I'll go ahead and read it.
No biggie.
It's a gem of an email so I want to read this through.
Alright, it's from RawSteelUT.
Alright, here we go.
Hey, OLR!
First off, it seems like you guys have joined the rest of the media in spending time on every next-gen rumor that comes down the pike, no matter how hilarious or ill-thought.
It's been proven that the mainstream games media can be easily fooled into believing anything, as has been shown by various angry formites and Tumblr people all over the years.
And while I know that the blogs will go after anything that gets clicks, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?
In what way does panic-mongering help the show?
It's clearly not bringing in the page hits.
Clearly it's not.
How rude.
But you're here.
That's what counts.
Have you guys ever thought of vetting these rumors?
Trying to sift the possibly legitimate things from the blatant and senseless bullshit?
Well, I am glad that you asked that question because that is a great... We should go vet those rumors.
In fact, let me place a call to Sony right now and ask that question.
I know, right?
Let me just... Let me get them on the line and see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4 rumors because you know...
As you mentioned before, it isn't going any distance in getting us hits at all that, you know, sites like, I don't know, the ESA when measuring E3 doesn't even want to take a second look at independent podcasts and all that stuff.
Clearly, these guys are on my speed dial and I can vet this shit till the cows come home.
I was just talking... Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.
I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, we were chilling.
Absolutely.
We'll get some fro-yo afterward.
I got photos of my Dan and you, Suzuki.
Which is actually true, I do.
Let me put a little reminder out there about what this show is all about, alright?
In case you forgot.
This show started because we all played DDR at the arcades and after DDR we would go and we would go to the restaurant that was down the street and we would sit around over, you know, food that was bad for us like mozzarella sticks and so forth.
Fried cheese.
God, they're so fucking good, huh?
And we would talk smack about what's going on in games.
And you know what happens a lot of times when people are talking smack?
They're talking about the rumors and things that go around in the industry.
I can't think of a time when we've said this stuff on air and said, this is fact, people.
Believe this, people.
I think we like to bring these ideas up and say, this is a rumor.
Take it with a grain of salt, like I think we just said about that iPad thing.
or ask people what they think about it.
What's wrong with discussion?
What is wrong with discussing and talking about ideas?
Because some rumors do pan out to be true.
So why not talk about what goes through the heads of these people that don't really want to be so ready to talk about these things?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Such as we just talked a little bit about Destiny and the fact that it requires an always online connection.
That is fact, not rumor.
They said that today.
But that's something that's going to impact the game industry.
The whole fact about used games being banned on the new consoles, that's a rumor, yes.
But I think all of us sit here and go...
Do you think, can you sit there and you honestly think to yourself that in no boardroom ever has it been said by a senior executive we should lock out new games on the new console.
Use games.
Is that what I said?
He said lock out new games.
Lock out the new ones so then we have to do an even newer system and have to charge them.
The online pass idea came from somewhere.
Rumors are often founded in fact.
I just don't think this was a very well thought out email, honestly.
But the biggest thing too is that I actually like looking at the rumors and the speculation and keeping track of it so I can see what legitimately happens when something comes out to see who was right, who was on the right track.
Was our technology really in a place where we had this capability?
For me, it's actually a gauge of how ambitious consumer level technology is.
I think it's neat.
BlackWolfInChat says, I'm not a journalist.
I'm a commentator.
I don't actually have the resources to be a real journalist.
Well, what is a real journalist anyway?
Because some things that get away with being real journalism are a little bit laughable.
But anyway, I do like that comparison.
I'm not a games journalist either, really.
I actually think more than anything I'm a games analyst.
I will analyze the shit out of your game.
I say that with a straight face too.
I'm a games analyst.
A lot of you are games analysts too.
You really are.
Some people are just anal.
We've been sitting here talking about games for 11 years and there's some other guys that go out there and are in every story and being interviewed with the games analyst title.
But you know what?
They get about as much stuff right as we do.
and about as much wrong as we do.
It's way too early to say something like that.
A year from now, maybe.
But this is Nintendo we're talking about.
Come on.
It's one thing to bring up rumor without having anything to substantiate it.
It's completely different if you actually have items that are going to back it up.
Like, okay, for example, let's say that it's a year from now and Nintendo has continued to have dismal sales and we're starting to see extreme price reductions on the Wii U and
and we're starting to see the 3DS game sales drop, then at that point it might be safe to speculate that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.
But right now, like you said, no, it's completely different just to completely sensationalize something and try to get people to back you up by being even more sensational about it as opposed to stating, well, this is what's being said, this is what we've seen, make your own decision.
There's people out there that will just read anything and believe it immediately.
It's just like, you know, you'll see commenters on news stories where they're talking about a rumor like, that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.
It's like, if that's true, then I'm not buying an Xbox.
Or, you know, if that's true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.
It's like, oh, this is absolute fact because it's coming to me from...
You know, this gaming blog that I trust their information, so therefore it is, you know, I am not going to buy this console.
These are the people that are fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind eight times.
These are the ones that, you know, fucking start a petition or, you know, join a group that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game.
And then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.
I mean...
Whatever.
But, yeah, I think I know for a fact that, and this comes from just my line of work, that I don't deal in guarantees.
I know that.
I'm always leaving myself a way out, and there's no way that I'm saying anything is absolute fact unless I actually see it.
Now, RossDLUT is in chat right now and says, makes a note that I'm now hated.
I didn't say I hated you.
No one said we hated you.
No.
But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors?
In what way does panic mongering help the show?
I just thought I would express why we spend time on nonsense rumors.
I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme of a viewpoint.
It's not like we're sitting here going, Ah!
Soldier Nintendo!
Oh my god!
I could hear once.
Plus, if the site gets more hits, I might lose VOG the game.
That's what it's really about, isn't it?
That's what I care about.
All right, let's get to the other half of the email, which is a question I think is a little more up our alley.
Secondly, Aliens Colonel Marines has been released after seven years development, and the consensus seems to be that it's a hot mess.
Now this is the type of email I like to get.
It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem Forever, the game had a protracted crap ton of development houses working on it.
My question here is this.
At what point are there too many hands in the pot and when should a project just be cancelled?
In my view, anything past three years and two development houses is asking for disaster.
It's all about contracts you sign.
Cooks in the soup.
And what you're going to be responsible for if you don't come through with the product you promised whoever paid you money to come through with.
Duke Nukem Forever was canceled at one point, was it not?
Like when the company went out of business and Gearbox essentially just bought what was left over from it.
Like Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.
But they kind of, you know, picked up the ashes and released what they did for better or for worse, right?
Mm-hmm.
So, hmm.
It's a question with a lot of gray area, because it's not like you can draw a line and say, you know, like you did three years and two development houses.
Well, that doesn't necessarily take everything into effect, because I think a game like Smash Bros., I think had more... Didn't the one on the Wii take more than three years to develop?
I think it did.
Didn't it take...
more like four you know and it came out okay the game was pretty good it's one of the better Wii titles you know it worked out yeah so you know I don't think you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long how long has Bioshock Infinite been right right delayed by years
or maybe, you know, how long has The Last Guardian been in the film?
Well, that's never going to come out.
How about Final Fantasy Versus XIII?
Yeah, there's a great example, huh?
Yeah, but the Agito XIII came out as zero.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
done, cancelled, money pulled that's what happens, that's part of the ebb and flow of it, so, you know, if there's enough development and things to show every few months, the game keeps going but if it stops, the game is done
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And the bugs that the internet are talking about are nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Saints Row.
I mean, that's child's play.
Those games have bugs down to a fine art.
Anyway, have a good show, guys.
Ross Steel, UT.
We're having a great show.
It's great.
Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com if you want to help us be a great show, too.
Let's get to the FUs of the week.
The self-entitled wads of fuck that drive in the parking lot at Whole Foods.
I don't care how expensive your damn car is or how much gas it guzzles or how organic you fucking eat.
Learn to fucking drive!
what a great place to find assholes I know you find assholes of all varieties and not just inside the shopping place another one goes to god I forgot what it was oh yeah, goes to Origin and the Mass Effect 3 update that just happened because I want my console back bitches, however I once again got Flycam working and
I think being sick, because my son just drives home every single illness like a fisherman's net for illness.
So that kind of sucks.
Don't you think that's what children do?
That's their revenge?
Revenge for what?
Discipline.
I don't know.
So I guess F you to that and F you to having to move my desk upstairs because for some dumb reason management thought it was a great idea to fucking flip the building upside down and so they have everybody from the third floor moving to the second floor and everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit I gotta move because I store all sorts of weird shit at my desk like arcade parts.
I have an MP5 and a System 573 board for Dance Maniac's second mix, a coin box, and a Neo Geo arcade board at my desk.
Among a bunch of figurines, I have a Gundam collection, I have anime stuff up on my shelves, and I have a what I consider life-size papercraft model of a Koopa.
and I have a chicken that has an Elebit riding on top of it.
That's right.
I have a chicken with an Elebit riding on top.
Does anyone fucking remember Elebits?
Hello?
Konami?
Let's make another Elebits game.
Wako, go ahead.
Uh, gosh, I was talking about this with my wife, and I was like, you know what, F you to the podcast app on iPod, iPhone, which is pretty old, but I finally updated my iPod, even though I heard that it was terrible.
And I was really mad because I couldn't scan through the show to find, like, every time I plug it into my car, it would reset back at the start, and I hated that.
But before, I could always just, uh, you know, like, kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at.
But I couldn't do that, and I couldn't figure it out.
and two seconds later she finds out how to do it.
You swipe the little logo for the show up and then there's a deal in there and you shuttle it out.
I feel so stupid, but... The podcast app is terrible.
It's still terrible, so still F you the podcast app.
Honestly, you Stitcher to listen to the show.
Sorry, but it's... You gotta stream Stitcher, don't you?
Yeah, yeah.
I gotta download because I listen to the card.
Actually, I think Stitcher will now let you download.
I want to say that's something they added to because a lot of podcasters were complaining about that.
I think they added that.
I'll check that out.
Yeah, I listen in the car, so I can't stream.
I have to.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
All right.
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't have tomorrow off, unlike a lot of yous.
I don't either.
I'm unemployed.
I'm going to sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.
Bananas in pajamas.
So F you to that.
I don't get tomorrow off.
What's a president's day?
Also F you to Shane.
Fucking bought Pokemon games for Shane.
What?
It's like a hen...
Hentai something.
I don't remember what it was called now.
It looked funny.
Because he does this weird penis spin on some guy's face or something.
That's Hentai, not Sentai.
Back away from Loki a little bit here.
Oh no, I think she was talking about the new American version is really terrible or something.
Megaforce, Rangers.
And here we all are entertaining this fucking Power Rangers discussion.
Knock it off.
Hey, you hush, because I have like two Laserdiscs.
One of them is Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger, and the other one is like another, I think, Mega Ranger movie.
So, shut up.
It is hentai common.
It is.
Hentai Kamen.
Hentai Kamen.
Yes.
They have a brand new superhero movie.
All right.
Let's go to a few more topics for you guys.
Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange On Radio, Loki.
So there's some Kickstarter games that are actually getting publishers, which is kind of cool.
One of them is this game called Takedown.
It's like a tactical shooter game.
They're seeing kind of like a slow-paced Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or something like that.
um sort of like that sort of series I guess um but it's gonna be coming out by 5 of 5 games uh called uh was it Takedown Red Saber and I guess the guy that developed it was uh was it Christian Allen oh I guess that's why it's similar to Tom Grant he was uh one of the creative directors for the Ghost Recon series and also I guess um SWAT and Rainbow Six so that's kind of cool um so that's gonna be coming out uh it doesn't say when though but uh sometime in 2013 um
and then uh Wildman we remember that was the one that was being done by Gas Powered Games kind of like as the last ditch hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going out of business thing well actually they canceled their Kickstarter um so and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter is because it got purchased by Wargaming it was I think World of Tanks so no word if they're going to still be doing the Wildman game but uh at least now they have some funding
So that's good.
Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.
I got one here too.
It's about a 90s arcade racer because there's just not enough Daytona USA in your life and the like.
It looks awesome.
And they are going to do this new racing game for iOS, Android, and Wii U. I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing... They picked it up.
That's the publisher.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, they picked it up.
Thank you.
They are the publisher.
The producer is Tyrone Rodriguez, is the Nysalis producer who will be producing and helping the game come to the iOS, Android, and Wii U, which I think is interesting.
Here's one that...
Now we're not talking about 360 or PlayStation.
It's Wii U. PC, Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.
It looks cool.
Yeah.
I almost backed it, but I'm poor.
But I'm poor.
Alright, that's it.
We're going to get to the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
We will talk about what's going on in games.
Whatever you want to talk about tonight.
We've had a lot of stuff tonight.
I'm sure it's going to elicit some sort of reaction.
So the Skype line is open now.
While we wait for some calls, Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?
I didn't really have anything I wanted to talk about other than I wanted to go into a little bit more detail with that whole iPad thing because they had some cool notes that I missed in there after I read through it.
Apparently those cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant for capturing objects that you place on top of it.
So basically it would capture both sides of a 3D object or they even may have more than just a couple cameras on there.
and it would import the full 3D object into your game, which is kind of cool.
Of course, they said 6-axis.
They're supposed to have some sort of LED strips on the side.
I guess that part that looked like the whole plywood thing.
Let me go to the phones because we're getting calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Hi, we can hear you.
Alright, I just wanted to say, hey, what's up guys?
Long time no talk to you.
Who is this?
Introduce yourself.
It's Gamer Girl.
Gamer Girl!
How you doing, Gamer Girl?
So, I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know what to talk about.
Oh, I think she's also lagged a little.
Oh, I think you're listening to us.
I hear a little bit of echo.
You might want to mute the radio in the background there.
Well, that's no problem.
What was going through your head when you hit the dial button?
Is it still echoing?
Uh-huh.
Hold on a second.
We'll hold.
We'll wait.
There's nothing.
We don't got nothing better to do.
We'll make up another rumor and talk about it.
How's that sound?
Oh, shoot.
Oh, what's up, gamer girl?
What's on your mind tonight?
Okay, I don't know if I'm still... We hear you, honey.
Keep talking.
Can I get a what what?
Um, shoot.
I don't think she can hear us.
Honey, try back later, because I don't think you can hear us.
Sorry to say.
Aw, that's always depressing.
Yeah.
Alright, let's go to the phones.
We'll try to get a phone.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Okay, I don't know if I'm still...
We hear you, honey.
Keep talking.
We're hearing ourselves.
All aboard the mail train.
I knew this was going to come up.
Hi, you guys.
It's Porkchop.
How's it going?
Wait, you can hear me and I can hear you?
Yes.
Oh my god, it's a miracle.
I fixed the show.
See, I fixed it.
Hi, guys.
It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.
I'm sure you'll agree.
Yeah, all this, you know, the rumors about the PS4, this whole used games thing.
Um...
I don't know what to believe anymore.
I'm starting to lose faith.
I know, and here we are.
We're making all this shit up and just rumor-mongering, and we just make the whole thing worse in our desperate attempt to get all the thousands of clicks that we get every week here on the show.
I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.
The guys were talking about old games and chat rooms, especially games in development hell and stuff like that.
And it was kind of sad to hear the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and The Last Guardian.
I was looking forward to those.
Why can't these companies just wake the fuck up and realize these games will sell?
I know The Last Guardian will anyway.
It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.
So get on that.
Stop bitching about fucking iPads and all this bullshit.
Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?
Because sometimes big titles come out and they don't sell, and it makes developers nervous.
I guess there was like, you know, sometimes there is a lot of hype.
Hype is just the theme for this week.
Like even I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising and I looked at the footage and I think, OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games kind of real justice like Bayonetta.
They did that.
But this game, there's something I can't shake about it as much as I love Metal Gear Solid and Raiden himself.
He's a cool character.
I'm just getting a weird feeling off it.
I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.
What's going into your decision ultimately?
What's going to help you get un-weird, if anything?
I don't know.
It's the fact that spin-off titles aren't always great.
It's something that I'm a bit tentative about.
I'm watching it and I'm thinking, even DMC, the new Devil May Cry game, I'm very scared to buy that because I really, really loved the series before that and now it's just turned on its head.
The game where you're not Dante?
The Game Where You're Not Dante?
The Game Where You're Dante Mark 2, yeah.
And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.
It's just like another doctor, it's okay.
Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.
Of course, yeah.
That's just retconned in there.
There's no point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is there?
Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry is the other kind of thing about it, is that this version in particular, I don't know if that's Bayonetta's fault.
The Devil May Metro?
Kinda, yeah.
Devil May Metro, a little bit.
I mean, not a bad thing.
Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.
I've heard something like that.
Apparently, the spitting image of the guy who developed the game.
I'm like, what?
It could be worse.
He could have the face of, like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried or... Or one of the Jonas Brothers.
Oh, that would be... I'm going to make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.
No, it could be a Dante de Medna version.
That's like DLC.
That's like for guilty pleasures and stuff like that.
What is ultimately going to... The boardroom guys want to get in your head as a gamer.
What is ultimately going to make that decision for you if you are going to pick up Devil May Cry or not?
if you just leave it alone you know don't don't don't don't twist it to think that you know this is a reboot and as far as I'm concerned the game was fine before they went and did all this I don't know fucking lost city of demons turning the fucking buildings upside down it was fine when he was the demon hunter and he was hot and he had white hair initially but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo I don't know what to make of him at all okay I'm just
Don't ruin it.
That's all I can really say.
I'm going to play boardroom guy for a second here.
This is how you get the female audience.
You go the bayonet route.
You have his penis basically act like her hair in that game.
So it's just flopping around, attacking things.
That would be frightening.
It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do, but still.
I would love to actually have a main male character who's just in completely oversexed positions.
Go play Devil May Cry.
I know, I want the over-the-top, like, you know, a comic book cover.
Done by Rob Liefeld.
You're like, you want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.
I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.
That's what she's talking about.
That would be hilarious.
You want a Hawkeye game.
Jeremy Renner stars as the main character.
That would be perfect.
I would just play Jeremy Renner's butt the game with a Wii move.
You all are taking this show to a very strange place.
Anyway, Porkchop, I've got to wrap up so I can try to get another call.
Any other thoughts for us tonight?
Yes, thanks very much.
I want to thank you personally.
You put me on the path of exile.
It's very satisfying and I'm going to play more of it.
Diablo 3, finally.
Well, it was Diablo, but even so, just playing it and killing things, it was worth it.
Totally worth waiting, and the internet was crap downloading.
Took ages.
It was worth it.
Go try it out, at least, even if you're not a fan.
Try it out.
A ringing endorsement from overseas.
There you go.
Can't beat that.
Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.
Good girl.
All right.
That's it, Porkchop.
Have a good one, buddy.
Take it easy, guys.
All right.
Bye-bye.
You too.
Bye.
I will try this call one more time because it's a new name, I think.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Nope, you gotta call Echo 123.
That's it.
And turn off your speakers.
Use headphones.
You gotta stop the show when you're calling in.
Sorry.
We'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.
We have another one coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
You talk about Path of Exile way too much.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Hi, Shane.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm good.
I'm playing Pokemon.
Why the hate boner, since we've been using that term a lot tonight, why the hate boner for Path of Exile?
Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.
Have you played Path of Exile?
I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer, because it was crap.
I'm telling you, there's a difference.
And Torchlight 2.
Have you played Torchlight 2?
I played the first one, the demo of it, and it was kind of boring.
Ugh.
You're the problem, Shane.
Yes.
We have stuff to do.
But I gotta watch Kyoryuger some more because it's so funny.
I need to watch it now.
Alright, why did you call in tonight?
Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile or did you have something else?
No, that's pretty much it.
and Nino Cooney sucks there.
Hey!
Another game he hasn't played that he hates.
I have Nino Cooney.
You have it.
Yes, I have it.
It is not fun.
It is super boring.
The Pokemon aspect is cool and the battles are fine.
I actually like the battles.
But the story is terrible.
Here's the thing.
A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane.
Like, you know, I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.
I got into probably... Are you playing Persona?
I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.
See?
See?
Everybody proof.
Mass Effect, and we have the Pokemon, and... Echo Image.
Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway.
Because it was in DDR.
Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance, was largely in part to Shane.
But...
I do influence Shane sometimes and Nino Cooney was one of them is that I convinced him to get Nino Cooney right now he doesn't like it he's gonna give me his copy I made the wrong choice it's just it's like the bizarre review Nino Cooney every reviewer is like no the story's amazing but you know there's some problems with the with the gameplay and the battle system battle system's great but story oh sucks now this means Shane can give me his copy
of Ni No Kuni.
Yeah.
I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little limited edition case I have with it because it goes for like 40 bucks just the case alone.
Damn it.
Did you get the book?
No, I did not get a book.
Oh, I want that book.
No.
Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.
The story is so boring.
I don't care about any of the characters.
I care about my little Mighty Might guy, and that's pretty much it.
I named him Fodder because I figured he wasn't going to be worth anything, but he's really good.
He is really good.
He actually lasts a long time, but if you read game facts, they all say, Oh, he's horrible.
He's got bad stats.
Okay, so I just want to be clear here, Chad.
I just want to be clear.
You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.
No.
But you are current on every episode of Power Rangers ever made, correct?
Um, not entirely.
There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.
I see, I see.
And how's the story in Pokemon?
You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?
Yes Okay, Shane, wait I have to ask you, because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages What is your favorite Sentai series?
Sentai series?
Yeah Probably Gokaiger Really?
Yes, it cracks me up, but Kyoryuger might take its place I still Oh, and Dekaranger I still say Megaranger was the best I don't know, I haven't seen that one Most of the later ones Go watch Megaranger, it's awesome
Are you guys done?
No, are you done?
Yes.
Bye, have a good time.
Thanks for calling.
Bye.
He's like, mm-hmm.
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft.
And then some.
7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.
Now live every week.
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
I got time for one more call.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
I got bronchitis!
That lady's making a killing.
But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?
She was on Tosh last year.
Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.
He was on Tosh too.
It's tough to make a living.
I'm gonna find out now.
Hold on.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
That's the one and only Ranma from the East Coast.
Hey, Ranma from the East Coast.
How's it going?
Oh, pretty good, pretty good.
We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.
Yeah, I heard.
I got the memo.
Good job on that.
But congrats on your first live show.
Thanks, and we try.
Evidently, Winamp didn't like a certain MP3 and decided to give me the middle finger.
It might do that with some of the foreign name titles, just so you know.
I should have warned you about that.
These are things we learn through trial and error.
Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.
Thank you.
And Anime Jam Session can also be heard live on VOG Network Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.
VOG got two new live shows.
Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.
It's like we kind of doubled.
Not really.
I guess we went from three to five.
It's close.
Pretty cool.
So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winamp?
Just making it through school.
Just chilling, just making it through school.
What are you studying?
Networking technology.
I guess you didn't get the notice on that.
I decided to go back to college.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh my god, you gotta tell our audience, I know it's a video game show, but like, I was reading, I saw it on Tumblr, I saw it on Facebook, I saw it on Twitter, like, there was drama everywhere, give us a little bit, give us a little bit of the drama, give us a tease.
Sure, the main issue was cosplayers in Congo was a kind of piss that an international Jewish organization took up a majority of the convention area and places for taking photography and there was pretty much insults going between both sides back and forth.
Really?
Yes, really.
Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?
I just don't like when you get two groups of people together who decide to act like name-calling five-year-olds.
Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.
Also, update on Antoine Dodson.
Released a single in 2012 called Lovesick Lullaby.
And how did that sell?
I just downloaded it.
Oh my god.
You're the problem.
Damn it, Ooptron.
Look at your life, look at your choices.
Antoine Dodson songs?
Ain't nobody got time for that.
So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?
Yeah, no, it's 2013.
It's a new year.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.
No.
Back in Huntsville.
No.
Huntsville.
He smoked marijuana.
Get out.
Anyway.
What else should I ask you about, Ranma?
I don't know.
I just have a few things to say.
Quick, and I'll be on my way.
The convention that you went to was called Animation on Display, and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Abare, was there as a guest.
Neat.
Yes.
And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is called Zuden Sentai Kyuruger.
It's the third Sentai series based off of Dinosaurs.
Okay.
Fun, because what was the one?
Dairanger.
Dino Thunder?
No, Dairanger.
Dinosaurs dress up and transform?
That's pretty awesome.
Zoo Ranger was the first one.
Yeah, Zoo Ranger, that was the first one.
Dairanger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old White Ranger guy.
Yeah, little do many people know is that the White Ranger was actually from a completely different series.
They had better outfits.
Just saying.
They did.
Yes, they did.
They totally had better outfits.
Well, Ranma, after this call, I feel like I learned something.
Two more things.
I'm going to get out of here.
A whole Year of Luigi thing.
Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.
As proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie wearing my Luigi hat.
That's awesome.
Never wash that hat again.
Just kidding.
You should probably wash it once in a while.
No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.
Oh, okay.
Alright, that works.
Oh my god, I haven't seen this picture.
How did I miss this?
You have not seen it?
No, that's hilarious.
That's pretty cool.
That's awesome.
Oh God, I love it.
All right.
When are you going to get your ass back out here?
Can you put that on Tumblr or something?
Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.
I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money and I'm done with college, okay?
Because I want to come back out there again.
I want to go out there and go to a con.
How about We Crash New York?
Well, Tiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here and me down there and Jovi Dea down here to do a big ol' party thing, you know what I'm saying?
There you go.
We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.
Only if it's a sexy party.
They do have that.
It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.
Awesome.
Sounds like fun to me.
Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to wrap up the show.
Fine, okay.
I'm outta here.
Alright, have a good one, buddy.
Later.
Later.
Another A-plus phone call from Ranma.
Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.
Echo 1, 2, 3 in the future.
There we go.
That's it.
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, or tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR.
Oh, shit, I gotta do the tweets.
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired and this guy was a George actually went for 80 plus hours and he actually finished or he beat the world record I guess at about over 84 hours and 36 million points so at least that's what the thought is right now that he has broken the record for both longest time playing on a
He likes to score all night.
Here's a last-minute story if I ever heard one.
Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's on topic and legit.
Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.
This is actually super important.
Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.
When's it happening?
Today, 5 p.m.
Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m.
Eastern, so that means in about...
two more hours we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita and it is ahead of the February 20th event meaning this is confirmed the two events are about separate topics so the February 20th event is all about something new because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week or tonight so Loki upon hearing that you just said earlier in the show where's the information on the Vita any reaction to this hearing this
I've got to see what they say.
See, the problem is when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games, and it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.
And here's the other funny thing you want to see.
I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and games side.
And we do a lot of promotions with them.
In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now because I probably can't go.
It's possibly to go on the red carpet premiere for This Is The End with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.
My wife might not like it.
But here's the thing.
I'll fucking go.
Our rep.
My name's Loki.
Our rep in house has been asking me.
She's all, okay, well, what...
what's in the electric or electronic device that Sony has that you know what's hot right now with Sony and stuff I was like oh yeah well you know there's the PlayStation 4 it's gonna be coming out and then there's the Vita so I may actually get another Vita
You're not having to pay for it, of course, but... You have a rough life.
Well, I... I might have to go to a movie premiere.
Well, no, no.
Here's the thing, though.
I've got another Vita.
No, right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.
They went to a winery one time, and then they went to... They went to Monterey, and I got... I didn't get included in either of those trips.
I had to stay back and answer phones.
Thanks.
Good times.
Alright, quickly, I gotta do some quick Twitter topics here.
TigerClaw sent us a couple stories here.
I'm just gonna do one because I'm pressed for time here.
Video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.
Oh, yeah.
Get out.
I didn't know that this was something they were doing.
That's been floating for a little bit.
I thought they had a play... On PS1 they did, right?
Really?
There was the Masters of Terra something.
Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.
It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't, you know, amount to anything.
Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct is greater than Super Metroid.
Just saying.
Well, you know Orange Laundry is the show where every gamer has a voice.
Except you.
Yeah.
Thanks for watching!
I've never said that there's a stupid question.
That's pushing it.
Since we are on the topic of Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars, and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know that
Star Wars figures with Disney figures.
Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.
Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.
You know what?
Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game.
So I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet.
Especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.
All right.
And lastly, from SSJ100, Matt, with so much negativity stemming from video games lately, someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.
Very interesting.
Let's see.
I'm trying to scan through this real quick.
God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.
The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games, and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.
It's a nonprofit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.
So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?
Wah, wah.
Womp, womp, womp.
All right.
That does it.
We got to wrap up.
We're at midnight 30 Eastern time here.
We're running a little late.
So we got to go around and wrap it up.
Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show and staying with us for all three hours tonight.
Remember, we do this show for free.
We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that.
But we do it because we love you guys and we love the community.
Yes, even the nasty emailers too.
I love you so much.
