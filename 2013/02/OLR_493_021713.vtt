Tonight, February 17th, 2013, Bungie reveals details on their next game.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Nintendo unveils more 3DS titles in the new Nintendo Direct.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And as the first glimpse of the Playstation 4 leaked to the internet,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February 17th, 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Blarg.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Blarg, yarg. How you doing?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm tired.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Tired?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Actually, thank you for the ca-ca-coc-pa-pa.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time and then it came out.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
The caffi. You were just saying it, you know, with an accent. The caffi.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I love coffee.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, I love coffee too.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm drinking it and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit because I went to San Francisco yesterday.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
How was San Francisco?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It was gay.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
What'd you do in San Francisco? I'm sure the weather was great. What'd you do in San Francisco?

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
It was fantastic. Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara and, well, there was beer involved and a place called Pizza Orgasmica.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I have been there.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's good.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, it's not just a clever title.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It's freaking good pizza.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, it is. Good stuff.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
So, yeah, there was some bar hopping and some curry rice earlier in the day and an anime convention that I had no idea was going on.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
And I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie, because I love that thing and wear it everywhere.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone's like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard?

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japan town.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I was like, I'm not here for the con. I'm just wearing my jacket.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Did you do a deadpan just like that?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Awesome.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I love the random impromptu anime convention.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Dark Sakura approaches. Quick, throw an anime convention.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
Well, I saw people putting on armor in the in the Japan town.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
OK, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I saw people putting on armor. I was like.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
It's not the cherry blossom festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Is there a convention going on and no one's told me?

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Sure enough, I, you know, I run into somebody and wearing a blue trench coat and a button up shirt.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
He's like, yeah, and there's my my doctor over there.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I was like, so is there a convention going on?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
He's like, oh, yeah, it sucks.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, I don't even remember what the convention was called.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Where was that? Was it at the was it was over the Kabuki Hotel.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Interesting. You know, that's where they're going to be having the gamer expo,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
but they call it gamer X now because they can't call it gamer con legal stuff.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
But that's where they're having that. So it seemed like a pretty good venue.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But I mean, I want to go to that one.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
But it was cosplay central all over Japan town and assholes with cameras.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
That's the other thing I call them assholes.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And I'm not talking about the professional photographers.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
You know, there's people who know how to behave,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
how to assure people aside when they're taking their photos.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
looking for the girls to the biggest.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm up with this in backing up into Techmaster Loki, everybody backing up into people

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
and stepping on feet and being just an asshole.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
And, you know, he tried to I ran into him again and I just said,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
you know, look where you're going ass face or something.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
And it was just being rude. You know, there's a way to take photos at a convention.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And the way this guy did it is not it.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Did you go to the anime convention and say I wasn't supposed to be here today?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
All right. I don't keep up with the concert anymore.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
How do I know all this?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki, officially everybody.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Hello. How are you doing?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm doing fine.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Good. Don't do that.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
But I can remember.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You had to think for a minute.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's been a while since I've been to the con. No, I don't think I have.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It's been a while since I've been to a con, too.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't even remember the last con I went to. It was probably like ASET.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I remember the last con job I pulled.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
What's a con job? It sounds hot.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Con? Con artist?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, OK.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
OK. Well, it wasn't funny in the first place.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
He's a familiar guy.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
or ever listened to Hoard House and hear his e-mails and tweets and all that.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It is Flaco Jones, everybody.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Hello, everybody.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
How are you doing?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm doing great.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah, I love that.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Because you just reminded me of Ni No Kuni and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
You're sticky and smell of caramel?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Can I smell you?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It's all this English candy.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Yes, it's all the Cyl candy, which much love to Cyl.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't know if Cyl listens to Orange Lawn Triadio, but I hope she won't mind.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I've been giving some of the candy away.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
I had to lay claim to the Mars Bar because I love Mars Bars.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So, yes, Cyl from Girls Gone Wow, which if you haven't heard the show, it's a fantabulous show.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
And it's you can hear it Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geek or Wednesday mornings, excuse me, at the Voice of Geeks Network.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It's Wednesday nights if you're in the UK, but they are a lovely British based group.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It's not just Cyl, it's Cyl, EJ, Raven and Rob.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
But I correspond mostly with Cyl because, you know, in getting her shows and so forth.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And Cyl offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
So she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain, like the Smarties over there, which are like totally different than Smarties here.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And like Aero Bars, which we don't have here at all.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Jelly Babies, which I'd never had, which were pretty good.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I can't eat Jelly Babies.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
But she sent stuff that I've never seen there, like the Bubblies. I've never seen them there.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, yeah. So pretty cool.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
And oh my God, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs. I had one yesterday.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So I have a return package. I don't want to spoil, just in case Sil is listening.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But I might spoil by the time it gets there.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
I do have a return package we're sending. And all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So if you know Sil.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And we're sending her a token of our love.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
That's right. In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Sil that we're sending.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So we'll send that over there soon.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
Alright, Flaco, what's new with you? What have you been up to? When was the last time you were on the show? A couple months ago, right?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I was on the year-end show.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
That's right.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
So December 30th.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
That's right, the last show of the year. Because you ruined one of the shows in June.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And hopefully tonight's show will be better.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
I scared everybody in December because something happened that hadn't happened. I guess the stream went down and that hadn't happened in a few weeks.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So it was scaring people.

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, I should warn everybody. I was having major internet issues yesterday. Like, Alan and I were trying to play World of Warcraft and disconnected like eight times. It was insane.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
He had net flatulence.

07:54.000 --> 08:07.000
My iPad wouldn't even connect to the internet. It was dumb. So we unplugged our routers overnight. And so far today, they've been fine. So we'll keep our fingers crossed. But Flaco's presence could break them again.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
I like that I have this reputation with the show. I'm the number one fan of Hoard House and the number one curse on a locker.

08:13.000 --> 08:22.000
Exactly. Exactly. So you you have two young ones at home. You just how old is your little girl now?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
She's almost one. She turns a year next month.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
So you have a less than a year old at home. Yes. How do you juggle that with game playing?

08:29.000 --> 08:40.000
I play very late at night or early in the morning. And you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni, something like that, I can actually play when they're up. They don't get bothered by it too much.

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
My son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon. You know, he doesn't like the battle. He gets bored of that, which I guess a lot of people do.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
You read some of the online reviews. But yeah, he loves the animated cut scenes in that. And, you know, another game we've been playing lately is The Unfinished Swan, and he loves that game.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
So if he loves the game, he'll actually request it. And Unfinished Swan, obviously, you can't say that, but he calls it tree.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Because when you, when you highlight the icon on the PlayStation, it just has a picture of, you know, like an ink splattered tree. And so that's what he calls it.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
So when he comes in the living room, he starts saying tree, tree. And like, you want us to play tree? Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
So we put, you know, we load up that game when we start playing it. And he just, he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game.

09:22.000 --> 09:34.000
Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I've used those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
Whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari had just, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get.

09:51.000 --> 10:02.000
So it's just interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve. And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I think they will.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
It'll just be different.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They're holding back on it right now. They just want to save it.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
You think so?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Holding back on it.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
They can do it now.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Or Oliver will be able to have the Aluma Room that has the boobies on the wall everywhere.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yes.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Just in time for that phase.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Boobs everywhere.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Just in time for that phase.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I thought you just called the motorboat room.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Akuma JP in our chat room.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
By the way, hi, chatters.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
We're always joined with the live chat room because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
vognetwork.com.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Akuma JP in chat says, sky sounds old.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Ha ha ha.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, jerk, keep this in mind.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
OLR is on our 11th year this year.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
So, if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
We didn't start this show when we were 18.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
We were more like 23 or 24.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
So, you do the math.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
You know what? The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
And what's that?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Because I'll be 37.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
In a row?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I rest my case.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
So, and I'll be 35.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So, Jamie's the old one.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Come on, Akuma.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Redirect your jokes appropriately.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Vintage.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
This rack took years to grow.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And I'm two weeks older than Rob.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I know. I feel like the young kid.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
And all my friends, I get the old jokes all the time from my friends.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I guess I just hang out with youngins.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That's the deal.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
So, Akuma JP in our chat room says, so you are old, lol.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Bonk.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You're only as old as you feel, honestly.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And I will say this with all honesty.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
We will talk about video games in a minute here, but obviously I still play video games,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
which a lot of people think is a youthful activity, although I don't think so.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
I think because we all grew up in a generation that at least had Atari 2600,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
video games has always been a part of our lives.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
So, I can't imagine not playing video games at this point, right?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Really, for real.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I have to agree with that for myself as well.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20 year olds.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
That's totally not the case.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
know that I was really sick when I was 29.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I missed two or three weeks at OLR because I'd been in the hospital.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'd have surgery.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
So, it was one of those things where they had to screen me

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and that was the type of stuff I had going on.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
So, it was scary and I think all that stuff going through that before 30

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
kind of definitely made me feel like turning 30 is awesome.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I get to turn 30, yes!

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
You want to know what's funny?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
What?

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Back in my early days on AOL, I had a friend who I chatted,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
another anime fan who was 10 years old.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I remember chatting with him when he graduated college.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
That makes me feel old.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah, I know, right?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I'm like, my nieces can drink.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's weird.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I remember when they were born.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
But now you can take them out drinking.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
The other day, we got an email to the show that was like,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I've been listening to you since I was 13.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I'm like, oh my God.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
He's like, I'm in college now.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh my God.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Not many.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Gunsmoke, The Simpsons.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Doctor Who.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
There's only a few.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So we're awesome.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and live at the Voice Ease Network.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
What the hell was that?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
They say that that kind of stuff happens all the time.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
It happened in San Francisco, right?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Later on.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, but it totally wasn't the same thing.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
It didn't shatter windows and stuff.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Probably somebody's science project out there.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Russia, meteor shatter you.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Little pictures in Soviet Russia.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I was busy being asleep.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, you don't live in Russia.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, no, no, no, no.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I actually didn't see the news until I got up late today

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
because I've been sick most of the day.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
So I was like, meteor, fuck, sleep.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
No, watching the videos online blew my mind.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
You can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and of course the car alarms is always the best part.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Somebody get Bruce Willis's Armageddon.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
as they have these dash cams going.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never fazed by any of this.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
There's no like, oh my God!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's just like, right?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's like, what?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You're just like, oh, that's weird.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die, oh well.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in like, I don't know,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Philadelphia or something?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah, and there's like a camera going. I can just imagine it right now.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and it was just like a small thing.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The guy's like driving on the freeway and he's like,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh my God, did you see that?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It's just like, okay.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh my God, thanks Obama.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I was driving home really late at night

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and there was a big green streak across the sky,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
but it didn't explode like that one,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
so obviously it wasn't even close to the size,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
but I thought it was pretty cool.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I was like, oh wow, that thing just comes streaking across

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
If it had been in my neck of the South, it'd be, the fuck is that?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Hand me a beer.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Shit, that means we're going to get them another hurricane.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Porkchop in our chat room says,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I guess I'm assuming they're in public cars.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, so I thought maybe the police cars.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
No, apparently they're really, from what I read,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
they're really into dash cams because I guess in traffic courts and stuff,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
they don't take any sort of verbal arguments.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
They have to have physical evidence.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And so because of altercations like that,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
you know, any sort of car accident,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
they want to have something to document it.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
So that's why they do it.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You know, Nelly was born in Russia.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Did she have anything to say about it?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
No.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Thank God it didn't happen here.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
She was born in the Ukraine.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
So it's a little different.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
A little different.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Uh, interesting.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Well, I don't know what that has to say.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah, Rob, everything Slavic is not Russian. Thank you.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Are you sure?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It was in the 80s.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I thought Canada was a state.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Anyhow, I don't know what that had to do with video games,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
but as far as like nerd news goes,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
like it was one of those things where I watched it.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I was like, oh my God.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
You make a burning Legion joke.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Yes, I saw that on Twitter.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Kashi Meteor.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Someone Kashi Meteor.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Code Man in chat says it was Team Rocket.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
There was a gif of the lights going out and Team Rocket shows up.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I guess it was Goku.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
All right.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Let's get into video games

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
and the video games that you have been playing this week

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Dark Sakura.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar. That was awesome.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You inhaled that thing.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I love Mars bars.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So I beat Mass Effect 2 again.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I started on Mass Effect 3

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and got Fly Cam working.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
But now,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
you know, we got that patch 1.5

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and none of my cheats

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
work anymore.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
So I just figured out how to put in

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
key binding commands using the coalesced editor.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And now all I have to do is hit

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
zero for god mode.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
No, but really,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I played WoW

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
for an hour.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And I

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
would actually log on and play more WoW

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
but I would like people

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
you know, plug it.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
yes, I know that Mars bars

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
are Milky Ways but they're not the regular

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Milky Ways. They taste better.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
They're different-er.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
They're actually from Mars.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
They are.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And you don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
so having it say Mars with the packaging

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
on it and everything makes me

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
stupendously happy.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So, now if I can find

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
whatchamacallits I'd be even happier.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I played

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I played

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
something else.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I don't remember what it was.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Oh yeah, Dan had a friend

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
over and they played through Contra hardcore

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and then played

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
through Ghouls

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and Ghosts

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
which was pretty fun because

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
my friend and I left

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and then we came back

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
and they were still playing Ghouls and Ghosts

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
like hours later.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So I'm like, what playthrough were you on? Oh, just the beginning

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
of the second playthrough.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Really. So yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And then I got

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
now this isn't a game but it's related to a game

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I found the Mass Effect

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Paragon Lost

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
for like 16 bucks brand new.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
So I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
let's buy it.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It didn't suck.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The only thing that I really didn't like about it was

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
how the kroken were drawn.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I did not care for the character design.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And it got me in the feels.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Damn you Bioware.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
So yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Damn those feels.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Damn the battle tits.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Full speed ahead.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Alright, let's move on to Loki.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I didn't play a whole ton this week.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm sure I started some of the

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
kind of DLC stuff

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
or not DLC stuff, the

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
mod quests

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I guess if you will. There's one that's kind of

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
where you hire a boat and you can actually go

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
to a bunch of different islands and stuff.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And it was neat, I guess.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I mean, it's pretty well done.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And they voice acted everything

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
so that's a little weird hearing people that

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
don't sound like the five different

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
NPCs that are in the game.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
They have voice, all the characters

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
it's ridiculous.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
So I played a little bit of that

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and then

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
a little bit of Borderlands

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
and

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
more Call of Duty.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
We actually bought Map Pack 4

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
or Content Pack 4

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
so now we have a few more maps

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
that I've already kind of gotten sick of.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But we got to do something because

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 is not coming out

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
in May like we had hoped it was so

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
got to have something to tide us over.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And then I just got done playing

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
DDRX2

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
on my PC.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Even though, yes, that's an arcade

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
game, but it

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
runs on a PC so I played

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it anyways.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And it isn't the versus

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
second mixing, that's 3 I guess.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
But it's X2.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It's cool, looks like

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Stepmania, I guess.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It looked a lot to me like the

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Playstation 3 version of the game.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
They just adapted that engine.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Or the Wii, DDR2 on the Wii.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm surprised they don't release a PC version.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It runs on a PC, there's

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
no work to be done.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Literally no work to be done.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Licensing would be the only thing.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I guess, but just put

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Konami Originals in there.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Done. Put it on Steam. There you go.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Money. Just rolling in.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
So there's that. And then my wife

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
has been taking

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
over the Xbox because she's been

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
playing Fable 3.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Really? Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That's not even the best Fable game.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
She played Fable 2 all the way.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And so she's playing Fable 3.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Who's getting into Fable. Or is into Fable.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah, she is into Fable.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Does she play good or bad? She's playing good.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Okay.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That game is...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It just makes me realize

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
how much Peter Molyneaux is full of

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
crap.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And he's just like talking

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
about all these different

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
enhancements

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
and all this is the first time

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
ever in the game and the dog is awesome

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
blah blah blah blah.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Okay, you're so full of shit it's not even funny.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
By the way folks, is anyone still curious

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
about curiosity? Because I'm pretty sure

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
everybody's fucking forgotten about this

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
curiosity. No, you know who hasn't

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
forgotten about curiosity is Alan.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Because he'll be sitting there on my iPad and

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
he'll walk into the room and he'll be like,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Have you checked on the cube Rob? Have you checked on the cube? What's in the cube?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Did you find what's in the cube yet?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Break the touch. Break the cubes.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
He does it just like that too. Break the cubes Rob.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I don't know what you would even

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
what that's going to be. I think it's going to just be like

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
whoever finally, the last person

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
to give that game up is going to be the winner

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
pretty much.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Well I was going to ask you about this because

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
there was that new Alien game

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
that came out this week from Gearbox

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
except for one site. Apparently really liked it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
But whatever. And then I went

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
on this Twitter thing. Now I don't know

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
shit about this game really but

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
jock? Because you know one particular

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
organization seemed to like it.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And I was like, well isn't like a difference of opinion

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
okay? And it was really weird

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
because Metacritic retweeted or no

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
favorited one of my tweets. I was like, that was kind of

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
weird but okay.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Alright. But yeah

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
there was all this crap going on. I guess

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
a big part of it was that

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
a lot of the stuff they'd been showing at E3

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and the type of stuff they'd been talking about

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
didn't actually come to fruition in the game.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Well yeah it makes a lot of sense.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And people are like, oh we're going to sue

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
and I'm just like

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
well game companies have been doing

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
this shit for years and you just brought up Peter

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Molyneux. Like he's the master of this shit.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
He makes up shit all the time.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Exactly. Who's trying to sue him?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I know nothing.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
He's not really working

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
he's not really attached to any more Fable games

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
or anything like that as far as I'm aware.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
There was Fable It's Not On Rails.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I seriously don't even know the name of the game.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's just Fable It's Not On Rails.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Fable The Journey

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Fable The Book The Game

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
The Series The Movie

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't know. But yeah

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
even the whole Gearbox

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
well there's two jokes I made about it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
First off Gearbox you've got

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and Borderlands Gearbox

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
well this is made by Duke Nukem

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Forever Gearbox.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And then the second thing is

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
yeah it's just because they showed

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
more fancy features and stuff like that

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
that may have been running on a PC version

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
or something like that

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
that come time to actually

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
implement that on a console

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
oh we don't have the memory

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
bandwidth to do all these fancy

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
things we've got to scale it back a bit

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
or oh we don't have enough processing

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
power or the frame rates and shit

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
or whatever and so maybe that's why.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But then again why wouldn't they just

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
allow that to kind of run

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
unleashed on the PC

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
probably because it's a console port

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't know.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Who cares?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Bad games happen all the time. Are you really surprised

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
that a movie tie-in game

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
is bad? Really?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I mean everyone's shocked that

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
this movie tie-in game is bad

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I mean

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
it doesn't really matter it's just

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
yeah

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
we all really kind of hope that

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Duke Nukem is as good as Borderlands

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
hell I thought Duke Nukem forever

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
this is going to be awesome because it's somebody of the guys that did Borderlands

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
No

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
No it's the team that did Duke Nukem forever

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
clearly

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
RossDielUT in our chatroom at

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
live.vognetwork.com says

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
differences is great but when there's literally one

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
that looks shady even with a game that doesn't get

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
well received there's always at least a group of

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
people who like the game

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
well yeah I mean you know

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
one guy liked the game but I can think of

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
like you know there's been like that one voice

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
that passionately defended it

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as like

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
you know what they say now it'd be different if they didn't mention

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
any of the flaws

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
but maybe they just thought that you know it didn't really

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
affect the game too much it's a person's

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
opinion one guy's opinion and you're just like

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
flipping shit over it

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
There's also no evidence in this scenario

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I mean people are like oh because it's running next

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
to an ad for the same game it's clearly

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
been bought I can't believe first off

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I can't believe I am the one

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
defending a big name site

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
like I'm usually the first one to

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
criticize that stuff Yeah because you know what they're going to sell ads

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
so they can run that site

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh my gosh game sites sell game ads

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
get out but there's no further

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
evidence that this whole thing was you know

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and so the Twitter wants to convict

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
and say this is full of shady it's not

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
like that whole scenario with what was the

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
freaking game at GameSpot that got that guy

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Kane and Lynch Yeah that whole thing

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
like there was more evidence and there

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
was stuff that came out about that and all

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
the shady dealings and the guy himself basically

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
said you know yeah it was

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
you know there was some stuff going on

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I mean I don't know

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I just think like the internet

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
should just get over it okay there was one

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
person that said it was good you know

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
well you know what somebody out there

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
somebody out there probably liked Yaris

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
it was free I like Silent Hill

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Revelations the movie nobody

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
else like that I want it I need to see

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
it you and Ospher actually

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Ospher on Twitter would defend that so there you

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
go it's something about being high on

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
leaderboards on VoG ActDef would probably like

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
it too well he did like it I

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
think look at oh my god

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
you know look at you know if you're gonna like blame

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
or mark games down just because

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
of like glitches and stuff like that then

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Earth Defense Force 2017

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
should have gotten like a one out of ten

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
because that thing is

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
glitchy as hell there is

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
no physics

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
no physics whatsoever or at least

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
no realistic physics

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
it's just it's crap the AI

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
is completely retarded

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
so yeah it

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
happens get over it

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Ross Steel UT in chat says and it

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
the game it took seven fucking years to make

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and had eight devs on it

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Lincoln just came out

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
18 years to make that's

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
because she was cast in it like ten years ago

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and you know had to defend

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
for an Oscar sometimes things

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
get trapped in development hell it doesn't necessarily mean

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
they turn out bad like you're doing forever

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
well but that's that's that's not

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
helping my case actually L.A. Noire

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I think was in development hell thank you that's

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
that's a better that's a good review thank you

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 just got delayed yeah

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
but that that had that hasn't been out

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
no that hasn't been that's very

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
long I mean it's not like this

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 came out in 2001

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
you know it's like wait a second

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
hey we're missing some numbers here

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
alright let's move on with

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
gaming week so we're gonna be here for an hour I'll talk

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go to Flaco

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
because I've been having long hours

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
at work and you know when I come home I'm like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I have to raid in WoW or something but

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I did play one new game and

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
it was something where it went

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
on sale this weekend and

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
so I get a text message from Shane

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
before it sells out and it's like you know

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he keeps texting me like did you buy the Pokemon yet

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
why haven't you bought Pokemon why won't you take a good deal

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
you can talk about it on OLR so finally it's like

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
shut up alright I'll buy the game

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
so Jamie are you gonna get in the Pokemon now

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
pretty soon because you guys are all

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
talking like gateway

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
game addicts or something

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
yeah okay you say that now

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
let me see it you want to see it

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
no I want to see the box it's actually super cute

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I don't care

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
alright so here's the thing

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
it's on the DS not the 3DS but the DS

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
and well then I could play it

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
but I don't care I've been having

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
fun with it you know what here's what I like

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
compared to Pearl it moves at a faster

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
pace it gives you all this shit up front

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and you know you don't have to like go

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
forever and grind more and I

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
at the beginning than there was in Pearl

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and it's just kind of

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
little quality of life improvements

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
here's where the game kind of

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
like goes crazy though is that there's all these

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
like online things like

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I can't figure out half this shit with the online

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
like some of it's in the

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
manual and some of it I tried to go online

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me but it's just

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
it's so weird like

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
you can use your little

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
online gear to put your Pokemon

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
to sleep and then you go on the

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
website and you register for the website

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and then you link your DS

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
to the website and then you

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
can do that Pokemon

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
that you just put to sleep you can

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
but you can also play these little online

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
games so your Pokemon can send

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
you things back in the regular game

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
once you tell your Pokemon to wake

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
up and then you launch your game again

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
and you hit the button

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
to tell it to wake up and go find where

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
like it's like oh my god

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
it's like an 18 step process

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
my brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
you said put him to sleep

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
put him down sorry Pikachu

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
it's funny

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
but I mean it's not I can

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
appreciate that the Pokemon company is like trying to do

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
these new things with Nintendo's infrastructure

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
which I can't imagine is a

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
real delight to work with

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
but it just kind of goes to show

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
like the fact that there's

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
just all these bells and whistles that are

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
buried like five minutes deep is just I don't know

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I feel like Pokemon kind of needs

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
a better interface like

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
it would be better if they could streamline

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
a lot of that maybe

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
the new 3DS version X and Y

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
good so it'll be

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
cool to see that

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
but yeah I mean don't let

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
my little rant get you wrong especially

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
for the core game about finding

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
the new Pokemon and challenging

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
the gym leaders and all that it's all

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
than the other games do so you'll get pretty

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
immediate rewards out of it

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
there's a medal system in the game since

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
their own little thing with medals and you can have

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
your little title when you go online

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
you know what

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I found my copy of Pearl

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
did you? yeah it was dusty

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
yeah

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I had played Pearl about three weeks ago

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and then I was like gosh this

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
game kind of moves really slow but this one's

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
a little better actually it's a lot better

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
it's all animations

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
in the little cut scenes too which is much

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
better than what it was before

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
where it's just like you know you see them

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
like shake up and down and that's like their little

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
attack a little silly

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
you know what my cat's butt

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
makes me think of Pokemon

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
what? because she does

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
you know when you see the little Pokemon bounce

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
back and forth on the thing she does

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
this little thing now where she wiggles her butt and then

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
jumps back and forth and I'm like

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Midna used fetch

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
or something

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
oh I should say this too I'm playing Pokemon Black 2

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and I didn't play Black 1 and I'm

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
doing just fine it's like the sequel thing

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
not an issue and I can appreciate

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
that that you know it didn't have to like they

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
always reference like all the people that you

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
talk to are like two years ago this happened

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
two years ago this happened so I guess that's

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
kind of its way of catching you up so that's

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that's kind of cool I guess

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
what is this that you're showing me?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
that okay that internet meme is seriously

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
15 years old I know I think it's

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
great that someone still remembers it

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
she's showing me the pictures of the cat oh is that in chat room?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
yeah the pictures of the cats

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
playing Pokemans and it says my Pokemans

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
let me show you them I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm saving it

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
alright Flaco Jones

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
how was your gaming week? it was pretty good

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I got to play a lot of games this week or not a lot

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
of games but a lot of two games

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
and the first one was

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Unfinished Swan I kind of

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I played the demo which is basically

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
just the first level and really liked

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
it and my wife kept pestering me

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
she's like why don't you just buy this game

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
we love playing the demo but then we have to stop

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
and it's like okay I'll buy the game

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
then I was mad because I missed out it was on sale

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
and I missed the sale by like a day and I was like

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
well I could have saved five

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
dollars she's like just buy it who cares

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
that's really rough when your wife is sitting

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
there saying buy the damn game

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Flaco buy the game

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
just buy it I don't care if it's not on sale

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
like what kind of bizarro world do you live in

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
well I'm really glad I bought it because it was

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
an awesome game and we

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
we'd go back and forth I'd watch a little game

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
we'd play some more of that I tweeted about that

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
of the game so I didn't hashtag

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
anything but I guess you can

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
get stuff come up

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
this tweet deck

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I think allows you to run one feed for

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
your Twitter and so but you can also

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
run a search and it'll pop right up there

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
like okay do you remember

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
when we had Ronnie from Big Brother

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Eleven on Horde House a couple weeks ago

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
yeah uh okay so we

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
got him uh this

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
was really Shane and X for his doing I can't take credit

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
we got him addicted to Frog Fractions

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
but I sent which is that Flash

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
game and if you haven't heard of it it's hilarious

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
but Shane and X for won't shut up about that game so they were talking

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
about it on the show so I sent Ronnie

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
the link and I said something like

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
here's Frog Fractions you're welcome

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I've ruined your life or whatever or something like that

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and the guy who wrote

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Frog Fractions favorited it

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
like I didn't hashtag it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I didn't include him he just randomly

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
sees the tweet I guess so it's

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
just funny like and I'm assuming

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Metacritic found my other thing this

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
week in a similar fashion yeah probably

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
if you mention anybody they'll have they have someone who's

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
watching the Twitters and will exactly watch

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
what you say on Twitter

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
so yeah so I played that

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and mainly I had gotten all the trophies

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
except for we still needed

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the hardest trophy to get in the game

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
was to do the first level

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
only using three paintballs

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and the point of the game is you splatter paint around

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
at least the first part of the game

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
you splatter paint around to see where you're going

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and it's kind of like a puzzler

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
it's kind of built like a shooter though

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
you know cause you just have like you're just shooting paintballs

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
all over the place can you make dirty noises while you're doing it

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
cause the way you describe it where you're like shooting paint everywhere

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
you could make these really disgusting noises like

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
then

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
not quite like that it just sounds like a

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
paintball gun

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
so uh

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
we did that my wife kind of

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
talked me through oh okay what next time you play

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
you should try it there was something in that game that did

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
make a dirty sound I can't remember it now though

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
especially with the wife around not the kids so much

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
but with the wife around see they're always around when we play

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
the game that's because they love it so much

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
but yeah so we we we did that my wife

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
talked me through it she found a guide

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
online and it's like walk backwards

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
until you hit a wall walk left until you

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
hit a wall walk straight you'll hear

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
leaves cracking under your feet cause you

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
pretty much do level blind everything's

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
completely whited out so I

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
we got that trophy and that was our 100% for that

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
so that was really cool and the other game

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I played of course was Ni No Kuni

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I passed the 31 hour mark

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
last night and I played a little bit more today

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
did it go downhill after 15 hours?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
no I have no idea what that

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
was about I don't know maybe my hours are different

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
than other people's because I've been doing everything

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
so I guess you can't really get

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I don't know can you hit a wall

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
if you're just doing everything? I don't think so

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
speed do it really fast and then you kind of

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
maybe you haven't gone out there cause it is pretty

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
grindy though I found it it's not

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
super grindy for me because if I do the quest

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
in the process of doing the quest I fight enough battles

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
that I level up and it's not

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
really felt grindy to me but I

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
could see how people would think it's

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
too grindy but I don't mind that

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I mean Secret of Mana is really really

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
grindy and there's no quest in that you just have to go out and

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
grind grind grind to get your party up

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
old school Final Fantasy games were very very

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
very grindy so I mean compared to

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
what we used to play it's not

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
grindy at all it's a walk in the park

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I felt a lot like playing WoW you know doing these

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
quests and going out and finding

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
rare pets and things like that that's what I've

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
really been getting hooked into is

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
finding all these familiars I look at some online

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
like what's the best one like oh I want to get that

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
so I go find one and I get it and

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
you have to fight a while because the taming is kind of random

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
you can't just tame it you just have to wait for it

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to kind of fall into your lap

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I've gotten very lucky apparently

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I spent an hour

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
trying to get uh what is that town

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Alma Moon the one with the milk right

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
yeah were you trying to get the babanas the big

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
uh banana guys

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I had to search for the banana guys

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
for an hour

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
an hour and then finally

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I trapped one and then here's the hilarious

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
part right because for that quest you have to get the banana

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and the turban monkey right yeah so

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I go and I'm like all excited so

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I go to turn in the banana and he's like oh you

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
got the bananas but you didn't get the turban monkey

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
well what I didn't realize is that the turban

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
monkey had evolved

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
because I had him in my party so the

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
turban monkey evolved so I had to go get another

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
one they don't evolve unless you give him a

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
treat well he was in my party

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I wanted him to evolve I didn't realize that was

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
so adorable I'm gonna feed you

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
he was so hungry I wanted him

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I don't evolve very quickly don't feed him after midnight

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
yeah I fed him after midnight and that was my mistake

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
yeah well that's pretty bad

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I could have screamed

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I could have screamed that's why I haven't played in a

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
week and a half I'm still punishing the game

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
well see when I do those quests I usually go

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
out and just do that because I consider

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that kind of one of my grind sessions because I know those

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I think it's only come up

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
one at a time in a different town but

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and then that's like the first thing I'll do I'm like oh this is a

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
good time to grind because this

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
one quest requires a lot of grinding so I'll go out

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
and I'll go tame the three pets

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
and then I'll bring them back and I bring them back

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
right away so I didn't realize

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
but I didn't know that was something

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
that would mess it up so now it's good to know

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
you don't ever evolve your

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I have only evolved the main ones that I use

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I don't evolve a lot of them

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I evolve them all

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
well if you hold on to them a little bit their stats get better

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
and the stats carry over

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
like I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not gonna miss

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
anything by evolving them but then I'll evolve them

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
yeah that's usually a good point to do

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
some of them I hold out longer

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
because some of them are more like late bloomers and stuff

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
so you can actually stretch them out a little bit longer

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
have more stats carry over

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it's not a big deal if you're just gonna play through the game and beat it

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
but there's some end game stuff in there

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
some post game that there's certain pets that are

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
really strong and so if you just

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
kinda keep them in your party just let them level

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
they'll be like really powerful by the end of the game

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and you do the colosseum stuff

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
like I already did the first round of the colosseum

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and I beat that and it was really hard

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
but I got through that

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the fencer puppy is really good right?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
or is it a kitty?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
yeah I have that he's pretty good

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I still like them on might and I look online and people say

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
oh the mighty might's not that good

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
but I don't know I really like him

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
he's got a shield he defends really well

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
he blocks out of attacks I use him I still use him as my main guys tank

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
so

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
yeah I don't know people complain about him though

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I guess but the cat is getting better

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
the cat's lower too

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
but I've metamorphosized both those guys

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I just kinda have two metamorphosized pets

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
and I always use my third slot just as like a leveling slot

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and I did just get the new Nino Cooney one

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
the one that's free on the Playstation network

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I was just gonna ask you to talk quickly about the downloads

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
cause there's a free like what gold one

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
or something?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
it's a little well mine was a little red dragon

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and I named it Little Strazza

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
a little WoW reference cause it looks like

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
it reminds me of Alex Strazza in the Red Dragons

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
like it looks just like a red whelpling from WoW

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
so I named it Little Strazza and uh

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
yeah and it's a little red dragon

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and I've not even used it in combat yet

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
but it's

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I've heard it's pretty good and I looked online

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
most of the dragons are really good

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
so I'm gonna work on that one

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
you reminded me about names have you really just sat there

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and read some of the suggested names

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
cause every Pokemon that you can pick in the game

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
has like four suggested names

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and some of them are so fucking funny

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
like the Turban Monkey thing

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
uh one of the suggested names was Turbanula

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I died

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I died some of them are so

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
funny I need to look at that now

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I look at the first one and I always change it

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
always cycle through cause there's four for each one

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
well I named him Toad Bandit cause he looked kinda like

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Toad but with a bandit mask on

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
so you're Toad Bandit

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
ok so though I have to ask this

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
cause this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
is it when you rename them they keep that name

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
like forever through all of their evolutions

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
but does it still let you know what

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
they originally are? you know he's talking

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon right?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm sorry I was thinking of Pokemon

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
it's really a lot

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
it's pretty much the same fucking thing

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I never played Pokemon but now I'm kinda interested cause I'm like

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
this game's really fun maybe I would like Pokemon cause I like

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
getting my familiars I like feeding them

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
the combat is the totally different part

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I'm sorry I had looked down for a moment

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Pokemon?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
to answer your question even though you didn't ask about this

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
you can rename them

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
but it will say what the name of their

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
kind of general familiar is

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
so if you need to look something up on that you can

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
for anyone else who's interested in that

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and that was my gaming week

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Ni No Kuni lots of it

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Ni No Lots of Kuni

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000

events or anything of note coming up so

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I mean episode 500 but that's not until April

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
we still don't know what we're doing yet

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
should be fun

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
alright let's move into some gaming

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
news tonight and talk about what's

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
going on in the world of gaming some big news today right

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Logie? Yeah so today Bungie

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
revealed Destiny

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and they have like a little kind of behind

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
the scenes development video that showed

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
actual I'm pretty

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
sure no actual gameplay

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
or if there was it was so insignificant

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
that I didn't remember

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
but basically

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Destiny is this

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
always on persistent

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
kind of first person

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
shooter adventure

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I guess where you

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
take on these guardians

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
of kind of one of the last

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
civilizations

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
in the solar system

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and you kind of venture out to

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
different planets and stuff like that and fight

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
aliens and

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
all sorts of stuff so it's kind of I think

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
what you know originally the description was

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
kind of like a single player co-op

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and you know

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
multiplayer game all mixed together

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
all at once

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
it should be interesting

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I'm not sure exactly how

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
how they're going to how you're going to

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
interact with their people it was going to be like kind of an emo

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
this reminded me it sounded a lot like

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
fantasy star I guess

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
you know where as that was

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
you know fantasy star online

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that's a good way of putting it that is

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
kind of what it sounds like where it's like you have the

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
central hub type of thing but you can go out with

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
friends and I guess

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
they were showing I actually did watch one of

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
the four minute videos they put out where

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
they showed how the iPhone I'm assuming

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Android as well would integrate with it where you could like

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
send messages like let's meet up on Venus

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
or something like that I don't know

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and you can let's meet up on Uranus

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
hahaha

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
let's do some

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
grinding on Uranus dark side of Uranus

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
alright anyways

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
yeah so it

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
looks neat I mean definitely

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
a huge franchise

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
they've got like a ten year plan with it

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
and they're just gonna

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
wait wait wait ten year plan

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the game announced for PlayStation

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
3 and Xbox 360 right?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I think it's going to be probably

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
and then probably whatever next gen consoles also

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
so their ten year plan

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
is how to get you to buy it three times

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
is that really what the ten year plan consists of?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
it's got to be right?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I'm not sure

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
yeah I think so because they're going to get you

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
on the PlayStation 3 and 360 where the game

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
comes out which it's assuming

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
the game comes out this holiday season

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Destiny is going to be going up against

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
these new consoles which

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
if Destiny is as ambitious as they say

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I mean go back to our last weeks show

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
about how

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
much these new consoles

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
really need to be here right now and if people

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
are going to adopt them

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I would imagine there's versions of

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Destiny in development for these

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
next to the world

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
but it's definitely not going to be just next gen

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
they can't

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Activision is smart enough to know

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
we're not going to gamble on

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
next gen right away

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
they're going to do it like okay we're going to put out

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
stuff at the same time that way if you want the next gen

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
version of the game you will have it

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
if you want a current gen version of the game you can have that too

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
because they know that there's a huge

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
install base already why cut out

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
all that money?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and none for Wii U buy

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
that's hard to say with Activision

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I mean because they've got

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
they have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and they even have a few games coming out although

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I mean out in the hot excited I began

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
about like re-releasing

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
the amazing Spiderman

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
that was the Xbox 360 version

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
they have Wii U version 4

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
The Walking Dead

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
and even though they did Call of Duty

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
they're still supporting the Wii U

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
actually Activision is a pretty strong supporter

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
of the Wii U right now

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
maybe followed up by

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Ubisoft although

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
you know a lot of their games

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
aren't coming to the Wii U

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I would say

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I would see a Wii U version of this coming out

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I mean especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
why not they would work

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
did you find the lack of PC interesting?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
because I sure did

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
yeah a little bit

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I mean the PC is the thing that could

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
evolve over those 10 years

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and the PC is the one thing that will still be here

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
you know us people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
but this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I mean who's to say

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
that there's not going to be a PC version for it

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
this is just kind of like

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
hey we're announcing this thing

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
really say which consoles it's going to be on

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
so they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
it's just

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I don't know

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
what did you think about all this?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
what do you think?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
because I have an opinion that others might not agree with

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
but what do you think Loki?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
but I don't know really much about it yet

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I mean I'm not going to be like oh my god Bungie made it

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I got to go buy it

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I didn't really buy Halo

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I bought Halo 3

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
that was the only Halo game I ever owned

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and I was just kind of like okay this is hard

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I mean it's just not like

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I don't lose my shit over Bungie games

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I'm going to be blunt

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
this whole video I watched

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
this whole pomp and circumstance

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
this is our big ambition

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and I really felt like

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
half that video was like

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
well you know we made Halo

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and we got to follow up to that and Halo was this

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
and we've poured all our company into this

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
since Halo and Halo Halo Halo Halo

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
like they had to name check Halo

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
but here's the thing that gets me about that

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Halo 2, one of the greatest

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
video games ever made

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
and here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
is that Halo 4

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
which Bungie didn't do

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
was better than Halo 3

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
yes

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
absolutely in many ways was better than Halo 3

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
better than Halo 2

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I don't know

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
gaming was a lot different with all those years in between

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and Halo 2 really pushed so many things

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
forward in a different way

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
but you know Halo 4 they didn't have anything to do with

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and it was a better game than what they did

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
at the end of the run

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I'm not the only one thinking it okay

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
so when they talk about all this

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Destiny stuff and like you know how much

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
of their Halo influence and all this has to do

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I'm kind of like

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
now are they saying that they had

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
one foot out the door when ODST

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
and all this stuff was being done and they were already

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
working on Destiny or what

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
what stock am I putting into this

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
because really I felt like all we heard

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
about today was an idea

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and although some of it's interesting like the iPhone

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
integration and

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
you know what this felt like?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
this felt like a Kickstarter video

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
like at the very end

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
at the very end they're gonna like

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
okay and now we need you to back this

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
pre-order it we need you to go pre-order it

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and back the game yes

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
that is a great comparison

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
that is really what it felt like

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
it felt like somebody's Kickstarter video

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
and it's like

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
and there was very little gameplay in it

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
there was some gameplay

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I sort of remember

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
the gameplay I saw was

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
nothing new

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
nothing new but granted it was three seconds

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
of gameplay but I looked at it and went

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
okay so you can co-op with your friends

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and maybe they're gonna be putting like

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
a warlock type class and a hunter class

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and a first person shooter

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
in more of a mass effect way than a

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Diablo way but I'm still like

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I mean I'm not convinced

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
that this is like the OMG

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
rule breaking

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
game that's gonna have a ten year cycle

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
well here's the thing I'm wondering though

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
cause if you have this coming out and this is supposed to be

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
like a first person shooter let's just say

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
where are they gonna put this as far as in

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
comparison to Call of Duty I mean if it's gonna

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
release with a next gen console

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
or something like that or around that time

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I mean you're gonna

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
it's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
you're gonna have Grand Theft Auto in September

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
you're gonna have some massive games in

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
November you're gonna have another Call of Duty

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
game you're gonna have

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
it's just

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
where are they gonna put a game of this

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
size I guess

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I don't know it's Activision

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
it's gonna be weird to see them

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
splitting their resources as far

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
as marketing goes between Destiny

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kinda like

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
well Call of Duty's just not quite

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
you know what it used to be we're just gonna

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
kinda back burner that

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
a little bit and just kinda release something

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
that's a slight upgrade and people will buy

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
it and then we'll focus all of our

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
money into this because this is our

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
10 year deal thing

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm looking

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
at some comments in our chat room at

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
live.vognetwork.com code man says

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
this is the first I've heard of this game is that

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
bad?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
No because when you really need to hear about

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
the game is you know just before the game comes out

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
those week one sales but this is

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
their efforts to get more people talking

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
about it success here we are and now you've

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
been educated on it so here's the thing too

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
why announce it now it's like a really weird

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
time to announce it I mean why not

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
it's an empty floor in Telly 3

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
why is Sony doing a big announcement next week

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
there's not a lot of other stuff

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
video game things for people to be writing about

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Sony I think needs something you know because

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
right now you know they don't have any

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Playstation I mean they kind of announced

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
their slate of Playstation 3 titles with

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
The Last of Us and

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
then they've got you know

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
a couple games that I don't think a lot of

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
people care about like Puppeteer

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
and was it the

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Beyond

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Beyond Two Souls which Beyond Two Souls

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
looks alright but I mean let's be honest that's not going to be

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
like this huge it's

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
it's still kind of niche I mean

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
the genre and

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
then their Puppeteer game which I got to be honest

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
their kind of

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
kids' titles aren't doing very well or the

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
children's titles I guess or younger

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
skewed titles

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
so I think they have to

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
really come out with you know

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
here's what our game plan is you guys

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
you know stick with us you know especially

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
with the Vita because holy crap

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Vita there's nothing really announced other than

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
we know there's that new game from

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Media Molecule there's going to be

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
the Killzone shooter game and

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
and what? There could

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
be some type of ace in the hole

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
with the next Playstation we don't know how

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
the next Playstation will interface with the Vita

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
could it do a Wii U type of thing

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
because that apparently now everybody feels like they have to call you

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
you know because I know

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
a little bit later in the show but like

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
my bar for the Playstation 4

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
right now is set so fucking low

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that's good though that's a good place

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
for Sony to be in isn't it?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
don't they want I mean if the bar is low that's

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
actually good news yeah

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
because they could really kick your ass

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
with these expectations

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
but here's the thing I'm setting the bar so low

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
because I don't think they're going to hit that even

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I mean it's just I don't expect anything

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
from them I just I'm expecting to be

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
kind of like

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
huh okay cool

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
well here's the other thing too is

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
remember guys it's February

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
and the console won't be out until

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
November I'm sure is a safe bet if it's not

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
delayed right

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
so you know

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
don't expect them to say a lot

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
you know maybe we'll get some pictures

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
maybe we'll see a couple

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
of the games but don't expect

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
price don't expect release

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
date don't expect all the bells and whistles

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
expect an idea

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
of what Sony thinks the next

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
generation of gaming is please God

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
do not be Facebook

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
just don't I don't know

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
social game I really

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
just I'm going to get irritated

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
if I hear that word too much at the same time

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
hmm I kind of hope

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
some more memes seriously

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
we need more

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
well this is why it's a pre-recorded thing

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Namco Namco

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I bet I'm expecting a Ridge Racer

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
okay I'm expecting a Ridge Racer

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
game it's been a while okay

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I need a new Ridge Racer game

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
alright I'm going to move on with news from a company

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
we always expect great things from

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
which had a surprising announcement this week

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
that they actually let some people go

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
it's Valve

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
yeah apparently up to 25

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
people were affected by these changes

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
now a lot of this is very vague

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
but some of this came from a tweet

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
that said yep got fired today time

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
for new exciting projects

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
so that was somebody

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
at Valve and was working on hardware

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and the

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
internet did some more research and found out

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
that part of what she had been working on was living room

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
PC controllers

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
also affected

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
thanks to internet research

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
director of business development Jason

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Holtman had left the company

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
some employee

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
pages on Valve's site actually changed

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
pretty significantly

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
very interesting

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
renewal did end up commenting on this to

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Engadgett

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
so

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
it could have nothing to do with

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
layoffs maybe something

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
it could be a personnel issue although

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
that's a hell of a

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
speculation

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
let's just say that he was working on

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
controllers

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't think they really need to

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
work on a controller because it's already

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
controller

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
why do we need another controller?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Steambox would come with its own controller

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
yeah but whatever

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
just use another third party controller

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I don't think they really need to

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
make another controller

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
just use an existing controller

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
support any controller

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
here's the other thing

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
happen at really weird times for reasons

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
because the project is done

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
to another and it's not like the business is always

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
constant there's not projects that

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
go on forever unless

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
maybe Bungie is feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
but if Destiny doesn't do very well

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
oh if that flops

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
that will hose the whole

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
company but anyway that's neither here nor there

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
projects start and projects end

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and if there's not a new project to go to when

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
one project ends people are let go

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
it sucks but it happens that's the game

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
industry so

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
it's just weird to hear it coming from

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Valve because it's like dude shouldn't he

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
be working on Half Life 3?

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
but who knows what they have up their sleeve

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
oh no there could be no Half Life 3

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
we will be waiting forever

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I still if you want to sell

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
a million of those Steam Boxes

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
just announce two exclusives

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
announce one exclusive

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
anything that ends in 3

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
coming out of Valve I'm talking

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Half Life 3, Portal 3

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
any of those gets the lead

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
on the Steam Box

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Steam Box will sell more than we do

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Half Life 2, Episode 3

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Half Life 3, Portal 3

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Team Fortress 3 and

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you'll outsell Wii U in like a day

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
and maybe like

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Garry's Mod X3 I don't know

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
alright let's move on

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Dark Saga

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
how about something that's

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
a little less frustrating

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
as soon as I can get a stupid

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
iPad to work

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
ok so

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
there have been some leaks

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
and there's people are kind of

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
oh ok you know

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
taking it a little bit in stride

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
but there is a few issues

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
that are coming out with the

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
DualShock 4 release image

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
who all here has seen it

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
so I don't

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
ok

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
well the controller itself

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
and the photo by the way

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
also shows that that might be a dev kit

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
for the Orbis dev kit

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
but they're saying that

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
you know just on the

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
items pointed out on the controller

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
itself is that there's the two point multi

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
touch pad

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
the move tracking light on the controller

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
itself

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
the loudspeaker and a headphone

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
socket and then they're talking

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
about what they're seeing on the

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
what they're I'm guessing to be the

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Orbis dev kit would be

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
two USB 3.0

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
slots and

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
just a number of other things

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
they're basically saying that

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
it's

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
going to be some pretty

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
hardcore material and they have

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
a lot of high hopes for the controller

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
now honestly I think that that might be

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
a little too much in the controller I'm actually wondering

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
how much it's going to weigh

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and I don't think it's going to come out with

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
all of the things that they're trying to

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
pump into it but it's interesting

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
it does raise some questions

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I think it's actually it's not multi

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
touch on that touch pad it's just

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
single and there's the rear touch pad

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
from the Vita isn't it?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
the rear one is multi touch

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
you can pinch and stuff like that

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
but what's kind of different

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
about it though is they're saying that it's

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
basically going to be used for interfaces and basic

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
stuff I don't even know why you need it to be

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
honest and then

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
of course they are reshaping the

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
trigger buttons on there they say

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
they're supposed to be a little bit more springy like the

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
360 stuff

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
surely you've all seen the gif of where

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
the little move light is actually a

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
siren and then the little screen is flashing

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
used game, used game, used game

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that's the purpose of the

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
screen

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
the little loud speaker

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
so Popo can come get you

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
it looks like the analog sticks they've got a little

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
difference on the top of it it's kind of

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
got a little bit of lip on the edge of

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
the actual sticks themselves

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
so that your thumbs don't fall off of them

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
like they do on the PS3 ones

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
the one thing that they're saying with this one

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
is actually that they were

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
saying that there wasn't a corresponding

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
touch on the

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
back this is on the front of the controller

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
is where the touch is showing

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
well that's good because the rear touch

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
on the Vita

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
that would just be irritating

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and then the other things there's a

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
share button on there that was spotted

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
in the upper left

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
hand corner of the touch pad area

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
that actual speaker spot

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
they're saying might actually be a microphone

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
kind of similar

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
to what's on the Vita I guess

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
or could it maybe pick

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
finally it picks up your voice

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
like there's a built in cross voice chat

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
thing on Playstation like there should have been all along

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
had like a built in headset

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
in there where you could put your headphones plugged in

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
opponent?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I think it's one goldmine

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
that we use missing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
we got this virtual console and all this stuff

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
why can't I play games online

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
with my friends and video chat with them at the same time?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
the problem though is I don't think that would work

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
because if you think about it there's no camera

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
on the actual controller itself

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
that you can see

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
no I don't think there's actually a camera

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you would see a camera on that

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I mean I don't think

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
here's what I want to know

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
so they've got that little bar at the end that's basically

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
supposed to be like the move stuff

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
how the fuck are you supposed to do that

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
as like a move controller

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I mean it doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
at all

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
because I remember you can use the dual shock

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
3 for the kind of

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
nunchuck portion if you will

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I bet there's a way you grip it sideways

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
you can probably grip it sideways

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and like use your fist

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I understand that you could probably grip it sideways

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
but your fingers would probably naturally

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
your fingers would want to go over that light

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
because you'd be holding on to the middle of it

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
and your hand's going to want to go over

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
that sensor in the middle

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I just don't think that's a good design

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
either that or they're going to have a separate

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
move related something

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and this is going to be more for just like

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
a gestural almost like the 6 axis

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
yeah I'm wondering if it's not

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I think it's going to be more like that

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
6 axis in a way

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
maybe instead of

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
you need to remember very important

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
this is a prototype big word

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
there this will change

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
this is not what the controller is going to look like

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
maybe it could be grippy

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm making shit up

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
there could be other things we don't see on it now

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
these things can and will change

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
they always always do so that's not

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
the final look of that controller

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
that'll be interesting I still don't understand what they're

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
going to use that touchpad for

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
the share button idea I guess that's kind of neat

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
but once again that also kind of scares me

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
because that gets in the whole social

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
gameplay stuff you know where

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
oh I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
you guys can watch me

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
beat up this hooker

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
well you're getting the Ouya aren't you?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
so maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
the touchpad on the front of the Ouya I believe

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
is multi-touch and I think that's meant for playing

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
like other

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Android games that would not use

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
the controller like you could actually use that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
to play

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Angry Birds or something like that

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
cause I'm like how do you

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
translate on a tiny little screen

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
what's going to happen on the

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
that is tough yeah cause you wouldn't

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
it's not as easy as looking at a touch screen

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
where okay I can see where my finger is

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I know where I'm hitting but you know

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
having it translate

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
although you say that but then you know

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
we all use touchpads so

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
we seem to figure out a way around that

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
uh Black Wolf

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
name checks Uno in a comment to me

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
and I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
about have a video camera so other people can watch

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I mean Uno was a huge selling game

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I don't know if it was because of the camera future

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
well but I mean cause the game's

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
years old it was a huge seller

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
no it was five bucks

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
five or ten yeah

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
you got the camera

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
the camera upgrade was free it didn't originally

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
support the camera cause the camera wasn't out yet

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
but then when the little vision cam came out

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
they did a free upgrade for it

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
let's see what else

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
there was a comment from whatupG

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Sony just show what they want

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
the PS4 controller to be

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
and then change big time like the boomerang did

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
boomerang is an excellent example

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
of how things can and will change

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
or a perfect example

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
the zapper controller

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
that they showed at E3

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
for the Wii that looked fucking amazing

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
and then they put out a piece of plastic shit

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
so works in reverse too

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
it could

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
alright let's move on with more news

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
speaking of Nintendo

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
they had some announcements

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and it's very exciting if you're

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
a 3DS owner

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
lots of news for you guys including game announcements

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
they announced a brand new Mario

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
and Luigi Dream Team

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
kind of a new game in that franchise

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
also

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
that's supposed to be coming out

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
for the 3DS

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I don't think it was

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
they have a special deal now

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
if you haven't bought a 3DS

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
if you buy the 3DS

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
XL and Luigi's Mansion

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
you get a free game

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
including Super Mario 3D Land

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and Star Fox 64 3D

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and some other games you probably don't want

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Mario Golf

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
World T coming to the 3DS

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
this summer

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
so that's kind of exciting

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
there's a new Mario game

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Mario and Donkey Kong game

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
more puzzle stuff, that's going to be coming to the 3DS

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
eShop as well as a new

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dylan's Rolling Western

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The Last Ranger

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
that's going to be coming out on March 11th

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
which actually that's supposed to be

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
kind of a pretty cool game as well

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The Harmony Knight

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The Harmony Knight and Curseploosh

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Curseploosh is a really weird premise

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Have you ever wondered what it's like

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
to be a rock thrown down a well?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
No

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Well now you can

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Doomplague in chat says was Fire Emblem on that list

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
at the Nintendo Direct

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I think that just came out

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
for the 3DS

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
coming out

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And last but not least, the most important news

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
June 9th, North America

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
June 14th in Europe

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Animal Crossing New Leaf

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
coming out

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The better question is

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
though, what did they have for the Wii U?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
not a whole lot actually

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The Wii U, couple announcements

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
DLC that's going to be coming out for

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
New Super Mario Brothers U

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So that'll be coming out later on

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Oh, I'm sorry

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah, it's alright, you're biting some of my stories

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I do have other stuff on Wii U

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Just one little thing

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Honestly, I checked it out this week

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
and it's not really that big a deal

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It's Wii Street U

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
which is the Google enhanced thing

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It's basically Google Maps for your Wii U

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You know what?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It's neat because it's something different

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
you can't really get anywhere else

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
and it is pretty smooth

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's a pretty smooth experience

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
How is Google Maps on the Vita?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Because of the whole fact it's got the gyroscope

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and you can kind of look around

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I'll have to show it on the Vita?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I think you just get the normal maps

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I don't know if it does the whole sensor

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Does it? Or even with phones

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I think you can do that

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Not on Google Earth on iPhone

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
No, this operates very differently

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and it's all set up so that

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
there's places already bookmarked

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
to go take a look at and stuff

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
The interface is interesting

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I mean, it's neat

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
It's the type of thing you would see as a demo

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
but it's not exactly

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
going to sell any systems or make people

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
feel like, ooh, there's all this new value in my system

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I like how they said free for a limited amount

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
of time, like someone's really

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
going to buy this one

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I don't know if I would have paid money for it

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
unless it was really, really cheap

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So, I don't know

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The Super Luigi DLC looks

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
interesting though because it sounds like they're talking about

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
basically just redoing the whole game almost

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
and they're going to redo all the levels and everything

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah, that's a perfect way of putting out another

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
new Super Mario Brothers game

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
without actually putting out another new Super Mario Brothers game

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
It's done with DLC

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
You know what though? I'm okay with that

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
because you're talking about $20 DLC versus $60 game

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
We don't know what the price is on that

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I guess we'll see

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You should be careful what I say

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
but I can't imagine it's going to be as much

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
as you think it is

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Also, on the Wii U

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
a new Miiverse community

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
for Zelda

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I actually

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
watched the Nintendo Direct and they did

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
kind of make a little bit of a deal about this

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
where they're like, it's the first Miiverse

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
about Zelda and you know it's just going to be

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
a bunch of people with a really creative artwork

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and so forth

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
which I guess it's neat but it's weird to me

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
that this is a

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
big deal

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
a game behind it, what a fucking concept

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
That's stupid, and the other thing too

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
is we love your amazing artwork

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
couldn't you think of an idea of

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
hey, how about we put some places

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
where you can showcase that artwork

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
we'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I'm pretty much going to guess

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Well, Loki, it's showcased when you turn the system on

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
That's all built into the whole

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I understand that, but I'm just saying

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
that this is basically the equivalent of a

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
forum, how hard is it to

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
create a sub-forum in a forum

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Apparently really difficult for Nintendo

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
engineers Let's also not forget

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
though that this forum is coming to iPhones

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
which was a pretty big announcement of the last

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Nintendo Direct, so they're kind of setting the stage

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
for that, but again

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I like Miiverse

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
There's a lot about it I do like

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and I've talked about that before when I talked about

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
the Wii U in general

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but I don't think this is like a game changer

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It's a logical next step

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Here's my worry

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Maybe theory or something

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
This whole thing

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
they're all like, oh there's a lot of news

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
and 3DS fans

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
This is so that

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
you guys know there's stuff coming

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
There wasn't really anything for the Wii U

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
though, it was all 3DS

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
so which makes me wonder

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
how far away are we from an announcement that

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
gamepad, because they have a ton of shit

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
coming out for the 3DS and

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
nothing coming out for the Wii U

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It makes perfect sense to say, hey

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
2 birds 1 stone, there you go

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
They won't be in 3D, but no one uses

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
the 3D feature anyways, we'll just have

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
the top screen up on the TV

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
bottom screen up on your gamepad, done

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
eShop

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
What gets me is that

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
they did this whole thing about

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
it's the year of Luigi

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and they really went all out

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and every little shot of one of their talking heads

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
had a little Luigi doll back there

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
but I was like, okay the only Luigi

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
which we already knew that was a thing

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and that was going to be coming, and then they say

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Luigi's a character in the golf game

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
and then this Luigi DLC

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
which is cool, yes, but

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to brand it all as the year of Luigi

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I was kind of like

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
yay

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You know what you need is a Waluigi vs. Luigi

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
game

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Just, you know, I don't know

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Just say we've got Luigi content

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Whatever, whatever

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Well that makes me wonder, when is this new

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Super Luigi content coming out

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
If it's the year of Luigi, it's not going to be

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
first half of the year

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So you could be waiting for this crap until

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
fourth quarter

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I got it, a new Mario is missing

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Did we say the year of Luigi? We meant the

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
decade of Luigi

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I mean, I'm just

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The eventually

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Once again, I would have thought

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Especially after all these announcements of delays

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Even some delays by Nintendo

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Like of their first party titles

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
That they would have said, hey, you know what

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
being delayed, here's what we have coming

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So that, you know, but they had nothing

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
They had nothing to announce

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Oh, Doom Plague mentions in our chat room

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The part of the Luigi thing

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
was also a new Mario and Luigi game

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Where you're inside Luigi's dream

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Okay, yes, I forgot about that

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
character to me. You are inside his dream

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So... I don't want to be

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
inside Luigi How are you

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Luigi inside Luigi? You're not

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's Luigi-ception

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It's like Mario Innerspace

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
So again, it's not like

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Okay, so it's just

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
These were all things that existed where like

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Stretch people, we need a

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
theme, people

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
What's the theme, people?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Let's, you know, go inside the dream

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
The Pikmin versus

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Garden Gnomes

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Lego City Stories

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Luigi

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Scene Legos

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Luigi likes Legos

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Luigi likes Legos

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Ah

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Crap

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Legend of Zelda Wind Waker

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
They're both green! Yes?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Yes? Green?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The Legend of Luigi

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Alright, let's move on with more news

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And then we'll get to release dates

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Dark Sakura

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Jeez, well

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Back to the, and this is now we're getting into

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
depressing. The Wii U

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
has sold a few systems

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
A few, and by a few I mean

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
55,000 in January

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And this is just US numbers

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Do you know how many Xbox 360's

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
were sold?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
281,000. So a system

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
that's already been out for a few years

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
is outselling the brand new

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Wii U. And is cheaper and has more games

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
to be fair. But

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
still, you know

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
they, um

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
their goal was supposed to be

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I think over 100,000

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
well, well over that really

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
but they've completely undersold

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
and so now, um

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
they're, uh

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
they had announced

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
that if it had sold

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
um, uh, if

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
that it sold

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
3.06 million

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
worldwide as of December

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
but

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
now, um, their forecast of

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
5.5 million has gone down to 4 million

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
worldwide. And I bet it's gonna go down again

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
at the end of this month. I don't see any more

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
systems, there's no games

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
there literally is no Wii U games coming

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
out this month. None.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I think that they're really

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
probably looking to the handheld market to

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
uphold their console market

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It gets me though that everybody

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
is crying that it's the death of Nintendo

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and now Nintendo will be forced to do

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Mario games on the 360

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Ha ha ha ha

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
This is the, the unfortunate thing

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
is that this is the exact same

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
fucking thing as the 3DS.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Exact same thing.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The 3DS launched

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
with a couple of good games, then

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
literally nothing. What, we got

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Ping Pals was a big release

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
on the 3DS. That was not

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
on 3DS. Oh no, I was regular DS. I don't know

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's still, with a Spongebob

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
game. You had shit on the 3DS

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
for a long time and then finally

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
they dropped the price and like a couple

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
years later the 3DS is bomb.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And hopefully Nintendo can make

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
magic work twice. I think

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
the only danger part is that Nintendo

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
is gonna have to work that magic

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
twice and they may have to drop the price of the

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Wii U in order to do it. Well maybe then I'd get

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
one. Yeah, I think that's awesome. But I still don't have a 3DS.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
You know, so

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Special year of Luigi

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
green Wii U

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I don't wanna see

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
a green Wii U

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm wondering what they're gonna

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
do with the price, especially when these new

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
consoles launch because it's gonna be

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
tough if they're having trouble

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
getting people to be interested in it now.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
When you have all that buzz of

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
all these awesome Wii U's. Especially

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
if, god forbid, you know

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
that Destiny or something like that is not

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
on the Wii U.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Granted I was on the Wii U

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Destiny's on the Wii U

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Madden's not on the Wii U

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
People are gonna be like, well why do I need a Wii U?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Yeah but if Zelda's on the Wii U

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's Wind Waker though!

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I'm not even talking about Wind Waker

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Yeah, new Zelda games not coming out this year.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
other than Wind Waker HD.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But that would be

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
enough for some people though.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Something else to think about though

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
All they would have to do

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Wind Waker HD comes with one

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
playable HD Zelda level.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Flying off shelves

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
You won't be able to find that shit anywhere

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Watch

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
had the Metal Gear

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
in it that actually wasn't bad

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and got a sequel

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Crackdown

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Alundra, didn't it have

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
the Final Fantasy 7 demo?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I know I was saying Alundra

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
How many people bought that

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and all the Dragon Ball fans?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yeah that was it, it was the 8 demo.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But anyway

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
There's a lot of people who will go out

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh shoot

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Was it

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
one of the games had a Xenogears

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
demo with it too?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And there's people

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
who will just buy a game to get the demo

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
of something that they want more

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Here's the thing honestly

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Is because once these 3DS games

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
are out it is all hands on fucking

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
deck for the Wii U

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Everybody at Nintendo first and second parties

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
are going to be cranking out shit for Wii U

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
It is Wii U's last stand and it's going to be

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
pretty fucking amazing to watch play out

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I think that's why it's so

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
3DS heavy because I think the holiday is going to end up

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
pretty weak because I think

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
there's like rush projects happening

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
They're going to crank it out

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
for this holiday season, they have to

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And if we're still sitting here

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
next January telling the same tale

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
then I'll

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
better be cooking up a Mario game

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
for the Playstation 4

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And in the end as long as there are

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
people who have little kids they want to play

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
games, they're going

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
to go for a Nintendo system

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Nintendo has that level of

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
brand recognition and the association

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
that they're working as a kid

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
friendly, family friendly system

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
until the kid

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
falls over and drops the tablet

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
and breaks it

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I agree, they're owning the

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
handheld market but

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
they may just not be a console

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
But they weren't

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
But they may just not be a console

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
company anymore

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Too early

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I'm not, I don't want you

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
to say I'm Nintendo defending

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
and all this stuff, I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
It is pretty shitty

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
This is having a worse month

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
These numbers are so

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
bad, it is worse than any month

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
like the 360

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
PlayStation 3

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I wouldn't go that far

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
has on record

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
What were Dreamcast sales like

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
in their first couple months?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
It's just a different culture now

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
There have been

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
people that were drawing comparisons

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
between Sega's last days

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and Nintendo

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Which is redonkulous

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That whole Nei saying whatever

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
That's like the anti-fanboy

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It's no better

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
How well did GameCube do?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It was third place and Nintendo did fine

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
As long as they're making enough money to keep

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
costs up in the company

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
As long as they're turning a profit

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
or at least breaking even

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
The handhelds

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
are going to do that for them just fine

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
They'll make it just fine

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
They'll be around

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It's not going to be like Sega

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Sega didn't have that handheld

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Sega also had some stupid marketing

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
They also had

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
really bad piracy

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That was the downfall of the Dreamcast

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
had an entire CD

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
spindle of burned games

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Every single burned game

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And then had their boot disk to play their imports

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Yep

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
No comment

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Some people had

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Para Para on their Dreamcast Rob

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I don't think that system is done

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I just think that right now

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
They're not doing a lot

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Basically the thing is they're not

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
that they should buy a Wii U

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
That's my thing

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
They need to have some sort of

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
here's what's coming out

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
soon

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah, working on Smash Bros. game

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Yeah, you know what?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You could have just launched this system and not said anything

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros. game

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Hell fuck!

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Just say, hey we're working on an F-Zero game

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
That would sell a few more systems

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Rob would buy another system, there you go

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Hell yeah

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But I want to see the receipts

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
You already bought a system, Rob

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I did buy a system, I'll buy another for F-Zero

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I will, I need two gamepads

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Two tablet controllers, yeah

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Such a consumer war

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
To register participation

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
passphrase, package

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That's true

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
This week we've got a couple big games

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
coming out, the first one being Crysis 3

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
and PC

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
on Playstation 3 and

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Xbox 360

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
We've got a PSP title, yes, there's actually

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
a PSP game coming out still

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Axis Games putting out

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
visual novels for some reason on the PSP

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Hakuoki, Warriors of

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Shinsengumi on

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
the PSP

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I want to play that

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Possibly at the end of this week

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
the add-on content pack for Playstation 3 and

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Xbox 360

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
You can buy the content stuff

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
or pre-order the game

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Or your console isn't online

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
You'll also be missing out on the next

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
gen systems

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I'm planning on picking one of these up because

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
it allows me to install them into multiple systems

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
and I've got two systems that we play on

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Yes, I'm sure, it's all on disk

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Alright, then I can move on to

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Japan

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
On the Playstation 3 in Japan this week, some price

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
reductions, the best series for

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Combat Assault Horizon, Dragon Ball Z

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Ultimate Blast, Naruto

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Ultimate Ninja Storm 2

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Ryuga Gotoku of the End

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
and Saint Seiya Senkai

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
As far as new games go, on February 21

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
comes out in Japan

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
That's pretty awesome

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Did you say there was a Saint Seiya game?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Uh, yeah

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Going into the beta, it's not new

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Oh, it's a re-release, ok

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Also, how did I miss this?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I'm on the PS3, also on a price reduction this week

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
in Japan. Don't you want to play Mass Effect

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
with all Japanese garris?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I don't know if they did the voiceovers again

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
if the subtitles are...

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
to see if the voice is nearly as hot

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It might be subs, it might not be dubs

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
We don't know

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Well, that just looks like the

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
US trailer

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah, it doesn't

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
So it's probably just subs

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Oh well

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Anyhow, let's look at other systems

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
How about anything on the Xbox 360?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Uh, price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
You have that to look forward to on the 360

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think that we

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
use bad here

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah, exactly

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And that's another thing people tend to forget

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
is that, you know, oh well, forget it

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
On the Vita, yes

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
the Vita in Japan

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
CL No Surge

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Ushina Ureta Hoshi Isasagushi

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Reincarnation

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Also, next rev

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Shoushi Shiken comes out

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
both new games on the Vita this week

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Did you know that?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I won't

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
On the Wii U in Japan this week

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
there is a game, Tank Tank Tank

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
but we've talked about how that game

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Tank Tank Tank before

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Magi Hajimari no Meikyu

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
comes out from Bandai Namco

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Let's go to the UK

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Dark Sakura

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
In the UK we have a few things

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
On the 21st we have

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Metal Gear Solid Rising

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And then on the 22nd

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
there is Crysis 3

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
and Metal Gear Solid Rising on PC

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I think that's it

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Let me check my calendar

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Because I completely forgot

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
the last day of the week is, yeah, that's it

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
That's it

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
We're done

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and then the classic game of the week, Loki

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So, we keep hearing a lot about

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
this Xbox Entertainment

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and this TV

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
initiative that they're doing

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Well, apparently what they're working on

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
is supposed to be this

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
interactive TV

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
and they're saying similar to how they have

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
the interactive presentations of the Grammys

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
or the Oscars or something like that

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
that it would be some sort of

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
interactive TV, I don't know if with Spark Glass

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
or if they're talking more along the lines of like the Sesame Street

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
stuff with Kinect

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Throw the tomatoes at the people on stage

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Yeah, wouldn't that be awesome if like

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
they did the Grammys through the Xbox or something

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
and then it's like, you know, while Justin Timberlake

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
is on stage, push A if you would like

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
to release the hounds

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Like that whole time

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I would pay for that feature

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
No, if it was like

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Bieber

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Throwing tomatoes

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
would be funny though, like

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
having leaderboard scores and stuff with your friends

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Release the B's on the Bieber

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
That's right

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Push B for Beyonce

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Or like

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
they could have eye tracking

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
or something like that

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Who can stare at Katy Perry's

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
breasts the least?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Go!

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Dammit! Lost!

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Or like camera switching

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Like, you know, during a football game

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
or something

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Yeah, during the Grammys

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
there's one on the stage and one on

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Chris Brown and Adele fighting

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and then there's another one on Katy Perry's

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
breasts and you can just watch that

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
cam the whole time, every time she applauds

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yes

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Rewind

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Rewind

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Push A if you want to release the Kraken

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Amazing

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
How about just 1 versus 100

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
as a network?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Could that be the interactive TV?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Because that would be awesome

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Game shows would rule

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But I'm not going to hold my breath

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
because that's too good

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
You know, right now

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I would just like to see whatever

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
it is that they're going to come out with

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
and actually have it functioning without

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
them saying, here's what we're going to do

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
As far as I'm aware, and I know the new season

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
working with goddamn Game of Thrones

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
so, you know, why am I supposed to believe

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
that, you know, any of this stuff is going to

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
actually work either

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
With smart glass? Yeah

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And where's my

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
goddamn interactive map on

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Android? How about that smart glass?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Smart glass is fucking useless

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
on Android, I can't like, do anything

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
with it

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It doesn't do anything

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Woohoo!

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Smart glass is the

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
fucking future, everybody

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
That's what I have the problem with these console manufacturers

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
is coming up with stupid

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
fucking ideas to do the same

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
shit we've already been doing

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Why do I need to have a new way to

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
swipe through menus? Why do I need a stupid touchpad

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
to swipe through menus when I can use the analog stick, the

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
shoulder buttons, the directional

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
pad? I've already got three fucking ways

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
or connect? Why do I need

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
another way? I'm sorry

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
You know what Microsoft is? Microsoft is the

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Fox TV of gaming. I don't mean Fox News

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I mean Fox TV because like

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
they announce this big feature and make a

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
pomp and circumstance of it and then they

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
cancel it after two episodes

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Like seriously. They put it in the Friday death slot

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Like XNA? Firefly

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Right? Am I right?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
One versus a hundred? Wonder

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Falls

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Am I right?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Game Room?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
What other Fox shows got

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
The Cleveland show? Is that still on the air?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That is still on the air actually. The Game Room did

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
last a good year or so before they pulled the plug

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Running Wild

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
What was the show about the town with the lake?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Eureka?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
It was like two episodes or something

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Eureka was on the lake

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Eureka's on Syfy

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Lake Town?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Well actually now it's NBC apparently

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Would be the

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
network to compare it to

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
What was that show with the

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
spies and they had like a house

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I remember that

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I don't know

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
The Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a TV show?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
No not Mr. and Mrs. Smith

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Or where Jamie gets her

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
name. The Bionic Woman

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Oh my gosh

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Thank you Tigerclaw

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Dollhouse

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
They gave that a second season

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Shadow Next Gen

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Game Room got 13

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
game packs and it had about

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
100 games well on its way to that

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Thousands of games they promised

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
at CES

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Thousands of games in my

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
imagination

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Technist

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Sarah Connor Chronicles

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That was actually a decent show

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
What would it last like 3 seasons?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
2 seasons?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That's better than, you know, we're talking

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Fireflies level stuff

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It has Shirley Manson in it

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah I was gonna say anything that puts Shirley Manson on my TV every week

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Like I'm gay and I still drool

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
over her, she's hot

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Alright

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
One more story for you guys

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I don't know how to transition into this story

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Cause I'm not gay for GameStop that's for sure

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
How about a big burp?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
GameStop

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Power to the players

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
GameStop is closing 250 stores in 2013

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Supposedly even though they're closing

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
250 they're gonna open

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
60 to 70 more

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
But that's just, you know, location moving

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
As neighborhoods build up there'll be new ones

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And purchased

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
40 are coming from UK retailer Game

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So some of those GameStops will be in the UK

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
A quote from the CFO

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Rob Lloyd if you care

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
During the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Quote

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
We've been successful at that for two years

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And we'll continue that program in 2013

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Yeah I think it's because a lot of these

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
They took over like, you know, the EB

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Games and stuff like that and they're in the same mall

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Yeah or like literally you have

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Like a GameStop and then across the street

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Another GameStop

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
They were trying to pull a Starbucks for a little while

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Yeah

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Yeah

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yeah

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Yeah so

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I mean

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I think if, you know, again if you're in an unprofitable

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Location or a redundant location

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Then you're probably in trouble

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
But I imagine most stores will be okay

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
But you know then CNN

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Or Fox News since I mentioned them earlier

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Picks up a story like this and

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Console gaming is dead y'all

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Console gaming is dead GameStop

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Is closing their doors

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
They've had to close down their stores because people are figuring out

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
That their games that they sell are causing

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
People to become murderers

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
See it's proof right there

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's mobile phones, everybody wants to play Smurf Village

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Haven't you heard?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Mobile phone, it's Temple Run, that's gaming

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Smurf Village is just code for terrorism

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Okay

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
See now I have

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
This is the mental image I'm seeing now

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Is the ColecoVision Smurfs with

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
You know AKs

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Shooting Gargamel in the face

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
My childhood has been raped

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Well

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
All I have to say to this news is

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
LOL bye

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Sorry to the people that work there

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I know y'all are just trying to make an honest living

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
But the corporation itself is

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Kinda terrible so I hope that

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Where the ashes land

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
From old GameStops a new indie

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Retailer will emerge one can at least dream

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Hey Play'n Trade now is your chance

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
To actually become like GameStop

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Since you think you are anyways

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Don't they have like a very similar logo too?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
They have

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
That's GameTrader

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Yeah they actually think that they're like a GameStop

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And they kinda try to

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Push themselves away and they're like

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Oh we got all these stores

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Yeah it doesn't really

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
They don't they actually haven't expanded in like

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
A long time so

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Alright let's take a step

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Let's take a step back to a simpler time you guys

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Let's go back to a time

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Where GameStop actually had competition

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Or back when GameStop

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Wasn't even GameStop yet

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Babbages, Funkoland

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Software etc

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Back before they were just all

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Swallowed whole

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
By GameStop

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Star Saga take us back to simpler times

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
The game of the week

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Is Cinestar

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yeah

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Cinestar came out by Williams in 1982

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And um

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It was uh

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
A pretty neat little game

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Kind of though

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
For me I'm not very good at it

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
But I'll just keep going

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Basically you are in a spacecraft and you have to create

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Cinnabombs

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Cinnabon? I love Cinnabon

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I love Cinnabon

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh my god

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Show's cancelled we're going to Cinnabon bye bitches

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I mean that's the good news is that

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Even though GameStops are closing

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Cinnabon next door will still be A-OK

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It's not next door

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
That was where the software etc used to be

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Now there's like a what a tinder shop there?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Lady don't take me literally OK

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
OK show's cancelled

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Cinnabombs

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
You have to shoot

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
At planetoids

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And get the crystals that are released

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And you have to use the bombs

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
To defeat Cinestar

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Who is this huge spacecraft

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
With a skull face

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And um

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
You're constantly under construction as you're going through the game

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So it's sort of like the Death Star

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But without being the Death Star

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Yeah beware I live

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
That voice used to freak me the fuck out when I was a kid

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I hunger for Cinnabons

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That's all pretty awesome

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Wow

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
This guy wants his fucking Cinnabon

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So is this like actually Cinestar

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Or is this like you know

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Recordings of people playing games over Xbox Live

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
This is the guy that goes to the airport

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
To get Cinnabon OK

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
OK can I get back to the review please

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So once Cinestar is formed

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
As we heard the digitized voice

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Pops up who's actually a radio personality

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
John Deramus

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And it's played through an

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
HD55516 CVSD decoder

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Ooh says

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I hunger coward

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And then it tells you run run run

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But how would you run in space

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Would it just be fly like a little bitch

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I don't know

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Anyway

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So um

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Basically it just eats you

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
All it does is eat you and it takes 13 Cinnabons

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
To satiate this Cinestar

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
He needs that cinnamon

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Sugary goodness

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
So you move from zone to zone

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And keep you know beating Cinestar

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Because some asshole keeps rebuilding the fucker

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Why don't we go kill

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
That asshole that keeps rebuilding

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Exactly exactly They really weren't smart

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
In the early 80's

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So you have to go through the worker zone

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
The warrior zone, planetoid zone and void zone

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
The void zone being

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
The difficult one because it has

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Very few planetoids to blow up

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Um

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
So also

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You know of course

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
The Cinestar can be repaired

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
By its little drone fuckers

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Unless you satiate him

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
With tasty Cinabons

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So yeah

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
There were different ports

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
There was the Atari 2600

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
The 8 bit computers

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
They were almost done

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
But there was

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The video game crash and they're like no

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
So we actually got it on

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
The Williams Arcade Greatest Hits for

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Smash, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Playstation and PC

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It was part of Midway Arcade Treasures

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
On Xbox, GameCube and PS2

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And then on PC

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And then part of the Midway Arcade Treasures

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Extended Play for the PSP in 2005

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
It was one of the first

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Games to use stereo

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
In the sit down version

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And it had

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Independent sound boards just for that

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
For purpose

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And it used the 49 way

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Joystick that Williams had produced

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Specifically for that game

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
As far as

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Other versions that have come out

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
There was a pseudo sequel

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
On the PC in 1999

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Called Cinestar Unleashed

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
It had nothing to do with

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
The original creators

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But it was supposed to be

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
A pretty neat little game

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And then Cinestar got re-released

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
For the Midway's Greatest Arcade

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Hits on the Game Boy

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Advanced without

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
The cool features

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
There's also

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
A lot of other little

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Cinestar is really just

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
You know

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
A big part of classic gaming

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Like in

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
There was

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'm trying to see if I can find it

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
For Team Fortress 2

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The heavy weapons guy says I live

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I run cowards

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And then

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Cinestar is in one of the

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Dresden Files books

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
There

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
A group of students at the College of William and Mary

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Did a musical version

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Called Cinestar the Musical

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I have to find this now

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And then

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
They used the voice of Cinestar

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
In an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
The Abridged series

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Which is a web series that

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I've been introduced to

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
This sequel

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
When he wants Cinnabons he wants over

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
9000

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Couldn't help myself

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Let's listen to some of the

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
voice

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You throw those Cinnabons at him

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You go ship

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
There it is your classic game of the week

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Beware I live

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Cinestar

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Available in arcades everywhere

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
If you can find him in business

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
If you live in 1982

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
So it's available in Bobby's arcade

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Yes

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You had to have caught

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Bobby's show to get the reference

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
There it is your classic game of the week

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And jeez Ron-Chan you're fast

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
On the posting

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
He's managing the tumblers

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Shout out to the OLR tumbler

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
The OLR tumbler is

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And while you're at it

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Look at my Mass Effect one

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Isn't your Mass Effect one

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
More popular than the Orange Lounge radio one?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yes

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So you don't need the help

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I'll repost it

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I'll show some promo love

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You'll tumble it

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
When I finally do Mass Effect as a classic game

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
That's not going to happen

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Last episode

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
We're not going to have a last episode

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
We're going to do this until we're dead

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Well then there would be a final episode

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Yeah but we won't know because one of us will just die suddenly

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
This is morbid

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I don't like where this is going

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Beware I die

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Give me Cinnabons

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Rob ate one too many Cinnabons

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
He dead

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Let's remember with the theme

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
from Mass Effect

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Alright

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Well that does it for the classic game of the week

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I've said that three times now

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So I swear we're done with part A

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
But don't go anywhere because this show is so much fun

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
We've got plenty more coming in part B

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Including the foogle question of the week

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
A very interesting patent name

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Something that Sony did

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Oh god somehow Jamie snuck in Mass Effect news

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
There is news and yes it is legit

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Information on Mass Effect

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Coming up after this break

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
More of Orange Lounge Radio

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Up next

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
In progress our

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
493rd episode

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
February the 17th of

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
2013

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And if you've never been

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
as we are live

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
You should join us sometimes Sunday nights

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
at the voice of geeks network

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
vognetwork.com

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Where you can hear such live antics as

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Rob leaving the microphones hot during the break

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
When some quiet music is playing

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So people can hear what we're saying

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Just barely though

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Oops oh well

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
See at least we weren't talking any smack

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
It was just more Nino Cooney talk

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It was Nino Cooney talk and Rob

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Coffee

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And birthday cake oreos that's really all you missed

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Alright there you go

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
ActDeft says it's the Flaco Jones curse

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
taking its course

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Well if leaving the mics hot is the worst it's gonna get

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I guess I'll take it

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
That's not so bad

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I was sitting here going like

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Oh that Bobby Blackwolf made me so mad tonight

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I can't even

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Just kidding

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Should ask him how often he's played his Wii U this week

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I've played Aliens

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Colonial Marines all his fault

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
He didn't warn me

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Why Bobby?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Why?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Alright I would never

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Alright anyhow

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Let's get back into some gaming

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
news rapid fire news time

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So Eain Zinga

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
settled their lawsuits over the

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Ville which was ripping off

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
social and

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
of course we don't know any of the

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
details of what they settled for but it's settled

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
and that's over

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I was hoping for a

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
long drawn out

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
fist fight

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I wanted it to be Judge Judy

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
solved I wanted it to go to Judge

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Judy

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Don't sit there

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
and tell me you didn't know what you're doing

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Um

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Halo 2 on

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
PC the multiplayer support has been

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
extended thanks to

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
you know

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
begging from fans

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Originally it was gonna be cutting

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
the servers off on

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
February 15th

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
but apparently now it's

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
been extended to June

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
and they're investigating further options

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
to support the fans

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
of the Halo 2 on PC so

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
that's good

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
That's good news for the dozens and dozens

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
of people still playing

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Halo 2 on PC

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Who do you think has more? More people playing

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Halo 2 on PC or more people that

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
listens to OLR? What do you think?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
OLR

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Really? I was gonna go for Halo

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Actually yeah I mean with all

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
you know all kidding aside

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Halo 2 I mean it's the only place you can

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
play it since

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
you know they shut down the Xbox 360

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
or excuse me Xbox regular

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
one because of 360 infrastructure

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
that they never really

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
followed through on

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
100 people on our friends list?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Oops

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Um and then finally

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Sniper Elite has a brand new game

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
in their franchise and going the route of

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
most other game franchises out there

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
they've decided to add zombies

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Army is gonna be coming out exclusively

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
on PC they're out on

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Steam for $15

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
and that's at the end of this

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
month on the 28th

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
it's a World War 2 sniper game

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
and the second Sniper Elite game

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
you actually got to shoot the balls

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
off of Hitler if you wanted to

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Hooray

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
They even have the cool like you know Mortal Combat

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
X-Ray mode thing where you can see the

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
testicles explode Oh that's so

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
lovely

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Thank you for that

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And in case you didn't get that game they actually are re-releasing

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
the uh Sniper Elite V2 with

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
the Kill Hitler

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
uh you know

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
DLC in there which it should really be teamed up

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
with Danger 5 you know cause

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
their mission is

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
to kill Hitler Orange Lounge Radio is apparently

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
the show this week where people can hear about

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
exploding Hitler's balls

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I thought they only had one

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Anyhow

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Uh is that it?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Please be it That's it

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Let's move on to something a lot less offensive

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
It is uh Bit.Trip

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
uh the Bit.Trip series

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
uh Bit.Trip soundtracks

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
for 20 bucks

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
and when you pre-order

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
with that 20 bucks the

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Bit.Trip Runner 2 future

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Legend of Rhythm Alien you will get

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
6 Bit.Trip soundtracks

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
for free although they're not really free cause you're paying

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
20 bucks for it but uh

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
pretty cool you know if you are a fan of

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Bit.Trip Runner so in other words if you're not Bobby

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I was gonna say is that like kind of how

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
they try to sell you two pieces of crap on

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
TV and really the whole

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
trick is just to get you to pay twice as much

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
for more than one that you need The trick is

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
to get you to pre-order Bit.Trip Runner 2

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
and boost its numbers

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
but the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
like if you like the 8-bit music

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
In fact I imagine most of you have um

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
acquired the soundtracks if you're

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
a fan of the series but wouldn't it be nice

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
to get them legally and you can do

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
that here for 20 bucks

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
pre-order

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
uh let's see I also

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I guess apparently uh you

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
can get some of the soundtracks for a dollar

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
and then 10 dollars you get the Runner 2

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
soundtrack as well well look at that

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
good times

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
uh there is a game

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
version of said game it's Need for Speed

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Most Wanted uh this game

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
last year

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
but it's coming out on the Wii

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
this year and

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
uh it's gonna have some new stuff in it such as

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
the whole uh you can actually

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
you know have the off TV mode on the gamepad

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
but then there's something about on the gamepad

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
you can actually help

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
somebody that's playing on the big

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
screen uh you can guide

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
them you can help them or you can either

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
hinder them they're calling it a co-driver

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
father and son mode is something

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
that they've called it amongst the criterion

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
developers you can literally have

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
shit up on that gamepad

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
that reminds me of what I do in Grand Theft Auto sometimes

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I'll have a thing where I can spawn cars

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
in front of me actually on my phone I'll do that

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
and I'll put it in first person mode and let the cab driver

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
try to drive while I'm dropping boats in front

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
of him and he just like

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
dropping boats yes that's awesome

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
on the gamepad you can turn traffic on

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
and off you can change the environment between

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
night and day distract cops

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
get a map that shows you where the cops

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
are and the speed cameras and

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
you can just take control away of the car from the driver

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
awesome

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
doing it wrong I'll be taking over

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
into the wall

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
uh there you go so uh

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
let me see a quote from Alexander

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Ward creative director quote

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
when we sat down to think about bringing Most Wanted

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
to Wii U we thought of this in a car game

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
what can the second player in the room do

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
we could have just released a vanilla version

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
of the game put it out and say hey it's Most Wanted

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
on the Wii U but really Nintendo's

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
challenge there is to allow others to interact

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
with the main player using the gamepad

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
you know when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
on the Wii U I got the impression that you were gonna

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
have two people playing at the

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
same time one on the gamepad one on the

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
TV I think you can do that that sounded

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
a lot better I think you could do that too

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I think there's just oh good this is

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
another mode they should really have it just

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
like passenger mode where you just

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
your gamepad is like the side window

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
you can roll it up and down and that's it

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
and the wind blows in your face and

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
that's all you can really do is just look out the window

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
and roll the window up and down I wonder if there will be

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
a dark soccer mode where a big button will pop

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
up and you push it and it goes Dan

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
coffee you are never

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
gonna let me live that down little Starbucks

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
shows up on your map

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
you know there's people listening who probably

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
have no idea where that came from

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
you wanna tell the story or should I

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
go ahead we were on a road

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
trip to Disneyland and I was trapped in

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
the back seat with Dan and dark soccer

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
in the front as they were having

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
heated discussions

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
through the trip down but

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
one of the things that you know would happen

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
for hundreds and hundreds of miles is that

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
dark soccer would be Dan

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
coffee and

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
every time we drove by a Starbucks which when

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
you're on highway 99 is all the time

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
five miles Dan

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
coffee

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
so Rob where's your phone

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
finally shut up

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
so finally finally we get to

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
a Starbucks like we're like halfway to Disneyland

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
we finally pull over to Starbucks and

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
she gets her coffee and I proceed to

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
leave my cell phone in the sandwich

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
shop except oh it was actually in my back

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
pocket the whole time

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
wah wah wah wah

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
now you know when knowing is

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
half the battle aren't you glad she

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
asked me to tell that story I didn't ask

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
you to tell the story it's so people don't get it

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
so I could delay this news

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
the 3DS has become the

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
best gaming machine out there

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
is a attention grabbing headline

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
that was run on Kotaku this week

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
why Kotaku an attention grabbing headline

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
that's unheard of

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
they don't stretch the truth at all

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
no

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
uh yeah so

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
how many articles did they write about hating

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
aliens colonial marines I can't remember

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
was it in the double digits because I think it was

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
uh

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
honestly I was

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
this story was something that was shared with us

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
in the show world thread by somebody

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
with somebody but no it actually

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
is just a whole story written about

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
hey the 3D remember when the

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
3DS was fucked and now

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
look at all this stuff oh my god it's just basically

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
that had already been run

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
but now under the guise of this is why the

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
3DS is the best

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
fucking game system

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
considering that there's like

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
you know

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
they're talking handheld game system

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
there's really only a couple to choose from

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
one of them being the 3DS and one of them being

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
the Vita no one's really gonna make the argument

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
out there

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I'm tapping

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
my finger do I want to go there

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
do I want to go behind door number 4

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
a system is only as good as the

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
games that are on it

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
no I unless it has reach around

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I have another rant brewing

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
do I want to go there

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
drama

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
this website is such shit

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
why does everybody keep reading it

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
and here I am talking about it

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
and it's gonna be more people checking it

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I fucking can't

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
why do we keep bringing

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
this fucking shitty

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
website up all of the time

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
and why does their attention grabbing antics

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
work all of the time

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I can't anymore

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I do not want any stories

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
from this website ever again on our show

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
we are better than this

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
done, banned

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I'm serious, do not link this

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
website ever again for a news story

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
there are better places on the internet to get your

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
gaming news done

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
they just grab all the stories from other people anyway

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
just go to the site, click the link that they got

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
and then use that one

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I am taking a stand here, I am not

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
giving these fuckers hits anymore

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
it is ridiculous

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Rob, yes, coffee

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
I think I might need

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
another cup

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
how about some more news stories DarkSakura

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Sega

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
yay, I love you Sega

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Sega has

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
a line of PCs

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
it's called the Sega Note PC laptop

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
and they have different styles, there's the generic

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
and the Dreamcast

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
and they're

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
anywhere between

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
$1,000 to $2,100

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
and

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
they'll come with the 64 bit version

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
of Windows 8

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
a 1920 by 1080 display

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
4 gigs of RAM and a 500 gigabyte

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
hard drive

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
and a Pentium 2020M processor

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
so yeah

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
and it will be obsolete in 5 seconds

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
moving on, how about some Square

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Square

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
actually

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
registered

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
domains

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
so maybe we're gonna see some

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
re-releases or

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
reboots, but there's

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
wolfensteinspiel.com

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and warfornasgoth.com

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
so

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
who knows

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game, I hope it's done

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
in Wolfenstein 3D fashion

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
the 3D ones never were

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I love the little

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I love the little sound they make

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
like

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
with the digitized voices

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
what

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I'm just American

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
you know that

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
actually when they did the re-releases

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
with that one, it's actually like banned in Switzerland

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Tina Turner

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
cannot play Wolfenstein now

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
in her new home

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
country

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I love that woman, I'm sure she's crushed

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and then

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
last but not least

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
trying to ignore because Axl Rose

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
pretty much has been

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
well, yeah it got

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
thrown out of fraud court so

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
not a big deal anymore

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Axl sucks

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
it's all good, he's attached to what

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
that new Band Fuse game that's coming out

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
and you know Band Fuse, the one that's gonna try to do the same

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
thing that what Power Gig tried to do

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
you remember Power Gig

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
right?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I do remember Power Gig

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
yes, so Band Fuse

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
the new Mastiff music game is gonna be coming out

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
it's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
but I think the difference with this one

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
was that it's real guitar

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
and you can sing

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
that's really it

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
you know what, you could do that with

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Beatles Rock Band

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
well that's not a real

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
guitar though

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
but no one cares

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
mostly more than Band Fuse

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
was that it?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
jeez Rob, I was chatting with chatters

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Rab! I was participating

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
think of another one

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
my extended hate boner was spewing

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
into the chat room, alright

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
your hate boner

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
tonight's show has been brought to you by the words

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
hate and boner

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
in other words hate boner used in tandem

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
be sure to make the special noise

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
let's go to a segment that never makes us

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
have to say in the Google Question of the Week

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
or our Google Plus community

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
you can participate with

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
a question we ask of our fan communities

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
each week on the program

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
starting off with this week's

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
question

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
it was announced today that the new game Destiny

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
will require a persistent internet connection

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
on previous episodes, OLR and Bobby

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
have talked about other games that require

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
an always online internet connection

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
such as Diablo 3 and the new

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
SimCity

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
how do you feel about games that require an always on

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
internet connection?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
and where I was kind of going with this

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
you know, obviously listeners come to draw their own conclusions

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and part of the reason we do this

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
was that we let some games

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
slip by and it's fine

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
it's accepted, like World of Warcraft

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
always online internet connection

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
new SimCity

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
we're not so forgiving

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
but Destiny kind of falls

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
in that weird kind of middle part where it's like

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
well, clearly online is a big

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
component of it, but you're going to have to

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
always be connected, so I was curious

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
if our listeners kind of

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
gave it a pass or no

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
we only had one response on Google Plus

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
so I'll read that, from Rentertainment

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
the one guy still using Google Plus

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
we need a high profile game with a

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
wide and vocal audience to have an always

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
on internet connection mandate

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
that way when some part of it fails

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
leaving people unable to play the game they paid

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
money for, the general public will rage

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
out about it, when the public rages out

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
about it, assuming these companies actually give

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
a shit about what the public wants, these

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
companies will finally see

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
how appropriate

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
these companies will finally see

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
what a mistake the always on

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
internet connection mandate is

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Rentertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
introduce you to a game called Diablo 3

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
this actually

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
happened, you couldn't log in

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
to Diablo 3 for like a week

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
after like an hour, and

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
speaking of hate boner, the internet

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
really had a big one for Diablo 3

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
because of the always online, because you might remember

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Diablo 2, you could play

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
LAN, and you could play offline

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
there's actually a game

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
that's going to be similar to this

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
SimCity

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I'm talking about more long lines of Destiny

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
like an online first person

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
shooter game that's

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
kind of like an MMO type thing

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Defiance from Trion

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
games, that's going to be coming out

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
in April, and it's

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
online only

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
they are an MMO company

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
however, this is a game

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
it's buy to play type thing

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
and it's on consoles

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
on PC and PS3, Xbox 360

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
so this

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
is something similar to

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
that, obviously not

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
as grand as I guess

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Destiny, but I see

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
this actually has an online port

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
once again, it was very vague on

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
everything, on why it needs

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
to be, why is it that

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
we need this

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
online world

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
we're going to have battles and stuff like that

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
or is it just like

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
oh, well I need to see my friend

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
he just cleared this spot

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
so now the enemies are easier here

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I don't know, I don't really know what they're doing

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
but it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
versus SimCity where

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
you just interact with your friends

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
cities that they make

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Diablo 3, despite everybody

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
raging on it and everything

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
still sold, what, 11 million

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
that's

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I don't think that's going to tell them

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I got the message, no more always online

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
yeah, right, well, and if that were the case

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
we wouldn't be seeing it now like a

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
fucking trend, right, like Destiny

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
SimCity, you know

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
the game Loki just talked about and all these other

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
things, so

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
alright, I just got a

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
text message from the person that

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
linked me that story originally that I blew up

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
at, I'll just say it's Jason

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
he doesn't mind me saying that I'm sure, he says

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
in their defense it was

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
an opinion piece, not news, but

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
lol, I was the straw that broke the camel's back

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
this is like congratulations

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
you are the catalyst

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
let me just put it this way, this is

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
this is a website, Rob chose the red ending

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not going back

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
down this road, no, close the door

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
lock it, done, alright

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
moving on, alright, what do you want to

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I just want to say

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Gawker figured out animated

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
gifs a couple months ago, and they've

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
been running with it ever since

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
you know the gif format has been on the internet

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
since like the early 90s, I understand that

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
but now they literally have posts

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
they're like, hey look at this, these are

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
some animated gifs I made based off of

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
this trailer that just came out

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
you know, I think it's funny that gif is still associated

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
with CompuServe, so they got a Tumblr

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
account, or started reading, oh no

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
they didn't, because those are the things I associate

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
with the animated gif, I get my best animated

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
gifs ever from OhNoTheyDidn't

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
which is a LiveJournal community and

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
that and Russian Meteorite sightings

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
so, anyhow

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
do they have like sightings like

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I just saw the Russian Meteorite down Starbucks

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
down the street here, no, well you know LiveJournal

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
is huge in Russia, LiveJournal is like

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I don't know if it's Facebook big in Russia, it got purchased

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
by a Russian company, yeah I mean, but not

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
that's not the reason it's big in Russia, it just

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
it is big in Russia, I just thought it might have been a meme

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
thing or something like that, where they, it's like

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
no, but like a lot of the YouTubes

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
were linked to people's Russian LiveJournals

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
alright, cool, you know, I'm glad LiveJournal

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
is still alive somewhere, anyhow

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
foogle, hello

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
always online connections and some

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
of our answers from Facebook, which really

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
had a lot of answers on it, so I can't

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
read them all, so please visit our

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Facebook community and read them all in their entirety

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
radio, Fabrice A

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
says very annoying and they are

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
punishing the wrong people, some people have a

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
crappy internet connection or even no internet

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
connection at all, so they can hardly play

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
people who bought the game legally and suffer

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
one of the previous problems can't play

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
people who play illegally don't

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
have any of those problems because the DRM

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
is absent

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
flaming toilet, god I love that name

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
says I would think that the fiasco with

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
PSN going down for two months a couple

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
years ago would have taught game makers that

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
requiring an always on internet connection

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
is a very bad idea

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
but they're always going to think it's never going to happen

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
to us, how many games were unplayable

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
or almost unplayable during that time

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
because there was no network to connect to

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
thank you flaming toilet for reminding us

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
never forget

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
playstation network fucking went down

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
like it ate shit

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
literal shit for two months

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
horrible

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
cell agent why not says

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
we're sorry, your game is not available at this

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
time, please hang up and try again

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
lolz

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
you remember that crap that actually happened with me in mass effect 3

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
when they were having the origin

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
issues, yes, and I couldn't

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
connect, but I also couldn't play

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
my single player game because it

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
wouldn't verify my DLC

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
yeah

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Christopher K replies and says

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
the always on idea is such that

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
people won't exploit and mod the games

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
this enables companies to utilize

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
microtransactions and disable cheat

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
codes that allow players replayability

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
if they want to fully explore the game after

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
completion, it's a way for publishers

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
to siphon more than the games retail

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
price for those who want shortcuts

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
there are several countries that still do

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
cap bandwidth or spotty internet coverage

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
why shouldn't I be allowed to play a game

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I paid for whenever, wherever I

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
like, I'm not too opposed to an

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
online activation of sorts, but let me

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
play offline when I'm traveling

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
you know a good point that this indirectly

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
brings up is that you know we've heard about

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Destiny's 10 year plan and so forth

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
what happens after 10 years

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
what happens when

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
they want to pull the servers

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and so forth, where's that

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
$60 investment in the game I made

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
and you know I heard

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
damn I wish I could remember where I heard about this

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
but I remember hearing about one

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
of the reasons why $60 games and people

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
are willing to pay that $60 price is the

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
equity that you're getting in those games

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
the fact that you can turn around and sell those games

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
for a value later, and when you

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
talk about

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
when you talk about robbing people

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
of the ability to sell used games

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
that there's now no

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
equity and there's nothing worth

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
investing $60 in

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but if your game, you know if you were going to turn off

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
used games and then have it be $30

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
maybe that wouldn't feel like

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
such a blow because the games

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
overall are cheaper and this could actually be a

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
great thing for everybody if the games are really

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
cheap

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I still think $30 or $40

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
might be too much

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
my point is though

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I can still plug in an Atari 2600

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
and appreciate the games I grew up on

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
let's say

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
for whatever reason Destiny is a game

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
that Flacco gets his kids to start playing

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
which I doubt but

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
just humor me for a minute here

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
what if they want to revisit that game in their 30s

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
and they can't because the 10 years is up

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
the servers are down, the plug's been pulled

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
what now?

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
it's sad

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
there are games that are like that

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
a lot of these games that were online

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
only or something like that

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
they're just completely useless now

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I don't know

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I can't think of anything that you would have

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
but yeah

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
they pull servers all the time

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
so it's very possible

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
I'm sure there's some MMOs, especially some of these

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Sony MMOs that

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
went offline

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I know there's a few that we mentioned before

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
even like Playstation 2 games

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
and stuff like that

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I don't know

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
even big MMOs go down to main

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
say if you bought a boxed copy

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
of The Matrix online or something like that

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
you can never play Tabula Rasa

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
you can never play it

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Star Wars Galaxies

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
yeah that's right, you will never experience

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
the pre-New Galaxy

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
experience, or the post for that matter

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
ever again in your life

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
he's just gonna get killed

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
the WoW killer is coming out

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Flaco

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
The WoW killer, Elder Scrolls Online

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
it's the WoW killer, Flaco

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
now Destiny's the WoW killer

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I keep seeing that in the chat all night

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
they're both killing WoW

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Miss Scarlet killed WoW

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
in the conservatory with the lead pipe

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
hate boner

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
back to Fugal

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Burr replied and said

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
in the case of Destiny

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I can be justified by what they're trying to do

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
with the gameplay, which at least makes me a little

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
more understanding about it

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
however, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers?

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
get out of our head

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I feel like always on DRM is a decision

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
made by focusing too much on the short term

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
if this trend continues

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
when servers inevitably retire

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
or entire publishers go bankrupt

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
fits right in, doesn't it?

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Red The Haze says

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
not everyone has internet

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
and the US is far from number one

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
when it comes to internet

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Gary B replies and says

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I wanted to see if I could Facebook

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
stalk this guy and figure out where he lived

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something?

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
or else I'll get

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
behind in some sort of

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
quest or whatever the fuck is going on

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
it might also be something that

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
kind of turns me off to it because

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I don't have the time to dedicate

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
to an MMO or something like that

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Last comment

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Facebook to read them all

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
jlinks says

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Well I could play FPS's offline

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
in single player, I didn't make that

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
the main reason I bought the game

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
if the game's good and I have the methods available

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
to play it, I'll buy it, simple as that

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
That's our comments

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
from Facebook and Google Plus

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
thank you guys who all responded

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
sorry I didn't read everybody's

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
but it's only a three hour show

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Let's get to a few more news stories

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
and pretty soon Skype calls

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Loki

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I swear to god that Sony is trolling us

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
because there is no way that like

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I just

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
can't believe that they would actually

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
do this, but apparently

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
there is a patent that they have

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
and I know this is going to come

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
as a shock to you guys, they actually

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
have a tablet that they have patented

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
and I'm really

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I need to check this out right now

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
to see what it's called, but they're calling

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
the iPad

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
like E-Y-E pad, there is no way that

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
that is called the iPad

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
that's a

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
European patent thing that they're

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
showing me here, it doesn't really help me very much

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
17 pages

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
let's see, 17 pages

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I think it looks like it's made out of

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
particle board or something like that

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
it's just weird, but basically it's

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
a tablet device, looks thin

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
looks like a directional pad, you know

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
face buttons, possibly a speaker

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
and one analog stick, shame

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
on you Sony, have you not

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
learned from the PSP one analog

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
stick that's more than the iPad's

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
got, well still though

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I like the big square sharp

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
corner design, reminds me of the NES

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
will I be able to install MAME on this?

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I don't know

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
so they don't really

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
say, I want to make sure that

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
it's actually called the

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
iPad or

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I had heard that name too

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
for what it's worth, now

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I think that someone's making that up

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I don't honestly think that they

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
would do that, oh my god

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
no, they actually have it

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
called the iPad

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
it makes sense, the Playstation 9

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
but again, take it with a jar of salt

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
a gallon of salt, no

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
it's in their patent information

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
they refer to it as the iPad

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
like E-Y-E pad

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
that's a patent law, that's a lawsuit

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
right there, holy fuck balls really

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
and honestly I think

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
this is something that you would see from a Chinese

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
knock off, you know, like iPad

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
thing that they would actually have it spelled out like that

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
so

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
yeah, so they have this thing

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
patented, who knows

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
there was the iToy

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
that's true

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I understand why they're using the iPad

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
and the Playstation 9 and all that stuff

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
it makes sense to me, however

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Apple's gonna go, no, fuck you

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
you can't call it the iPad

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
this really is a whole come at me bro

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
move at Apple

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
but again, huge

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
results, you know, I don't know

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
this seems, it seems unnecessary

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
to have both this and the

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
little thingy built into the controller

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I don't understand

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
well, here's some of the stuff, let me just read some of the cool things

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
that they're saying that this thing has

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
they're saying that

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
it's gonna have stereoscopic

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
cameras on it, so you're gonna be able to

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
like, I guess, record 3D or

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
something like that, kind of like the 3DS

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
they're saying that there's some

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
sort of

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
weird prism thing going on

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
with their touchpad and stuff

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
it's gonna have 6-axis

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
built into it, at least that's what they're

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
everything has a 6-axis

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
built into it

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
so I guess, you know, we'll have to hear more about it

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
if this is gonna be part of the Playstation 4

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
is this a story coming from my favorite

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
website, because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
no, it's a patent, it's actually a patent

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
this is, I'm reading this

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
you can understand why I'm asking though, right?

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
no, no, no, no, I'm reading all of this

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
yes, they did run this

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
they did run the story as did everyone else

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
but I'm just saying though, this is actually from

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
the patent, I'm reading straight out of the patent

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
description

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
maybe patent, we don't know if it's real

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
right? is it coming from the official patent

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
website, or is it

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
they have a link there or something?

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
well they've got it, it's from

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
it's actually linked from

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
or it's embedded from the European

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
patent applications

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
nah, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
it's true, but

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
it also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
a tie-in to the Playstation 4

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
so why would they not maybe want to come up

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
with a hybrid Playstation tablet

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
well, they're saying though, here's one of the things

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
is therefore, in addition to the convenient

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
controller provides the PS3

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
with data and all that stuff, now they're talking about

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
PS3 a little bit

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
uh

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I don't know, we'll see

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
it's just

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
it seems a little weird, but

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
they could do it, I guess

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I mean, they tried to put out some Playstation

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
or Playstation branded

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
tablets

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
that all looked really weird, but

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
who knows, we'll see

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
it's right around the corner

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
yeah, I think they're just covering their bases

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
like all these patent applications

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
iPad, I mean, really

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
just call it like the Playstation

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
tablet or something like that, you know

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
something, Sony Playstation

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
tablet, not iPad, I mean

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
calm down, it's the name in a patent, it's not the final

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
just call it a thingy and be done with it

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
that's right

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
anyhow, one other rumor going

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
around about new consoles that just won't

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
die, is the fact that used

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
games are not going to be playable on it

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
you can bet that Electronic

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Arts EA is just cheering

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
about this, after all, they're the ones that started

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
the online pass shit, aren't they?

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
well, anyhow, the chief

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
financial officer, Blake Jorgensen

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
had a talk with Gamasutra

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
and Gamasutra asked him

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
about the whole used games and these rumors

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
in response, quote

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
it's one of those classic double-edged

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
swords, in one way

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
the used game business has been critical

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
for the health of the retail channel

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
and having a healthy retail channel

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
is an important thing for us

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
we would like to sell everything at full price

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
would we like to sell everything at full price

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
excuse me, and not have a used games market?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
sure, but I think the used game market

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
is a little like any other kind of market

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
where it creates liquid

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
I hate this word

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
liquidity

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
the fact is that liquidity benefits

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
us in some fashion

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
so if someone goes in and trades a game

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
there's a good chance they're going to buy another one of our games

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
and so if there's a liquid market

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I think that's not a bad thing at all

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
so it's

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
sort of like a half admission that

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
maybe used games aren't the worst thing in the world

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
could this be a sign

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
of things to come if EA is

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
openly, or at least one of their executives

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
thing, or are they just setting this up

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
for when the ban hammer comes down

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
on this pretty soon, with the used games

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
any thoughts on EA's comments?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Loki?

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Do you have anything?

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I think they're already making their money

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
on used games with the whole

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
online passes, I mean I think they were

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
touting before that they made a ton of money on

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
online passes, so to them that's

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
just money in their

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
pockets, I guess

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I was actually going to say something along similar lines

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
they've found a way to keep making

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
a profit on it, and that is

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
a really, you know

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
with a lot of cases in the

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
used market, the people who

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
are getting rid of their used games are trying to get

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
the new next better, we've

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
even traded in some of our games, some of our

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
crappy ones, to get new games, so

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
it's, and I mean

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
especially it's even better for

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
EA as an example

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
if someone trades in one of their

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
competitor's games to get to one of theirs

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
so I mean, that

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
whole liquid market thing

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
is pretty, I'd say

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
pretty accurate. And also considering that EA

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
is also one of these companies that puts out yearly

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
releases of their sports games, and they probably

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
know that people aren't going to want to

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
hold onto their copy of Madden

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
13 or something like that, when Madden

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
25, the dumbest

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
new, what are they thinking

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
there? Okay we're going to go 13 to 25

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
and then next year it's going to be 15

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
and then in a few years we're going to have

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
25 again. If it's the 25th year

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I get it, it's not

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
call it like Madden 25th anniversary

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
not Madden 25, it's stupid, anyways

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
that's not the point. The point is

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
that they release games

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
each year and that

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
they know that people are going to need to trade these

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
because they're essentially useless after

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
it comes out. And after

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
all, EA shuts off their servers in a couple years

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
anyways, so you kind of

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
want to trade that in. He is kind of

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
full of dicks right now. Well, here's

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
a further comment I want to, because they were

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
pushed a little further on the whole

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
used games and is that something that's happening

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
in the new consoles. Here was the

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
rest of the quote, quote, I can't really

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
comment on where the next generation boxes

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
are going to be relative to used games.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I will say that the trend in the business

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
is to have that always on

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
connectivity and connect with a customer

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
and to the extent that the software identifies

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
a certain customer is going to create

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
some issues going down the road in the used

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
game market. But I do believe that

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
the consumer likes it and it's been

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
good for the retail channel.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Um...

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Um...

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
What? I do believe

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
the consumer likes it. Um...

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Didn't I just read some

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
frugal answers that didn't seem to go that direction?

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
They like the always on connectivity?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And they've done some polls on

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
certain websites that

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
basically have said the same thing. In fact,

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
actually GameStop did a poll. Was it 60%?

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Over 60% of, you know, people

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
that use GameStop or whatever don't

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
like not having used games.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
This worries me when that sentence comes

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
out of a game maker's mouth. Is how

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
out of touch are you?

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
See, people in the boardroom

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
think they know what we want.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
But clearly they don't.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
But by telling us in an interview

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
this is what gamers want

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
then the more gullible will

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
run with it and, you know, the CNNs

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
will say, oh well, you know,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
want according to electronics art.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Um, why don't you try talking to a

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
gamer? Well, and

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
see, that's the thing. They have a habit

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
of trying to manipulate the

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
data that they find to suit

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
their own purposes. That's, anything can

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
be changed. And they have

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
to get an unbiased source

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
if they're going to have accurate information. But all they want

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
is for people to tell them the same things

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
that's going to support the outcome that they

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
look for. Uh, the

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
gives a Homer Simpson quote.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Facts are meaningless. You can create facts

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
for something that is remotely true.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Interesting note to end that

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
on. Let's move on, DarkSakura.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Well, how about, uh,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
something else EA's managed to fuck up?

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up?

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Okay, EA come close

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
to really royally fucking up. The Mass Effect

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
series.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And yes, we warned you, there is

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Mass Effect news. BioWare

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
is basically saying don't call

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
it Mass Effect 4 because it's

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
implying that it is a

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
another addition to the trilogy.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Um, they're saying,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
um, that basically the

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
trilogy's over. This is another game

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
in the universe. And, uh,

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
the comparison here is, and I'll read the

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
quote from, um, from Priestly.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
It says, um,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
if you have three games centered

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
around a group of key soldiers in the

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
US Army during World War I and then decided to make

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
a game about another group of people during the

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Second World War, the games would have many points

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
in common and feel true to one another.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
So basically it's saying, you know,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
it's saying it's not necessarily going to be a

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
prequel or a sequel. It could be set

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
within the same time frame.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
There could be other things going on, but

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
it's not going to be associated

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
with the Shepard story. So,

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Mass Effect 4 Moderner Warfare?

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
I have no idea.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Um, but they are,

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
um, you know, talking about, uh,

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
it's, uh, being in development

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
with BioWare Montreal and

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
that, uh, that's the same, uh, office

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
that of course gave us this

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
superb multiplayer.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
As I mentioned before, um,

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
and Mass Effect 2, which is The Crown,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
it's not necessarily the popular opinion amongst

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
my Mass Effect loving friends, but

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
um, I'm okay with them going a completely

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
different direction and kind of starting over, if

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
you will, because, you know, they created

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
such a great universe the first time

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
that

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
why not get introduced to new people

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
that will be as compelling, if not more so

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
than the first group? That's okay, I think.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
The only, the thing that would make me happy

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
a production timeline

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
and actually put out

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
a good quality product

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
with great writing, the way that

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Mass Effect 2 was.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
That would just completely

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
tickle me to no end. Of course I'm gonna

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
play it, I mean. Sadly that won't happen.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I know, right? That's so sad.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I mean, and this is the problem is that, yeah,

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I'm an addict, I'll still play it. I love the universe.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
You know, even with the,

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
the pieces

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
of shit that are involved in Mass Effect

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
3, I still

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
play the game on, I've probably played it more

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
than 2, just because I like how it

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
plays better. If it keeps using

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
the

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
newer incarnations of the

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
You know, as long as it's fun to play and

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I get more lore, I'm happy.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
The multiplayer is so good, too.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
It is. We should play again, but you don't play on PC

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
anymore, and that makes me sad.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I kind of do a mix and match now.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Well, then come play online with me.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Meh.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So anyways, there's yet another

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
rumor going along with the PlayStation 4

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Orvis, whatever you call it.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
So that is

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
because they purchased Gaikai,

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
they're going to be using that

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
streaming service to

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
stream PlayStation 3 games to

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
the new PlayStation.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Basically saying that there's not

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
going to be really any backwards compatibility

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
with the old system, which makes sense.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
A lot of it

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
is being offered as

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Basically

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
saying that this is also going to kind of coincide with

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
also physical releases for

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I can see

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
this as kind of an evolution of

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
that whole

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
PlayStation Plus game library thing,

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
because right now you have to download and install

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
everything, which takes fucking forever.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Whereas this, you could be just like

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
okay, I want to play, uh,

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Steam 302. Go.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
And then just load it up and stream it.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
And the hour-long game trials, too.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Like, you have to actually

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
download the entire game to play

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
for an hour and then just delete it.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
So, once again, we'll see.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
in one way or another in the PlayStation 4.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I spent so much money on that. Obviously, it's going to be

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
integrated somehow.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week, too.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
That seems something obvious that they could

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
talk about. They could almost do that with

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
the PlayStation 3.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
is PlayStation 4. I think that they could

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
do this, hey, you guys,

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
you know how you have that online game library

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
right now? Well, guess what?

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
instantly. It makes sense, because

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
inside of it as well, so it could run all the games.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
And then when they started cutting that out

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
and getting the price down,

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
you know, that disappeared.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
So maybe they're trying to not

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
wow us with a $599

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Probably more like

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
$499. But, you know,

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
don't expect it to be

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
that low. But this

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
is one way they'll be able to save some money on

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
the console and maybe not have it be so expensive

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
is that they're going to use the streaming technology

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
to emulate some of the

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
older games. I hope, though, that it's

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
just an option. That you can

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
also, like, okay, you can stream it, or you

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
can download it, because, once again,

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
if their service goes to shit,

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
then that's going to suck not being

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
able to play your game, because

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
you can't stream it anymore.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I would assume that you'd be able to

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
download it as well. I hope that you could

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
do that. Shadownextgen with a comment in our

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
PlayStation Network is in no way good enough

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
to do streaming gameplay like that.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Even with Gaikai.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Is PlayStation Network ready for that

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
kind of bandwidth?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
It's a fair question. Let's put it this way, though.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with, like, some

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
of the demos with, like, FIFA and stuff like that

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
through a web browser and stuff. I think they

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
could probably handle it.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Is it going to look good, though, coming through

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
your bandwidth? You know, like,

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
through your internet connections, again,

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
like, all fucking pixelated and shit?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I don't know.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
That's...

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
We'll just have to see, I guess.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Alright.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Kind of a follow-up

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
story of sorts. You remember when

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
and how it's going to this free-to-play model

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
on the Wii U? That hasn't

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
arrived in America yet, but

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
guess what? It's going to happen in

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Europe as well. Europe will be the next

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
The base download will have

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Monster Battle, Free-for-All, and Team

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Versus, and you can play them up to three times.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Woohoo.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
The first add-on is MyKong,

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
which will cost

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
$1.99 in Euros

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
through February 28th.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Interesting.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I want to fight the bees!

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I hear the game's not very good, but

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I mean, it's a fun arcade game, but

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I don't know.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
As much as I love the game, I really don't see it

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
as well. Unless everyone has

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
the things. I think the free-to-play

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
model is certainly interesting.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Anybody

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank?

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Do you think they will roll this out

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
to the States next? Anybody?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
I'd have to, I think.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
I think they'll eventually roll it out to the States.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
I'd be interested to see

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I guess I'm a little bit

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I don't know. Namco's

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
tried doing this whole free-to-play

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
type approach for some of

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
their games. It didn't work out so well

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
with the Ridge Racer on the Vita.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Remember that? Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
That was, pay $30, $40

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
and get nothing.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Get a demo, and then buy

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
extra crap for it.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
So that kind of sucked, but

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
we'll see.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
$2 is not that bad for an

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
add-on.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Let's go to the mailbag. Every week

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
you guys send us emails. Mailbag at

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
and we read them here on the show.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
where you can send us emails every week.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
We have one email this week and

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I'll go ahead and read it. It just came in

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
like an hour ago. I'll go ahead and read it.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
No biggie.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
It's a gem of an email, so I want to

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
read this through. Alright.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Here we go.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Hey, OLR.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
First off, it seems like you guys have

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
joined the rest of the media in spending

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
time on every next-gen rumor that

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
comes down the pike, no matter how

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
hilarious or ill-thought. It's

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
been proven that the mainstream games media

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
can be easily fooled into believing anything,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
as has been shown by various

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
angry forumites and Tumblr people all

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
over the years. And while I know that the

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
blogs will go after anything that gets clicks,

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
why do you guys spend time on nonsense

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
rumors? That's a good

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
question. In what way does

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
panic-mongering help the show?

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
It's clearly not bringing in the page

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
hits. Clearly

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
it's not. How rude.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
But you're here. That's what counts.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Have you guys ever thought

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
of vetting these rumors, trying to

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
sift the possibly legitimate things

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
from the blatant and senseless bullshit?

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Well, I am glad

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
that you asked that question. Because

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
that is a great... We should

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
go vet those rumors. In fact, let me

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
place a call to Sony right now

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
and ask that question. I know, right?

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Let me just, let me get them on the line and

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
rumors. Because you know, as you

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
mentioned before, it isn't going any

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
distance and getting us hits at all

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
that, you know, sites like

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I don't know, the ESA, when measuring

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
E3, doesn't even want to take a second look

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
at independent podcasts and all that stuff.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Clearly, these guys are on my

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
speed dial, and I can vet

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
this shit till the cows come home.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
I was just talking...

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Because I get paid to do that all day long, too.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know?

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, we were chillin'.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Absolutely. We'll get some fro-yo

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
afterwards. I got photos of my

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Dan and Yu Suzuki, which is actually

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
true, I do. Let me put a little reminder

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
out there about what this show is all

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
about, alright? In case you forgot.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Uh, this

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
show started because we all played

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
DDR at the arcades, and after

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
DDR, we would go and we would go to the

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
restaurant that was down the street, and we would

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
sit around over, you know, food that was bad

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
for us, like mozzarella sticks and so

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
forth. Fried cheese. Oh god, they're so fucking

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
good, huh? And we would talk smack about

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
what's going on in games, and you know

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
what happens a lot of times when people are talking

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
smack? They're talking about the

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
rumors and things that go around in the

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
industry. You know, I can't think

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
of a time when we've said this stuff on

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
air and said, you know, this is fact,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
people. Believe this, people. You know,

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I think we like to bring these ideas

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
up and say, this is a rumor,

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
take it with a grain of salt, like I think

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
we just said about that iPad thing.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Or ask people what they think

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
about it. Exactly. What's wrong with

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
discussion? What is wrong with discussing

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
and talking about ideas? Because

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
some rumors do

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
pan out to be true. So

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
why not talk about

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
what goes through the heads

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
of these people that don't really

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
want to be so ready to talk about

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
these things? And I think that's what

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
we try to do with the community. So

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
if you have an opinion on these rumors

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
besides the fact that these rumors are

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
bullshit, well, why don't you share that opinion

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
with us? That's what the show is set up for, where

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
every gamer has a voice. So

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
tell us a little bit about what you think

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
these rumors could be good or

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
bad for the future. Such

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
as we just talked a little bit about destiny

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and the fact that it requires an always

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
online connection. That is fact,

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
not rumor. They said that

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
today. But that's something that's going to impact

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
the game industry. The whole fact

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
about used games being banned on the new

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
consoles. That's a rumor, yes.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
But I think all of us sit

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
here and go, do you think, can you

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
sit there and you honestly think to yourself

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
that in no boardroom ever

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
has it been said by a senior

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
executive, we should lock out

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
new games on the new console.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Use games. Is that what

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I said? Lock out new games.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Lock out the new ones.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Then we have to do an even newer system and have to

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
charge them.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
The online pass idea came

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
from somewhere.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Rumors are often

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
founded in fact.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I just don't think this was a very well thought

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
out email, honestly.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
But

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
the biggest thing too is that

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I actually like looking at the rumors

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
and the speculation and keeping

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
track of it so I can see what legitimately

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
happens when something comes out to see

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
who was right, who was on the right track.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Was our technology really

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
in the place where we had

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
this capability? For me

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
it's actually a gauge of how

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
ambitious consumer

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
level technology is.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I think it's neat.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Black Wolf

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
in Chat says, I'm not a journalist. I'm a

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
commentator. I don't actually have the resources

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
to be a real journalist.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Well, what is a real journalist anyway?

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Because some things that get away with

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
being real journalism are a little

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
bit laughable. But anyway

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I do like that comparison.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
I'm not a games journalist either,

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
really. I actually think more than anything I'm a

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
games analyst.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
I will analyze the shit out of your game. I say

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
that with a straight face too.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I'm a games analyst. A lot of you are games

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
analysts too. You really are.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Some people are just anal. We've been

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
sitting here talking about games for 11 years and

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
there's some other guys that go out there

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
in every story and being interviewed with

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
a games analyst title. But you know what?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
They get about as much stuff right as we do.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
And about as much wrong as we do. Because

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
one of those games analysts was out there this week,

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
a big one in fact, talking about how this is

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
the doom and gloom, the end all be all for Nintendo.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
And that Nintendo is fucked. And I'm

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
thinking like, dude, what are you smoking?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
It is way too fucking early to say anything

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
about that. I don't care what degree you have under your belt.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
This is, this is just not

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
like

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
it's not, it is way too

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
early to say something like that.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
A year from now, maybe. But this is Nintendo

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
we're talking about. Come on.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
It's one thing to bring up rumor

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
without having anything to substantiate

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
it. It's completely

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
different if you actually have items

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
that are going to back it up. Like, okay, for example,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
let's say that

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
it's a year from now and Nintendo

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
has continued to have dismal sales

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
and we're starting to see extreme

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
price reductions on the Wii U

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
and we're starting to see the

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
3DS

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
game sales drop, then

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
at that point it might be safe to speculate

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
that Nintendo might be looking at a failure.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
But right now, like

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
you said, no. It's completely

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
different just to completely sensationalize

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
something and try to get

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
people to back you up by being

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
even more sensational about

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
it as opposed to stating

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
well, this is what's being said.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
This is what we've seen. Make your

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
own decision. There's people out there

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
who will just read anything and believe it immediately.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
It's just like, you'll see

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
commenters on news stories

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
where they're talking about a rumor and they're like

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
It's like, if that's

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
true, then I'm not buying an Xbox

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
or if that's

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
It's like, oh, this is absolute fact

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
because it's coming to me from

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
this gaming blog that I trust their

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
information, so therefore it is

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I am not going to buy this

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
console. These are the people that are

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
eight times. These are the ones that

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
start a petition or join a group

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
and then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
I mean, whatever.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
But yeah, I think

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I know for a fact that

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
and this comes from just my line of work

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
that I don't deal in guarantees.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I know that.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I'm always

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
leaving myself a way out

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
and there's no way that I'm saying anything

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
is absolute fact unless

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I actually see it.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Now, rostielut is in chat right now and says

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
makes a note that I'm now hated.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I didn't say I hated you.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
No one said we hated you.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
spend time on nonsense rumors?

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
In what way does panic mongering help the show?

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
I just thought I would express

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
why we spend time on nonsense rumors.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
of a viewpoint. It's not like we're sitting here going

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
AHHHHH!

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
So under Nintendo! Oh my god!

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
I could hear once.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Run!

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Plus, if the site gets more hits

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
I might lose to bog the game.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
That's what it's really

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
about, isn't it? That's what I care about.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Alright, let's get to the other half

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
of the email which is a question

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
I think is a little

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
a little more up our alley.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Secondly, Aliens Colonel

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Marines has been released after seven years

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
development and the consensus seems to be that it's

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
a hot mess.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
This is the type of email I like to get.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Forever, the game had a protracted

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
crap ton of development houses working

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
on it. My question here is this.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
At what point are there too many hands

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
in the pot and when should a project

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
just be cancelled? In my view

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
anything past three years in two development

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
houses is asking for disaster.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
It's all about contracts you sign.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Cooks in the soup.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
And what you're going to be responsible

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
for if you don't come through with the product

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
you promised whoever paid you

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
money to come through with.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
at one point, was it not? Like when the company

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
went out of business and Gearbox essentially just

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
bought what was left over from it.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
But they kind of

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
picked up the ashes and released what

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
they did for better or for worse.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Right?

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
It's a

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
question with a lot of gray area because it's not like

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
you can draw a line and say

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
you did three years in two development houses.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Well that doesn't necessarily

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
take everything into effect because I think a game

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
like Smash Brothers

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
didn't the one on the Wii take more

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
than three years to develop? I think it did.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Didn't it take more like four?

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
You know and it came out okay.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
The game was pretty good. It's one of the better Wii titles.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
You know it worked out.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
So you know I don't think

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
How long has Bioshock Infinite been

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
in development?

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Delayed by years.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Or

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
maybe how long has

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Last Guardian been in development?

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Well that's never going to come out.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
How about Final Fantasy Versus

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
13? Yeah

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
there's a great example huh?

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Yeah but the

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Agito 13 came out at zero.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
So anyway

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I don't think there is a line you can

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
draw but I think there does come a point where

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
somebody has to assess it and this is what

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
happens once in a while and this is why games get cancelled.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Is that somebody walks in there every three months

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
and says I'm here representing the people

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
who put their money into this and is paying

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
all your paychecks right now. Show me what you

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
got. And if it doesn't live up to expectations

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
done. Cancelled. Money pulled.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
That's what happens. That's part

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
of the ebb and flow of it. So you know if there's

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
enough development and things to show

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
every few months the game keeps

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
going but if it stops the game

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
is done.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I wonder if it's just one of those things where they just

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
they just they crapped out what they had

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
it sounds like they shoved it off to this other

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
company to finish it off what they'd started

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
and it was just kind of a mess

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
like it just sounds like maybe it was just like

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
mismanaged and I don't know but I haven't

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
played the game so I feel weird kind of sitting here

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
and giving all these opinions on a game I haven't played.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
I can really only go off of what you know the internet

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
is saying about it.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
And the bugs of the internet are talking about are

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Red Dead Redemption Saints Bro

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
I mean that's

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
that's child's play.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Those games have bugs down to

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
a fine art. Anyway

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
have a good show guys.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
We're having a great show.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
It's great.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
if you want to help us be a great show too.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Two

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
The self entitled wads of

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
fuck that drive in the parking lot

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
at Whole Foods.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I don't care how expensive

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
your damn car is

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
or how much gas it guzzles

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
or how organic you fucking eat.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Learn to fucking

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
drive.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I know.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
You find assholes of all

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
varieties and not just inside

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
the shopping place.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Another one goes

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
to

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
oh yeah

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
goes to

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Legend and the Mass Effect

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
3 update

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
that just happened because I want my

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
console back.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
However

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I once again got fly cam working.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
And

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
I think being sick

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
because my son just drives

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
every single illness like a

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
like a fisherman's neck

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
for illness.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
So that kind of sucks.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
That's what children do. That's their revenge.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Discipline.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I don't know.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
So

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I guess FU to that and

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
FU to having to move my desk upstairs

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
because for some dumb

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
reason management thought it was a great idea

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
to fucking flip the building upside

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
down and so they have

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
you know everybody

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
from the third floor moving to the second floor and

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I got to move because I store all sorts of weird

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
shit at my desk like arcade parts.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
So you know

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
it's a little weird.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I have an MP5

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
and a System 573

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
board for Dance Maniac

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Second Mix, a coin box

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
and a Neo Geo arcade board

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
at my desk among a bunch of

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
figurines. I have a Gundam

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
collection. I have anime

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
stuff up on my shelves.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
And I have a what I consider

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
life size paper craft

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
model of a Koopa.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
And I have a chicken

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
that has an Elibit riding on top

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
of it. That's right. I have a chicken

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
with an Elibit riding on top.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Does anyone fucking remember Elibits?

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Hello? Konami?

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Let's make another Elibits game.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Waco go ahead.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Uh

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
gosh I was talking about this with my wife

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
and I was like you know what FU

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
to the podcast app

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
on iPod, iPhone

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
which is pretty old but I finally updated

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
my iPod even though I heard it was

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
terrible and I was really mad

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
because I couldn't scan through

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
the show to find like every time I plug

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
it into my car it would reset back to the start and I

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
hated that. But before I could always just

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
you know like

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
but I couldn't do that and I couldn't figure it out. Well my wife

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
grabs it and two seconds later she finds

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
out how to do it. You swipe the little

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
logo for the show up and then there's a

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
deal up there and you shut all of that. I feel so

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
stupid but the podcast app is terrible.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Still terrible so still FU the

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
podcast app is terrible. Honestly use Stitcher

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
to listen to the show. Sorry but

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
you got to stream on Stitcher don't you? Yeah

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
yeah I got to download because I listen in the

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
car. Actually I think Stitcher

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
will now let you download. I want to say that's something

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
they added to because a lot of podcasters

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
were complaining about that. I think they

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
added that. I'll check that out. Yeah

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
I listen in the car so I can't stream.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Don't

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
don't

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Alright my FU of the week goes to the fact that

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
I don't have tomorrow off unlike

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
a lot of yous. I don't either.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I'm unemployed.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
I have tomorrow off. I'm going to

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Bananas in pajamas.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
So FU to that I don't get tomorrow off.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
What's a President's Day?

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Also FU to Shane.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Fucking bot Pokemon

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
games.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
You can buy next the fucking

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Power Rangers game. No.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
We've had this discussion. I said that's one

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
that's one you're not going to get. Oh my god

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
isn't there a new Sentai series out? Shane

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
is there a new Sentai series out because I

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
want to watch it. Follow his Facebook. He says it's terrible.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
They have that new

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
one now. It's a new movie that's coming out

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
that's

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
the pervert one.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
The guy that wears the

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
panties over his face or something like that.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
What? It's like a

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
hentai something.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
I don't remember what it's called now.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
It looks funny.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Because he does this weird penis spin

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
on some guy's face

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
or something.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
He wears

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
he wears hentai not sentai.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Back away from Loki a little bit here.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Oh no I think Shane was talking about the new

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
American version is really

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
terrible or something.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Megaforce Rangers. And here we all are

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
entertaining this fucking

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Power Rangers discussion. Knock it off.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Hey you hush.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
I have like two laser discs.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
One of them is Mega Ranger vs.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Car Ranger. And the other one is

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
like another I think Mega Ranger movie.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
So shut up. It is

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
hentai common.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Hentai common. Hentai common.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Yes. They have a brand new

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
super hero

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
movie.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Alright let's go to a few more

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
topics for you guys and then we're going to get to the

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Skype line at 1877 Game O

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
L R or our username on Skype.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Loki. So there's some

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Kickstarter games that are actually getting

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
publishers which is kind of cool.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
One of them is

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
this game called Take Down.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
It's like a tactical shooter

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
game. They're seeing kind of like a

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
slow paced Tom Clancy's

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Ghost Recon or something like that.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Sort of

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
like that sort of series

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
I guess. But

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
it's going to be coming out by five of five games

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
called Take Down Red Saber.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
And I guess the guy that developed it was

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Christian Allen. Oh I guess that's why it's similar to

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Tom Grant. He was one of the creative

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
directors for the Ghost Recon series and

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
also I guess

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
SWAT and Rainbow Six.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
So that's going to be coming out.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
It doesn't say when though but sometime in

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
2013. And then

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Wildman. Remember that was the one that

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
was being done by Gas Powered Games

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
kind of like as the last ditch

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
out of business thing. Well actually

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
they canceled their Kickstarter.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
So

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
is because they got purchased by Wargaming.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Because I think World of Tanks.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
So no word if they're going to still

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
be doing the Wildman game but

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
at least now they have some funding.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
So that's good.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Lots of Kickstarter news tonight.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
I got one here too. It's about a

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
90's arcade racer. Because there's just

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
not enough Daytona USA in your life.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
And the like.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
It looks awesome.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Nysalis. Is that how you say their name?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Nysalis. They are doing

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
this Kickstarter for what's called the 90's

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
arcade racer. It has already exceeded

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
the 10,000 pound gold

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
that they had set. Nysalis

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
made Cave Story.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
And they are going to do this new racing game

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
for iOS, Android, and Wii U.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Well I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
their, they picked it up. Oh that's the publisher.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Yeah they picked it up. Thank you. They are the

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
publisher. The

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
producer is Tyrone Rodriguez

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
is the

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Nysalis producer who will be

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
producing and helping the game come to

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
the iOS, Android, and Wii U.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Which I think is interesting. Here's one that

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
now we're not talking about 360

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
or Playstation. It's Wii U. PC,

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Mac, and Linux as well were already announced.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
It looks cool.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Yeah. I almost backed it

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
but I'm poor.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
But I'm poor.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Alright. That's it.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
We're going to get to the Skype line.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
1877 Game OLR. Or our user name

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
We will talk about

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
what's going on in games.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Whatever you want to talk about tonight.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
We've had a lot of stuff tonight. I'm sure it's going to

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
elicit some sort of reaction. So the Skype line is open

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
now. While we wait for some calls

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Loki, any last minute stories you want to share?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Um...

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Nah. I didn't really have anything

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I wanted to talk about other than

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
I wanted to go into a little bit more

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
detail with that whole iPad thing.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Because they had some cool notes

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
that I missed in there after I read through it.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Apparently those

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
for capturing objects that you

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
place on top of it. So basically

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
it would capture both sides of a 3D object

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
or they even may have

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
more than just a couple cameras on there.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
And it would import the full

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
3D object into your game.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Which is kind of cool.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Of course, you know, they said

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
6 axis

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
They're supposed to have some sort of LED

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
strips on the side. I guess that part that looked

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
like the whole

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
what is it, a plywood thing.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Let me go to the phones because we're getting

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Hey, can you guys hear me? Hi, we can hear you.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Alright. I just wanted to say

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Hey, what's up guys?

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
Long time no talk to you. Who is this?

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Introduce yourself.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
It's Gamer Girl.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
Gamer Girl! How you doing, Gamer Girl?

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
So

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
what to talk about.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
I think she's also

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Oh, I think you're listening to us

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I hear a little bit of echo.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
You might want to mute the radio in the background there.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Well, that's no problem.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
You're just going through your head when you hit the dial button.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Is it still echoing?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Uh huh.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Um, hold on a second.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
We'll hold. We'll wait.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
There's nothing we got to do.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
We don't got nothing better to do.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
We'll make up another rumor and talk

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
about it. How's that sound?

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Oh, what's up Gamer Girl?

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
What's on your mind tonight?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Okay, I don't know if I'm

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
still

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
We hear you honey. Keep talking.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Can I get a what what?

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Um, shoot.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I don't think she can hear us.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Honey, try back later because I don't think you can hear us.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Sorry to say.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Aw, that's always depressing.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Yeah. Alright, let's go to the phones.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Ooh, anyone new?

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Okay, I don't know if I'm still

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
We hear you, honey.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Keep talking.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
We're hearing ourselves.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Shoot.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
God damn it. Alright, let's try it.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Flocko's fucking Hair Doll.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
I knew this was going to come up.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Hi, you guys. It's Porkchop. How's it going?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Wait, wait, wait. You can hear me?

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
And I can hear you? Yes.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Oh my god. It's a miracle.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
I fixed the show.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Hi, guys.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
It's been a pretty hype-tastic week.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
I don't know what to believe anymore.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
I'm starting to lose faith.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
I know, and here we are. We're making all this shit up

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
and just rumour-mongering

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
and we just made the whole thing worse

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
in our desperate attempt to get

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
all the thousands of clicks that we get

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
every week here on the show.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
I kind of got nostalgic as well, though.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Like, the guys were talking about, you know,

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
like, old games in chat

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
and especially games in development hell

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
and stuff like that.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
I don't know.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
And it was kind of sad to hear, like, you know,

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
and The Last Guardian. I was looking forward to those.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Like, why can't these companies

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
just, you know, wake the fuck up

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
and realise these games will sell

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
because they had a...

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Well, I know The Last Guardian will anyway.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
So, you know, get on that.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Stop bitching about fucking iPads

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
and all this bullshit.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Yeah, but what about when they don't sell?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Because sometimes, you know, big time

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
because sometimes, you know, big titles come out

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
and they don't sell.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
And it makes developers nervous.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
I guess there was, like, you know,

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
sometimes there is a lot of hype.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Hype is just the theme for this week.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Like, even, I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
and I looked at the footage and I think,

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games,

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
kind of real justice,

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
like Bayonetta, they did that.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
But this game,

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
there's something I can't shake about it

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
as much as I love Metal Gear Solid

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
and writing himself his cool character.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
I'm just getting a weird feeling off it

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
and I'm not sure whether or not to buy it.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
What's going into your decision, ultimately?

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
What's going to help you get home weird, if anything?

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
I don't know.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
It's the fact that,

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000
you know, spin-off titles aren't always great, you know.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.000
It's something that I'm a bit tentative about

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
and I'm watching it and I'm thinking,

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
like, even DMC, the New Devil May Cry game,

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
I'm very scared to buy that

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
because I really, really

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
loved the series before that

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
and now it's just turned on its head.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
The game where you're not Dante?

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Pardon? The game where you're not Dante?

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
The game where you're Dante Mark 2, yeah.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Yeah.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
I've been scared of him for so long.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
It's just like another doctor, it's OK.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Of course, yeah.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
That's just Red Cannon in there.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:21.000
No point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is it?

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry,

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
is the other kind of thing about it,

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
is that this version in particular...

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.000
The Devil May Metro?

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Kinda, yeah. Devil May Metro, a little bit.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
I mean, that's a bad thing.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
I've heard something like that.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Apparently, the spitting image of the guy

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
who developed the game, I'm like, what?

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
It could be worse. He could have the face of,

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:48.000
like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried, or...

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Or one of the Jonas Brothers.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Oh, that would be...

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.000
I'm gonna make myself sick if I talk about it anymore.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Hey, no, it could be a Dante de Medna version.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
I would know.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
That's like DLC.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
That's like, you know, guilty pleasures and stuff like that.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
What is ultimately going to...

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
You know, this is...

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
The boardroom guys wanna get in your head as a gamer.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
What is ultimately going to make that decision for you

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.000
if you're gonna pick up Devil May Cry or not?

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.000
If you just leave it alone,

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
you know, don't...

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Don't twist it to think that you're...

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
No, this is a reboot.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
And as far as I'm concerned, the game was fine

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
before they went and did all this,

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.000
I don't know, fucking lost city of demons

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.000
turning the fucking buildings upside down.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
It was fine when he was the demon hunter

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
and he had white hair initially,

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000
but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo...

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I don't know what to make of him at all.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Okay, I'm gonna play...

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Don't ruin it, that's all I can really say.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
I'm gonna play boardroom guy for a second here.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.000
This is how you get the female audience.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
You go the Bayonetta route, okay?

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
You just have... You have his penis

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
basically act like her hair in that game,

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.000
so it's just flopping around, attacking things.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
And there you go.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
That would be frightening.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do,

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
but still.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I would love to actually have a main male character

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:19.000
who's just in completely oversexed positions.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Like...

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:21.000
We'll play Devil May Cry.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I know, I want the over-the-top,

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
like, you know, a comic book cover.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Done by Rob Liefeld.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
You're like... You want the Hawkeye Initiative

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.000
to be a video game.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
That's what she's talking about.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:34.000
That would be hilarious.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
You want a Hawkeye game.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Jeremy Renner stars as fucking the main character,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000
so that would be perfect.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
I would just play Jeremy Renner's, you know,

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:43.000
butt the game.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
With, you know, Wii Move.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Or Wii.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.000
You're taking...

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
You all are taking this show to a very strange place.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Alright.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Uh...

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Anyway, Porkchop, I got to wrap up,

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
so I can try to get another call,

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
but any other thoughts for us tonight?

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Yes, thanks very much.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000
I want to thank you personally.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
You put me on the Path of Exile.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:02.000
It's very satisfying,

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
and I'm going to play more of it.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:05.000
How about that?

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Somebody just accused me,

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
I think it was on Hoard House this week,

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
saying I never shut up about that game, so...

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Which, I've mentioned it twice,

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
and apparently I never shut up.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Says the person who mentions Mass Effect of Pokemon all the time.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
I instilled fearmongering in people

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:23.000
if they didn't go play Path of Exile.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000
It's worth a shot.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
For a five gig download,

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.000
this game really is worth a shot,

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
and you heard it here, so...

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Like, honestly, didn't you play it,

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
and you were like,

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
oh my god, Diablo 3, finally.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Uh, well, it was Diablo,

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.000
but even so, just playing it and killing things,

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
it was, look, it was worth it.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Totally worth waiting,

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
and the internet was crap downloading,

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:43.000
took ages, it was worth it.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Go try it out, at least,

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000
even if you're not a fan.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Try it out.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
A ringing endorsement from overseas.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.000
There you go.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Can't beat that.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Good girl.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:55.000
All right, that's it, Porkchop.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Have a good one, buddy.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Take it easy, guys.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.000
All right, bye-bye.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
All right, I will try this call one more time,

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
because it's a new name, I think.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Hi, you're on Orange Country.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Who's this?

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.000
It was crap downloading, took ages.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Nope, you gotta call Echo 1-2-3.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
That's it.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:11.000
And turn off your speakers.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Yeah, well, yeah, that's the problem.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Use headphones.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
You gotta stop the show when you're calling in, so.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Sorry.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Uh, we'll try to see if we can get at least one more call.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.000
We have another one coming in.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Hi, you're on Orange Country.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Who's this?

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:26.000
You talk about Path of Exile way too much.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Oh, god, here we go.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Hi, Shane.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Hello.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000
How are you?

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000
I'm good.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I'm playing Pokemon.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Why the hate boner,

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.000
since we've been using that term a lot tonight,

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
why the hate boner for Path of Exile?

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Have you played Path of Exile?

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:47.000
I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer,

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
because it was crap.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
I'm telling you, there's a difference.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
And Torchlight 2, have you played Torchlight 2?

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
I played the first one, the demo of it,

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
and it was kind of boring.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
You're the problem, Shane.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Shane.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Yes.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
We have stuff to do.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Mm-hmm.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:10.000
But I got to watch Kilryuger some more, because it's so funny.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:11.000
I need to watch it now.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.000
All right, why did you call in tonight?

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile,

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
or did you have something else?

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
No, that's pretty much it.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
And Ni No Kuni sucks there.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Hey!

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Another game he hasn't played that he hates.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I have a Ni No Kuni.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:28.000
You have it.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Yes, I have it.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:30.000
It is not fun.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:31.000
It is super boring.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:34.000
The Pokémon aspect is cool, and the battles are fine.

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:35.000
I actually like the battles.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:36.000
What else is wrong with it?

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.000
But the story is terrible.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:38.000
Here's the thing.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Here's the thing.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:42.000
A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane,

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
that I got into Mass Effect because of Shane.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
I got into probably...

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Are you playing Persona?

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:48.000
And they're right.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.000
I haven't played Persona yet, but I will.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:50.000
See?

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.000
See?

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Everybody proof.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Mass Effect, and we have the Pokémon and...

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Acornage.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway,

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:00.000
because it was in DDR.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance,

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
was largely in part to Shane.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000
But I do influence Shane sometimes,

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:08.000
and Ni No Kuni was one of them,

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
is that I convinced him to get Ni No Kuni, right Shane?

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.000
Yeah, but now he doesn't like it.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:12.000
He's gonna give me his copy.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:13.000
It was between that and Devil May Cry,

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
and I made the wrong choice.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
It's like the Bizarro review, Ni No Kuni.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Every reviewer is like,

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
oh, the story's amazing, but, you know,

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:25.000
there's some problems with the gameplay and the battle system.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
But Shane's like, battle system's great,

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:28.000
but story, oh, sucks.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Now this means Shane can give me his copy.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Of Ni No Kuni?

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Yeah.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Now I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
limited edition case I have with it,

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.000
because it goes for like 40 bucks,

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.000
just the case alone.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Damn it.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Did you get the book?

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
No, I did not get a book.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Oh, I want the book.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:47.000
No.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Like, the story is so boring.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
I don't care about any of the characters.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
I care about, like, my little mighty,

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
mighty guy, and that's pretty much it.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.000
I named him Fodder,

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
because I figured he wasn't gonna be worth anything,

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:03.000
but he's really good.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:04.000
He is really good.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:05.000
He actually lasts a long time,

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.000
but, though, if you read game facts,

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:07.000
they all say, oh, he's horrible.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:08.000
He's got bad stats.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Okay, so, I just want to be clear here,

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
I just want to be clear.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000
No.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
But you are current on every episode

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:20.000
of Power Rangers ever made, correct?

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Um, not entirely.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.000
There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:27.000
I see, I see.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:28.000
And how's the story in Pokemon?

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
You a big fan of the story in Pokemon?

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Yes.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Okay, Shane, wait.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.000
I have to ask you,

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages,

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.000
what is your favorite Sentai series?

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:39.000
Sentai series?

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Yeah.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Um, probably Gokaiger.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Really?

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Yes, it cracks me up,

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
but Kyoryuja might take its place.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:48.000
I still...

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Oh, and Dekaranger.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Dekaranger.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:51.000
Dekaranger's awesome.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:54.000
I still say Mega Ranger was the best.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:55.000
I don't know.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.000
I haven't seen that one.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Most of the later ones.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Go watch Mega Ranger.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:00.000
It's awesome.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Are you guys done?

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
No, are you done?

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000
Yes.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Bye, have a good time.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Thanks for calling.

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Mm-hmm.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Bye.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000
He's like, mm-hmm.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:15.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:20.000
live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:23.000
on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:24.000
And then some.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.000
Now live every week.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.000
I got time for one more call.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I got bronchitis.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
That lady's making a killing.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson?

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
She was on Tosh last year.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000
He was on Tosh, too.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.000
It's tough to make a living.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.000
I'm going to find out now.

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Hold on.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:57.000
Who's this?

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
That's the one and only Ronda from the East Coast.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Hey, Ronda from the East Coast.

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.000
How's it going?

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Ah, pretty good, pretty good.

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.000
We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
Yeah, I heard.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000
I got the memo.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
Good job on that.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
But congrats on your first live show.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Thanks, and we try.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Evidently, Winnamp didn't like a certain MP3

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.000
and decided to give me the middle finger.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
It might do that with some of the foreign name titles,

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:22.000
just so you know.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:23.000
I should have warned you about that.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:24.000
That's worse.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000
These are things we learn through trial and error.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:28.000
Mm-hmm.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000
Mm-hmm.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Thank you.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.000
An anime jam session can also be heard live on VOG Network

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
VOG got two new live shows.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:43.000
Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week.

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
It's like we kind of doubled.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Not really.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.000
I guess we went from three to five.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:48.000
It's close.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
So pretty cool.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:55.000
So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winnamp?

03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Just making it through school.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Just chilling, just making it through school?

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.000
What are you studying?

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Networking technology.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
I guess you didn't get the notice on that.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:10.000
I decided to go back to college.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
I am quite proud of your achievement.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Thank you.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
No, I did get the memo on it, but I don't assume

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
that the radio listeners all know the story about them.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:20.000
So I sometimes ask rhetorical questions, but anyway.

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
Any cons going on lately?

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Weren't you at a con this weekend?

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.000
No, that was Kat's a con, but we're going to be covering that

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.000
this week because there was so much drama and controversy

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:31.000
going on there.

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Oh my God, you've got to tell our audience.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:36.000
I know it's a video game show, but I saw it on Tumblr.

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.000
I saw it on Facebook.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
I saw it on Twitter.

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000
There was drama everywhere.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:41.000
Give us a little bit.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Give us a little bit of the drama.

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.000
Give us a tease.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Sure.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Sure.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:49.000
The main issue was cosplayers and con goers, a kind of piss

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:53.000
that a international Jewish organization took up a majority

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000
of the conventions of the convention area and places

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
for taking photography.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.000
And there was pretty much insults going between both sides

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
back and forth.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Really?

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Yes, really.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted?

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
I don't know enough about it.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:20.000
And honestly, I just feel like asshole photographers.

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.000
You will talk later because believe you me, I have friends

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
that are also Jewish and cosplayers.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.000
We're pissed at both sides as well, but we'll see that

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:29.000
for another time.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:32.000
I just don't like when you get two groups of people together

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.000
who decide to act like name calling five year olds.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:39.000
Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go.

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Also, update on Antoine Dodson released a single in 2012

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
called Lovesick Lullaby.

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:47.000
How did that sound?

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:48.000
I just downloaded it.

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Oh, my God.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
You're the problem.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Damn it, Uchon.

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Look at your life.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Look at your choices.

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Antoine Dodson songs?

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:01.000
So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids?

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:02.000
Yeah.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:03.000
No, it's 2013.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:04.000
It's a new year.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:05.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:11.000
for having a warrant out on him for pot possession.

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:12.000
No.

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:13.000
Back in Huntsville.

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.000
No.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Huntsville.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:16.000
He smoked marijuana.

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:19.000
Get out.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:20.000
Hide your bong.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:21.000
Hide your roach.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:25.000
Anyway, what else should I ask you about, Rama?

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:26.000
I don't know.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
I just have a few things to say.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:29.000
All right.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
Quick, and I'll be on my way.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.000
The convention that you went to is called Animation on Display,

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:39.000
and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Hebert, was there as a guest.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Neat.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:41.000
Yes.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:45.000
And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
called Zuden Sentai Kuruja.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:51.000
It's the third Sentai series based off of dinosaurs.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Fun, because what was the one?

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.000
Dioranger.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Dino Thunder?

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.000
No, Dioranger was...

03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Dinosaurs dress up and transform?

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:00.000
That's pretty awesome.

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:01.000
No, no.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Kuruja was the first one.

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.000
Yeah, Zooranger.

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:04.000
That was the first one.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:09.000
Dioranger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old white ranger guy.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:10.000
Mm-hmm.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Yeah.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:16.000
Yeah, a little too many people know is that the white ranger was actually from a completely

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:17.000
different series.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
They had better outfits, just saying.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:20.000
They did.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:21.000
Yes, they did.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.000
They totally had better outfits.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Well, Rama, after this call, I feel like I learned something.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Two more things, I'm going to get out of here.

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.000
All right.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
The whole Year of Luigi thing.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:39.000
Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:44.000
That's proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:47.000
wearing my Luigi hat.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:48.000
That's awesome.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Never wash that hat again.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:50.000
Just kidding.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:53.000
You should probably wash it once in a while.

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case.

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Oh, okay.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:57.000
All right.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:58.000
That works.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.000
That works.

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Oh, my God.

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:01.000
I haven't seen this picture.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:02.000
How did I miss this?

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:03.000
You have not seen it?

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:04.000
No.

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:05.000
That's hilarious.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:06.000
That's pretty cool.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:07.000
That's awesome.

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:08.000
Oh, God, I love it.

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:09.000
All right.

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
When are you going to get your ass back out here?

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Can you put that on Tumblr or something?

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:17.000
I will.

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:20.000
I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:21.000
and I'm done with college.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Okay.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:23.000
Because I want to come back out there again.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
I want to go out there and go to a club.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
How about we crash New York?

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Well, Chiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:36.000
and me down there and Jovidea down here to do a big old party thing.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:37.000
You know what I'm saying?

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:38.000
There you go.

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:39.000
We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con.

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Only if it's a sexy party.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
They do have that.

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:47.000
It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.000
Awesome.

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Sounds like fun to me.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
All right, Rama, I got to let you go to wrap up the show.

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:52.000
Fine.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Okay.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:54.000
I'm out of here.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:55.000
All right.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Have a good one, buddy.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
Another A plus phone call from Rama.

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:02.000
Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy.

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:06.000
Echo one, two, three in the future.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:07.000
There we go.

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:08.000
That's it.

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Mailbag at orangelandtrady.com or tweet us.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:17.000
Oh shit, I got to do the tweets.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:18.000
Here I was ready to wrap up.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:19.000
I have a last minute story.

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:20.000
All right, go for it.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
I got to pull up the Twitters.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:25.000
So there is a new world record for Qbert.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:36.000
Apparently, George Layouts, I guess, he had been playing Qbert with a friend, Ed Hemskerk.

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:41.000
They've been playing the game for 30 years now, and they've been trying to go for this world record.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired, and this guy, George, actually went for 80 plus hours.

03:09:52.000 --> 03:10:01.000
He actually beat the world record, I guess, at about over 84 hours and 36 million points.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:11.000
So at least that's what the thought is right now, that he has broken the record for both the longest time playing on a single quarter and score.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:15.000
He likes to score all night.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:19.000
Here's a last minute story if I ever heard one.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's like on topic and legit.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Let's give him a hand for doing a good job.

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.000
All right, no, this is actually super important.

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:35.000
Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
When's it happening?

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Today, 5 p.m. Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m. Eastern.

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:48.000
So that means in about two more hours, we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita.

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:55.000
And it is ahead of the February 20th event, meaning, this is confirmed, the two events are about separate topics.

03:10:55.000 --> 03:11:03.000
So the February 20th event is all about something new, because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week, or tonight.

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:09.000
So, Loki, upon hearing that, you just said earlier in the show, where's the information on the Vita?

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
Any reaction to this, hearing this?

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
I'm going to see what they say.

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:18.000
See, the problem is, when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games.

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:21.000
And it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000
And here's the other funny thing you want to see.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:30.000
Because I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and game side.

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
And we do a lot of promotions with them.

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:38.000
In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now, because I probably can't go.

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:46.000
It's possibly to go on a red carpet premiere for This Is The End, with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that.

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:47.000
It'll be fun.

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:48.000
My wife might not like that.

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:49.000
But here's the thing.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:50.000
They've been...

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:51.000
I'll fucking go.

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:52.000
Our rep...

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:53.000
My name's Loki.

03:11:53.000 --> 03:12:00.000
A rep in house has been asking me, she's all, okay, well, what's in the electronic device that Sony has?

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
You know, what's hot right now with Sony and stuff?

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:06.000
And I was like, oh yeah, well, there's the PlayStation 4, it's going to be coming out, and then there's the Vita.

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.000
I may actually get another Vita.

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
I'm not having to pay for it, of course, but...

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
You have a rough life.

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Well, I...

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.000
I might have to go to a movie premiere.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:16.000
Well, no, no.

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000
Here's the thing, though.

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:18.000
I've got another Vita.

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:22.000
Right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:28.000
They went to a winery one time, and then they went to Monterey.

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
I didn't get included in either of those trips.

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:35.000
I had to stay back and answer phones.

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Thanks.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:37.000
Good times.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
All right, quickly, I've got to do some quick Twitter topics here.

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
Tigerclaw sent us a couple stories here.

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
I'm just going to do one because I'm pressed for time here.

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:48.000
A video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it.

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:49.000
Oh, yeah.

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:50.000
Get out.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.000
I didn't know that this was something they were doing.

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
That's been floating for a little bit.

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:54.000
Yeah, but there was...

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:55.000
I thought they had a Play...

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000
There was the...

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:57.000
On PS1 they did, right?

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.000
Really?

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000
There was the Masters of Terra something.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:03.000
Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul.

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:06.000
It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't,

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:09.000
you know, amount to anything.

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:14.000
Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
is greater than Super Metroid.

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:17.000
Just saying.

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.000
Well, you know, Orange Lontre, who is the show where every gamer has a voice.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:21.000
Except you.

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:22.000
No, no, no.

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:23.000
He has a voice, but...

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:24.000
He has a voice.

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
Just what's it like to have such a wrong voice?

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:32.000
I mean, there's no such thing as a wrong opinion, but that's really fucking close.

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.000
I've never said there's no such thing as a...

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
I've never said that there's a stupid question.

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:40.000
That's pushing it.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:46.000
Since we are on the topic of, you know, Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars,

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:55.000
and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know

03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:02.000
that in Disney, and obviously this is all very, very early, but they have greenlit Star

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000
Wars figures for Disney Infinity.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.000
Probably not coming out anytime soon, but it is in the works.

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.000
So don't be surprised next year if you see Star Wars figures.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:17.000
What would be interesting is Star Wars figures with Marvel figures with Disney figures.

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:20.000
Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel.

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:21.000
Yeah, we almost forgot about that too.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:22.000
You know what?

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:27.000
Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game,

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:32.000
so I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet,

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:35.000
especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet.

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:40.000
Alright, and lastly from SSJ100Matt,

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:43.000
with so much negativity stemming from video games lately,

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:47.000
someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut.

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
Very interesting.

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
Let's see, I'm trying to scan through this real quick.

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:54.000
God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here.

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:58.000
The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games,

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:01.000
and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:06.000
It's a non-profit operation relying on donations to keep operations going.

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:10.000
Similar to an arcade in Massachusetts called Tokyo Game Action,

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:13.000
which was also non-profit, but they closed.

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.000
No game list available yet, but they're talking about driving games,

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:19.000
pinball machines, air hockey, Kinect, and many more.

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:23.000
So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade?

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:27.000
Wah wah.

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
Womp womp womp.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
Alright, that does it.

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:32.000
We gotta wrap up.

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000
We're at midnight thirty eastern time here.

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:37.000
We're running a little late, so we gotta go around and wrap it up.

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
and staying with us for all three hours tonight.

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:44.000
Remember, we do this show for free.

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:49.000
We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that,

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
but we do it because we love you guys and we love the community.

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Yes, even the nasty emailers too.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
I love you so much.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:00.000
You can help spread the word about our show by telling a friend.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:01.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:04.000
Leave us a nice review on whatever website you found the show on,

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:07.000
iTunes or Stitcher or wherever.

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:08.000
We really appreciate it.

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:12.000
Tumblr, you can tumbles about us and all that good stuff.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:13.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
Flaco, thank you very much for being here tonight.

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:16.000
I hope you had fun.

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:17.000
I did.

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:18.000
Alright, good times.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:19.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
Just thanks for having me.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.000
I got to talk about Ni No Kuni.

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.000
I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Ni No Kuni podcast,

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:30.000
just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
Are you going to call it Ni No Podcast?

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:33.000
Ni No Podcast.

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:34.000
Ni No Cast.

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:40.000
I think Ni No Podcast would be a great addition to the VOG network.

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:41.000
I'm sure Bobby would have no problem.

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:42.000
He would love it.

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:43.000
No problem at all.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:44.000
Green light, green light.

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
I'm going to just offer you the spot right now.

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:47.000
We'll just call it Bobby Blackwolf Night.

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:50.000
We'll have Mass Effect Podcast and Ni No Kuni Podcast back to back.

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:52.000
And then the Brony show.

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000
Oh yeah, the Brony show.

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:55.000
The Brony show.

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:56.000
Sounds great.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:57.000
It'll be awesome.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:02.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Hate boner.

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:09.000
My final thought tonight is sunflower seeds.

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:15.000
My final thought is, I don't know, I don't have anything.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000
I just don't want to move upstairs.

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000
I hate moving my stuff.

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:20.000
Get a peon to do it for you.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:24.000
I've been in that spot for a long time and I just don't like moving

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:27.000
because everyone's like, well, your desk is a mess anyways.

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000
Actually, no, my desk is just spread out.

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:30.000
It's not a mess.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:31.000
It's organized chaos.

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:32.000
It's not organized at all.

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:36.000
It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000
It's got to be stored somewhere.

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:42.000
It's sure as hell not going to be at my house.

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:43.000
Alright, that's it.

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:46.000
Thanks a lot, guys, for tuning in and listening and staying with us

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:47.000
all night long.

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:48.000
Here, have a cookie.

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:49.000
We'll see you again next week.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:50.000
Good night.

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:54.000
