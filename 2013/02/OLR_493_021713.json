{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Visual Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, February 17th, 2013, Bungie reveals details on their next game. Nintendo unveils more 3DS titles in the new Nintendo Direct. And as the first glimpse of the Playstation 4 leaked to the internet, Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 493, February 17th, 2013. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts. First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Blarg. Blarg, yarg. How you doing? I'm tired. Tired? Actually, thank you for the ca-ca-coc-pa-pa. I was trying to say caffeine and coffee at the same time and then it came out. The caffi. You were just saying it, you know, with an accent. The caffi. I love coffee. Yeah, I love coffee too. I'm drinking it and I'm going to beg more from you in a little bit because I went to San Francisco yesterday. How was San Francisco? It was gay. What'd you do in San Francisco? I'm sure the weather was great. What'd you do in San Francisco? It was fantastic. Actually, I went with my friends Gary and Susan, which Gary is the scariest driver ever next to my friend Julie. And then we met up with Gary's sister and our friend Tamara and, well, there was beer involved and a place called Pizza Orgasmica. I have been there. It's good. Yeah, it's not just a clever title. It's freaking good pizza. Yeah, it is. Good stuff. So, yeah, there was some bar hopping and some curry rice earlier in the day and an anime convention that I had no idea was going on. And I was walking around in my N7 hoodie, my Mass Effect hoodie, because I love that thing and wear it everywhere. And I just happened to be in the bathroom and someone's like, oh, are you cosplaying Shepard? And I was like, I'm not Commander Shepard, but this is my favorite bathroom in Japan town. I was like, I'm not here for the con. I'm just wearing my jacket. Did you do a deadpan just like that? Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. I love the random impromptu anime convention. Dark Sakura approaches. Quick, throw an anime convention. Well, I saw people putting on armor in the in the Japan town. Things you would hear at an anime convention or a war zone? OK, it was in the Kintetsu Mall parking lot. I saw people putting on armor. I was like. It's not the cherry blossom festival, so the cosplay parade isn't happening. Is there a convention going on and no one's told me? Sure enough, I, you know, I run into somebody and wearing a blue trench coat and a button up shirt. I said, I bet you're cosplaying Captain Jack Harkness, aren't you? He's like, yeah, and there's my my doctor over there. I was like, so is there a convention going on? He's like, oh, yeah, it sucks. Oh, I don't even remember what the convention was called. Where was that? Was it at the was it was over the Kabuki Hotel. Interesting. You know, that's where they're going to be having the gamer expo, but they call it gamer X now because they can't call it gamer con legal stuff. But that's where they're having that. So it seemed like a pretty good venue. But I mean, I want to go to that one. But it was cosplay central all over Japan town and assholes with cameras. That's the other thing I call them assholes. And I'm not talking about the professional photographers. You know, there's people who know how to behave, how to assure people aside when they're taking their photos. This was some sweaty otaku wearing a wolf hat five times the size of my husband, looking for the girls to the biggest. I'm up with this in backing up into Techmaster Loki, everybody backing up into people and stepping on feet and being just an asshole. And, you know, he tried to I ran into him again and I just said, you know, look where you're going ass face or something. And it was just being rude. You know, there's a way to take photos at a convention. And the way this guy did it is not it. Did you go to the anime convention and say I wasn't supposed to be here today? I said we shouldn't have come today or we should have checked the con schedule. All right. I don't keep up with the concert anymore. How do I know all this? Say hello to Techmaster Loki, officially everybody. Hello. How are you doing? I'm doing fine. You ever been pervy with a camera at a convention? No. Good. Don't do that. But I can remember. You had to think for a minute. It's been a while since I've been to the con. No, I don't think I have. It's been a while since I've been to a con, too. I don't even remember the last con I went to. It was probably like ASET. I remember the last con job I pulled. What's a con job? It sounds hot. Con? Con artist? Oh, OK. It's not funny when I have to explain it, Rob. OK. Well, it wasn't funny in the first place. Anyway, we have a special guest in studio tonight. He's a familiar guy. You might know him if you've listened to some previous episodes of the show or ever listened to Hoard House and hear his e-mails and tweets and all that. Or if you ever go to vognetwork.com and look at the leaderboards. It is Flaco Jones, everybody. Hello, everybody. How are you doing? I'm doing great. As apparently I called you earlier, our biggest flan. Yeah, I love that. Because you just reminded me of Ni No Kuni and I feed flan to my tin man familiar all the time. You're sticky and smell of caramel? Yes. Can I smell you? It's all this English candy. Yes, it's all the Cyl candy, which much love to Cyl. I don't know if Cyl listens to Orange Lawn Triadio, but I hope she won't mind. I've been giving some of the candy away. It's not that I don't love it, but it's like I got to share the love. I had to lay claim to the Mars Bar because I love Mars Bars. So, yes, Cyl from Girls Gone Wow, which if you haven't heard the show, it's a fantabulous show. And it's you can hear it Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geek or Wednesday mornings, excuse me, at the Voice of Geeks Network. It's Wednesday nights if you're in the UK, but they are a lovely British based group. It's not just Cyl, it's Cyl, EJ, Raven and Rob. But I correspond mostly with Cyl because, you know, in getting her shows and so forth. And Cyl offered on Facebook to do this candy exchange thing. So she sent me a bag full of candy from Britain, like the Smarties over there, which are like totally different than Smarties here. And like Aero Bars, which we don't have here at all. Jelly Babies, which I'd never had, which were pretty good. I can't eat Jelly Babies. It has some of the same stuff in it that I'm allergic to. But some of the bars that she sent, we do have a place called Touch of Britain in town. But she sent stuff that I've never seen there, like the Bubblies. I've never seen them there. Yeah, yeah. So pretty cool. And oh my God, the thing I want to go back to England for, not go back, but want to go there for, is just to raid the collection of Cadbury eggs. She did send authentic Cadbury cream eggs. I had one yesterday. Mars eggs are the best thing in the universe. So I have a return package. I don't want to spoil, just in case Sil is listening. But I might spoil by the time it gets there. I do have a return package we're sending. And all I'm going to say is that she'll have plenty to share as well. So if you know Sil. And we're sending her a token of our love. That's right. In fact, I need Loki and Flaco to sign the little love notes for Sil that we're sending. So we'll send that over there soon. Alright, Flaco, what's new with you? What have you been up to? When was the last time you were on the show? A couple months ago, right? I was on the year-end show. That's right. So December 30th. That's right, the last show of the year. Because you ruined one of the shows in June. Yes. And hopefully tonight's show will be better. I scared everybody in December because something happened that hadn't happened. I guess the stream went down and that hadn't happened in a few weeks. So it was scaring people. Well, I should warn everybody. I was having major internet issues yesterday. Like, Alan and I were trying to play World of Warcraft and disconnected like eight times. It was insane. He had net flatulence. My iPad wouldn't even connect to the internet. It was dumb. So we unplugged our routers overnight. And so far today, they've been fine. So we'll keep our fingers crossed. But Flaco's presence could break them again. I like that I have this reputation with the show. I'm the number one fan of Hoard House and the number one curse on a locker. Exactly. Exactly. So you you have two young ones at home. You just how old is your little girl now? She's almost one. She turns a year next month. So you have a less than a year old at home. Yes. How do you juggle that with game playing? I play very late at night or early in the morning. And you know what's cool about games like Ni No Kuni, something like that, I can actually play when they're up. They don't get bothered by it too much. My son likes it because it kind of looks like a cartoon. You know, he doesn't like the battle. He gets bored of that, which I guess a lot of people do. You read some of the online reviews. But yeah, he loves the animated cut scenes in that. And, you know, another game we've been playing lately is The Unfinished Swan, and he loves that game. So if he loves the game, he'll actually request it. And Unfinished Swan, obviously, you can't say that, but he calls it tree. Because when you, when you highlight the icon on the PlayStation, it just has a picture of, you know, like an ink splattered tree. And so that's what he calls it. So when he comes in the living room, he starts saying tree, tree. And like, you want us to play tree? Yeah. So we put, you know, we load up that game when we start playing it. And he just, he'll just sit there and he loves watching that game. Isn't it interesting now that, you know, our kids, I mean, not that I have kids, but I've used those little quotes, our kids or this generation's children or whatever, are growing up in a world that has PlayStation 3s and all this stuff. Whereas, you know, when we were all growing up, at least you and I are the same age, and Atari had just, like, just came out around the time we were, what, three? I guess, no, Atari had been out, but Atari kind of really started to pick up speed around the time we were three. Yeah, my parents had an Atari, so that's what I get. So it's just interesting that we grew up in a way different world where we've really watched gaming evolve. And now, you know, by the time Oliver's 15, they'll probably have the holodeck for real. I think they will. It'll just be different. They're holding back on it right now. They just want to save it. You think so? Yeah. Holding back on it. They can do it now. Or Oliver will be able to have the Aluma Room that has the boobies on the wall everywhere. Yes. Just in time for that phase. Boobs everywhere. Just in time for that phase. I thought you just called the motorboat room. Akuma JP in our chat room. By the way, hi, chatters. We're always joined with the live chat room because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network. vognetwork.com. Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Akuma JP in chat says, sky sounds old. Ha ha ha. Well, jerk, keep this in mind. OLR is on our 11th year this year. So, if we had started this show when we were 18, we'd already be 29. We didn't start this show when we were 18. We were more like 23 or 24. So, you do the math. You know what? The big joke amongst my friends is going to happen on my birthday this year. And what's that? Because I'll be 37. In a row? I rest my case. So, and I'll be 35. So, Jamie's the old one. Come on, Akuma. Redirect your jokes appropriately. No, no, no, no, no, no. Vintage. This rack took years to grow. And I'm two weeks older than Rob. I know. I feel like the young kid. If Loki wasn't here, I'd be the baby for once. And all my friends, I get the old jokes all the time from my friends. I guess I just hang out with youngins. That's the deal. So, Akuma JP in our chat room says, so you are old, lol. Bonk. You're only as old as you feel, honestly. And I will say this with all honesty. We will talk about video games in a minute here, but obviously I still play video games, which a lot of people think is a youthful activity, although I don't think so. I think because we all grew up in a generation that at least had Atari 2600, video games has always been a part of our lives. So, I can't imagine not playing video games at this point, right? But honestly, my 30s, way better than my 20s. Really, for real. I have to agree with that for myself as well. I mean, not that my 20s sucked or not that I hate 20 year olds. That's totally not the case. But I think a lot of that has to do with, and those of you that listen to the show a long time know that I was really sick when I was 29. I missed two or three weeks at OLR because I'd been in the hospital. I'd have surgery. So, it was one of those things where they had to screen me because they thought I could have had pancreatic cancer and that was the type of stuff I had going on. So, it was scary and I think all that stuff going through that before 30 kind of definitely made me feel like turning 30 is awesome. I get to turn 30, yes! You want to know what's funny? What? Back in my early days on AOL, I had a friend who I chatted, another anime fan who was 10 years old. I remember chatting with him when he graduated college. That makes me feel old. Yeah, I know, right? I think about my nieces who are like 22 years old and stuff. I'm like, my nieces can drink. It's weird. I remember when they were born. But now you can take them out drinking. The other day, we got an email to the show that was like, I've been listening to you since I was 13. I'm like, oh my God. He's like, I'm in college now. Oh my God. Yeah, but how many TV shows have been on that have lasted as long as us? Not many. Gunsmoke, The Simpsons. Doctor Who. There's only a few. So we're awesome. Well, we just love being here with you all in our chat room and live at the Voice Ease Network. I was going to talk about the meteor before we get into our gaming week. Surely everybody saw that meteor talk about something straight out of a video game. What the hell was that? They say that that kind of stuff happens all the time. It happened in San Francisco, right? Later on. Yeah, but it totally wasn't the same thing. It didn't shatter windows and stuff. It was just like, oh, there's light in the sky. Probably somebody's science project out there. Russia, meteor shatter you. Yeah, I've heard all those jokes all over Facebook. Little pictures in Soviet Russia. I was busy being asleep. Well, you don't live in Russia. I think if you'd been sleeping when that thing went off, it would have woken you up. Well, no, no, no, no. I actually didn't see the news until I got up late today because I've been sick most of the day. So I was like, meteor, fuck, sleep. No, watching the videos online blew my mind. You can just hear the big pow and then all the shattered glass and of course the car alarms is always the best part. Somebody get Bruce Willis's Armageddon. I love all the weird radio stations or radio they're listening to in Russia as they have these dash cams going. Sometimes it's like American pop music, sometimes it's something completely different. And the other cool part, the Russians, they're never fazed by any of this. There's no like, oh my God! It's just like, right? It's like, what? You're just like, oh, that's weird. Maybe it's a nuke and we'll all die, oh well. Can you imagine if that type of thing had happened in like, I don't know, Philadelphia or something? Yeah, and there's like a camera going. I can just imagine it right now. Well, they showed the San Francisco one, like I said, and it was just like a small thing. The guy's like driving on the freeway and he's like, Oh my God, did you see that? It's just like, okay. Oh my God, thanks Obama. I saw something similar back when I lived up in Lake County. I was driving home really late at night and there was a big green streak across the sky, but it didn't explode like that one, so obviously it wasn't even close to the size, but I thought it was pretty cool. I was like, oh wow, that thing just comes streaking across and it turned kind of green and just disappeared off in the distance. If it had been in my neck of the South, it'd be, the fuck is that? Hand me a beer. Shit, that means we're going to get them another hurricane. Porkchop in our chat room says, I assume the dash cams are for insurance purposes. I guess I'm assuming they're in public cars. Yeah, so I thought maybe the police cars. No, apparently they're really, from what I read, they're really into dash cams because I guess in traffic courts and stuff, they don't take any sort of verbal arguments. They have to have physical evidence. And so because of altercations like that, you know, any sort of car accident, they want to have something to document it. So that's why they do it. You know, Nelly was born in Russia. Did she have anything to say about it? No. Thank God it didn't happen here. She was born in the Ukraine. So it's a little different. A little different. Uh, interesting. Well, I don't know what that has to say. Yeah, Rob, everything Slavic is not Russian. Thank you. Are you sure? It was in the 80s. I thought Canada was a state. Anyhow, I don't know what that had to do with video games, but as far as like nerd news goes, like it was one of those things where I watched it. I was like, oh my God. You make a burning Legion joke. Yes, I saw that on Twitter. Kashi Meteor. Someone Kashi Meteor. Code Man in chat says it was Team Rocket. Yes, I think I saw that one with the Super Bowl lights going out gif. There was a gif of the lights going out and Team Rocket shows up. I guess it was Goku. All right. Let's get into video games and the video games that you have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Sakura. I just ate the fuck out of a Mars bar. That was awesome. You inhaled that thing. I love Mars bars. Seriously, it's my favorite candy bar. So I beat Mass Effect 2 again. I started on Mass Effect 3 and got Fly Cam working. But now, you know, we got that patch 1.5 and none of my cheats work anymore. So I just figured out how to put in key binding commands using the coalesced editor. And now all I have to do is hit zero for god mode. No, but really, I've beaten that game so many times it's not even funny. I played WoW for an hour. And I would actually log on and play more WoW but I would like people to run in dungeons with me so I don't have to you know, plug it. And yes, I know that Mars bars are Milky Ways but they're not the regular Milky Ways. They taste better. They're different-er. They're actually from Mars. They are. And you don't even realize, I used to get Mars bars when I was a little kid so having it say Mars with the packaging on it and everything makes me stupendously happy. So, now if I can find whatchamacallits I'd be even happier. I played I played something else. I don't remember what it was. Oh yeah, Dan had a friend over and they played through Contra hardcore and then played through Ghouls and Ghosts which was pretty fun because my friend and I left and then we came back and they were still playing Ghouls and Ghosts like hours later. So I'm like, what playthrough were you on? Oh, just the beginning of the second playthrough. Really. So yeah. And then I got now this isn't a game but it's related to a game I found the Mass Effect Paragon Lost for like 16 bucks brand new. So I was like, what the hell, we just got our tax money let's buy it. It didn't suck. The only thing that I really didn't like about it was how the kroken were drawn. I did not care for the character design. And it got me in the feels. Damn you Bioware. So yeah. Damn those feels. Damn the battle tits. Full speed ahead. Alright, let's move on to Loki. How was your gaming week, Loki? I didn't play a whole ton this week. I played, let's see, a little bit of Skyrim I'm sure I started some of the kind of DLC stuff or not DLC stuff, the mod quests I guess if you will. There's one that's kind of where you hire a boat and you can actually go to a bunch of different islands and stuff. And it was neat, I guess. I mean, it's pretty well done. And they voice acted everything so that's a little weird hearing people that don't sound like the five different NPCs that are in the game. They have voice, all the characters it's ridiculous. So I played a little bit of that and then a little bit of Borderlands and more Call of Duty. We actually bought Map Pack 4 or Content Pack 4 so now we have a few more maps that I've already kind of gotten sick of. But we got to do something because Grand Theft Auto 5 is not coming out in May like we had hoped it was so got to have something to tide us over. And then I just got done playing DDRX2 on my PC. Even though, yes, that's an arcade game, but it runs on a PC so I played it anyways. And it isn't the versus second mixing, that's 3 I guess. But it's X2. It's cool, looks like Stepmania, I guess. It looked a lot to me like the Playstation 3 version of the game. They just adapted that engine. Or the Wii, DDR2 on the Wii. I'm surprised they don't release a PC version. It runs on a PC, there's no work to be done. Literally no work to be done. Licensing would be the only thing. I guess, but just put Konami Originals in there. Done. Put it on Steam. There you go. Money. Just rolling in. So there's that. And then my wife has been taking over the Xbox because she's been playing Fable 3. Really? Yeah. That's not even the best Fable game. She played Fable 2 all the way. And so she's playing Fable 3. Wow, this is your wife who usually makes fun of games. Who's getting into Fable. Or is into Fable. Yeah, she is into Fable. Does she play good or bad? She's playing good. Okay. That game is... It just makes me realize how much Peter Molyneaux is full of crap. And he's just like talking about all these different enhancements and all this is the first time ever in the game and the dog is awesome blah blah blah blah. Okay, you're so full of shit it's not even funny. By the way folks, is anyone still curious about curiosity? Because I'm pretty sure everybody's fucking forgotten about this curiosity. No, you know who hasn't forgotten about curiosity is Alan. Because he'll be sitting there on my iPad and he'll walk into the room and he'll be like, Have you checked on the cube Rob? Have you checked on the cube? What's in the cube? Did you find what's in the cube yet? Break the touch. Break the cubes. He does it just like that too. Break the cubes Rob. I don't know what you would even what that's going to be. I think it's going to just be like whoever finally, the last person to give that game up is going to be the winner pretty much. Well I was going to ask you about this because there was that new Alien game that came out this week from Gearbox and it's been getting a lot of shit all over the internet except for one site. Apparently really liked it. But whatever. And then I went on this Twitter thing. Now I don't know shit about this game really but I was kind of like, why is everybody getting on this one guy's jock? Because you know one particular organization seemed to like it. And I was like, well isn't like a difference of opinion okay? And it was really weird because Metacritic retweeted or no favorited one of my tweets. I was like, that was kind of weird but okay. Alright. But yeah there was all this crap going on. I guess a big part of it was that a lot of the stuff they'd been showing at E3 and the type of stuff they'd been talking about didn't actually come to fruition in the game. Well yeah it makes a lot of sense. And people are like, oh we're going to sue and I'm just like well game companies have been doing this shit for years and you just brought up Peter Molyneux. Like he's the master of this shit. He makes up shit all the time. Exactly. Who's trying to sue him? I know nothing. He's not really working he's not really attached to any more Fable games or anything like that as far as I'm aware. There was Fable It's Not On Rails. I seriously don't even know the name of the game. It's just Fable It's Not On Rails. Fable The Journey Fable The Book The Game The Series The Movie I don't know. But yeah even the whole Gearbox well there's two jokes I made about it. First off Gearbox you've got Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox and Borderlands Gearbox well this is made by Duke Nukem Forever Gearbox. And then the second thing is yeah it's just because they showed more fancy features and stuff like that that may have been running on a PC version or something like that that come time to actually implement that on a console oh we don't have the memory bandwidth to do all these fancy things we've got to scale it back a bit or oh we don't have enough processing power or the frame rates and shit or whatever and so maybe that's why. But then again why wouldn't they just allow that to kind of run unleashed on the PC probably because it's a console port I don't know. Who cares? Bad games happen all the time. Are you really surprised that a movie tie-in game is bad? Really? I mean everyone's shocked that this movie tie-in game is bad I mean it doesn't really matter it's just yeah we all really kind of hope that Duke Nukem is as good as Borderlands hell I thought Duke Nukem forever this is going to be awesome because it's somebody of the guys that did Borderlands No No it's the team that did Duke Nukem forever clearly RossDielUT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says differences is great but when there's literally one that looks shady even with a game that doesn't get well received there's always at least a group of people who like the game well yeah I mean you know one guy liked the game but I can think of like you know there's been like that one voice that passionately defended it Why does everyone have to be on the same page as far as like you know what they say now it'd be different if they didn't mention any of the flaws but maybe they just thought that you know it didn't really affect the game too much it's a person's opinion one guy's opinion and you're just like flipping shit over it There's also no evidence in this scenario I mean people are like oh because it's running next to an ad for the same game it's clearly been bought I can't believe first off I can't believe I am the one defending a big name site like I'm usually the first one to criticize that stuff Yeah because you know what they're going to sell ads so they can run that site Oh my gosh game sites sell game ads get out but there's no further evidence that this whole thing was you know and so the Twitter wants to convict and say this is full of shady it's not like that whole scenario with what was the freaking game at GameSpot that got that guy Kane and Lynch Yeah that whole thing like there was more evidence and there was stuff that came out about that and all the shady dealings and the guy himself basically said you know yeah it was you know there was some stuff going on where the publisher was yanking it and all this stuff I mean I don't know I just think like the internet should just get over it okay there was one person that said it was good you know well you know what somebody out there probably liked Fusion Frenzy 2 somebody out there probably liked Yaris it was free I like Silent Hill Revelations the movie nobody else like that I want it I need to see it you and Ospher actually Ospher on Twitter would defend that so there you go it's something about being high on leaderboards on VoG ActDef would probably like it too well he did like it I think look at oh my god you know look at you know if you're gonna like blame or mark games down just because of like glitches and stuff like that then Earth Defense Force 2017 should have gotten like a one out of ten because that thing is glitchy as hell there is no physics no physics whatsoever or at least no realistic physics it's just it's crap the AI is completely retarded so yeah it happens get over it Ross Steel UT in chat says and it wasn't just Gearbox that was the problem with the game it took seven fucking years to make and had eight devs on it Lincoln just came out a movie by Steven Spielberg and that took like I think 18 years to make that's why Sally Field was cast as Mary Todd because she was cast in it like ten years ago and you know had to defend the casting of the part and stay with it it got nominated for an Oscar sometimes things get trapped in development hell it doesn't necessarily mean they turn out bad like you're doing forever well but that's that's that's not helping my case actually L.A. Noire I think was in development hell thank you that's that's a better that's a good review thank you Grand Theft Auto 5 just got delayed yeah but that that had that hasn't been out no that hasn't been that's very long I mean it's not like this Grand Theft Auto 5 came out in 2001 you know it's like wait a second hey we're missing some numbers here alright let's move on with gaming week so we're gonna be here for an hour I'll talk about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go to Flaco I haven't played a lot of new stuff this week because I've been having long hours at work and you know when I come home I'm like I have to raid in WoW or something but I did play one new game and it was something where it went on sale this weekend and so I get a text message from Shane hey you should get Pokemon Black 2 it's on sale Black 2 has the sassier Pokemon and it's on sale right now at Best Buy so you should get it I get a text an hour later did you get it yet text an hour later you know you can order it online you can just go pick it up after work before it sells out and it's like you know he keeps texting me like did you buy the Pokemon yet why haven't you bought Pokemon why won't you take a good deal you can talk about it on OLR so finally it's like shut up alright I'll buy the game so Jamie are you gonna get in the Pokemon now pretty soon because you guys are all talking like gateway game addicts or something yeah okay you say that now let me see it you want to see it no I want to see the box it's actually super cute I don't care alright so here's the thing it's on the DS not the 3DS but the DS and well then I could play it but I don't care I've been having fun with it you know what here's what I like compared to Pearl it moves at a faster pace it gives you all this shit up front and you know you don't have to like go forever and grind more and I feel like there's a larger variety of Pokemon at the beginning than there was in Pearl and it's just kind of little quality of life improvements here's where the game kind of like goes crazy though is that there's all these like online things like I can't figure out half this shit with the online like some of it's in the manual and some of it I tried to go online I tried to have Shane explain some of it to me but it's just it's so weird like you can use your little online gear to put your Pokemon to sleep and then you go on the website and you register for the website and then you link your DS to the website and then you can do that Pokemon that you just put to sleep you can have in the virtual world that's kind of like Farmville but you can also play these little online games so your Pokemon can send you things back in the regular game once you tell your Pokemon to wake up and then you launch your game again and you hit the button to tell it to wake up and go find where like it's like oh my god it's like an 18 step process my brain just went somewhere really horrible the moment you said put him to sleep put him down sorry Pikachu it's funny but I mean it's not I can appreciate that the Pokemon company is like trying to do these new things with Nintendo's infrastructure which I can't imagine is a real delight to work with but it just kind of goes to show like the fact that there's just all these bells and whistles that are buried like five minutes deep is just I don't know I feel like Pokemon kind of needs a better interface like it would be better if they could streamline a lot of that maybe the new 3DS version X and Y will fix a lot of that because X and Y sure looks good so it'll be cool to see that but yeah I mean don't let my little rant get you wrong especially for the core game about finding the new Pokemon and challenging the gym leaders and all that it's all it's all solid and it moves at a faster pace than the other games do so you'll get pretty immediate rewards out of it there's a medal system in the game since Nintendo doesn't have an achievement system they did their own little thing with medals and you can have your little title when you go online you know what I found my copy of Pearl did you? yeah it was dusty yeah I had played Pearl about three weeks ago and then I was like gosh this game kind of moves really slow but this one's a little better actually it's a lot better it's all animations in the little cut scenes too which is much better than what it was before where it's just like you know you see them like shake up and down and that's like their little attack a little silly you know what my cat's butt makes me think of Pokemon what? because she does you know when you see the little Pokemon bounce back and forth on the thing she does this little thing now where she wiggles her butt and then jumps back and forth and I'm like Midna used fetch or something oh I should say this too I'm playing Pokemon Black 2 and I didn't play Black 1 and I'm doing just fine it's like the sequel thing not an issue and I can appreciate that that you know it didn't have to like they always reference like all the people that you talk to are like two years ago this happened two years ago this happened so I guess that's kind of its way of catching you up so that's that's kind of cool I guess what is this that you're showing me? that okay that internet meme is seriously 15 years old I know I think it's great that someone still remembers it she's showing me the pictures of the cat oh is that in chat room? yeah the pictures of the cats playing Pokemans and it says my Pokemans let me show you them I saw that cat picture like 15 years ago I'm saving it alright Flaco Jones how was your gaming week? it was pretty good I got to play a lot of games this week or not a lot of games but a lot of two games and the first one was Unfinished Swan I kind of bought it on Super Bowl Sunday just because I played the demo which is basically just the first level and really liked it and my wife kept pestering me she's like why don't you just buy this game we love playing the demo but then we have to stop and it's like okay I'll buy the game then I was mad because I missed out it was on sale and I missed the sale by like a day and I was like well I could have saved five dollars she's like just buy it who cares that's really rough when your wife is sitting there saying buy the damn game Flaco buy the game just buy it I don't care if it's not on sale like what kind of bizarro world do you live in well I'm really glad I bought it because it was an awesome game and we ended up playing it a lot on Super Bowl Sunday we'd go back and forth I'd watch a little game we'd play some more of that I tweeted about that and my tweet was actually favorited by the level designer of the game so I didn't hashtag anything but I guess you can get stuff come up this tweet deck I think allows you to run one feed for your Twitter and so but you can also run a search and it'll pop right up there like okay do you remember when we had Ronnie from Big Brother Eleven on Horde House a couple weeks ago yeah uh okay so we got him uh this was really Shane and X for his doing I can't take credit we got him addicted to Frog Fractions but I sent which is that Flash game and if you haven't heard of it it's hilarious but Shane and X for won't shut up about that game so they were talking about it on the show so I sent Ronnie the link and I said something like here's Frog Fractions you're welcome I've ruined your life or whatever or something like that and the guy who wrote Frog Fractions favorited it like I didn't hashtag it I didn't include him he just randomly sees the tweet I guess so it's just funny like and I'm assuming Metacritic found my other thing this week in a similar fashion yeah probably if you mention anybody they'll have they have someone who's watching the Twitters and will exactly watch what you say on Twitter so yeah so I played that and mainly I had gotten all the trophies except for we still needed the hardest trophy to get in the game was to do the first level only using three paintballs and the point of the game is you splatter paint around at least the first part of the game you splatter paint around to see where you're going and it's kind of like a puzzler it's kind of built like a shooter though you know cause you just have like you're just shooting paintballs all over the place can you make dirty noises while you're doing it cause the way you describe it where you're like shooting paint everywhere you could make these really disgusting noises like then not quite like that it just sounds like a paintball gun so uh we did that my wife kind of talked me through oh okay what next time you play you should try it there was something in that game that did make a dirty sound I can't remember it now though especially with the wife around not the kids so much but with the wife around see they're always around when we play the game that's because they love it so much but yeah so we we we did that my wife talked me through it she found a guide online and it's like walk backwards until you hit a wall walk left until you hit a wall walk straight you'll hear leaves cracking under your feet cause you pretty much do level blind everything's completely whited out so I we got that trophy and that was our 100% for that so that was really cool and the other game I played of course was Ni No Kuni I passed the 31 hour mark last night and I played a little bit more today did it go downhill after 15 hours? no I have no idea what that was about I don't know maybe my hours are different than other people's because I've been doing everything so I guess you can't really get I don't know can you hit a wall if you're just doing everything? I don't think so I feel like you hit a wall if you're trying to speed do it really fast and then you kind of hit a wall because maybe you haven't leveled enough maybe you haven't gone out there cause it is pretty grindy though I found it it's not super grindy for me because if I do the quest in the process of doing the quest I fight enough battles that I level up and it's not really felt grindy to me but I could see how people would think it's too grindy but I don't mind that I mean Secret of Mana is really really grindy and there's no quest in that you just have to go out and grind grind grind to get your party up old school Final Fantasy games were very very very grindy so I mean compared to what we used to play it's not grindy at all it's a walk in the park I felt a lot like playing WoW you know doing these quests and going out and finding rare pets and things like that that's what I've really been getting hooked into is finding all these familiars I look at some online like what's the best one like oh I want to get that so I go find one and I get it and you have to fight a while because the taming is kind of random you can't just tame it you just have to wait for it to kind of fall into your lap I've gotten very lucky apparently I spent an hour trying to get uh what is that town Alma Moon the one with the milk right yeah were you trying to get the babanas the big uh banana guys I had to search for the banana guys for an hour an hour and then finally I trapped one and then here's the hilarious part right because for that quest you have to get the banana and the turban monkey right yeah so I go and I'm like all excited so I go to turn in the banana and he's like oh you got the bananas but you didn't get the turban monkey well what I didn't realize is that the turban monkey had evolved because I had him in my party so the turban monkey evolved so I had to go get another one they don't evolve unless you give him a treat well he was in my party I wanted him to evolve I didn't realize that was so adorable I'm gonna feed you he was so hungry I wanted him I don't evolve very quickly don't feed him after midnight yeah I fed him after midnight and that was my mistake yeah well that's pretty bad I could have screamed I could have screamed that's why I haven't played in a week and a half I'm still punishing the game well see when I do those quests I usually go out and just do that because I consider that kind of one of my grind sessions because I know those I think it's only come up one at a time in a different town but and then that's like the first thing I'll do I'm like oh this is a good time to grind because this one quest requires a lot of grinding so I'll go out and I'll go tame the three pets and then I'll bring them back and I bring them back right away so I didn't realize I wouldn't have metamorphosized them anyway but I didn't know that was something that would mess it up so now it's good to know you don't ever evolve your I have only evolved the main ones that I use I don't evolve a lot of them I evolve them all well if you hold on to them a little bit their stats get better and the stats carry over I always hold them long enough so that they get every ability like I look at their abilities to make sure I'm not gonna miss anything by evolving them but then I'll evolve them yeah that's usually a good point to do some of them I hold out longer because some of them are more like late bloomers and stuff so you can actually stretch them out a little bit longer have more stats carry over it's not a big deal if you're just gonna play through the game and beat it but there's some end game stuff in there some post game that there's certain pets that are really strong and so if you just kinda keep them in your party just let them level they'll be like really powerful by the end of the game and you do the colosseum stuff like I already did the first round of the colosseum and I beat that and it was really hard but I got through that the fencer puppy is really good right? or is it a kitty? yeah I have that he's pretty good I still like them on might and I look online and people say oh the mighty might's not that good but I don't know I really like him he's got a shield he defends really well he blocks out of attacks I use him I still use him as my main guys tank so yeah I don't know people complain about him though I guess but the cat is getting better the cat's lower too but I've metamorphosized both those guys I just kinda have two metamorphosized pets and I always use my third slot just as like a leveling slot and I did just get the new Nino Cooney one the one that's free on the Playstation network I was just gonna ask you to talk quickly about the downloads cause there's a free like what gold one or something? it's a little well mine was a little red dragon and I named it Little Strazza a little WoW reference cause it looks like it reminds me of Alex Strazza in the Red Dragons like it looks just like a red whelpling from WoW so I named it Little Strazza and uh yeah and it's a little red dragon and I've not even used it in combat yet but it's I've heard it's pretty good and I looked online most of the dragons are really good so I'm gonna work on that one you reminded me about names have you really just sat there and read some of the suggested names cause every Pokemon that you can pick in the game has like four suggested names and some of them are so fucking funny like the Turban Monkey thing uh one of the suggested names was Turbanula I died I died some of them are so funny I need to look at that now I look at the first one and I always change it always cycle through cause there's four for each one well I named him Toad Bandit cause he looked kinda like Toad but with a bandit mask on so you're Toad Bandit ok so though I have to ask this cause this is always the thing that pissed me off in the old ones is it when you rename them they keep that name like forever through all of their evolutions but does it still let you know what they originally are? you know he's talking Ni No Kuni and not Pokemon right? I'm sorry I was thinking of Pokemon it's really a lot it's pretty much the same fucking thing I never played Pokemon but now I'm kinda interested cause I'm like this game's really fun maybe I would like Pokemon cause I like getting my familiars I like feeding them the combat is the totally different part I'm sorry I had looked down for a moment and then I hear pets and I hear naming and I'm like Pokemon? to answer your question even though you didn't ask about this you can rename them but it will say what the name of their kind of general familiar is so if you need to look something up on that you can for anyone else who's interested in that and that was my gaming week Ni No Kuni lots of it Ni No Lots of Kuni housekeeping twitter.com slash olr we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and on google plus as well please consider joining our fan communities I don't think we have any special events or anything of note coming up so I mean episode 500 but that's not until April we still don't know what we're doing yet should be fun alright let's move into some gaming news tonight and talk about what's going on in the world of gaming some big news today right Logie? Yeah so today Bungie revealed Destiny and they have like a little kind of behind the scenes development video that showed actual I'm pretty sure no actual gameplay or if there was it was so insignificant that I didn't remember but basically Destiny is this always on persistent kind of first person shooter adventure I guess where you take on these guardians of kind of one of the last civilizations in the solar system and you kind of venture out to different planets and stuff like that and fight aliens and all sorts of stuff so it's kind of I think what you know originally the description was kind of like a single player co-op and you know multiplayer game all mixed together all at once it should be interesting I'm not sure exactly how how they're going to how you're going to interact with their people it was going to be like kind of an emo this reminded me it sounded a lot like fantasy star I guess you know where as that was you know fantasy star online that's a good way of putting it that is kind of what it sounds like where it's like you have the central hub type of thing but you can go out with friends and I guess they were showing I actually did watch one of the four minute videos they put out where they showed how the iPhone I'm assuming Android as well would integrate with it where you could like send messages like let's meet up on Venus or something like that I don't know and you can let's meet up on Uranus hahaha let's do some grinding on Uranus dark side of Uranus alright anyways yeah so it looks neat I mean definitely a huge franchise they've got like a ten year plan with it and they're just gonna wait wait wait ten year plan the game announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 right? I think it's going to be probably Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and then probably whatever next gen consoles also so their ten year plan is how to get you to buy it three times is that really what the ten year plan consists of? it's got to be right? I'm not sure yeah I think so because they're going to get you on the PlayStation 3 and 360 where the game comes out which it's assuming the game comes out this holiday season Destiny is going to be going up against these new consoles which if Destiny is as ambitious as they say I mean go back to our last weeks show about how much these new consoles really need to be here right now and if people are going to adopt them I would imagine there's versions of Destiny in development for these PlayStation 4 and Xbox next to the world but it's definitely not going to be just next gen they can't Activision is smart enough to know we're not going to gamble on next gen right away they're going to do it like okay we're going to put out the current gen stuff and we're going to put out the next gen stuff at the same time that way if you want the next gen version of the game you will have it if you want a current gen version of the game you can have that too because they know that there's a huge install base already why cut out all that money? and none for Wii U buy that's hard to say with Activision I mean because they've got they have been supporting the Wii U quite a bit and they even have a few games coming out although I mean out in the hot excited I began about like re-releasing the amazing Spiderman that was the Xbox 360 version now they're adding DLC and re-releasing that they have Wii U version 4 The Walking Dead and even though they did Call of Duty and Call of Duty kind of flopped on the Wii U they're still supporting the Wii U actually Activision is a pretty strong supporter of the Wii U right now maybe followed up by Ubisoft although you know a lot of their games aren't coming to the Wii U I would say I would see a Wii U version of this coming out I mean especially if they're doing an Xbox 360 version why not they would work did you find the lack of PC interesting? because I sure did yeah a little bit I mean the PC is the thing that could evolve over those 10 years and the PC is the one thing that will still be here you know us people upgrade their own PCs for other purposes but this is so early that they could very well come out with a PC version for it I mean who's to say that there's not going to be a PC version for it this is just kind of like hey we're announcing this thing really say which consoles it's going to be on so they didn't say it wasn't going to be on PC it's just I don't know what did you think about all this? what do you think? because I have an opinion that others might not agree with but what do you think Loki? but I don't know really much about it yet I mean I'm not going to be like oh my god Bungie made it I got to go buy it I didn't really buy Halo I bought Halo 3 that was the only Halo game I ever owned and I was just kind of like okay this is hard I mean it's just not like I don't lose my shit over Bungie games I'm going to be blunt a lot of this felt like smoke up my ass this whole video I watched this whole pomp and circumstance this is our big ambition and I really felt like half that video was like well you know we made Halo and we got to follow up to that and Halo was this and we've poured all our company into this since Halo and Halo Halo Halo Halo like they had to name check Halo but here's the thing that gets me about that Halo was a great game, don't get me wrong Halo 2, one of the greatest video games ever made and here's the problem I have with a lot of that comparison is that Halo 4 which Bungie didn't do was better than Halo 3 yes absolutely in many ways was better than Halo 3 better than Halo 2 I don't know gaming was a lot different with all those years in between and Halo 2 really pushed so many things forward in a different way but you know Halo 4 they didn't have anything to do with and it was a better game than what they did at the end of the run I'm not the only one thinking it okay so when they talk about all this Destiny stuff and like you know how much of their Halo influence and all this has to do I'm kind of like now are they saying that they had one foot out the door when ODST and all this stuff was being done and they were already working on Destiny or what what stock am I putting into this because really I felt like all we heard about today was an idea and although some of it's interesting like the iPhone integration and you know what this felt like? this felt like a Kickstarter video like at the very end at the very end they're gonna like okay and now we need you to back this pre-order it we need you to go pre-order it and back the game yes that is a great comparison that is really what it felt like it felt like somebody's Kickstarter video and it's like and there was very little gameplay in it there was some gameplay I sort of remember the gameplay I saw was nothing new nothing new but granted it was three seconds of gameplay but I looked at it and went okay so you can co-op with your friends and maybe they're gonna be putting like a warlock type class and a hunter class and a first person shooter in more of a mass effect way than a Diablo way but I'm still like I mean I'm not convinced that this is like the OMG rule breaking game that's gonna have a ten year cycle well here's the thing I'm wondering though cause if you have this coming out and this is supposed to be like a first person shooter let's just say where are they gonna put this as far as in comparison to Call of Duty I mean if it's gonna release with a next gen console or something like that or around that time I mean you're gonna it's pretty crowded in the fourth quarter you're gonna have Grand Theft Auto in September you're gonna have some massive games in November you're gonna have another Call of Duty game you're gonna have it's just where are they gonna put a game of this size I guess I don't know it's Activision it's gonna be weird to see them splitting their resources as far as marketing goes between Destiny and Call of Duty I'm wondering if they're kinda like well Call of Duty's just not quite you know what it used to be we're just gonna kinda back burner that a little bit and just kinda release something that's a slight upgrade and people will buy it and then we'll focus all of our money into this because this is our 10 year deal thing I'm looking at some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com code man says this is the first I've heard of this game is that bad? No because when you really need to hear about the game is you know just before the game comes out those week one sales but this is their efforts to get more people talking about it success here we are and now you've been educated on it so here's the thing too why announce it now it's like a really weird time to announce it I mean why not it's an empty floor in Telly 3 why is Sony doing a big announcement next week there's not a lot of other stuff video game things for people to be writing about Sony I think needs something you know because right now you know they don't have any Playstation I mean they kind of announced their slate of Playstation 3 titles with The Last of Us and then they've got you know a couple games that I don't think a lot of people care about like Puppeteer and was it the Beyond Beyond Two Souls which Beyond Two Souls looks alright but I mean let's be honest that's not going to be like this huge it's it's still kind of niche I mean the genre and then their Puppeteer game which I got to be honest their kind of kids' titles aren't doing very well or the children's titles I guess or younger skewed titles so I think they have to really come out with you know here's what our game plan is you guys you know stick with us you know especially with the Vita because holy crap Vita there's nothing really announced other than we know there's that new game from Media Molecule there's going to be the Killzone shooter game and and what? There could be some type of ace in the hole with the next Playstation we don't know how the next Playstation will interface with the Vita could it do a Wii U type of thing because that apparently now everybody feels like they have to call you you know because I know we're going to be talking about a lot of it next week and even a little bit later in the show but like my bar for the Playstation 4 right now is set so fucking low that's good though that's a good place for Sony to be in isn't it? don't they want I mean if the bar is low that's actually good news yeah because they could really kick your ass with these expectations but here's the thing I'm setting the bar so low because I don't think they're going to hit that even I mean it's just I don't expect anything from them I just I'm expecting to be kind of like huh okay cool well here's the other thing too is remember guys it's February and the console won't be out until November I'm sure is a safe bet if it's not delayed right so you know don't expect them to say a lot you know maybe we'll get some pictures maybe we'll see a couple of the games but don't expect price don't expect release date don't expect all the bells and whistles expect an idea of what Sony thinks the next generation of gaming is please God do not be Facebook just don't I don't know social game I really just I'm going to get irritated if I hear that word too much at the same time hmm I kind of hope I kind of hope that they have announcements like that because we need some more memes seriously we need more well this is why it's a pre-recorded thing Namco Namco I bet I'm expecting a Ridge Racer okay I'm expecting a Ridge Racer game it's been a while okay I need a new Ridge Racer game alright I'm going to move on with news from a company we always expect great things from which had a surprising announcement this week that they actually let some people go it's Valve yeah apparently up to 25 people were affected by these changes now a lot of this is very vague but some of this came from a tweet hardware designer Jerry Ellsworth wrote a tweet that said yep got fired today time for new exciting projects so that was somebody at Valve and was working on hardware and the internet did some more research and found out that part of what she had been working on was living room PC controllers also affected thanks to internet research director of business development Jason Holtman had left the company some employee pages on Valve's site actually changed pretty significantly very interesting renewal did end up commenting on this to Engadgett so it could have nothing to do with layoffs maybe something it could be a personnel issue although that's a hell of a speculation let's just say that he was working on controllers I don't think they really need to work on a controller because it's already kind of integrated with the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller why do we need another controller? Steambox would come with its own controller yeah but whatever just use another third party controller I don't think they really need to make another controller just use an existing controller support any controller here's the other thing as much as it sucks this is just the ebb and flow of the game industry is that layoffs sometimes happen at really weird times for reasons because the project is done and you have a lot of projects where it goes from one to another and it's not like the business is always constant there's not projects that go on forever unless maybe Bungie is feeling pretty good with Destiny or whatever but if Destiny doesn't do very well oh if that flops that will hose the whole company but anyway that's neither here nor there projects start and projects end and if there's not a new project to go to when one project ends people are let go it sucks but it happens that's the game industry so it's just weird to hear it coming from Valve because it's like dude shouldn't he be working on Half Life 3? but who knows what they have up their sleeve oh no there could be no Half Life 3 we will be waiting forever I still if you want to sell a million of those Steam Boxes just announce two exclusives announce one exclusive anything that ends in 3 coming out of Valve I'm talking Half Life 3, Portal 3 Left 4 Dead 3, Team Fortress 3 any of those gets the lead on the Steam Box Steam Box will sell more than we do Half Life 2, Episode 3 Half Life 3, Portal 3 Team Fortress 3 and you'll outsell Wii U in like a day and maybe like Garry's Mod X3 I don't know alright let's move on Dark Saga how about something that's a little less frustrating as soon as I can get a stupid iPad to work ok so there have been some leaks and there's people are kind of oh ok you know taking it a little bit in stride but there is a few issues that are coming out with the DualShock 4 release image who all here has seen it so I don't ok well the controller itself and the photo by the way also shows that that might be a dev kit for the Orbis dev kit but they're saying that you know just on the items pointed out on the controller itself is that there's the two point multi touch pad the move tracking light on the controller itself the loudspeaker and a headphone socket and then they're talking about what they're seeing on the what they're I'm guessing to be the Orbis dev kit would be a 50 gigabyte Blu-ray drive two USB 3.0 slots and just a number of other things they're basically saying that it's going to be some pretty hardcore material and they have a lot of high hopes for the controller now honestly I think that that might be a little too much in the controller I'm actually wondering how much it's going to weigh and I don't think it's going to come out with all of the things that they're trying to pump into it but it's interesting it does raise some questions I think it's actually it's not multi touch on that touch pad it's just single and there's the rear touch pad from the Vita isn't it? the rear one is multi touch you can pinch and stuff like that but what's kind of different about it though is they're saying that it's basically going to be used for interfaces and basic stuff I don't even know why you need it to be honest and then of course they are reshaping the trigger buttons on there they say they're supposed to be a little bit more springy like the 360 stuff surely you've all seen the gif of where the little move light is actually a siren and then the little screen is flashing used game, used game, used game that's the purpose of the screen the little loud speaker so Popo can come get you it looks like the analog sticks they've got a little difference on the top of it it's kind of got a little bit of lip on the edge of the actual sticks themselves so that your thumbs don't fall off of them like they do on the PS3 ones the one thing that they're saying with this one is actually that they were saying that there wasn't a corresponding touch on the back this is on the front of the controller is where the touch is showing well that's good because the rear touch on the Vita especially since I like to drum my fingers on the back of the controller that would just be irritating and then the other things there's a share button on there that was spotted in the upper left hand corner of the touch pad area that actual speaker spot they're saying might actually be a microphone kind of similar to what's on the Vita I guess or could it maybe pick finally it picks up your voice like there's a built in cross voice chat thing on Playstation like there should have been all along it could be I mean that would be pretty nice if it had like a built in headset in there where you could put your headphones plugged in wouldn't it be cool if the little screen could show you your opponent? I think it's one goldmine that we use missing we got this virtual console and all this stuff why can't I play games online with my friends and video chat with them at the same time? the problem though is I don't think that would work because if you think about it there's no camera on the actual controller itself that you can see no I don't think there's actually a camera you would see a camera on that I mean I don't think here's what I want to know so they've got that little bar at the end that's basically supposed to be like the move stuff how the fuck are you supposed to do that as like a move controller I mean it doesn't really seem like that would be comfortable at all because I remember you can use the dual shock 3 for the kind of nunchuck portion if you will I bet there's a way you grip it sideways you can probably grip it sideways and like use your fist I understand that you could probably grip it sideways but your fingers would probably naturally your fingers would want to go over that light because you'd be holding on to the middle of it and your hand's going to want to go over that sensor in the middle I just don't think that's a good design either that or they're going to have a separate move related something and this is going to be more for just like a gestural almost like the 6 axis yeah I'm wondering if it's not I think it's going to be more like that because that technology is pretty good that they have on the move so I wonder if it isn't some way to improve 6 axis in a way maybe instead of you need to remember very important this is a prototype big word there this will change this is not what the controller is going to look like so maybe the light doesn't ultimately look like that maybe it could be grippy I'm making shit up there could be other things we don't see on it now these things can and will change they always always do so that's not the final look of that controller that'll be interesting I still don't understand what they're going to use that touchpad for the share button idea I guess that's kind of neat but once again that also kind of scares me because that gets in the whole social gameplay stuff you know where oh I'm going to share this clip on my Facebook you guys can watch me beat up this hooker well you're getting the Ouya aren't you? doesn't that have a touchpad on the front as well? so maybe you'll get a little preview and see how it works the touchpad on the front of the Ouya I believe is multi-touch and I think that's meant for playing like other Android games that would not use the controller like you could actually use that to play Angry Birds or something like that cause I'm like how do you translate on a tiny little screen what's going to happen on the that is tough yeah cause you wouldn't it's not as easy as looking at a touch screen where okay I can see where my finger is I know where I'm hitting but you know having it translate although you say that but then you know we all use touchpads so we seem to figure out a way around that going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com uh Black Wolf host of the Bobby Black Wolf Show name checks Uno in a comment to me and I'm assuming that is in response to when I'm talking about have a video camera so other people can watch I mean Uno was a huge selling game I don't know if it was because of the camera future well but I mean cause the game's years old it was a huge seller no it was five bucks five or ten yeah you got the camera the camera upgrade was free it didn't originally support the camera cause the camera wasn't out yet but then when the little vision cam came out they did a free upgrade for it let's see what else there was a comment from whatupG Sony just show what they want the PS4 controller to be and then change big time like the boomerang did boomerang is an excellent example of how things can and will change or a perfect example the zapper controller that they showed at E3 for the Wii that looked fucking amazing and then they put out a piece of plastic shit so works in reverse too it could alright let's move on with more news speaking of Nintendo they had some announcements and it's very exciting if you're a 3DS owner lots of news for you guys including game announcements they announced a brand new Mario and Luigi Dream Team kind of a new game in that franchise also that's supposed to be coming out for the 3DS I don't think it was they have a special deal now if you haven't bought a 3DS if you buy the 3DS XL and Luigi's Mansion or Pokemon Mystery Dungeon you get a free game including Super Mario 3D Land or Professor Layton's Miracle Mask and Star Fox 64 3D and some other games you probably don't want Mario Golf World T coming to the 3DS this summer so that's kind of exciting there's a new Mario game Mario and Donkey Kong game more puzzle stuff, that's going to be coming to the 3DS eShop as well as a new Dylan's Rolling Western The Last Ranger that's going to be coming out on March 11th which actually that's supposed to be kind of a pretty cool game as well The Harmony Knight The Harmony Knight and Curseploosh Curseploosh is a really weird premise Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a rock thrown down a well? No Well now you can Doomplague in chat says was Fire Emblem on that list No, but they talked a lot about Fire Emblem at the Nintendo Direct Yeah, Fire Emblem wouldn't be on that list because Fire Emblem was coming out I think that just came out Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS coming out And last but not least, the most important news June 9th, North America June 14th in Europe Animal Crossing New Leaf coming out The better question is though, what did they have for the Wii U? And not a whole lot actually The Wii U, couple announcements One, they're going to have a pretty massive piece of DLC that's going to be coming out for New Super Mario Brothers U So that'll be coming out later on Oh, I'm sorry Yeah, it's alright, you're biting some of my stories I do have other stuff on Wii U Just one little thing Honestly, I checked it out this week and it's not really that big a deal It's Wii Street U which is the Google enhanced thing It's basically Google Maps for your Wii U You know what? It's neat because it's something different you can't really get anywhere else and it is pretty smooth It's a pretty smooth experience How is Google Maps on the Vita? Because of the whole fact it's got the gyroscope and you can kind of look around I'll have to show it on the Vita? I think you just get the normal maps I don't know if it does the whole sensor Does it? Or even with phones I think you can do that Not on Google Earth on iPhone No, this operates very differently and it's all set up so that there's places already bookmarked to go take a look at and stuff The interface is interesting I mean, it's neat It's the type of thing you would see as a demo but it's not exactly going to sell any systems or make people feel like, ooh, there's all this new value in my system I like how they said free for a limited amount of time, like someone's really going to buy this one I don't know if I would have paid money for it unless it was really, really cheap So, I don't know The Super Luigi DLC looks interesting though because it sounds like they're talking about basically just redoing the whole game almost and they're going to redo all the levels and everything Yeah, that's a perfect way of putting out another new Super Mario Brothers game without actually putting out another new Super Mario Brothers game It's done with DLC You know what though? I'm okay with that because you're talking about $20 DLC versus $60 game We don't know what the price is on that Oh, I don't think they could get away with charging more I guess we'll see You should be careful what I say but I can't imagine it's going to be as much as you think it is Also, on the Wii U a new Miiverse community for Zelda I actually watched the Nintendo Direct and they did kind of make a little bit of a deal about this where they're like, it's the first Miiverse community, it's not tied to a game where you can talk about Zelda and you know it's just going to be a bunch of people with a really creative artwork and so forth which I guess it's neat but it's weird to me that this is a big deal Oh, it's a new Miiverse community that doesn't have a game behind it, what a fucking concept That's stupid, and the other thing too is we love your amazing artwork couldn't you think of an idea of hey, how about we put some places where you can showcase that artwork we'll have a new Miiverse channel for that since I'm pretty much going to guess Well, Loki, it's showcased when you turn the system on That's all built into the whole I understand that, but I'm just saying that this is basically the equivalent of a forum, how hard is it to create a sub-forum in a forum Apparently really difficult for Nintendo engineers Let's also not forget though that this forum is coming to iPhones which was a pretty big announcement of the last Nintendo Direct, so they're kind of setting the stage for that, but again I like Miiverse There's a lot about it I do like and I've talked about that before when I talked about the Wii U in general but I don't think this is like a game changer It's a logical next step Here's my worry Maybe theory or something This whole thing they're all like, oh there's a lot of news that's going to get Nintendo Wii U fans and 3DS fans This is so that you guys know there's stuff coming There wasn't really anything for the Wii U though, it was all 3DS so which makes me wonder how far away are we from an announcement that the 3DS games are going to start playing on the Wii U gamepad, because they have a ton of shit coming out for the 3DS and nothing coming out for the Wii U It makes perfect sense to say, hey 2 birds 1 stone, there you go They won't be in 3D, but no one uses the 3D feature anyways, we'll just have the top screen up on the TV bottom screen up on your gamepad, done eShop What gets me is that they did this whole thing about it's the year of Luigi and they really went all out They had a little dancing Luigi behind Reggie and every little shot of one of their talking heads had a little Luigi doll back there but I was like, okay the only Luigi stuff I really caught was Luigi's Mansion which we already knew that was a thing and that was going to be coming, and then they say Luigi's a character in the golf game and then this Luigi DLC which is cool, yes, but to brand it all as the year of Luigi I was kind of like yay You know what you need is a Waluigi vs. Luigi game Just, you know, I don't know Just say we've got Luigi content Whatever, whatever Well that makes me wonder, when is this new Super Luigi content coming out If it's the year of Luigi, it's not going to be first half of the year So you could be waiting for this crap until fourth quarter I got it, a new Mario is missing Did we say the year of Luigi? We meant the decade of Luigi I mean, I'm just The eventually Once again, I would have thought Especially after all these announcements of delays Even some delays by Nintendo Like of their first party titles That they would have said, hey, you know what I know you guys are concerned because there's some titles being delayed, here's what we have coming So that, you know, but they had nothing They had nothing to announce Oh, Doom Plague mentions in our chat room The part of the Luigi thing was also a new Mario and Luigi game Where you're inside Luigi's dream Okay, yes, I forgot about that But that still sounds like Luigi's the supporting character to me. You are inside his dream So... I don't want to be inside Luigi How are you Luigi inside Luigi? You're not It's Luigi-ception It's like Mario Innerspace So again, it's not like Okay, so it's just These were all things that existed where like Stretch people, we need a theme, people What's the theme, people? I just watched Nightmare on Elm Street Let's, you know, go inside the dream The Pikmin, they're in Luigi's backyard The Pikmin versus Garden Gnomes Lego City Stories Luigi Scene Legos Luigi likes Legos Luigi likes Legos Ah Crap Legend of Zelda Wind Waker They're both green! Yes? Yes? Green? The Legend of Luigi Alright, let's move on with more news And then we'll get to release dates Dark Sakura Jeez, well Back to the, and this is now we're getting into depressing. The Wii U has sold a few systems A few, and by a few I mean 55,000 in January And this is just US numbers Do you know how many Xbox 360's were sold? 281,000. So a system that's already been out for a few years is outselling the brand new Wii U. And is cheaper and has more games to be fair. But still, you know they, um their goal was supposed to be I think over 100,000 well, well over that really but they've completely undersold and so now, um they're, uh they had announced that if it had sold um, uh, if that it sold 3.06 million worldwide as of December but now, um, their forecast of 5.5 million has gone down to 4 million worldwide. And I bet it's gonna go down again at the end of this month. I don't see any more systems, there's no games there literally is no Wii U games coming out this month. None. I think that they're really probably looking to the handheld market to uphold their console market It gets me though that everybody is crying that it's the death of Nintendo and now Nintendo will be forced to do Mario games on the 360 Ha ha ha ha This is the, the unfortunate thing is that this is the exact same fucking thing as the 3DS. Exact same thing. The 3DS launched with a couple of good games, then literally nothing. What, we got Ping Pals was a big release on the 3DS. That was not on 3DS. Oh no, I was regular DS. I don't know It's still, with a Spongebob game. You had shit on the 3DS for a long time and then finally they dropped the price and like a couple years later the 3DS is bomb. And hopefully Nintendo can make magic work twice. I think the only danger part is that Nintendo is gonna have to work that magic twice and they may have to drop the price of the Wii U in order to do it. Well maybe then I'd get one. Yeah, I think that's awesome. But I still don't have a 3DS. You know, so Special year of Luigi green Wii U I don't wanna see a green Wii U I'm wondering what they're gonna do with the price, especially when these new consoles launch because it's gonna be tough if they're having trouble getting people to be interested in it now. When you have all that buzz of all these awesome Wii U's. Especially if, god forbid, you know that Destiny or something like that is not on the Wii U. Granted I was on the Wii U Destiny's on the Wii U Madden's not on the Wii U People are gonna be like, well why do I need a Wii U? Yeah but if Zelda's on the Wii U It's Wind Waker though! I'm not even talking about Wind Waker I'm talking about like a new Zelda or something. Yeah, new Zelda games not coming out this year. I guarantee there's no new Zelda game coming out this year other than Wind Waker HD. But that would be enough for some people though. Something else to think about though All they would have to do Wind Waker HD comes with one playable HD Zelda level. Flying off shelves You won't be able to find that shit anywhere Watch It's like everybody who bought Zone of the Enders had the Metal Gear Or the game that had the Halo 3 demo in it that actually wasn't bad and got a sequel Crackdown Alundra, didn't it have the Final Fantasy 7 demo? I know I was saying Alundra How many people bought that and all the Dragon Ball fans? Yeah that was it, it was the 8 demo. But anyway There's a lot of people who will go out Oh shoot Was it one of the games had a Xenogears demo with it too? And there's people who will just buy a game to get the demo of something that they want more Here's the thing honestly I think you're seeing a lot of 3DS news right now Is because once these 3DS games are out it is all hands on fucking deck for the Wii U Everybody at Nintendo first and second parties are going to be cranking out shit for Wii U It is Wii U's last stand and it's going to be pretty fucking amazing to watch play out I think that's why it's so 3DS heavy because I think the holiday is going to end up pretty weak because I think there's like rush projects happening They're going to crank it out for this holiday season, they have to And if we're still sitting here next January telling the same tale then I'll entertain the notion a little more that Nintendo better be cooking up a Mario game for the Playstation 4 And in the end as long as there are people who have little kids they want to play games, they're going to go for a Nintendo system Nintendo has that level of brand recognition and the association that they're working as a kid friendly, family friendly system until the kid falls over and drops the tablet and breaks it I agree, they're owning the handheld market but they may just not be a console But they weren't But they may just not be a console company anymore Too early I'm not, I don't want you to say I'm Nintendo defending and all this stuff, I'm a Nintendo fanboy and all this It is pretty shitty This is having a worse month These numbers are so bad, it is worse than any month like the 360 PlayStation 3 I wouldn't go that far has on record What were Dreamcast sales like in their first couple months? You're talking about almost 15 years ago at this point It's just a different culture now There have been people that were drawing comparisons between Sega's last days and Nintendo Which is redonkulous That whole Nei saying whatever That's like the anti-fanboy It's no better How well did GameCube do? It was third place and Nintendo did fine As long as they're making enough money to keep costs up in the company As long as they're turning a profit or at least breaking even The handhelds are going to do that for them just fine They'll make it just fine They'll be around It's not going to be like Sega Sega didn't have that handheld Sega also had some stupid marketing They also had really bad piracy That was the downfall of the Dreamcast Every friend I knew that had a Dreamcast had an entire CD spindle of burned games Every single burned game And then had their boot disk to play their imports Yep No comment Some people had Para Para on their Dreamcast Rob I don't think that system is done I just think that right now They're not doing a lot Basically the thing is they're not doing a lot to reassure people that want to buy a Wii U or thinking about buying a Wii U that they should buy a Wii U That's my thing They need to have some sort of here's what's coming out soon Yeah, working on Smash Bros. game Yeah, you know what? You could have just launched this system and not said anything and I would have assumed you're working on a Smash Bros. game Hell fuck! Just say, hey we're working on an F-Zero game That would sell a few more systems Rob would buy another system, there you go Hell yeah But I want to see the receipts You already bought a system, Rob I did buy a system, I'll buy another for F-Zero I will, I need two gamepads Two tablet controllers, yeah Such a consumer war To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, package Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for all the other consoles besides the Wii U That's true This week we've got a couple big games coming out, the first one being Crysis 3 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and PC Also Metal Gear Rising Revengeance on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 We've got a PSP title, yes, there's actually a PSP game coming out still Axis Games putting out visual novels for some reason on the PSP Hakuoki, Warriors of Shinsengumi on the PSP I want to play that And Possibly at the end of this week Although I think it's more of next week, Borderlands 2 the add-on content pack for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 You can buy the content stuff or pre-order the game Or your console isn't online You'll also be missing out on the next gen systems I'm planning on picking one of these up because it allows me to install them into multiple systems and I've got two systems that we play on Are you sure you don't just open it up and there's a code in there?

Don't you want to play Mass Effect with all Japanese garris? I don't know if they did the voiceovers again if the subtitles are... I honestly, now this makes me want to go find YouTube videos to see if the voice is nearly as hot It might be subs, it might not be dubs We don't know Well, that just looks like the US trailer Yeah, it doesn't So it's probably just subs Oh well Anyhow, let's look at other systems How about anything on the Xbox 360? Uh, price reduction on Ace Combat Assault Horizon You have that to look forward to on the 360 But the 360 in Japan, boy, you think that we use bad here Yeah, exactly And that's another thing people tend to forget is that, you know, oh well, forget it On the Vita, yes the Vita in Japan CL No Surge Ushina Ureta Hoshi Isasagushi Reincarnation Also, next rev Shoushi Shiken comes out both new games on the Vita this week Next week, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus and Phantasy Star Online 2 is next week Did you know that?

Go! Dammit! Lost! Or like camera switching Like, you know, during a football game or something Yeah, during the Grammys there's one on the stage and one on Chris Brown and Adele fighting and then there's another one on Katy Perry's breasts and you can just watch that cam the whole time, every time she applauds Yes Rewind Rewind Push A if you want to release the Kraken Amazing How about just 1 versus 100 as a network? Could that be the interactive TV? Because that would be awesome Game shows would rule But I'm not going to hold my breath because that's too good You know, right now I would just like to see whatever it is that they're going to come out with and actually have it functioning without them saying, here's what we're going to do As far as I'm aware, and I know the new season hasn't launched yet, they still don't have that fucking shit working with goddamn Game of Thrones so, you know, why am I supposed to believe that, you know, any of this stuff is going to actually work either With smart glass? Yeah And where's my goddamn interactive map on Android? How about that smart glass? Smart glass is fucking useless on Android, I can't like, do anything with it Smart glass is fucking useless on any device you It doesn't do anything Doesn't it work great on a Windows phone? No, you can set up playlists in Dance Central 3 Woohoo! Smart glass is the fucking future, everybody That's what I have the problem with these console manufacturers is coming up with stupid fucking ideas to do the same shit we've already been doing Why do I need to have a new way to swipe through menus? Why do I need a stupid touchpad to swipe through menus when I can use the analog stick, the shoulder buttons, the directional pad? I've already got three fucking ways or connect? Why do I need another way? I'm sorry You know what Microsoft is? Microsoft is the Fox TV of gaming. I don't mean Fox News I mean Fox TV because like they announce this big feature and make a pomp and circumstance of it and then they cancel it after two episodes Like seriously. They put it in the Friday death slot Like XNA? Firefly Right? Am I right? One versus a hundred? Wonder Falls Am I right? Game Room? What other Fox shows got The Cleveland show?

Why? Alright I would never Alright anyhow Let's get back into some gaming news rapid fire news time So Eain Zinga settled their lawsuits over the Ville which was ripping off social and of course we don't know any of the details of what they settled for but it's settled and that's over I was hoping for a long drawn out fist fight I wanted it to be Judge Judy solved I wanted it to go to Judge Judy Don't sit there and tell me you didn't know what you're doing Um Halo 2 on PC the multiplayer support has been extended thanks to you know begging from fans Originally it was gonna be cutting the servers off on February 15th but apparently now it's been extended to June and they're investigating further options to support the fans of the Halo 2 on PC so that's good That's good news for the dozens and dozens of people still playing Halo 2 on PC Who do you think has more? More people playing Halo 2 on PC or more people that listens to OLR? What do you think? OLR Really? I was gonna go for Halo Actually yeah I mean with all you know all kidding aside Halo 2 I mean it's the only place you can play it since you know they shut down the Xbox 360 or excuse me Xbox regular one because of 360 infrastructure that they never really followed through on Remember how it was supposed to help us get more than 100 people on our friends list? Oops Um and then finally Sniper Elite has a brand new game in their franchise and going the route of most other game franchises out there they've decided to add zombies So Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is gonna be coming out exclusively on PC they're out on Steam for $15 and that's at the end of this month on the 28th and if you're not familiar with Sniper Elite it's a World War 2 sniper game and the second Sniper Elite game you actually got to shoot the balls off of Hitler if you wanted to Hooray They even have the cool like you know Mortal Combat X-Ray mode thing where you can see the testicles explode Oh that's so lovely Thank you for that And in case you didn't get that game they actually are re-releasing the uh Sniper Elite V2 with the Kill Hitler uh you know DLC in there which it should really be teamed up with Danger 5 you know cause their mission is to kill Hitler Orange Lounge Radio is apparently the show this week where people can hear about exploding Hitler's balls I thought they only had one Anyhow Uh is that it? Please be it That's it Let's move on to something a lot less offensive It is uh Bit.Trip uh the Bit.Trip series uh Bit.Trip soundtracks for 20 bucks and when you pre-order with that 20 bucks the Bit.Trip Runner 2 future Legend of Rhythm Alien you will get 6 Bit.Trip soundtracks for free although they're not really free cause you're paying 20 bucks for it but uh pretty cool you know if you are a fan of Bit.Trip Runner so in other words if you're not Bobby I was gonna say is that like kind of how they try to sell you two pieces of crap on TV and really the whole trick is just to get you to pay twice as much for more than one that you need The trick is to get you to pre-order Bit.Trip Runner 2 and boost its numbers but the Bit.Trip soundtracks are really good like if you like the 8-bit music and the 8-bit rock and the chiptune stuff you can't go wrong with the Bit.Trip soundtracks In fact I imagine most of you have um acquired the soundtracks if you're a fan of the series but wouldn't it be nice to get them legally and you can do that here for 20 bucks pre-order uh let's see I also I guess apparently uh you can get some of the soundtracks for a dollar and then 10 dollars you get the Runner 2 soundtrack as well well look at that good times uh there is a game coming on the Wii U that apparently will be the definitive version of said game it's Need for Speed Most Wanted uh this game came out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 last year but it's coming out on the Wii this year and uh it's gonna have some new stuff in it such as the whole uh you can actually you know have the off TV mode on the gamepad but then there's something about on the gamepad you can actually help somebody that's playing on the big screen uh you can guide them you can help them or you can either hinder them they're calling it a co-driver father and son mode is something that they've called it amongst the criterion developers you can literally have a backseat fucking driver that will fuck your shit up on that gamepad that reminds me of what I do in Grand Theft Auto sometimes I'll have a thing where I can spawn cars in front of me actually on my phone I'll do that and I'll put it in first person mode and let the cab driver try to drive while I'm dropping boats in front of him and he just like dropping boats yes that's awesome on the gamepad you can turn traffic on and off you can change the environment between night and day distract cops get a map that shows you where the cops are and the speed cameras and you can just take control away of the car from the driver awesome doing it wrong I'll be taking over into the wall uh there you go so uh let me see a quote from Alexander Ward creative director quote when we sat down to think about bringing Most Wanted to Wii U we thought of this in a car game what can the second player in the room do we could have just released a vanilla version of the game put it out and say hey it's Most Wanted on the Wii U but really Nintendo's challenge there is to allow others to interact with the main player using the gamepad you know when I first heard about Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Wii U I got the impression that you were gonna have two people playing at the same time one on the gamepad one on the TV I think you can do that that sounded a lot better I think you could do that too I think there's just oh good this is another mode they should really have it just like passenger mode where you just your gamepad is like the side window you can roll it up and down and that's it and the wind blows in your face and that's all you can really do is just look out the window and roll the window up and down I wonder if there will be a dark soccer mode where a big button will pop up and you push it and it goes Dan coffee you are never gonna let me live that down little Starbucks shows up on your map you know there's people listening who probably have no idea where that came from you wanna tell the story or should I go ahead we were on a road trip to Disneyland and I was trapped in the back seat with Dan and dark soccer in the front as they were having heated discussions through the trip down but one of the things that you know would happen for hundreds and hundreds of miles is that dark soccer would be Dan coffee and every time we drove by a Starbucks which when you're on highway 99 is all the time five miles Dan coffee so Rob where's your phone finally shut up so finally finally we get to a Starbucks like we're like halfway to Disneyland we finally pull over to Starbucks and she gets her coffee and I proceed to leave my cell phone in the sandwich shop except oh it was actually in my back pocket the whole time wah wah wah wah now you know when knowing is half the battle aren't you glad she asked me to tell that story I didn't ask you to tell the story it's so people don't get it so I could delay this news the 3DS has become the best gaming machine out there is a attention grabbing headline that was run on Kotaku this week why Kotaku an attention grabbing headline that's unheard of they don't stretch the truth at all no uh yeah so how many articles did they write about hating aliens colonial marines I can't remember was it in the double digits because I think it was uh honestly I was this story was something that was shared with us in the show world thread by somebody else and I was hoping it was like an actual interview with somebody but no it actually is just a whole story written about hey the 3D remember when the 3DS was fucked and now look at all this stuff oh my god it's just basically regurgitating the same Nintendo Direct News that had already been run but now under the guise of this is why the 3DS is the best fucking game system considering that there's like you know they're talking handheld game system there's really only a couple to choose from one of them being the 3DS and one of them being the Vita no one's really gonna make the argument that the Vita is the best gaming handheld system out there I'm tapping my finger do I want to go there do I want to go behind door number 4 a system is only as good as the games that are on it no I unless it has reach around I have another rant brewing do I want to go there drama this website is such shit why does everybody keep reading it and here I am talking about it and it's gonna be more people checking it I fucking can't why do we keep bringing this fucking shitty website up all of the time and why does their attention grabbing antics work all of the time I can't anymore I do not want any stories from this website ever again on our show we are better than this done, banned I'm serious, do not link this website ever again for a news story there are better places on the internet to get your gaming news done they just grab all the stories from other people anyway just go to the site, click the link that they got and then use that one I am taking a stand here, I am not giving these fuckers hits anymore it is ridiculous Rob, yes, coffee I think I might need another cup how about some more news stories DarkSakura Sega yay, I love you Sega Sega has a line of PCs it's called the Sega Note PC laptop and they have different styles, there's the generic Sega, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn and the Dreamcast and they're anywhere between $1,000 to $2,100 and they'll come with the 64 bit version of Windows 8 a 1920 by 1080 display 4 gigs of RAM and a 500 gigabyte hard drive and a Pentium 2020M processor so yeah and it will be obsolete in 5 seconds moving on, how about some Square Square actually registered Wolfenstein and Legacy of Kain domains so maybe we're gonna see some re-releases or reboots, but there's wolfensteinspiel.com and warfornasgoth.com so who knows I hope there's a new Wolfenstein game, I hope it's done in Wolfenstein 3D fashion the 3D ones never were I love the little I love the little sound they make like with the digitized voices what I'm just American you know that actually when they did the re-releases with that one, it's actually like banned in Switzerland Tina Turner cannot play Wolfenstein now in her new home country I love that woman, I'm sure she's crushed and then last but not least you know that Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit that Axl Rose had popped up that we've been trying to ignore because Axl Rose pretty much has been well, yeah it got thrown out of fraud court so not a big deal anymore Axl sucks it's all good, he's attached to what that new Band Fuse game that's coming out and you know Band Fuse, the one that's gonna try to do the same thing that what Power Gig tried to do you remember Power Gig right? I do remember Power Gig yes, so Band Fuse the new Mastiff music game is gonna be coming out it's one of those that ties in with a real guitar type thing but I think the difference with this one was that it's real guitar and you can sing that's really it you know what, you could do that with Beatles Rock Band well that's not a real guitar though but no one cares mostly more than Band Fuse was that it? I'm sorry, I fell behind a little bit jeez Rob, I was chatting with chatters Rab! I was participating think of another one my extended hate boner was spewing into the chat room, alright your hate boner tonight's show has been brought to you by the words hate and boner in other words hate boner used in tandem be sure to make the special noise let's go to a segment that never makes us make that noise because we love to hear what our listeners have to say in the Google Question of the Week facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus community you can participate with a question we ask of our fan communities each week on the program starting off with this week's question it was announced today that the new game Destiny will require a persistent internet connection on previous episodes, OLR and Bobby have talked about other games that require an always online internet connection such as Diablo 3 and the new SimCity how do you feel about games that require an always on internet connection? and where I was kind of going with this you know, obviously listeners come to draw their own conclusions and part of the reason we do this was that we let some games slip by and it's fine it's accepted, like World of Warcraft always online internet connection new SimCity we're not so forgiving but Destiny kind of falls in that weird kind of middle part where it's like well, clearly online is a big component of it, but you're going to have to always be connected, so I was curious if our listeners kind of gave it a pass or no we only had one response on Google Plus so I'll read that, from Rentertainment the one guy still using Google Plus we need a high profile game with a wide and vocal audience to have an always on internet connection mandate that way when some part of it fails leaving people unable to play the game they paid money for, the general public will rage out about it, when the public rages out about it, assuming these companies actually give a shit about what the public wants, these companies will finally see how appropriate these companies will finally see what a mistake the always on internet connection mandate is Rentertainment, that's a fine answer, but I want to introduce you to a game called Diablo 3 this actually happened, you couldn't log in to Diablo 3 for like a week or like maybe you'd get on but then get kicked off after like an hour, and speaking of hate boner, the internet really had a big one for Diablo 3 because of the always online, because you might remember Diablo 2, you could play LAN, and you could play offline there's actually a game that's coming out a lot sooner than Destiny that's going to be similar to this SimCity I'm talking about more long lines of Destiny like an online first person shooter game that's kind of like an MMO type thing Defiance from Trion games, that's going to be coming out in April, and it's online only they are an MMO company however, this is a game it's buy to play type thing and it's on consoles on PC and PS3, Xbox 360 so this is something similar to that, obviously not as grand as I guess Destiny, but I see this actually has an online port once again, it was very vague on everything, on why it needs to be, why is it that we need this online world are there going to be stuff pushing back and forth we're going to have battles and stuff like that is it going to be this massive battle that you're going into or is it just like oh, well I need to see my friend he just cleared this spot so now the enemies are easier here I don't know, I don't really know what they're doing but it sounds like there actually is multiplayer in there versus SimCity where you just interact with your friends cities that they make Diablo 3, despite everybody raging on it and everything still sold, what, 11 million that's I don't think that's going to tell them I got the message, no more always online yeah, right, well, and if that were the case we wouldn't be seeing it now like a fucking trend, right, like Destiny SimCity, you know the game Loki just talked about and all these other things, so alright, I just got a text message from the person that linked me that story originally that I blew up at, I'll just say it's Jason he doesn't mind me saying that I'm sure, he says in their defense it was an opinion piece, not news, but lol, I was the straw that broke the camel's back this is like congratulations you are the catalyst let me just put it this way, this is this is a website, Rob chose the red ending no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not going back down this road, no, close the door lock it, done, alright moving on, alright, what do you want to I just want to say Gawker figured out animated gifs a couple months ago, and they've been running with it ever since you know the gif format has been on the internet since like the early 90s, I understand that but now they literally have posts they're like, hey look at this, these are some animated gifs I made based off of this trailer that just came out you know, I think it's funny that gif is still associated with CompuServe, so they got a Tumblr account, or started reading, oh no they didn't, because those are the things I associate with the animated gif, I get my best animated gifs ever from OhNoTheyDidn't which is a LiveJournal community and pretty much the only thing that's still going on LiveJournal that and Russian Meteorite sightings so, anyhow do they have like sightings like I just saw the Russian Meteorite down Starbucks down the street here, no, well you know LiveJournal is huge in Russia, LiveJournal is like I don't know if it's Facebook big in Russia, it got purchased by a Russian company, yeah I mean, but not that's not the reason it's big in Russia, it just it is big in Russia, I just thought it might have been a meme thing or something like that, where they, it's like no, but like a lot of the YouTubes were linked to people's Russian LiveJournals alright, cool, you know, I'm glad LiveJournal is still alive somewhere, anyhow foogle, hello always online connections and some of our answers from Facebook, which really had a lot of answers on it, so I can't read them all, so please visit our Facebook community and read them all in their entirety facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, Fabrice A says very annoying and they are punishing the wrong people, some people have a crappy internet connection or even no internet connection at all, so they can hardly play people who bought the game legally and suffer one of the previous problems can't play people who play illegally don't have any of those problems because the DRM is absent flaming toilet, god I love that name says I would think that the fiasco with PSN going down for two months a couple years ago would have taught game makers that requiring an always on internet connection is a very bad idea but they're always going to think it's never going to happen to us, how many games were unplayable or almost unplayable during that time because there was no network to connect to thank you flaming toilet for reminding us never forget playstation network fucking went down like it ate shit literal shit for two months horrible cell agent why not says we're sorry, your game is not available at this time, please hang up and try again lolz you remember that crap that actually happened with me in mass effect 3 when they were having the origin issues, yes, and I couldn't connect, but I also couldn't play my single player game because it wouldn't verify my DLC yeah Christopher K replies and says the always on idea is such that people won't exploit and mod the games this enables companies to utilize microtransactions and disable cheat codes that allow players replayability if they want to fully explore the game after completion, it's a way for publishers to siphon more than the games retail price for those who want shortcuts there are several countries that still do cap bandwidth or spotty internet coverage why shouldn't I be allowed to play a game I paid for whenever, wherever I like, I'm not too opposed to an online activation of sorts, but let me play offline when I'm traveling you know a good point that this indirectly brings up is that you know we've heard about Destiny's 10 year plan and so forth what happens after 10 years what happens when they want to pull the servers and so forth, where's that $60 investment in the game I made and you know I heard damn I wish I could remember where I heard about this but I remember hearing about one of the reasons why $60 games and people are willing to pay that $60 price is the equity that you're getting in those games the fact that you can turn around and sell those games for a value later, and when you talk about when you talk about robbing people of the ability to sell used games that there's now no equity and there's nothing worth investing $60 in but if your game, you know if you were going to turn off used games and then have it be $30 maybe that wouldn't feel like such a blow because the games overall are cheaper and this could actually be a great thing for everybody if the games are really cheap I still think $30 or $40 might be too much my point is though I can still plug in an Atari 2600 and appreciate the games I grew up on let's say for whatever reason Destiny is a game that Flacco gets his kids to start playing which I doubt but just humor me for a minute here what if they want to revisit that game in their 30s and they can't because the 10 years is up the servers are down, the plug's been pulled what now? it's sad there are games that are like that a lot of these games that were online only or something like that they're just completely useless now I don't know I can't think of anything that you would have but yeah they pull servers all the time so it's very possible I'm sure there's some MMOs, especially some of these Sony MMOs that went offline I know there's a few that we mentioned before even like Playstation 2 games and stuff like that I don't know even big MMOs go down to main say if you bought a boxed copy of The Matrix online or something like that you can never play Tabula Rasa you can never play it Star Wars Galaxies yeah that's right, you will never experience the pre-New Galaxy experience, or the post for that matter ever again in your life I gotta make sure my kids play WoW real soon he's just gonna get killed the WoW killer is coming out Flaco The WoW killer, Elder Scrolls Online it's the WoW killer, Flaco now Destiny's the WoW killer I keep seeing that in the chat all night they're both killing WoW Miss Scarlet killed WoW in the conservatory with the lead pipe hate boner back to Fugal Burr replied and said in the case of Destiny I can be justified by what they're trying to do with the gameplay, which at least makes me a little more understanding about it however, what happens in the future when they stop running the servers? get out of our head I feel like always on DRM is a decision made by focusing too much on the short term if this trend continues future gamers will be shut out of a lot of history when servers inevitably retire or entire publishers go bankrupt I swear I didn't read that before our previous rant fits right in, doesn't it? Red The Haze says not everyone has internet and the US is far from number one when it comes to internet Gary B replies and says I wanted to see if I could Facebook stalk this guy and figure out where he lived is he living in remote Canada or Alaska or something? or else I'll get behind in some sort of quest or whatever the fuck is going on it might also be something that kind of turns me off to it because I don't have the time to dedicate to an MMO or something like that Last comment I'm going to read here tonight, but do visit our Facebook to read them all jlinks says Well I could play FPS's offline in single player, I didn't make that the main reason I bought the game if the game's good and I have the methods available to play it, I'll buy it, simple as that That's our comments from Facebook and Google Plus thank you guys who all responded sorry I didn't read everybody's but it's only a three hour show Let's get to a few more news stories and pretty soon Skype calls Loki I swear to god that Sony is trolling us because there is no way that like I just can't believe that they would actually do this, but apparently there is a patent that they have and I know this is going to come as a shock to you guys, they actually have a tablet that they have patented and I'm really I need to check this out right now to see what it's called, but they're calling the iPad like E-Y-E pad, there is no way that that is called the iPad that's a European patent thing that they're showing me here, it doesn't really help me very much 17 pages let's see, 17 pages I think it looks like it's made out of particle board or something like that it's just weird, but basically it's a tablet device, looks thin looks like a directional pad, you know face buttons, possibly a speaker and one analog stick, shame on you Sony, have you not learned from the PSP one analog stick that's more than the iPad's got, well still though I like the big square sharp corner design, reminds me of the NES will I be able to install MAME on this? I don't know so they don't really say, I want to make sure that it's actually called the iPad or I had heard that name too for what it's worth, now I think that someone's making that up I don't honestly think that they would do that, oh my god no, they actually have it called the iPad it makes sense, the Playstation 9 but again, take it with a jar of salt a gallon of salt, no it's in their patent information they refer to it as the iPad like E-Y-E pad that's a patent law, that's a lawsuit right there, holy fuck balls really and honestly I think this is something that you would see from a Chinese knock off, you know, like iPad thing that they would actually have it spelled out like that so yeah, so they have this thing patented, who knows there was the iToy that's true I understand why they're using the iPad and the Playstation 9 and all that stuff it makes sense to me, however Apple's gonna go, no, fuck you you can't call it the iPad this really is a whole come at me bro move at Apple but again, huge results, you know, I don't know this seems, it seems unnecessary to have both this and the little thingy built into the controller I don't understand well, here's some of the stuff, let me just read some of the cool things that they're saying that this thing has they're saying that it's gonna have stereoscopic cameras on it, so you're gonna be able to like, I guess, record 3D or something like that, kind of like the 3DS they're saying that there's some sort of weird prism thing going on with their touchpad and stuff it's gonna have 6-axis built into it, at least that's what they're everything has a 6-axis built into it so I guess, you know, we'll have to hear more about it if this is gonna be part of the Playstation 4 is this a story coming from my favorite website, because it sure sounds like a bunch of bullshit no, it's a patent, it's actually a patent this is, I'm reading this you can understand why I'm asking though, right? no, no, no, no, I'm reading all of this yes, they did run this they did run the story as did everyone else but I'm just saying though, this is actually from the patent, I'm reading straight out of the patent description maybe patent, we don't know if it's real right? is it coming from the official patent website, or is it they have a link there or something? well they've got it, it's from it's actually linked from or it's embedded from the European patent applications nah, just because they patent it doesn't mean they'll do anything with it it's true, but it also doesn't necessarily have anything to do with games I mean, just, you know, it's not necessarily a tie-in to the Playstation 4 let's not forget, Sony makes TVs and shit so why would they not maybe want to come up with a hybrid Playstation tablet well, they're saying though, here's one of the things is therefore, in addition to the convenient joystick and button inputs, the 6-axis controller provides the PS3 with data and all that stuff, now they're talking about PS3 a little bit uh I don't know, we'll see it's just it seems a little weird, but they could do it, I guess I mean, they tried to put out some Playstation or Playstation branded tablets that all looked really weird, but who knows, we'll see maybe we'll hear more about this on Wednesday it's right around the corner yeah, I think they're just covering their bases like all these patent applications iPad, I mean, really just call it like the Playstation tablet or something like that, you know something, Sony Playstation tablet, not iPad, I mean calm down, it's the name in a patent, it's not the final just call it a thingy and be done with it that's right anyhow, one other rumor going around about new consoles that just won't die, is the fact that used games are not going to be playable on it you can bet that Electronic Arts EA is just cheering about this, after all, they're the ones that started the online pass shit, aren't they? well, anyhow, the chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen had a talk with Gamasutra and Gamasutra asked him about the whole used games and these rumors in response, quote it's one of those classic double-edged swords, in one way the used game business has been critical for the health of the retail channel and having a healthy retail channel is an important thing for us we would like to sell everything at full price would we like to sell everything at full price excuse me, and not have a used games market? sure, but I think the used game market is a little like any other kind of market where it creates liquid I hate this word liquidity the fact is that liquidity benefits us in some fashion so if someone goes in and trades a game there's a good chance they're going to buy another one of our games and so if there's a liquid market I think that's not a bad thing at all so it's sort of like a half admission that maybe used games aren't the worst thing in the world could this be a sign of things to come if EA is openly, or at least one of their executives is openly admitting that maybe it's not such a bad thing, or are they just setting this up for when the ban hammer comes down on this pretty soon, with the used games any thoughts on EA's comments? Loki? Do you have anything? I think they're already making their money on used games with the whole online passes, I mean I think they were touting before that they made a ton of money on online passes, so to them that's just money in their pockets, I guess I was actually going to say something along similar lines they've found a way to keep making a profit on it, and that is a really, you know with a lot of cases in the used market, the people who are getting rid of their used games are trying to get the new next better, we've even traded in some of our games, some of our crappy ones, to get new games, so it's, and I mean especially it's even better for EA as an example if someone trades in one of their competitor's games to get to one of theirs so I mean, that whole liquid market thing is pretty, I'd say pretty accurate. And also considering that EA is also one of these companies that puts out yearly releases of their sports games, and they probably know that people aren't going to want to hold onto their copy of Madden 13 or something like that, when Madden 25, the dumbest new, what are they thinking there? Okay we're going to go 13 to 25 and then next year it's going to be 15 and then in a few years we're going to have 25 again. If it's the 25th year I get it, it's not call it like Madden 25th anniversary not Madden 25, it's stupid, anyways that's not the point. The point is that they release games each year and that they know that people are going to need to trade these in or they're probably going to want to get rid of them because they're essentially useless after it comes out. And after all, EA shuts off their servers in a couple years anyways, so you kind of want to trade that in. He is kind of full of dicks right now. Well, here's a further comment I want to, because they were pushed a little further on the whole used games and is that something that's happening in the new consoles. Here was the rest of the quote, quote, I can't really comment on where the next generation boxes are going to be relative to used games. I will say that the trend in the business is to have that always on connectivity and connect with a customer and to the extent that the software identifies a certain customer is going to create some issues going down the road in the used game market. But I do believe that the consumer likes it and it's been good for the retail channel. Um... Um... What? I do believe the consumer likes it. Um... Didn't I just read some frugal answers that didn't seem to go that direction? They like the always on connectivity? And they've done some polls on certain websites that basically have said the same thing. In fact, actually GameStop did a poll. Was it 60%? Over 60% of, you know, people that use GameStop or whatever don't like not having used games. This worries me when that sentence comes out of a game maker's mouth. Is how out of touch are you? See, people in the boardroom think they know what we want. But clearly they don't. But by telling us in an interview this is what gamers want then the more gullible will run with it and, you know, the CNNs will say, oh well, you know, these consoles are always on because it's what the gamers want according to electronics art. Um, why don't you try talking to a gamer? Well, and see, that's the thing. They have a habit of trying to manipulate the data that they find to suit their own purposes. That's, anything can be changed. And they have to get an unbiased source if they're going to have accurate information. But all they want is for people to tell them the same things that's going to support the outcome that they look for. Uh, the legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com gives a Homer Simpson quote. Facts are meaningless. You can create facts for something that is remotely true. Interesting note to end that on. Let's move on, DarkSakura. Well, how about, uh, something else EA's managed to fuck up? I'm sorry, did I say EA fuck up? Okay, EA come close to really royally fucking up. The Mass Effect series. And yes, we warned you, there is Mass Effect news. BioWare is basically saying don't call it Mass Effect 4 because it's implying that it is a another addition to the trilogy. Um, they're saying, um, that basically the trilogy's over. This is another game in the universe. And, uh, the comparison here is, and I'll read the quote from, um, from Priestly. It says, um, if you have three games centered around a group of key soldiers in the US Army during World War I and then decided to make a game about another group of people during the Second World War, the games would have many points in common and feel true to one another. So basically it's saying, you know, it's saying it's not necessarily going to be a prequel or a sequel. It could be set within the same time frame. There could be other things going on, but it's not going to be associated with the Shepard story. So, Mass Effect 4 Moderner Warfare? I have no idea. Um, but they are, um, you know, talking about, uh, it's, uh, being in development with BioWare Montreal and that, uh, that's the same, uh, office that of course gave us this superb multiplayer. As I mentioned before, um, and Mass Effect 2, which is The Crown, it's not necessarily the popular opinion amongst my Mass Effect loving friends, but um, I'm okay with them going a completely different direction and kind of starting over, if you will, because, you know, they created such a great universe the first time that why not get introduced to new people that will be as compelling, if not more so than the first group? That's okay, I think. The only, the thing that would make me happy about this is if they don't let EA dictate to them a production timeline and actually put out a good quality product with great writing, the way that Mass Effect 2 was. That would just completely tickle me to no end. Of course I'm gonna play it, I mean. Sadly that won't happen. I know, right? That's so sad. I mean, and this is the problem is that, yeah, I'm an addict, I'll still play it. I love the universe. You know, even with the, the pieces of shit that are involved in Mass Effect 3, I still play the game on, I've probably played it more than 2, just because I like how it plays better. If it keeps using the newer incarnations of the Unreal Engine, I'll be completely happy. You know, as long as it's fun to play and I get more lore, I'm happy. The multiplayer is so good, too. It is. We should play again, but you don't play on PC anymore, and that makes me sad. I kind of do a mix and match now. Well, then come play online with me. Meh. So anyways, there's yet another rumor going along with the PlayStation 4 Orvis, whatever you call it. So that is coming from the Wall Street Journal saying that because they purchased Gaikai, they're going to be using that streaming service to stream PlayStation 3 games to the new PlayStation. Basically saying that there's not going to be really any backwards compatibility with the old system, which makes sense. I mean, it's kind of hard to do backwards compatibility. A lot of it is being offered as downloadable stuff through emulators, so that makes sense. Basically saying that this is also going to kind of coincide with also physical releases for PlayStation 4 games and that kind of stuff. I can see this as kind of an evolution of that whole PlayStation Plus game library thing, because right now you have to download and install everything, which takes fucking forever. Whereas this, you could be just like okay, I want to play, uh, Steam 302. Go. And then just load it up and stream it. And the hour-long game trials, too. Like, you have to actually download the entire game to play for an hour and then just delete it. So, once again, we'll see. I think it seems obvious we're going to see games streaming in one way or another in the PlayStation 4. I spent so much money on that. Obviously, it's going to be integrated somehow. I wonder if that's something we'll get a little news on this week, too. That seems something obvious that they could talk about. They could almost do that with the PlayStation 3. I don't necessarily think this is going to be something that is PlayStation 4. I think that they could do this, hey, you guys, you know how you have that online game library right now? Well, guess what? We're going to just have it now where you can access all that stuff instantly. It makes sense, because part of the reason why the PlayStation 3 was so expensive at first is that you basically had a PS2 inside of it as well, so it could run all the games. And then when they started cutting that out and getting the price down, you know, that disappeared. So maybe they're trying to not wow us with a $599 US dollar price launch for the PlayStation 4. Probably more like $499. But, you know, don't expect it to be that low. But this is one way they'll be able to save some money on the console and maybe not have it be so expensive is that they're going to use the streaming technology to emulate some of the older games. I hope, though, that it's just an option. That you can also, like, okay, you can stream it, or you can download it, because, once again, if their service goes to shit, then that's going to suck not being able to play your game, because you can't stream it anymore. I would assume that you'd be able to download it as well. I hope that you could do that. Shadownextgen with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. PlayStation Network is in no way good enough to do streaming gameplay like that. Even with Gaikai. Is PlayStation Network ready for that kind of bandwidth? It's a fair question. Let's put it this way, though. We've seen kind of what Gaikai can do with, like, some of the demos with, like, FIFA and stuff like that through a web browser and stuff. I think they could probably handle it. Is it going to look good, though, coming through your bandwidth? You know, like, through your internet connections, again, like, all fucking pixelated and shit? I don't know. That's... We'll just have to see, I guess. Alright. Kind of a follow-up story of sorts. You remember when we talked about Tank Tank Tank in Japan and how it's going to this free-to-play model on the Wii U? That hasn't arrived in America yet, but guess what? It's going to happen in Europe as well. Europe will be the next region to get Tank Tank Tank free-to-play. The base download will have Monster Battle, Free-for-All, and Team Versus, and you can play them up to three times. Woohoo. The first add-on is MyKong, which will cost $1.99 in Euros through February 28th. Interesting. I want to fight the bees! I hear the game's not very good, but I mean, it's a fun arcade game, but I don't know. As much as I love the game, I really don't see it as well. Unless everyone has the things. I think the free-to-play model is certainly interesting. Anybody interested in checking out Tank Tank Tank? Do you think they will roll this out to the States next? Anybody? I'd have to, I think. I think they'll eventually roll it out to the States. I'd be interested to see I guess I'm a little bit I don't know. Namco's tried doing this whole free-to-play type approach for some of their games. It didn't work out so well with the Ridge Racer on the Vita. Remember that? Actually, that wasn't even free-to-play. That was, pay $30, $40 and get nothing. Get a demo, and then buy extra crap for it. So that kind of sucked, but we'll see. $2 is not that bad for an add-on. Let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read them here on the show. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com where you can send us emails every week. We have one email this week and I'll go ahead and read it. It just came in like an hour ago. I'll go ahead and read it. No biggie. It's a gem of an email, so I want to read this through. Alright. Here we go. Hey, OLR. First off, it seems like you guys have joined the rest of the media in spending time on every next-gen rumor that comes down the pike, no matter how hilarious or ill-thought. It's been proven that the mainstream games media can be easily fooled into believing anything, as has been shown by various angry forumites and Tumblr people all over the years. And while I know that the blogs will go after anything that gets clicks, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors? That's a good question. In what way does panic-mongering help the show? It's clearly not bringing in the page hits. Clearly it's not. How rude. But you're here. That's what counts. Have you guys ever thought of vetting these rumors, trying to sift the possibly legitimate things from the blatant and senseless bullshit? Well, I am glad that you asked that question. Because that is a great... We should go vet those rumors. In fact, let me place a call to Sony right now and ask that question. I know, right? Let me just, let me get them on the line and see what they have to say about those PlayStation 4 rumors. Because you know, as you mentioned before, it isn't going any distance and getting us hits at all that, you know, sites like I don't know, the ESA, when measuring E3, doesn't even want to take a second look at independent podcasts and all that stuff. Clearly, these guys are on my speed dial, and I can vet this shit till the cows come home. I was just talking... Because I get paid to do that all day long, too. I was just talking with Miyamoto yesterday, you know? Oh yeah. Oh yeah, we were chillin'. Absolutely. We'll get some fro-yo afterwards. I got photos of my Dan and Yu Suzuki, which is actually true, I do. Let me put a little reminder out there about what this show is all about, alright? In case you forgot. Uh, this show started because we all played DDR at the arcades, and after DDR, we would go and we would go to the restaurant that was down the street, and we would sit around over, you know, food that was bad for us, like mozzarella sticks and so forth. Fried cheese. Oh god, they're so fucking good, huh? And we would talk smack about what's going on in games, and you know what happens a lot of times when people are talking smack? They're talking about the rumors and things that go around in the industry. You know, I can't think of a time when we've said this stuff on air and said, you know, this is fact, people. Believe this, people. You know, I think we like to bring these ideas up and say, this is a rumor, take it with a grain of salt, like I think we just said about that iPad thing. Or ask people what they think about it. Exactly. What's wrong with discussion? What is wrong with discussing and talking about ideas? Because some rumors do pan out to be true. So why not talk about what goes through the heads of these people that don't really want to be so ready to talk about these things? And I think that's what we try to do with the community. So if you have an opinion on these rumors besides the fact that these rumors are bullshit, well, why don't you share that opinion with us? That's what the show is set up for, where every gamer has a voice. So tell us a little bit about what you think these rumors could be good or bad for the future. Such as we just talked a little bit about destiny and the fact that it requires an always online connection. That is fact, not rumor. They said that today. But that's something that's going to impact the game industry. The whole fact about used games being banned on the new consoles. That's a rumor, yes. But I think all of us sit here and go, do you think, can you sit there and you honestly think to yourself that in no boardroom ever has it been said by a senior executive, we should lock out new games on the new console. Use games. Is that what I said? Lock out new games. Lock out the new ones. Then we have to do an even newer system and have to charge them. The online pass idea came from somewhere. Rumors are often founded in fact. I just don't think this was a very well thought out email, honestly. But the biggest thing too is that I actually like looking at the rumors and the speculation and keeping track of it so I can see what legitimately happens when something comes out to see who was right, who was on the right track. Was our technology really in the place where we had this capability? For me it's actually a gauge of how ambitious consumer level technology is. I think it's neat. Black Wolf in Chat says, I'm not a journalist. I'm a commentator. I don't actually have the resources to be a real journalist. Well, what is a real journalist anyway? Because some things that get away with being real journalism are a little bit laughable. But anyway I do like that comparison. I'm not a games journalist either, really. I actually think more than anything I'm a games analyst. I will analyze the shit out of your game. I say that with a straight face too. I'm a games analyst. A lot of you are games analysts too. You really are. Some people are just anal. We've been sitting here talking about games for 11 years and there's some other guys that go out there in every story and being interviewed with a games analyst title. But you know what? They get about as much stuff right as we do. And about as much wrong as we do. Because one of those games analysts was out there this week, a big one in fact, talking about how this is the doom and gloom, the end all be all for Nintendo. And that Nintendo is fucked. And I'm thinking like, dude, what are you smoking? It is way too fucking early to say anything about that. I don't care what degree you have under your belt. This is, this is just not like it's not, it is way too early to say something like that. A year from now, maybe. But this is Nintendo we're talking about. Come on. It's one thing to bring up rumor without having anything to substantiate it. It's completely different if you actually have items that are going to back it up. Like, okay, for example, let's say that it's a year from now and Nintendo has continued to have dismal sales and we're starting to see extreme price reductions on the Wii U and we're starting to see the 3DS game sales drop, then at that point it might be safe to speculate that Nintendo might be looking at a failure. But right now, like you said, no. It's completely different just to completely sensationalize something and try to get people to back you up by being even more sensational about it as opposed to stating well, this is what's being said. This is what we've seen. Make your own decision. There's people out there who will just read anything and believe it immediately. It's just like, you'll see commenters on news stories where they're talking about a rumor and they're like that's it, I'm not buying an Xbox. It's like, if that's true, then I'm not buying an Xbox or if that's true, that's the reason I'm not going to buy an Xbox. It's like, oh, this is absolute fact because it's coming to me from this gaming blog that I trust their information, so therefore it is I am not going to buy this console. These are the people that are fucking wishy-washy that will change their mind eight times. These are the ones that start a petition or join a group that say, oh, I'm not playing the next Call of Duty game and then you see them playing the next Call of Duty game. I mean, whatever. But yeah, I think I know for a fact that and this comes from just my line of work that I don't deal in guarantees. I know that. I'm always leaving myself a way out and there's no way that I'm saying anything is absolute fact unless I actually see it. Now, rostielut is in chat right now and says makes a note that I'm now hated. I didn't say I hated you. No one said we hated you. But when you're going to ask a question, why do you guys spend time on nonsense rumors? In what way does panic mongering help the show? I just thought I would express why we spend time on nonsense rumors. I think panic mongering might be a little bit extreme of a viewpoint. It's not like we're sitting here going AHHHHH! So under Nintendo! Oh my god! I could hear once. Run! Plus, if the site gets more hits I might lose to bog the game. That's what it's really about, isn't it? That's what I care about. Alright, let's get to the other half of the email which is a question I think is a little a little more up our alley. Secondly, Aliens Colonel Marines has been released after seven years development and the consensus seems to be that it's a hot mess. This is the type of email I like to get. It's interesting that much like Duke Nukem Forever, the game had a protracted crap ton of development houses working on it. My question here is this. At what point are there too many hands in the pot and when should a project just be cancelled? In my view anything past three years in two development houses is asking for disaster. It's all about contracts you sign. Cooks in the soup. And what you're going to be responsible for if you don't come through with the product you promised whoever paid you money to come through with. Duke Nukem Forever was cancelled at one point, was it not? Like when the company went out of business and Gearbox essentially just bought what was left over from it. Duke Nukem Forever was not going to happen. But they kind of picked up the ashes and released what they did for better or for worse. Right? It's a question with a lot of gray area because it's not like you can draw a line and say you did three years in two development houses. Well that doesn't necessarily take everything into effect because I think a game like Smash Brothers didn't the one on the Wii take more than three years to develop? I think it did. Didn't it take more like four? You know and it came out okay. The game was pretty good. It's one of the better Wii titles. You know it worked out. So you know I don't think you should cancel a game just because it's taken too damn long. How long has Bioshock Infinite been in development? Delayed by years. Or maybe how long has Last Guardian been in development? Well that's never going to come out. How about Final Fantasy Versus 13? Yeah there's a great example huh? Yeah but the Agito 13 came out at zero. So anyway I don't think there is a line you can draw but I think there does come a point where somebody has to assess it and this is what happens once in a while and this is why games get cancelled. Is that somebody walks in there every three months and says I'm here representing the people who put their money into this and is paying all your paychecks right now. Show me what you got. And if it doesn't live up to expectations done. Cancelled. Money pulled. That's what happens. That's part of the ebb and flow of it. So you know if there's enough development and things to show every few months the game keeps going but if it stops the game is done. I wonder if it's just one of those things where they just they just they crapped out what they had it sounds like they shoved it off to this other company to finish it off what they'd started and it was just kind of a mess like it just sounds like maybe it was just like mismanaged and I don't know but I haven't played the game so I feel weird kind of sitting here and giving all these opinions on a game I haven't played. I can really only go off of what you know the internet is saying about it. And the bugs of the internet are talking about are nothing compared to some of the shit you see in Skyrim Red Dead Redemption Saints Bro I mean that's that's child's play. Those games have bugs down to a fine art. Anyway have a good show guys. We're having a great show. It's great. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to help us be a great show too. Let's get to the FUs of the week. Two The self entitled wads of fuck that drive in the parking lot at Whole Foods. I don't care how expensive your damn car is or how much gas it guzzles or how organic you fucking eat. Learn to fucking drive. I know. You find assholes of all varieties and not just inside the shopping place. Another one goes to oh yeah goes to Legend and the Mass Effect 3 update that just happened because I want my console back. However I once again got fly cam working. And I think being sick because my son just drives every single illness like a like a fisherman's neck for illness. So that kind of sucks. That's what children do. That's their revenge. Discipline. I don't know. So I guess FU to that and FU to having to move my desk upstairs because for some dumb reason management thought it was a great idea to fucking flip the building upside down and so they have you know everybody from the third floor moving to the second floor and everybody from the second floor moving to the third floor and I have a lot of shit I got to move because I store all sorts of weird shit at my desk like arcade parts. So you know it's a little weird. I have an MP5 and a System 573 board for Dance Maniac Second Mix, a coin box and a Neo Geo arcade board at my desk among a bunch of figurines. I have a Gundam collection. I have anime stuff up on my shelves. And I have a what I consider life size paper craft model of a Koopa. And I have a chicken that has an Elibit riding on top of it. That's right. I have a chicken with an Elibit riding on top. Does anyone fucking remember Elibits? Hello? Konami? Let's make another Elibits game. Waco go ahead. Uh gosh I was talking about this with my wife and I was like you know what FU to the podcast app on iPod, iPhone which is pretty old but I finally updated my iPod even though I heard it was terrible and I was really mad because I couldn't scan through the show to find like every time I plug it into my car it would reset back to the start and I hated that. But before I could always just you know like kind of scan ahead to the part that I was at but I couldn't do that and I couldn't figure it out. Well my wife grabs it and two seconds later she finds out how to do it. You swipe the little logo for the show up and then there's a deal up there and you shut all of that. I feel so stupid but the podcast app is terrible. Still terrible so still FU the podcast app is terrible. Honestly use Stitcher to listen to the show. Sorry but you got to stream on Stitcher don't you? Yeah yeah I got to download because I listen in the car. Actually I think Stitcher will now let you download. I want to say that's something they added to because a lot of podcasters were complaining about that. I think they added that. I'll check that out. Yeah I listen in the car so I can't stream. Don't don't Alright my FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't have tomorrow off unlike a lot of yous. I don't either. I'm unemployed. I have tomorrow off. I'm going to sit in my pajamas all day and play Mass Effect. Bananas in pajamas. So FU to that I don't get tomorrow off. What's a President's Day? Also FU to Shane. Fucking bot Pokemon games. You can buy next the fucking Power Rangers game. No. We've had this discussion. I said that's one that's one you're not going to get. Oh my god isn't there a new Sentai series out? Shane is there a new Sentai series out because I want to watch it. Follow his Facebook. He says it's terrible. They have that new one now. It's a new movie that's coming out that's the pervert one. The guy that wears the panties over his face or something like that. What? It's like a hentai something. I don't remember what it's called now. It looks funny. Because he does this weird penis spin on some guy's face or something. He wears he wears hentai not sentai. Back away from Loki a little bit here. Oh no I think Shane was talking about the new American version is really terrible or something. Megaforce Rangers. And here we all are entertaining this fucking Power Rangers discussion. Knock it off. Hey you hush. I have like two laser discs. One of them is Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger. And the other one is like another I think Mega Ranger movie. So shut up. It is hentai common. Hentai common. Hentai common. Yes. They have a brand new super hero movie. Alright let's go to a few more topics for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game O L R or our username on Skype. Loki. So there's some Kickstarter games that are actually getting publishers which is kind of cool. One of them is this game called Take Down. It's like a tactical shooter game. They're seeing kind of like a slow paced Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or something like that. Sort of like that sort of series I guess. But it's going to be coming out by five of five games called Take Down Red Saber. And I guess the guy that developed it was Christian Allen. Oh I guess that's why it's similar to Tom Grant. He was one of the creative directors for the Ghost Recon series and also I guess SWAT and Rainbow Six. So that's kind of cool. So that's going to be coming out. It doesn't say when though but sometime in 2013. And then Wildman. Remember that was the one that was being done by Gas Powered Games kind of like as the last ditch hey we need this Kickstarter or else we're going out of business thing. Well actually they canceled their Kickstarter. So and the reason they canceled their Kickstarter is because they got purchased by Wargaming. Because I think World of Tanks. So no word if they're going to still be doing the Wildman game but at least now they have some funding. So that's good. Lots of Kickstarter news tonight. I got one here too. It's about a 90's arcade racer. Because there's just not enough Daytona USA in your life. And the like. It looks awesome. Nysalis. Is that how you say their name? Nysalis. They are doing this Kickstarter for what's called the 90's arcade racer. It has already exceeded the 10,000 pound gold that they had set. Nysalis made Cave Story. And they are going to do this new racing game for iOS, Android, and Wii U. Well I don't think it's Nysalis that's actually doing their, they picked it up. Oh that's the publisher. Yeah they picked it up. Thank you. They are the publisher. The producer is Tyrone Rodriguez is the Nysalis producer who will be producing and helping the game come to the iOS, Android, and Wii U. Which I think is interesting. Here's one that now we're not talking about 360 or Playstation. It's Wii U. PC, Mac, and Linux as well were already announced. It looks cool. Yeah. I almost backed it but I'm poor. But I'm poor. Alright. That's it. We're going to get to the Skype line. 1877 Game OLR. Or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call. We will talk about what's going on in games. Whatever you want to talk about tonight. We've had a lot of stuff tonight. I'm sure it's going to elicit some sort of reaction. So the Skype line is open now. While we wait for some calls Loki, any last minute stories you want to share? Um... Nah. I didn't really have anything I wanted to talk about other than I wanted to go into a little bit more detail with that whole iPad thing. Because they had some cool notes that I missed in there after I read through it. Apparently those cameras, the stereoscopic cameras are meant for capturing objects that you place on top of it. So basically it would capture both sides of a 3D object or they even may have more than just a couple cameras on there. And it would import the full 3D object into your game. Which is kind of cool. Of course, you know, they said 6 axis They're supposed to have some sort of LED strips on the side. I guess that part that looked like the whole what is it, a plywood thing. Let me go to the phones because we're getting calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, can you guys hear me? Hi, we can hear you. Alright. I just wanted to say Hey, what's up guys? Long time no talk to you. Who is this? Introduce yourself. It's Gamer Girl. Gamer Girl! How you doing, Gamer Girl? So I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know what to talk about. I think she's also Oh, I think you're listening to us I hear a little bit of echo. You might want to mute the radio in the background there. Well, that's no problem. You're just going through your head when you hit the dial button. Is it still echoing? Uh huh. Um, hold on a second. We'll hold. We'll wait. There's nothing we got to do. We don't got nothing better to do. We'll make up another rumor and talk about it. How's that sound? Oh, what's up Gamer Girl? What's on your mind tonight? Okay, I don't know if I'm still We hear you honey. Keep talking. Can I get a what what? Um, shoot. I don't think she can hear us. Honey, try back later because I don't think you can hear us. Sorry to say. Aw, that's always depressing. Yeah. Alright, let's go to the phones. Ooh, anyone new? Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this? Okay, I don't know if I'm still We hear you, honey. Keep talking. We're hearing ourselves. Shoot. God damn it. Alright, let's try it. Flocko's fucking Hair Doll. I knew this was going to come up. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this? Hi, you guys. It's Porkchop. How's it going? Wait, wait, wait. You can hear me? And I can hear you? Yes. Oh my god. It's a miracle. I fixed the show. Hi, guys. It's been a pretty hype-tastic week. I don't know what to believe anymore. I'm starting to lose faith. I know, and here we are. We're making all this shit up and just rumour-mongering and we just made the whole thing worse in our desperate attempt to get all the thousands of clicks that we get every week here on the show. I kind of got nostalgic as well, though. Like, the guys were talking about, you know, like, old games in chat and especially games in development hell and stuff like that. I don't know. And it was kind of sad to hear, like, you know, the likes of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and The Last Guardian. I was looking forward to those. Like, why can't these companies just, you know, wake the fuck up and realise these games will sell because they had a... Well, I know The Last Guardian will anyway. It looked amazing when I saw the trailers and stuff. So, you know, get on that. Stop bitching about fucking iPads and all this bullshit. Yeah, but what about when they don't sell? Because sometimes, you know, big time because sometimes, you know, big titles come out and they don't sell. And it makes developers nervous. I guess there was, like, you know, sometimes there is a lot of hype. Hype is just the theme for this week. Like, even, I was thinking about Metal Gear Rising and I looked at the footage and I think, OK, Platinum Games normally do these action games, kind of real justice, like Bayonetta, they did that. But this game, there's something I can't shake about it as much as I love Metal Gear Solid and writing himself his cool character. I'm just getting a weird feeling off it and I'm not sure whether or not to buy it. What's going into your decision, ultimately? What's going to help you get home weird, if anything? I don't know. It's the fact that, you know, spin-off titles aren't always great, you know. It's something that I'm a bit tentative about and I'm watching it and I'm thinking, like, even DMC, the New Devil May Cry game, I'm very scared to buy that because I really, really loved the series before that and now it's just turned on its head. The game where you're not Dante? Pardon? The game where you're not Dante? The game where you're Dante Mark 2, yeah. Yeah. I've been scared of him for so long. And yes, I will read you the phone book, no problem. It's just like another doctor, it's OK. Yeah, he just regenerated like a doctor. Of course, yeah. That's just Red Cannon in there. No point in talking about any real substantial story at all, is it? Plus, it's the really sexed-up Devil May Cry, is the other kind of thing about it, is that this version in particular... The Devil May Metro? Kinda, yeah. Devil May Metro, a little bit. I mean, that's a bad thing. Dante's now got the face of the lead developer or something. I've heard something like that. Apparently, the spitting image of the guy who developed the game, I'm like, what? It could be worse. He could have the face of, like, you know, I don't know, Gilbert Gottfried, or... Or one of the Jonas Brothers. Oh, that would be... I'm gonna make myself sick if I talk about it anymore. Hey, no, it could be a Dante de Medna version. I would know. That's like DLC. That's like, you know, guilty pleasures and stuff like that. What is ultimately going to... You know, this is... The boardroom guys wanna get in your head as a gamer. What is ultimately going to make that decision for you if you're gonna pick up Devil May Cry or not? If you just leave it alone, you know, don't... Don't twist it to think that you're... No, this is a reboot. And as far as I'm concerned, the game was fine before they went and did all this, I don't know, fucking lost city of demons turning the fucking buildings upside down. It was fine when he was the demon hunter and he had white hair initially, but now they just made him look like this fucking weirdo... I don't know what to make of him at all. Okay, I'm gonna play... Don't ruin it, that's all I can really say. I'm gonna play boardroom guy for a second here. This is how you get the female audience. You go the Bayonetta route, okay? You just have... You have his penis basically act like her hair in that game, so it's just flopping around, attacking things. And there you go. That would be frightening. It wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do, but still. I would love to actually have a main male character who's just in completely oversexed positions. Like... We'll play Devil May Cry. I know, I want the over-the-top, like, you know, a comic book cover. Done by Rob Liefeld. You're like... You want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game. I want the Hawkeye Initiative to be a video game. That's what she's talking about. That would be hilarious. You want a Hawkeye game. Jeremy Renner stars as fucking the main character, so that would be perfect. I would just play Jeremy Renner's, you know, butt the game. With, you know, Wii Move. Or Wii. You're taking... You all are taking this show to a very strange place. Alright. Uh... Anyway, Porkchop, I got to wrap up, so I can try to get another call, but any other thoughts for us tonight? Yes, thanks very much. I want to thank you personally. You put me on the Path of Exile. It's very satisfying, and I'm going to play more of it. How about that? Somebody just accused me, I think it was on Hoard House this week, saying I never shut up about that game, so... Which, I've mentioned it twice, and apparently I never shut up. Says the person who mentions Mass Effect of Pokemon all the time. I instilled fearmongering in people if they didn't go play Path of Exile. It's worth a shot. For a five gig download, this game really is worth a shot, and you heard it here, so... Like, honestly, didn't you play it, and you were like, oh my god, Diablo 3, finally. Uh, well, it was Diablo, but even so, just playing it and killing things, it was, look, it was worth it. Totally worth waiting, and the internet was crap downloading, took ages, it was worth it. Go try it out, at least, even if you're not a fan. Try it out. A ringing endorsement from overseas. There you go. Can't beat that. Well, maybe I will be downloading it tonight. Good girl. All right, that's it, Porkchop. Have a good one, buddy. Take it easy, guys. All right, bye-bye. All right, I will try this call one more time, because it's a new name, I think. Hi, you're on Orange Country. Who's this? It was crap downloading, took ages. Nope, you gotta call Echo 1-2-3. That's it. And turn off your speakers. Yeah, well, yeah, that's the problem. Use headphones. You gotta stop the show when you're calling in, so. Sorry. Uh, we'll try to see if we can get at least one more call. We have another one coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Country. Who's this? You talk about Path of Exile way too much. Oh, god, here we go. Hi, Shane. Hello. How are you? I'm good. I'm playing Pokemon. Why the hate boner, since we've been using that term a lot tonight, why the hate boner for Path of Exile? Because it's just a Diablo-style game, and those aren't fun. Have you played Path of Exile? I've played Diablo 3, and it's no longer on my computer, because it was crap. I'm telling you, there's a difference. And Torchlight 2, have you played Torchlight 2? I played the first one, the demo of it, and it was kind of boring. You're the problem, Shane. Shane. Yes. We have stuff to do. Mm-hmm. But I got to watch Kilryuger some more, because it's so funny. I need to watch it now. All right, why did you call in tonight? Did you just want to tell me to shut up about Path of Exile, or did you have something else? No, that's pretty much it. And Ni No Kuni sucks there. Hey! Another game he hasn't played that he hates. I have a Ni No Kuni. You have it. Yes, I have it. It is not fun. It is super boring. The Pok\u00e9mon aspect is cool, and the battles are fine. I actually like the battles. What else is wrong with it? But the story is terrible. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. A lot of people on this show think I am solely influenced by Shane, that I got into Mass Effect because of Shane. I got into probably... Are you playing Persona? And they're right. I haven't played Persona yet, but I will. See? See? Everybody proof. Mass Effect, and we have the Pok\u00e9mon and... Acornage. Well, yeah, but I would have found that anyway, because it was in DDR. Final Fantasy XIV, giving that a second chance, was largely in part to Shane. But I do influence Shane sometimes, and Ni No Kuni was one of them, is that I convinced him to get Ni No Kuni, right Shane? Yeah, but now he doesn't like it. He's gonna give me his copy. It was between that and Devil May Cry, and I made the wrong choice. It's like the Bizarro review, Ni No Kuni. Every reviewer is like, oh, the story's amazing, but, you know, there's some problems with the gameplay and the battle system. But Shane's like, battle system's great, but story, oh, sucks. Now this means Shane can give me his copy. Of Ni No Kuni? Yeah. Now I'm gonna eBay that and sell my little limited edition case I have with it, because it goes for like 40 bucks, just the case alone. Damn it. Did you get the book? No, I did not get a book. Oh, I want the book. No. Yeah, Ni No Kuni does suck, though. Like, the story is so boring. I don't care about any of the characters. I care about, like, my little mighty, mighty guy, and that's pretty much it. I named him Fodder, because I figured he wasn't gonna be worth anything, but he's really good. He is really good. He actually lasts a long time, but, though, if you read game facts, they all say, oh, he's horrible. He's got bad stats. Okay, so, I just want to be clear here, I just want to be clear. You do not like the story of Ni No Kuni. No. But you are current on every episode of Power Rangers ever made, correct? Um, not entirely. There's some seasons that I've kind of glossed over. I see, I see. And how's the story in Pokemon? You a big fan of the story in Pokemon? Yes. Okay, Shane, wait. I have to ask you, because I've been meaning to ask you this for ages, what is your favorite Sentai series? Sentai series? Yeah. Um, probably Gokaiger. Really? Yes, it cracks me up, but Kyoryuja might take its place. I still... Oh, and Dekaranger. Dekaranger. Dekaranger's awesome. I still say Mega Ranger was the best. I don't know. I haven't seen that one. Most of the later ones. Go watch Mega Ranger. It's awesome. Are you guys done? No, are you done? Yes. Bye, have a good time. Thanks for calling. Mm-hmm. Bye. He's like, mm-hmm. 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. You can hear more hilarious antics from Shane live Wednesday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network on Horde House, where we talk about Warcraft. And then some. 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern. Now live every week. 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. I got time for one more call. Ain't nobody got time for that. I got bronchitis. That lady's making a killing. But whatever happened to Antoine Dodson? She was on Tosh last year. Antoine Dodson moved back to Alabama. He was on Tosh, too. It's tough to make a living. I'm going to find out now. Hold on. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? That's the one and only Ronda from the East Coast. Hey, Ronda from the East Coast. How's it going? Ah, pretty good, pretty good. We kind of crashed a stream three times on our live show. Yeah, I heard. I got the memo. Good job on that. But congrats on your first live show. Thanks, and we try. Evidently, Winnamp didn't like a certain MP3 and decided to give me the middle finger. It might do that with some of the foreign name titles, just so you know. I should have warned you about that. That's worse. These are things we learn through trial and error. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, congratulations on 100 episodes nonetheless. Thank you. An anime jam session can also be heard live on VOG Network Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern every week. VOG got two new live shows. Well, they're not new shows, but two new live shows this week. It's like we kind of doubled. Not really. I guess we went from three to five. It's close. So pretty cool. So what else have you been up to besides crashing Winnamp? Just making it through school. Just chilling, just making it through school? What are you studying? Networking technology. I guess you didn't get the notice on that. I decided to go back to college. I am quite proud of your achievement. Thank you. No, I did get the memo on it, but I don't assume that the radio listeners all know the story about them. So I sometimes ask rhetorical questions, but anyway. Any cons going on lately? Weren't you at a con this weekend? No, that was Kat's a con, but we're going to be covering that this week because there was so much drama and controversy going on there. Oh my God, you've got to tell our audience. I know it's a video game show, but I saw it on Tumblr. I saw it on Facebook. I saw it on Twitter. There was drama everywhere. Give us a little bit. Give us a little bit of the drama. Give us a tease. Sure. Sure. The main issue was cosplayers and con goers, a kind of piss that a international Jewish organization took up a majority of the conventions of the convention area and places for taking photography. And there was pretty much insults going between both sides back and forth. Really? Yes, really. Jamie, as a Jewish former cosplayer, do you feel conflicted? I don't know enough about it. And honestly, I just feel like asshole photographers. You will talk later because believe you me, I have friends that are also Jewish and cosplayers. We're pissed at both sides as well, but we'll see that for another time. I just don't like when you get two groups of people together who decide to act like name calling five year olds. Then I think both people just need to shut up and let it go. Also, update on Antoine Dodson released a single in 2012 called Lovesick Lullaby. How did that sound? I just downloaded it. Oh, my God. You're the problem. Damn it, Uchon. Look at your life. Look at your choices. Antoine Dodson songs? Ain't nobody got time for that. So we're done with hiding your wife and hiding your kids? Yeah. No, it's 2013. It's a new year. Ain't nobody got time for that. The last thing that Wikipedia said was that he got arrested for having a warrant out on him for pot possession. No. Back in Huntsville. No. Huntsville. He smoked marijuana. Get out. Hide your bong. Hide your roach. Anyway, what else should I ask you about, Rama? I don't know. I just have a few things to say. All right. Quick, and I'll be on my way. The convention that you went to is called Animation on Display, and one of our podcast good friends, Kyle Hebert, was there as a guest. Neat. Yes. And the other Sentai series that's coming out, that actually premiered yesterday, is called Zuden Sentai Kuruja. It's the third Sentai series based off of dinosaurs. Fun, because what was the one? Dioranger. Dino Thunder? No, Dioranger was... Dinosaurs dress up and transform? That's pretty awesome. No, no. Kuruja was the first one. Yeah, Zooranger. That was the first one. Dioranger was the one with the tiger guy, the 10-year-old white ranger guy. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, a little too many people know is that the white ranger was actually from a completely different series. They had better outfits, just saying. They did. Yes, they did. They totally had better outfits. Well, Rama, after this call, I feel like I learned something. Two more things, I'm going to get out of here. All right. The whole Year of Luigi thing. Just so you know, we always knew that Reggie was Team Luigi. That's proof of the picture I have posted on Facebook and in the chat room of Reggie wearing my Luigi hat. That's awesome. Never wash that hat again. Just kidding. You should probably wash it once in a while. No, I take it to be dry cleaned and I keep it in a glass case. Oh, okay. All right. That works. That works. Oh, my God. I haven't seen this picture. How did I miss this? You have not seen it? No. That's hilarious. That's pretty cool. That's awesome. Oh, God, I love it. All right. When are you going to get your ass back out here? Can you put that on Tumblr or something? Because I need the podcasties to be able to see that too. I will. I will Tumblr it and I will be back on the West Coast as soon as I get some more money and I'm done with college. Okay. Because I want to come back out there again. I want to go out there and go to a club. How about we crash New York? Well, Chiara is out this way, so I don't think it'd be too hard to get you over here and me down there and Jovidea down here to do a big old party thing. You know what I'm saying? There you go. We need to do our own con and call it Fuck You Con. Only if it's a sexy party. They do have that. It's 21 plus and you're guaranteed to be drunk by the end of the three days. Awesome. Sounds like fun to me. All right, Rama, I got to let you go to wrap up the show. Fine. Okay. I'm out of here. All right. Have a good one, buddy. Another A plus phone call from Rama. Sorry to those we didn't get to, and I'm sorry to those who had their connections all screwy. Echo one, two, three in the future. There we go. That's it. Sorry to those who didn't get through, but email us. Mailbag at orangelandtrady.com or tweet us. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Oh shit, I got to do the tweets. Here I was ready to wrap up. I have a last minute story. All right, go for it. I got to pull up the Twitters. So there is a new world record for Qbert. Apparently, George Layouts, I guess, he had been playing Qbert with a friend, Ed Hemskerk. They've been playing the game for 30 years now, and they've been trying to go for this world record. Ed had actually gone for 60 hours before he had gotten tired, and this guy, George, actually went for 80 plus hours. He actually beat the world record, I guess, at about over 84 hours and 36 million points. So at least that's what the thought is right now, that he has broken the record for both the longest time playing on a single quarter and score. He likes to score all night. Here's a last minute story if I ever heard one. Shane actually sent this link to me, and believe it or not, it's like on topic and legit. Let's give him a hand for doing a good job. All right, no, this is actually super important. Sony has just announced that they are going to be doing a stream all about the PlayStation Vita. When's it happening? Today, 5 p.m. Tokyo time, and that will be 3 a.m. Eastern. So that means in about two more hours, we're going to be having a feed from Sony all about the PlayStation Vita. And it is ahead of the February 20th event, meaning, this is confirmed, the two events are about separate topics. So the February 20th event is all about something new, because they're getting the Vita stuff out of the way this week, or tonight. So, Loki, upon hearing that, you just said earlier in the show, where's the information on the Vita? Any reaction to this, hearing this? I'm going to see what they say. See, the problem is, when they make announcements in Japan, it's for Japanese games. And it's not necessarily something that's going to come over here. And here's the other funny thing you want to see. Because I work at a company that we deal with Sony on both movies and game side. And we do a lot of promotions with them. In fact, they have a new promotion, which I'm fucking pissed at right now, because I probably can't go. It's possibly to go on a red carpet premiere for This Is The End, with fucking Seth Rogen and shit like that. It'll be fun. My wife might not like that. But here's the thing. They've been... I'll fucking go. Our rep... My name's Loki. A rep in house has been asking me, she's all, okay, well, what's in the electronic device that Sony has? You know, what's hot right now with Sony and stuff? And I was like, oh yeah, well, there's the PlayStation 4, it's going to be coming out, and then there's the Vita. I may actually get another Vita. I'm not having to pay for it, of course, but... You have a rough life. Well, I... I might have to go to a movie premiere. Well, no, no. Here's the thing, though. I've got another Vita. Right now the wife has said I can't go, and I've missed out on the last two Sony trips that they did. They went to a winery one time, and then they went to Monterey. I didn't get included in either of those trips. I had to stay back and answer phones. Thanks. Good times. All right, quickly, I've got to do some quick Twitter topics here. Tigerclaw sent us a couple stories here. I'm just going to do one because I'm pressed for time here. A video of a tech demo of a Star Wars fighting game for the original Xbox that never made it. Oh, yeah. Get out. I didn't know that this was something they were doing. That's been floating for a little bit. Yeah, but there was... I thought they had a Play... There was the... On PS1 they did, right? Really? There was the Masters of Terra something. Yeah, but this one's got like Anakin versus Darth Maul. It looks like it ties into the prequels a little bit, which is probably why it didn't, you know, amount to anything. Spazinator says, by the way, in reference to the music break tonight, Killer Instinct is greater than Super Metroid. Just saying. Well, you know, Orange Lontre, who is the show where every gamer has a voice. Except you. No, no, no. He has a voice, but... He has a voice. Just what's it like to have such a wrong voice? I mean, there's no such thing as a wrong opinion, but that's really fucking close. I've never said there's no such thing as a... I've never said that there's a stupid question. That's pushing it. Since we are on the topic of, you know, Star Wars, or we were on the topic of Star Wars, and this is kind of a bit of a duh, but I have been told by somebody that would know that in Disney, and obviously this is all very, very early, but they have greenlit Star Wars figures for Disney Infinity. Probably not coming out anytime soon, but it is in the works. So don't be surprised next year if you see Star Wars figures. What would be interesting is Star Wars figures with Marvel figures with Disney figures. Oh yeah, I'm surprised nobody's asked the question about Marvel. Yeah, we almost forgot about that too. You know what? Marvel's got their own venture going on with that Marvel Heroes whatever play game, so I wouldn't see them putting in the Marvel people just yet, especially since you're not seeing anything Marvel really involved with the parks yet. Alright, and lastly from SSJ100Matt, with so much negativity stemming from video games lately, someone is opening up an arcade in Newton, Connecticut. Very interesting. Let's see, I'm trying to scan through this real quick. God, I wish I had more time to talk about this here. The Sandy Hook Arcade Center, a focus on family-friendly games, and Newtown residents will be able to play it for free. It's a non-profit operation relying on donations to keep operations going. Similar to an arcade in Massachusetts called Tokyo Game Action, which was also non-profit, but they closed. No game list available yet, but they're talking about driving games, pinball machines, air hockey, Kinect, and many more. So it's a non-profit arcade, so it's an arcade? Wah wah. Womp womp womp. Alright, that does it. We gotta wrap up. We're at midnight thirty eastern time here. We're running a little late, so we gotta go around and wrap it up. Thank you guys very much for tuning into the show and staying with us for all three hours tonight. Remember, we do this show for free. We even endure the people calling us out on our fear mongering and all that, but we do it because we love you guys and we love the community. Yes, even the nasty emailers too. I love you so much.

We really appreciate it. Tumblr, you can tumbles about us and all that good stuff. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Flaco, thank you very much for being here tonight. I hope you had fun. I did. Alright, good times. Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Just thanks for having me. I got to talk about Ni No Kuni. I'm going to use it for my pilot for my Ni No Kuni podcast, just so Bobby Blackwolf can wear out the waste of time keys on his keyboard. Are you going to call it Ni No Podcast? Ni No Podcast. Ni No Cast. I think Ni No Podcast would be a great addition to the VOG network. I'm sure Bobby would have no problem. He would love it. No problem at all. Green light, green light. I'm going to just offer you the spot right now. We'll just call it Bobby Blackwolf Night. We'll have Mass Effect Podcast and Ni No Kuni Podcast back to back. And then the Brony show. Oh yeah, the Brony show. The Brony show. Sounds great. It'll be awesome. Alright, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight? Hate boner. My final thought tonight is sunflower seeds. Loki, your final thought tonight? My final thought is, I don't know, I don't have anything. I just don't want to move upstairs. I hate moving my stuff. Get a peon to do it for you. I've been in that spot for a long time and I just don't like moving because everyone's like, well, your desk is a mess anyways. Actually, no, my desk is just spread out. It's not a mess. It's organized chaos. It's not organized at all. It's just there's stuff on there, but I have a lot of stuff. It's got to be stored somewhere. It's sure as hell not going to be at my house. Alright, that's it. Thanks a lot, guys, for tuning in and listening and staying with us all night long. Here, have a cookie. We'll see you again next week. Good night.
