1
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:19,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, February 10th, 2013, a Wii U exclusive game is pushed back to go multi-platform.

2
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:23,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Controversial rumors surround the next Xbox, and could J.J.

3
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:26,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Abrams make a Portal movie after Star Wars?

4
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:44,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio back on this February 10th for our 492nd episode.

6
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:49,899
[SPEAKER_04]: After a week off last week, I'll tell you why and give you all our sorry excuses in a minute.

7
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:57,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, say hello to the well-rested and ready to go back for another week of OLR, my co-host DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:58,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm unemployed.

9
00:00:58,783 --> 00:00:59,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're unemployed.

10
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:00,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun employed.

11
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the preferred term.

12
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:01,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

13
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:03,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very.

14
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:09,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really having a lot of fun because I had what also caused the show to.

15
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:11,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

16
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:11,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

17
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:12,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

18
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I didn't say it, my name is Rob Roberts.

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if I introduced myself or not.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,490
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're not.

21
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, I am.

22
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare you question me?

23
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:24,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there is no question that we are also joined every week by the one and only.

24
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:25,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wants to die for art?

25
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:28,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to die for art?

26
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:31,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Loki, Techmaster Loki definitely doesn't want to die for art.

27
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:32,579
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

28
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But he almost did over this weekend.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't almost die.

30
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's dying for that pizza he's eating right now.

31
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:41,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, that's the thing is my stomach hasn't stretched out again.

32
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It only takes like a day for it to go back, I guess.

33
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:49,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I even got a small and I'm only able to eat half of it right now.

34
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

35
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's portion control, right?

36
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though you want to eat the whole thing.

37
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, I've already done my part.

38
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Sickness, drop five pounds.

39
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:05,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of sickness, it's a big part of the reason why we weren't here last week.

40
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got really sick.

41
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:13,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out of work on a Friday and a Monday, and no, I was not just trying to extend my weekend.

42
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had the worst of it on Saturday and Sunday.

43
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:15,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

44
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: The head cold from hell.

45
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:18,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else to say about it.

46
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:19,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been a flu or something.

47
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So I obviously didn't want these two coming over and getting sick.

48
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I already had it.

49
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think you were sick anyway.

50
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually sick for about seven days.

51
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, I'll just come over anyway.

52
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

53
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:30,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was like, God damn it.

54
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:31,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come over.

55
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just do the show by myself.

56
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to talk about the news.

57
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a busy week in gaming.

58
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:37,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I know.

59
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

60
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:38,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks to lose this week.

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,996
[SPEAKER_04]: But let it go, Loki.

62
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,780
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

63
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a question for you.

64
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you play a football game on Xbox if it was Turians versus humans versus Corians or whatever?

65
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:15,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I sincerely doubt that's ever going to happen.

66
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:16,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would play it.

67
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:17,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

68
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:20,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to happen to a company that owns both of those franchises?

69
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:21,586
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

70
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't think it's going to happen.

71
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura presents... Turian Ball, actually.

72
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:28,729
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

73
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Turian Balls might be a whole different type of game that DarkSakura would want to present.

74
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, let's get into...

75
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:37,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That face, though.

76
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish this were a video show.

77
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:39,775
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

78
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:40,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

79
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:44,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I was picturing it, but all of my favorite fan artists have other plans.

80
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,162
[SPEAKER_04]: How many X-rated Mass Effect fan art sites have you looked up in your time, DarkSakura?

81
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:52,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically only one.

82
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:52,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

83
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a few tumblers that I follow.

84
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:56,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

85
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

86
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:04,311
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't go to their main page, then it doesn't count because they got reblogged and there's nothing you can do about it, right?

87
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:05,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, oops.

88
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:05,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

89
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,693
[SPEAKER_04]: How Is Our Gaming Weeks?

90
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:27,449
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hey, we got PlayStation Home!

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't fucking care.

93
00:04:48,681 --> 00:05:11,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's funny, because when that was all unfolding, I was at work, and I was on one of my 15-minute breaks at work, trying to furiously catch up on Twitter, and I saw what some of the other indie podcasters I follow were saying on it, and like, OMG, PlayStation 4, and I said, why are we getting all... What if this isn't like a PlayStation Vita conference, like a Nintendo Direct style, here's the upcoming Vita games, like, why are we all so... Because there's nothing coming.

94
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we all so quick to assume it's PlayStation 4?

95
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:29,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, what ended up, Forbes or Wall Street Journal or one of those more financial magazines, or excuse me, newspapers went with a rumor, which they don't typically tend to do unless they really put a lot of stock in it, that yes, it's going to be PlayStation 4.

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,362
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, I've said on Orange Launch Radio, I don't believe that Sony is under any obligation to put PlayStation 4 out this year.

97
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:47,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked, you know, we talked at the end of last year about what might be the big shocker next year and I even kind of said that PlayStation 4 might not happen this year.

98
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'm okay being wrong.

99
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.

100
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:53,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, games analysts sometimes get things wrong.

101
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that yet.

102
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:54,806
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

103
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:55,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But come on, you're right.

104
00:05:56,006 --> 00:06:00,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has, even if it's Vita, Vita, Vita, Vita and then little tiny

105
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony doesn't have to say what Sony doesn't want to say

106
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:12,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Troll Troll Troll

107
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:35,489
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that you're looking, you know, going up to this February 20th conference, it makes a lot of sense.

108
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:41,733
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to get around the typical convention cycle of release your news at E3.

109
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:55,263
[SPEAKER_04]: They purposefully are doing this ahead of Microsoft a couple weeks after one of their execs even said, we have no reason to show our cards before Microsoft, which is a very interesting sort of turnaround.

110
00:06:55,283 --> 00:07:00,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also the week before Destination PlayStation where they meet with all their retail partners and stuff like that.

111
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps, you know, this is ahead of that and Game Developers Conference is in March too, right?

112
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:17,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they might have some things to say or show about that because certainly you've got to have the third party support and get the other developers on board pretty early as another company is learning the hard way this week, but we'll get into that later.

113
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:18,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

114
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting now because Sony will be the talk of everything between February and whenever Microsoft finally announces whatever they're doing, which could be E3 at this point, although why not announce it a little earlier?

115
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be because that's not how they did the 360.

116
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:37,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

117
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:37,957
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not how they did the 360.

118
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:39,678
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

119
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:40,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

120
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:46,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have another thought about Sony keeping quiet for the sake of raising that speculation and gathering interest.

121
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:58,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if they don't mention anything more than a little teeny thing about the PS4, they're building all the suspense and getting people interested in what they're going to say.

122
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:03,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it's definitely the hype machine is in full force now and that's what 2013 is going to be.

123
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the year of the...

124
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,615
[SPEAKER_04]: As somebody called it this week, Gen 4 consoles.

125
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Sony themselves called it Gen 4 consoles in an unrelated discussion.

126
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:13,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's the Nintendo?

127
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Minus 5?

128
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:14,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

129
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, I see.

130
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,200
[SPEAKER_04]: The console generations didn't start until Sony got to the table.

131
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's in reality.

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: What, we're getting into the 9th generation, I think?

133
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:29,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the Magnavox, it was the Odyssey, the Fairchild were considered Gen 1 consoles.

134
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:31,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari was Gen 2.

135
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:45,133
[SPEAKER_08]: The Magnavox Odyssey came out in 79 and the Fairchild Channel F came out right around the same time or right before that maybe.

136
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:51,517
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there were the Texas Instruments systems came out in 81 so did the 2600?

137
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:54,947
[SPEAKER_04]: NextGenGaming.com

138
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:39,660
[SPEAKER_04]: one other thing though I think and I wanted to touch on this is I find it very interesting that Sony is kind of going to the web they're taking their case to the internet I find it a move very inspired in part by what Nintendo Direct is doing and you know Sony got a lot of shit the year they unveiled the PlayStation 3 and rightfully so that press conference was a hot mess I mean we made fun of it on this show for years and years Giant Enemy Crabs 599 US dollars Ridge Racer Africa

139
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,063
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a... No, Africa was the next year.

140
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:45,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

141
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:46,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was.

142
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:47,384
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it was.

143
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:48,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

144
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fucking mess.

145
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:52,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was an awesome mess and we loved it as gamers.

146
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But Sony doesn't want to make that same mistake twice.

147
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So why not have a nice, polished, pre-edited presentation that they deliver directly to the internets?

148
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I also think is fascinating is that...

149
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,798
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 is losing some of its relevance in that regard.

150
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:22,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not out here saying E3's dead, oh my god, and you know, E3 has its place, it's important, yes, but it's very interesting that E3 is not going to have the big reveals of either of these consoles, although certainly...

151
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:39,019
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the big game announcements and some of the specifications release dates, prices a lot of that probably won't come out till E3 don't expect you're going to know the release date and the price of this machine on February 20th not going to happen I feel very confident in saying that

152
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:44,221
[SPEAKER_04]: because Sony does kind of want to size up what their competition is doing before they're ready to announce something like that.

153
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:52,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the price of parts can fluctuate that much in the time period between February and when this thing actually gets released.

154
00:10:55,385 --> 00:11:01,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that you are looking forward to or not out of this particular event on the 20th?

155
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's only 10 days away at this point.

156
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,309
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not even really considering anything.

157
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:08,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I just... I don't know.

158
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be nice to see what they had planned for the Vita.

159
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:14,034
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned on Twitter, I got rid of mine.

160
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, someone was interested in making an offer on it before someone put it on eBay.

161
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I noticed that all came up.

162
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in the two-week break.

163
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You sold your Vita during the two-week break.

164
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:25,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

165
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:32,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there's really nothing coming out for the Vita.

166
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:37,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PlayStation 3, it's just not really... Not a whole lot of stuff that excites me about that.

167
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:38,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

168
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:40,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

169
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting to see what they have to offer, what's going to be unique.

170
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:48,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, it's going to have to be something that's kind of this big wow factor thing.

171
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what did it for the Wii.

172
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:59,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii may not have been technologically superior, but it was like, hey, look, you're going to be able to play games a completely different way than you've ever played games before.

173
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:00,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it took off.

174
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that everybody kind of has the same type of thing, it's...

175
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

176
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:40,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I just really hope that this, you know, new console, you know, I think we've heard a lot about not necessarily this console may not be so much about the technological aspect of it, but kind of the way it integrates itself, the gaming, you know, a true entertainment box and that whole, you know, social gaming becoming more prevalent and Gaikai integration, you know, how is that going to be a factor and so forth.

177
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:51,294
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I really fear, though, is that I really fear all the execs sitting in the boardroom, and we all know just about every bad decision made in gaming started in a boardroom somewhere, right?

178
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:55,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really worried that everybody's just tapping into Facebook.

179
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to have a piece of Facebook gaming.

180
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:58,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is gaming.

181
00:12:58,675 --> 00:12:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what people want.

182
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:03,736
[SPEAKER_04]: People want Facebook, and they want the mobile games and the OUYA, and that's what the people want.

183
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:07,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got to have a one-button integration that goes with Facebook and so forth, and

184
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:10,739
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to have games playable on Facebook that are on the PlayStation 3.

185
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, God, I hope not.

186
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that really feels like a step backwards to me.

187
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: If we go all like Farmville on PlayStation 3, that can be one element of it.

188
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really hope that's not the focus.

189
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:26,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they're going to do that because they've been kind of more, you know, core audience.

190
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, you know, and the same thing would have been reading all these, you know,

191
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:31,414
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

192
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:55,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

193
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's the thing is no one's forcing you at gunpoint to buy a new console for the next generation so I don't understand why anybody should feel you know like that this is your own choice just listen to what their options are and then make a decision or hey trust me if you decide not to buy a new console there's plenty of games you know seven generations worth of games that you can go play

194
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chat room, of course, we always do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

195
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:48,874
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

196
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big thank you to all those of you that have turned up live tonight.

197
00:14:52,957 --> 00:15:02,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have a lot of competition going on tonight with the silly Grammys on TV, which I think are one of the worst of all the award shows, but people still seem to want to watch it anyway, so there's that.

198
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Trenton said that they didn't believe in not making a system where you couldn't play used games on

199
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:39,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're going to get into this a little more later in the show, but I just don't think Sony or Microsoft, for that matter, is that stupid.

200
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, again, every bad decision comes from a boardroom somewhere.

201
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:47,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredibly ballsy to try something like that.

202
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good way to put it.

203
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:51,099
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a ballsy move.

204
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically saying, hey, buy, sell, trade retailers, we don't need you.

205
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:59,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they say buy, sell, trade retailers, we mean GameStop.

206
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:01,266
[SPEAKER_06]: They need GameStop.

207
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just going back to what you said, Loki.

208
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It just encourages people not to buy it, and so publishers are stuck making games for the systems they already have.

209
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta be everybody's on board or not.

210
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:14,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And even then, if everybody's on board with it, people will go elsewhere.

211
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

212
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:19,840
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, they're not the only companies making consoles.

213
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, there's going to be the Ouya, which is Android-based and stuff, and that may not be what you're looking for, but it's open.

214
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:35,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more open than these consoles are, so if they try to do something like that, which they're not, I just don't see it working out for them.

215
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:39,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in our chatroom, and the PSP didn't catch up at all.

216
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita seems like it's going the way of the PSP or worse.

217
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Vita hosed at this point?

218
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:50,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Sony... I mean, I know you just sold yours this week, so maybe I can already tell your perspective.

219
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But has Sony written the Vita off?

220
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:53,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Vita done for?

221
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they've written it off, but they sure didn't start off very well.

222
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the problem was they outsourced a lot of their big games for...

223
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

224
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:43,623
[SPEAKER_06]: and it sucks because you had the same company that made the really terrible first person shooter resistance game do that and now, you know, they had even like Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which was supposed to be alright but I don't think it was, you know, I don't know if it sold systems but...

225
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:58,307
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing was, now the next game that's supposed to be this, oh, this is really going to define the system as Killzone, which, that's cool that it's a first-person shooter in Killzone, but I'm not a big fan of the Killzone franchise.

226
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:03,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, looking at the outlook of what's coming out for the Vita, there just wasn't anything there for me.

227
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I got rid of it, because I just had nothing I wanted to play on it.

228
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,933
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened with things like Final Fantasy X Remake?

229
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:14,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's still way the hell down there.

230
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:14,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And who cares?

231
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:21,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a remake of Final Fantasy X. Well, the whole HD part, there's parts about that that are relevant to my interests.

232
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd check it out, probably.

233
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:32,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, I mean, I just... I played 10 already, so... I agree that you can't... You know, you can't support your system with nothing but remakes, Nintendo.

234
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's... It helps.

235
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not... I mean, that's nice...

236
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:40,757
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

237
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:00,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't my thing.

238
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:04,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not even really a huge fan of Smash Bros., but at least Smash Bros.

239
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,711
[SPEAKER_06]: seemed like... I don't know.

240
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of more fun.

241
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I can identify... Not really identify the characters, but, you know, the characters were a little bit more... I don't know how to really put it.

242
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:19,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like I don't really have any... I guess any attachments to any of these characters in the Sony game, I guess.

243
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:22,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, Jak and Daxter, cool.

244
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really played any of those games.

245
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Sly Cooper.

246
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:24,976
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I...

247
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:51,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care about that series there just wasn't a lot of stuff there now if they announced Grand Theft Auto and it was coming out in March that'd be a whole different story I'd probably be still keeping that system or it just if they announced hey Grand Theft Auto is coming to the Vita yeah I'd be still sticking on to that but it's just nothing that I really wanted for it was coming out and it's kind of the same problem with the 3DS because remember the 3DS was when they were talking about 3DS it was like hey Saints Row DJ Hero coming to the 3DS I was like fuck

248
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:55,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that sold the system for me.

249
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row on the go and DJ Hero, that'd be pretty awesome.

250
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And then neither one came out, so I was like, ah, fuck that.

251
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:03,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was disappointing.

252
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:08,365
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, overall, what it is is it's just I don't have time for portable gaming anymore.

253
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I don't go anywhere.

254
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:15,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need a portable system, so there's really no need for me to have this.

255
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments from chat.

256
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,314
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, Sly Cooper is awesome, and Actdeft says, Loki, you should totally play Sly Cooper for real.

257
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:23,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, cool.

258
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:25,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I can pick it up on my PS3, but I'm not.

259
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:31,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, it's just I don't need a portable system anymore is what it is.

260
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't need it because I don't.

261
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,502
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

262
00:20:59,059 --> 00:20:59,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy, actually.

263
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I played some Mass Effect 2, of course.

264
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually don't think I logged into WoW at all, which is weird.

265
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:12,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started Dragon Age 2, which I really like the game.

266
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked it when I played it before.

267
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, you know, killed my hand to play on the Xbox.

268
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:20,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm playing it on PC, and I'm having a really good time with it.

269
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:21,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

270
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,312
[SPEAKER_08]: We have had another addition to our gaming family.

271
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:46,505
[SPEAKER_08]: What else was it that I was playing?

272
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:51,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, we got another Super Nintendo that came with a box of games.

273
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And among them was Pocky and Rocky 2.

274
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Which goes for, oh, unboxed a good 90 bucks on eBay.

275
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty rare Super Nintendo game.

276
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,630
[SPEAKER_08]: We bought the whole batch for 50.

277
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you find all this?

278
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodwill.

279
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh really?

280
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:04,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

281
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

282
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:05,912
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what else I got at Goodwill?

283
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,132
[SPEAKER_08]: An earring magic pen.

284
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:07,732
In the box.

285
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:10,474
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, though.

286
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: For $10.

287
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:16,302
[SPEAKER_04]: You found such a gaming motherlode, I guess, of sorts.

288
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:23,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, since we've already got a bajillion other Super Nintendos, we're going to sell this one with a copy of Super Mario World.

289
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:26,014
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put it up on Craigslist, and I'll share the link later.

290
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's also selling his old driving rig.

291
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:31,688
[SPEAKER_04]: and I got a copy of Mega Man X out of it because you got dupes so I can't complain.

292
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:38,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've got a bunch of other dupes too but Dan and I sat all that night, that first night and played Jeopardy together.

293
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:43,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the deluxe Jeopardy and he's like, I don't know what area to pick now.

294
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:44,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I know all this other stuff.

295
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:44,917
[SPEAKER_08]: What about this?

296
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:54,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, just pick the French Revolution and then I started answering all the questions in the French Revolution because you know me, I'm a stupid history nerd and he's like, oh my God, you knew all those.

297
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:57,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, yeah, you married a smart woman.

298
00:22:57,385 --> 00:22:57,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Blastrous.

304
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've got like a bajillion Super Scope 6 copies now.

305
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And another Mario Paint, even though we have no mouse.

306
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:39,688
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the mouse pad, we have no mouse.

[SPEAKER_08]: Battle Clash?

309
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:44,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Battle Clash.

310
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:46,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle Chess?

311
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:47,016
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not Battle Chess.

312
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It was another Super Scope game that's like...

313
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you're talking about.

314
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:51,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:51,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_08]: Something tank thing.

321
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure somebody in chat will yell it out, but yeah.

322
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:03,579
[SPEAKER_08]: We also, what else came in that collection?

323
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:05,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I said Wheel of Fortune, right?

324
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:06,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

325
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:06,741
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

326
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:09,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Wheel of Fortune came with it.

327
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:13,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Killer Instinct also came with it.

328
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:14,348
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you find?

329
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:38,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Clash Battle Clash, that's it was the game I think you're thinking of there was also this is the long list of games that supported the Super Scope Battle Clash, Bazooka Blitzkrieg The Hunt for Red October had bonus games in it Lamborghini American Challenge had many games Lemmings 2 The Tribes had calibration Metal Combat, Falcon's Revenge, Operation Thunderbolt I remember that one

330
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: T2 The Arcade Game, Tin Star, X-Zone, Yoshi Safari

331
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:54,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We got something like, I want to say, 12 games or so with the system.

332
00:24:55,257 --> 00:25:00,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan and I also sat down, because he took a few days off and I'm unemployed.

333
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We cataloged all of our games that we have at our house right now, and this isn't including what we've loaned out.

334
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:29,038
[SPEAKER_08]: or what's not at the house given that would be our Atari, all of our Atari games which would be 2600, 5200, 7800 we did get Lynx though, Lynx stuff was at the house our Clicovision, Intellivision and Odyssey, Odyssey 2 collection so we cataloged 1279 individual games and we have dupes of some of them

335
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Indipendent Skews

336
00:25:45,822 --> 00:26:06,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough Even though you're not a Best Buy, but that works I forgot that we had two copies of Cyberbots But Dan and I are actually starting to think about selling off some of our dupes So we're giving friends and OLR listeners first crack So I'll let you guys know when that's happening

337
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:09,660
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very retrotastic week, it sounds like.

338
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

339
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

340
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:13,103
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been up to?

341
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,204
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been sick?

342
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:16,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what did I do?

343
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a bit of Minecraft.

344
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:23,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I built, I'm not really sure what it is, a small bridge, I guess.

345
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:24,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I played that too.

346
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:28,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, I just noticed actually our dynamic map's not working correctly.

347
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:32,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It's showing up someone else's world, which is not of my interest.

348
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:44,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then I played, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row the 3rd today because, um, I'd left some of my games at work and I wanted to play those, but, um, you know, Saints Row happened to be in my bag and...

349
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:45,103
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

350
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, that kind of sucks.

351
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't want to play that game again.

352
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:18,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe later on, but just not... I don't know.

353
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:21,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want to do all those activities again because some of those are really annoying.

354
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see, what else?

355
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I also played a little bit of Forza Horizon, just mainly working on some decals.

356
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a small bit... Well, we played some Borderlands 2 this week, and...

357
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:38,808
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:27:54,030 --> 00:28:07,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyrim, more Skyrim my modded game on PC it's getting really buggy probably because I'm not supposed to put 87 mods on it I actually removed some because I had 90 something there at one point but

359
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, lots of mods in the game.

360
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's awesome because the game is so large.

361
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:22,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I don't know, I can't remember what's part of the game and what's a mod, at least some of this stuff.

362
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:27,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously the Realm of Chuck Norris wasn't in, um, the original Skyrim, but, uh,

363
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

364
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:44,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did try the Dovah Bear mod and it got annoying because Dovah Bear, like most of the other NPCs in some games, it just kept walking in front of me and trapping me in places because it just wouldn't get out of my way.

365
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:48,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to attack things and just stand there growling and

366
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

367
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:10,567
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week.

368
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:16,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week when I was sick, I played a lot more Ni No Kuni, which I talked about on a previous episode of the show.

369
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Still enjoying it, even though I'm about to that 15-16 hour mark.

370
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:24,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I've taken a pretty big break the past few days.

371
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:31,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a lot of console games when I was sick, so I've not been wanting to do that because I haven't been sick since Monday.

372
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do still intend on finishing Ni No Kuni at some point.

373
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:36,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Path of Exile Path of Exile

374
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:08,864
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know if you guys are familiar with this game at all but Path of Exile is a free game and it is put out by Gear Grinder Games.

375
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:10,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have messed that up, sorry.

376
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:19,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the notes in front of me but it's got microtransactions in it but they are very big on saying that

377
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to do ethical microtransactions.

378
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:28,396
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to do the type of microtransactions that would hold you back in like a Zynga game, like an energy meter running out or something.

379
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:33,558
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to sell cosmetics, spell effects, pets.

380
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:41,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at their marketplace, that is the kind of stuff they're selling along with like extra character slots and extra stash things and so forth.

381
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:47,404
[SPEAKER_04]: The money factor is not holding the game back, whatever.

382
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:50,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I believe technically the game is still considered open beta right now.

383
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:54,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably will be in beta for a long time, kind of like Gmail is.

384
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:59,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But Path of Exile is a Diablo clone of sorts, for lack of a better term.

385
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:00,648
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best way I could explain it to you.

386
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:07,610
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2 or even Diablo 3, you pretty much get the gist of what Path of Exile is going to be like.

387
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:17,153
[SPEAKER_04]: and it does have the fully online integration where you can get other people to join your game while you're going and you can party up to take on mobs that will be of an increased difficulty.

388
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:19,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

389
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:31,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there are six classes in the game and everything is kind of based around the three kind of guiding stats of intelligence,

390
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:33,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Strength, Dexterity.

391
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you have one class that's very focused in each of those areas.

392
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:39,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I play a witch, which is the intelligence-focused class.

393
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's other classes that are like Strength meets Dexterity, Strength meets Intelligence, which I think is like the Templar, and so on and so on.

394
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:51,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything is very dictated by the colors that go along with those stats because you get gems that are those colors.

395
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Most items have sockets in them.

396
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,554
[SPEAKER_04]: All the abilities are driven by gems.

397
00:31:57,074 --> 00:32:05,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And where this game gets really interesting is that you get gems that modify abilities if you have them in a connected socket.

398
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:11,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for example, let's say I have a blue gem that makes fire and I do like a little fire bolt.

399
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when I beat a quest later on, I might get another gem that's called fork.

400
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I put fork and I tie it in a socket that joins with the fire spell, I will get a fireball that forks.

401
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:31,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool because it gives it this way of developing your own spells in a way.

402
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no gold in the game, which I found very interesting at first, but everything is basically barter.

403
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:46,333
[SPEAKER_04]: The scrolls of Identify and the scrolls of Town Portal become your currency, which is really interesting to me.

404
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:52,117
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you level up your characters is basically Final Fantasy X's Crystallarium.

405
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:58,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really explain it any better, but it's this gigantic map where you move through all these different talents.

406
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the level cap in the game is like 100.

407
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:05,127
[SPEAKER_04]: You can imagine this leveling chart is gigantic.

408
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:14,755
[SPEAKER_04]: and so there's so many ways that you could screw up your build because one of the tiny drawbacks is that there's very few ways to respec.

409
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:21,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can respec a little bit limited, one point or two, but if you screw up your class, you're stuck with it and you'll have to roll again or whatever.

410
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:26,965
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean did I mention this game's free?

411
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So how can I sit here and really complain about it at all?

412
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:44,376
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are really good, they're optimized very well Especially, you know, because I even have problems in games like Diablo 3 and Warcraft sometimes But the graphics are optimized very well in Path of Exile

413
00:33:44,996 --> 00:34:13,241
[SPEAKER_04]: and I guess the only maybe little drawback I would say is that I feel like the camera is always zoomed in too much and although you can zoom in a little bit to you know kind of see your character a different way for screenshots and whatever like you can't zoom out enough which can kind of be a bitch in multiplayer modes but that is one tiny ass gripe in the scope of what is really a great game that if you're a fan of Diablo or Torchlight or any of that stuff this game is free

414
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:22,523
[SPEAKER_04]: and I will be honest to God surprised if this game can pull it off and sustain itself on this model.

415
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing.

416
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:26,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of look at this and go, how can this company not be bankrupt in a year?

417
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:34,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been enjoying it enough where I almost just want to kick them 20 bucks just to say, well done, applause.

418
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:39,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just buy something stupid like more character slots or something just to support the game.

419
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually kind of want to do that.

420
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird, huh?

421
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to support a company that I think is doing a pretty awesome thing here.

422
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:50,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Path of Exile.

423
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:52,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend it.

424
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:52,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

425
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the game's still in beta and so forth, it's fun.

426
00:34:56,821 --> 00:35:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we'll only get better with time as it gets out of beta.

427
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well done.

428
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:06,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty much my gaming week.

429
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll move on to some housekeeping news.

430
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:11,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

431
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:16,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Facebook and Google+, so please find us on social media.

432
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

433
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Also want to give a shout-out to our friends at Anime Jam Session.

434
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the other shows you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

435
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: They are about to hit 100 shows this week, so congratulations to Ranma, Ari Rockefeller, the whole gang over there at Anime Jam Session.

436
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,829
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, to celebrate their 100th episode

437
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:39,969
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

438
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,458
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that does it for housekeeping.

439
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:12,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.

440
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been pretty damn busy, hasn't it, Loki?

441
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:15,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

442
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:21,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the announcements this week was that Rayman Legends has been delayed.

443
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

444
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:33,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It was originally supposed to be one of the bigger Wii U releases for people that bought the Wii U. It was one of the games that they were kind of touting, not even E3.

445
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:42,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other bit of news that goes along with that, not only has it been delayed to September, but now it's not going to be exclusive to the Wii U anymore.

446
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:45,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

447
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they want to make money.

448
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:50,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

449
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:56,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they said that the reason that they have the delay is because it's not done yet.

450
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:08,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they said, well, we could put out the Wii U version now and then do the other ones later in September.

451
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:11,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But we usually release all of our stuff simultaneously.

452
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just, you know, it's not a standard practice.

453
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,422
[SPEAKER_06]: We just do this on a case-by-case basis.

454
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, here's what it is.

455
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, folks, if you think about it.

456
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:24,466
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a game that they're going to want to market.

457
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:33,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you double your marketing spend so that the Wii U people, the very few of them that may buy this game, get advertised to?

458
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:43,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so basically, it's better just to wait, put the extra polish on the Wii U version of the game, put it out in the other consoles, make some additional content, market it all at the same time in September.

459
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,731
[SPEAKER_06]: What does suck, though, about that is...

460
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,373
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is now coming out for the Wii U?

461
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:58,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, honestly, that was going to be the only game for the Wii U in February.

462
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:00,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have two months with no Wii U games.

463
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:03,279
[SPEAKER_04]: When's Pikmin out?

464
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:03,619
[SPEAKER_04]: March?

465
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,580
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Pikmin got delayed.

466
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

467
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Not good.

468
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no first party title.

469
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:10,202
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the LEGO game, right?

470
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:19,906
[SPEAKER_06]: The LEGO game is the only first party title that they have for... I mean, that's... Yeah, it's not really Nintendo, but they're, I guess, publishing it.

471
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:25,188
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, that's going to be... There's a lot of stuff in March, but, I mean, let me put it this way.

472
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:31,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at the list of stuff coming out for the Wii U. There's maybe about eight games until the end of the year so far that have been announced.

473
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:37,116
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm including all of the like Zelda HD and all that stuff.

474
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:41,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's literally not a lot to go around right now.

475
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then to play devil's advocate.

476
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:53,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can see where the audience for this Rayman game will expand quite a bit by delaying the game and doing it on 360 and PlayStation 3.

477
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.

478
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:56,893
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, you had a captive audience of

479
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,796
[SPEAKER_04]: That is how some people are really taking this news

480
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:27,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft right now is pulling in profit hand over fist, so I don't really think that it's going to hurt them that badly.

481
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertain my point for a minute here, whether I really believe this or not.

482
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the concept that there was a captive audience in the Wii U audience, and now in September, you're going to get your game notice in September?

483
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Rayman, yes, it has its fans, and it's always going to appeal, especially as a kid-friendly type of game, where I've seen a lot of people on the internet saying, well, now it's got to go up against Grand Theft Auto.

484
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:51,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

485
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,643
[SPEAKER_04]: How short-sighted of a statement is that?

486
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

487
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,247
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are one of those people saying that, I'm smacking you upside the head.

488
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Wake up call.

489
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Do those two games really have the same audiences?

490
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Counter-advocate.

491
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:02,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

492
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:03,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

493
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:03,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Family.

494
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:04,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

495
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:08,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Where it's a decision between buying something for the kids or buying something for the grown-ups.

496
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:34,644
[SPEAKER_04]: however all that being said when you're at September you're knocking down the Christmas season's door and those games are going to be a dime a dozen those family games so why wasn't the opportunity seized to really have Nintendo fans full undivided attention a smaller audience yes a loyal audience clearly Loki any thoughts on that um

497
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:38,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I once again, I just think it just comes down to money.

498
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:42,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's because they're going to spend less money in marketing that.

499
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they could just put it out the Wii U version without any marketing.

500
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,162
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, you know, they're not going to make a whole ton of money off of that.

501
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:55,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, they've already kind of marketed it with demos and stuff like that.

502
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:59,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, you have to consider what the install base of the Wii U is.

503
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:00,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not very large.

504
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:05,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many what percentage of those people are going to buy Rayman Legends?

505
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:26,299
[SPEAKER_06]: being that's the only game in two months maybe quite a few of them but it's still not a big chunk I mean if you could guarantee all of them would buy it and maybe that might be worth it but it's just it's not gonna happen they know third-party attachment rates on this these things are not not good

506
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:34,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to share a point, and I will credit this to Bobby because it's something he said on his show, so please support Mr. Bobby Blackwolf.

507
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:38,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf Show, 5 o'clock here at VOG, 8 o'clock Eastern.

508
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:51,914
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about how Nintendo gets this rap all the time where it's all about the first-party games, and Nintendo does great for first-party and their stuff, but they don't do enough for third-party games.

509
00:41:52,094 --> 00:42:07,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So here they go, they put out their system and the reason why they have this big blank slate is that they wanted the third parties to be able to carry this, is that they didn't want to flood the market with their own stuff because they wanted the third parties to have a chance to shine, to have a chance to sell their games.

510
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:12,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be fair, Zombie U has done very well in that category, also an Ubisoft game.

511
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:19,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the system's launch was Mario and Nintendo Land and there's not going to be anything else till Christmas.

512
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:21,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So third parties, here you go.

513
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:22,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your chance to shine.

514
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:28,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of taking that chance, Ubisoft has literally shit on them.

515
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: like literally taking a dump all over that offering from Nintendo I mean whether it's a good business decision or not that's pretty much what happened because Nintendo did put a lot of stock and investment in this whole you know we got Rayman Legends coming da da da we got an exclusive demo da da da only to get the literally shit on by Ubisoft with this

516
00:42:53,228 --> 00:43:01,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, can we really complain about how Nintendo doesn't support third parties when this is how the third parties respond?

517
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:15,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, I'm sorry, but to play, I guess, devil's advocate there, I don't really think that the whole blank space right here is to allow for third parties.

518
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:24,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's that Nintendo's development is fucked up, and that's because they had stuff for first quarter that they were going to put out first-party titles, and they're just not fucking done yet.

519
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a matter of them, oh, we're being gracious to these third parties.

520
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:29,659
[SPEAKER_06]: They have nothing coming up.

521
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,280
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably, like...

522
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

523
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:50,416
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still PlayStation 2 games coming out last year.

524
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:55,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a couple, but that's still many years after the system's done.

525
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Versus the Wii U comes out, nothing this year.

526
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,564
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like three games for the Wii coming out.

527
00:44:03,564 --> 00:44:04,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

528
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:05,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just nothing.

529
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Just drop down to nothing.

530
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing for your new system either.

531
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like they said, fuck you guys, we're just going to go to the other platforms.

532
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Devil's Advocate a lot.

533
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:19,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my honest opinion.

534
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:20,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I really think.

535
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:22,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I've shared all this other stuff, here's what I really think.

536
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:27,017
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ubisoft decision from a purely business and nothing else perspective, it does make sense.

537
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:33,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as disappointing as that is, as a Wii U owner, honestly, I probably wasn't going to buy the game anyway.

538
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:35,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Rayman was not the system seller for me anyway.

539
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:42,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo is in a situation exactly like the 3DS situation.

540
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:45,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really ridiculous that they're in that situation yet again.

541
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,093
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the only way out of it... I mean, the 3DS is in a great place now.

542
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo is essentially going to have to repeat history.

543
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,016
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to eat shit.

544
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to cut the price of the Wii U. That's the only thing now.

545
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to get another one of those E3s this year where Reggie comes out on stage and says...

546
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:01,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking want games?

547
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:02,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Bam.

548
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:03,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game.

549
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:03,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game.

550
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game.

551
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:05,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game.

552
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

553
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.

554
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be their E3 this year.

555
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be just like the year that this all went down with 3DS.

556
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be that.

557
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:18,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a year from now, we're all going to sit here going, how did we ever doubt Nintendo and the Wii U?

558
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:21,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Will the Wii U be the force to be reckoned with the Wii was?

559
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:22,919
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

560
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:29,244
[SPEAKER_04]: But if these... I mean, who's to say these other consoles...

561
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,117
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

562
00:45:47,553 --> 00:46:15,494
[SPEAKER_04]: and things they might do and missteps they might make of their own that could really piss people off in convincing them to spend $500 on these new consoles and if that happens and you're the soccer mom come Christmas time do you want to buy one of these $500 consoles that doesn't play used games or do you want to buy this other console that has the Nintendo name on it that has Mario's face on it that just had its price slashed by 50 bucks to play games that albeit are not that much better technologically than the ones that are out now

563
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it, that could happen all over again.

564
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,222
[SPEAKER_04]: History could very well repeat itself.

565
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we're all sitting here laughing at Nintendo right now, don't count them out.

566
00:46:30,348 --> 00:46:34,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It is way too early, and Nintendo is far too stubborn to let it go.

567
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:39,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have the special superpower of lucky bitch powers.

568
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:54,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Because seriously, I mean, have you not noticed that just when things seem, you know, about to be down for Nintendo, they pull something out of their ass or something turns around or just one little thing will work in their favor and it all turns around.

569
00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:54,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

570
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:56,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

571
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:57,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucky bitch powers.

572
00:46:59,861 --> 00:47:01,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, though.

573
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,822
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot can happen between now and E3.

574
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:04,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very interesting year.

575
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait.

576
00:47:06,563 --> 00:47:07,923
[SPEAKER_04]: A note for our live listeners.

577
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:12,304
[SPEAKER_04]: We are aware that the show is cutting out a little bit here and there, and a lot of you are having to reload.

578
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:13,725
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry about it.

579
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: The same problem was affecting Bobby's show tonight, so we actually think it does not originate with us.

580
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we had some lousy...

581
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame God Blame God

582
00:47:42,441 --> 00:47:46,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really the problem is our choice to go with Blizzard cooling for our server.

583
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:48,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, right?

584
00:47:49,204 --> 00:47:52,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Should have gone with water or air.

585
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:53,286
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Blizzard!

586
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:53,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better.

587
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:56,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get all that Rayman stuff out?

588
00:47:56,947 --> 00:47:58,808
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have an exclusive demo.

589
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:02,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, good luck Nintendo, man.

590
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: They know how to show appreciation.

591
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:10,113
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have you guys put out another... Ubisoft's going to put out another demo.

592
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:13,615
[SPEAKER_06]: and other exclusive ream and legends demo.

593
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:14,255
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point.

594
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:22,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel and UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the third parties aren't going to go back to Nintendo.

595
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:23,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gonna happen.

596
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a bold as fuck statement.

597
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:27,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

598
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:32,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's some other stuff that we may talk about later on that...

599
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why don't I throw this out there as far as third parties go.

600
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:48,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision, interesting little development during their earnings call where Bobby Kotick was asked about Skylanders and so forth, how the console sales with that all goes.

601
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:57,064
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, quote, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U. We're concerned about the install base for 6 to 11 year olds.

602
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, this caused all the blogs to run with...

603
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:17,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision is concerned about Nintendo because he did use that you know we're concerned okay we'll see I don't think I wouldn't worry about this too long term but it does show Nintendo really has to show a clear future on how that console is going to print money very soon

604
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:23,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's one for you, since I see it's not in our show rule.

605
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: EA.

606
00:49:25,592 --> 00:49:29,414
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no EA sports games for the Wii or Wii U this year, so far.

607
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:30,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I noticed that.

608
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's up through August, through Madden.

609
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:36,357
[SPEAKER_06]: No Tiger, no... And this even goes with 2K.

610
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:37,437
[SPEAKER_06]: No MLB game.

611
00:49:37,897 --> 00:49:40,038
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no NCAA and no Madden.

612
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:40,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's...

613
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:42,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

614
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:53,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

615
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:53,934
[SPEAKER_06]: FIFA.

616
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:55,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see FIFA being on there.

617
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, no Wii U titles, sports-wise.

618
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:01,036
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows?

619
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll continue with other franchises of theirs.

620
00:50:04,397 --> 00:50:20,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not forget, though, despite the fact we say all the third parties are abandoning ship, which I think it's a little early to say that for sure, remember one place where Wii U and Nintendo themselves have really endeared themselves, and don't count out what this base can do for your console, is indies.

621
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,821
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3, Xbox 360 Heavy

622
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe people have all started realizing that it's the same game every year.

623
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:53,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, they haven't figured that out yet.

624
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Still the number one selling sports game.

625
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:59,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma in our chatroom suggests Tecmo Bowl for Wii U, please.

626
00:51:00,697 --> 00:51:02,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be an interesting time for somebody.

627
00:51:02,098 --> 00:51:04,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they try that for the Wii and how well did that sell?

628
00:51:04,258 --> 00:51:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

629
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,679
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be an interesting time for somebody else to come in and do their knockoff game.

630
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it couldn't be NBA or NFL officially, but...

631
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:16,790
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to know there's no football game that's as good as super high impact end of story

632
00:51:20,492 --> 00:51:22,693
[SPEAKER_04]: High Impact Wii U. No Super Garrus Ball.

633
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:23,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything is possible.

634
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Super Garrus Ball.

635
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys.

636
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:27,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man Soccer.

637
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:29,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even I think the joke is getting old.

638
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:31,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is funny.

639
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:35,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually, that's when we were cataloging our games, I completely forgot that we had Mega Man Soccer.

640
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:46,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you noticed on Twitter, someone was saying that they, oh, was it like a Mass Effect spoof of, was it a Gangnam Style or something like that?

641
00:51:46,505 --> 00:51:46,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

642
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:51,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what was that wallpaper that everyone's been, their phone wallpaper now?

643
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:54,019
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it wasn't that.

644
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I was replying to someone's tweet, and it was about something that had to do with Mass Effect.

645
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I'm surprised there hasn't been a... You guys should do a Mass Effect... Oh, it was like, you guys should do a Mass Effect parody song to Gangnam Style or something like that.

646
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:14,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm sure someone's already done that to Mass Effect.

647
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:18,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, they had a Mass Effect Gangnam Style.

648
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:20,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was like Garrus Style or something like that.

649
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:27,477
[SPEAKER_08]: There is this wallpaper for phone circulating that's Garrus and Kaden.

650
00:52:27,497 --> 00:52:29,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's Garrus style.

651
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:30,979
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a still.

652
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of spent on Gangnam Style after the pistachio commercial.

653
00:52:39,544 --> 00:52:41,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, were you watching a football game on TV?

654
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you were.

655
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:43,306
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't have seen that.

656
00:52:44,146 --> 00:52:45,227
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

657
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:46,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Objection!

658
00:52:47,188 --> 00:52:47,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Hulu.

659
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:47,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Hulu.

660
00:52:48,254 --> 00:52:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fine.

661
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:52,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

662
00:52:52,156 --> 00:52:52,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl, don't even.

663
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:54,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I will.

664
00:52:55,897 --> 00:53:03,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a developer called Ack Studios, A-C-K-K, which makes me think of Bill the Cat now.

665
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,901
[SPEAKER_08]: They've put out an announcement.

666
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:10,442
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on a 3D RPG that is inspired by Earthbound and The World Ends With You.

667
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:12,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be on the Wii U eShop.

668
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:14,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's codename is Project Y2K.

669
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:16,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't they like 13 years too late for that name?

670
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:31,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a teaser up for it and basically they're saying that basically right now it's concept art, finalized script and storyline, and graphics and gameplay engine.

671
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:35,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot this story was on our show roll tonight.

672
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:36,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I just say?

673
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,822
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I just say about indies and the Wii U?

674
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:43,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It could make for a very interesting marriage.

675
00:53:43,456 --> 00:53:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

676
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:47,678
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo finally actually puts its stock in this.

677
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:51,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it more like Wii U leaving one mistress for another?

678
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it would be quite the change for Nintendo.

679
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:59,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, three years ago, fans had to start a letter-writing campaign.

680
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:12,616
[SPEAKER_04]: to get games like Xenoblade, which should have been an obvious put that out here in the States, please, and Last Story, which has done well for XSEED, and now Pandora's Tower.

681
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:19,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Nintendo finally could be doing this turnaround where they're like, maybe gamers here want this shit.

682
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:20,583
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a niche for us.

683
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:22,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're changing their polygamy for a harem.

684
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:24,567
[SPEAKER_04]: However you want to phrase it.

685
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to think of a good analogy.

686
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:28,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear him.

687
00:54:29,984 --> 00:54:30,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't want to hear him?

688
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Except you'd have to pay for all of this.

689
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:33,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

690
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:37,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

691
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:38,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on then, I guess.

692
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:39,967
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

693
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:40,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

694
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:42,048
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked crap about Sony.

695
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:43,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked crap about Nintendo.

696
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:44,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are we leaving out, Loki?

697
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about Microsoft.

698
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: As we get close to E3, and I'm sure it's just not going to quit until they make their final announcements...

699
00:54:55,346 --> 00:54:59,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about random Xbox next generation rumors.

700
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:05,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting off, the next Xbox will always be online and will use Blu-ray.

701
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:18,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, kind of a big duh with the Blu-ray because, you know, either it's going to be Blu-ray of their own proprietary format, obviously something that's going to be... But Microsoft can't use Blu-ray, Loki.

702
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:21,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Sony product.

703
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:22,673
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense.

704
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking crazy.

705
00:55:26,372 --> 00:55:27,333
[SPEAKER_06]: They can totally do it.

706
00:55:27,413 --> 00:55:34,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised actually they don't use HD DVD because that's technology that they have access to and no one's using it for anything.

707
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:46,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony was also one part of Blu-ray and I also want to remind everybody Microsoft kind of sucked some dick to get Final Fantasy XI on its console early on which had this whole Play Online front end.

708
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:47,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Who owns Play Online?

709
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:50,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dropping the mic now.

710
00:55:51,894 --> 00:56:04,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so yeah, there's rumors going around that it's supposed to be always online, which I guess is supposed to somehow tie in with maybe, I don't know, the way used games work?

711
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:13,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some way to, I guess, cut into the second-hand game market by authenticating your games or something?

712
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:13,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know.

713
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:19,553
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no real specifics on that, on why that's even an important fact on there.

714
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:42,357
[SPEAKER_06]: the other one is of course that there's going to have some sort of they say natural speech detection and speech attacks which I know they've been trying to do that kind of crap with the Kinect and I always think it's very like useless I mean just like oh I plug in the Kinect and Kinect I want you to do this you know or Kinect yeah but you have functional hands

715
00:56:43,653 --> 00:56:55,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I'm saying that they're trying to improve on this front right here, and to play devil's advocate, that's really only benefiting a small percentage of their market base.

716
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:56,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about as far as...

717
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:05,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know how much further they're going to go with this, how this is going to play into the next-gen console.

718
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:14,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is actually... Even though this is all rumors and we should take it with a grain of salt, I believe this part, the text-to-speech part, is absolutely true.

719
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the proof is in something that's actually going on in the 360 right now.

720
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:26,018
[SPEAKER_04]: There's in the Kinect channel, or whatever it is, you go into the Kinect thing, there's an app you can download that is nothing but...

721
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,780
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

722
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to collect different accents and the way people talk through this channel.

723
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,805
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to collect all this information, which is really weird when you consider, well, they've already implemented a lot of this.

724
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're gearing for something else.

725
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:05,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the proof is there that this is happening.

726
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to get it more user-friendly instead of saying, like, Xbox, play DVD, or play...

727
00:58:13,497 --> 00:58:19,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Search, X-Files, Play, where can I find the X-Files?

728
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Or where can I watch X-Files?

729
00:58:21,601 --> 00:58:22,601
[SPEAKER_08]: You should talk like GLaDOS.

730
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I would believe that they're going to show a video or something of the new Xbox where somebody walks in as they're getting home from work.

731
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging up their jacket or whatever and somebody's walking in going, Xbox, play last night's episode of The Walking Dead.

732
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:45,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Xbox will just magically turn on and maybe it powers on your TV too or something, I don't know, through an infrared communication.

733
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there it goes.

734
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts playing The Walking Dead.

735
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:50,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're going to – that will be like a thing.

736
00:58:51,033 --> 00:59:05,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I hope that we get another one of those stupid demonstrations where they're saying in front of the Kinect, like, oh, I'm virtually trying on outfits, or, oh, I'm going to scan in my skateboard logo or whatever so it can appear on my object in-game.

737
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, all that shit that they promised us for the Kinect and never fucking came through with?

738
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:20,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, you know, getting a vague color for my car, which, by the way, with that fucked up camera was always like a whitish-pinkish color, no matter what the lighting in the room.

739
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:22,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's much better.

740
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:32,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, the whole internet connection thing was, of course, supposed to be that whole, oh, it's not going to play used games because it's going to be always connected to the internet and it's going to be tied in.

741
00:59:32,086 --> 00:59:33,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're saying, like, you...

742
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:37,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a one-time code you use and that's it.

743
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:39,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And then your disk is useless, I guess.

744
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:42,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make any sense.

745
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:43,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to happen.

746
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:52,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, once again, like I said, you're not being forced to buy a new console and they're not going to cut out... I mean, seriously, if they cut out GameStop, who's going to sell their console?

747
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:56,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I understand there's other retailers out there that sell consoles, but...

748
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:59,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They all want to sell used games too.

749
00:59:59,374 --> 01:00:02,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But those GameStops aren't going out of business because those guys aren't selling consoles.

750
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,261
[SPEAKER_06]: All they're saying is, hey, you know what?

751
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: You should buy a PS4 instead.

752
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:07,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

753
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:08,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it plays better games.

754
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and because you can sell your games back.

755
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

756
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:35,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was talking about a lot of things that really didn't happen until more recently.

757
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:44,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that it's not necessarily that it is going to do all this, that they want it to do all this, and it will eventually do all that.

758
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:46,736
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't expect instant gratification.

759
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:49,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're going to have all this.

760
01:00:49,257 --> 01:00:50,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's going to happen right away.

761
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:51,539
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

762
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:57,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to keep in mind what happens in reality and keep on top of the technology.

763
01:00:58,928 --> 01:01:02,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And so help me keep Peter Molyneux out of E3.

764
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on for a minute and just do a what if.

765
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:21,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think this, but I think it's worth going down an avenue exploring here for a little bit because like you say, Loki, if the Xbox doesn't play used games and the PlayStation 4 does, then Microsoft might as well seal its own fate right now because they won't be sold in GameStop.

766
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:27,142
[SPEAKER_04]: But what if, tinfoil hat, what if Sony and Microsoft are in cahoots

767
01:01:27,722 --> 01:01:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard about the rumors about the trademark or whatever that the Sony discs would be tied to the console.

768
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:36,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had this rumor about Sony already.

769
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:50,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Sony and Microsoft have had secret meetings and it's not unheard of that competitors will have meetings about mutually beneficial topics because maybe EA brought them both to the table or somebody else, okay?

770
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:54,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if they have both decided that used games will not be playable on the consoles?

771
01:01:55,322 --> 01:01:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what happens?

772
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:56,722
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

773
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:20,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

774
01:02:20,752 --> 01:02:26,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say you're on a tight budget and you need to trade in those old games to make up the money to buy the new games.

775
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:30,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you can't do that anymore because that option's gone.

776
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:31,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to do?

777
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to train yourself to now wait six months for them to drop the price of the game.

778
01:02:37,406 --> 01:02:37,806
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

779
01:02:59,437 --> 01:03:04,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in my whole little tinfoil hat scenario, I agree now with Ross UT in our chatroom.

780
01:03:04,818 --> 01:03:06,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo would be the only winner in that pact.

781
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely go back to what I said at the beginning of the show where Nintendo can dig themselves out of this hole if Sony and Microsoft fuck themselves, and this would be one way to do it.

782
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm going to take the tinfoil hat off, put it on the table.

783
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:20,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I really think.

784
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:28,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't necessarily think these rumors are false, just like I don't think the rumors about the PlayStation 4 disk protection or whatever is false.

785
01:03:29,086 --> 01:03:32,607
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Microsoft's had a real problem with dev kits.

786
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:34,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And where do most of these rumors start?

787
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,229
[SPEAKER_04]: They start from disgruntled devs and so forth.

788
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:39,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you not buy a dev kit on eBay?

789
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Not eBay, but yeah.

790
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

791
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the thing.

792
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:46,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Microsoft really wants you to have one of those.

793
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:50,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to me like a lot of that shit's been floating out there randomly where anybody could get it.

794
01:03:51,076 --> 01:04:01,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thought is maybe the dev kits always require you to be online and the dev kits will always be reading or talking to Microsoft or what have you.

795
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:15,308
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that these games don't leak early because what Microsoft's really trying to combat is not the used game market but day zero piracy because that is what hurts the most is the piracy that gets out there before the game even goes on sale.

796
01:04:15,328 --> 01:04:19,811
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean like Halo 4 being leaked four weeks early, two weeks early?

797
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, ding, ding, absolutely, Loki.

798
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That is absolutely it.

799
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:30,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would even say it would be realistic to see that perhaps a game goes on sale digitally

800
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple days before it goes on sale in tangible form, not much to GameStop chagrin and so forth.

801
01:04:37,078 --> 01:04:42,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a direction I could see where they go down the line again, and it is all about combating piracy.

802
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That I would see and would understand if that's what they're doing.

803
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And to require an online-only console, it's just not going to happen anyways because not everyone has internet.

804
01:04:54,443 --> 01:04:59,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even now, our internet, especially high-speed internet, not everyone has high-speed internet.

805
01:05:00,824 --> 01:05:02,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Or has reliable high-speed internet.

806
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:05,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a lot of things that could go wrong.

807
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: 27% of Xboxes never online, according to an Ars Technica article that cited a 2010 study.

808
01:05:13,273 --> 01:05:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, in three years a lot can happen, but it's got to be above 10%, which is a number that can't be ignored.

809
01:05:21,081 --> 01:05:28,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, I mean, and let's just say, now I understand that some of those may have gone online at some point, but does it mean that they're always online?

810
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:37,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know, like, sometimes my Xbox doesn't have an internet connection, depending on where I'm using it and stuff, and that would kind of suck that, oh, I can't play a game on this because...

811
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:40,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of some reason, I don't know.

812
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:52,776
[SPEAKER_06]: If they really want to combat piracy or something, what they could do, if you're going to do a one-time code thing, is have it like a PC game, like I have my Grand Theft Auto games and stuff, where I can revoke that code at some point.

813
01:05:52,836 --> 01:05:56,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Say I want to trade it in or whatever, and I revoke that code, and then...

814
01:05:56,681 --> 01:06:01,103
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, okay, you don't have that code, you can't really play this game on the system.

815
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:03,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be one way to do it.

816
01:06:04,144 --> 01:06:09,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So then they'd be trying to hose the rental market, because the rental market wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of that one.

817
01:06:09,486 --> 01:06:12,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they don't really care about the rental market.

818
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

819
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:15,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

820
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we will see in the coming months.

821
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it all sucks, if all the consoles suck, there's always Steam.

822
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:24,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And Steam's going to have those same games that are on consoles.

823
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:29,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously not the Microsoft first party or Sony first party, but you're going to have a lot of those multi-platform games.

824
01:06:30,114 --> 01:06:38,237
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, don't expect Sony or Microsoft to be very forthcoming about this in their press conferences or whatever Sony's doing on February 20th.

825
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:47,552
[SPEAKER_04]: These questions will have to be asked point blank and they will be asked by journalists at E3 and that is where the answer will be found is when those interviews come out.

826
01:06:47,993 --> 01:06:48,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall see.

827
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, error.

828
01:06:58,563 --> 01:07:02,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's talk about somebody else that's in some trouble right now, Zynga.

829
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, it's just been bad news after bad news after bad news.

830
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we've had a lot of financial reports lately.

831
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:31,474
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently another one came out here Zynga did pretty bad in 2012 they posted a 209.4 million dollar loss that's not as bad as 2011 when it was a 404.3 million dollar loss but keep in mind they've closed some places since then they've had to make some cutbacks

832
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:40,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're going to be shutting down other games or what, or what the future holds, but they're still losing money.

833
01:07:41,143 --> 01:07:42,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the Facebook thing is over.

834
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe not over, but it's not the huge thing that people once thought it was, which again, I would caution Sony and Microsoft in their whole trying to capture that market and so forth.

835
01:07:56,637 --> 01:07:57,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at what's happening to Zynga.

836
01:07:58,378 --> 01:07:59,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a fad.

837
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't marry Facebook.

838
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only going to get ugly.

839
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't play catch-up.

840
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to come up with something new.

841
01:08:11,636 --> 01:08:14,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Why marry Facebook when you can make your own Facebook?

842
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have a hard time believing Microsoft doesn't want to make their own maybe not necessarily like you know the exact same thing that Facebook does but what if they could take some of the parts of Facebook and kind of make Xbox Live a new version of that I don't know

843
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see where they maybe want to make their own thing as opposed to just trying to marry something that's already out there.

844
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, it didn't work so well for Apple, so I don't know.

845
01:08:43,842 --> 01:08:46,446
[SPEAKER_06]: We here at Microsoft are now going to partner with the new MySpace.

846
01:08:48,898 --> 01:08:55,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the new Myspace, as funny as that joke is to make, the new Myspace is really about music and not so much games or anything else.

847
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really about music and artistry because that's kind of what Myspace turned into when everybody left it.

848
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:03,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all artists trying to promote themselves.

849
01:09:03,193 --> 01:09:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like they were all each other's friends.

850
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:07,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Myspace now is trying to compete with Pitchfork.

851
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:09,035
[SPEAKER_04]: and Pinterest.

852
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:11,576
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like a Pinterest of music is what it is.

853
01:09:11,836 --> 01:09:13,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pin fork.

854
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:21,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to get invited to the thing as in preview or whatever and it looked nice but there was nothing there for me.

855
01:09:21,942 --> 01:09:27,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I was honestly only there to see how I could pimp Orange Lounge Radio and you know the podcast stuff I do like you know what's in it for me.

856
01:09:28,607 --> 01:09:29,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't find it.

857
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:33,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So not really on it.

858
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:35,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow let's move on.

859
01:09:36,812 --> 01:09:37,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Saga.

860
01:09:38,283 --> 01:09:40,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we know of That Game Company, right?

861
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Flower, Journey.

862
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is just a little interesting.

863
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:51,565
[SPEAKER_08]: More put it in here, yeah, just for the interest side of it and to help people keep things in perspective.

864
01:09:52,265 --> 01:09:55,787
[SPEAKER_08]: When Journey shipped, they were bankrupt.

865
01:09:56,707 --> 01:09:58,529
[SPEAKER_08]: They could not pay their employees.

866
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:05,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They really just went ahead and shipped out the game with a prayer that they wouldn't lose more.

867
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:11,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And as it turned out, that's put them back up in the top and kept them alive.

868
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:25,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just, you know, you think of all these companies that are pretty much, we've been saying sinking ship, sinking ship, but really all it takes is that one shining, you know, gemstone out there that's gonna, you know, bring them back.

869
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:28,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Just thought this would be a good one for perspective.

870
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know what's going to happen.

871
01:10:58,578 --> 01:10:59,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know what's going to happen.

872
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:01,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't make shit and you'll be okay.

873
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

874
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:09,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the last story a little bit, Technist wants to clarify, Microsoft already has a deal with Facebook.

875
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you see Bing Maps and Bing Translate on Facebook.

876
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:19,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the limit of exclusivity it would be to that.

877
01:11:19,393 --> 01:11:21,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a hard word to pronounce, isn't it?

878
01:11:21,835 --> 01:11:22,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Exclusiveness.

879
01:11:22,816 --> 01:11:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Exclusiveness.

880
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:24,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Exclusity?

881
01:11:25,737 --> 01:11:29,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That still doesn't stop Microsoft necessarily doing their own thing.

882
01:11:29,338 --> 01:11:30,599
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Facebook get out of it?

883
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the Skype integration thing?

884
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:37,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was something they were really hyping up for their Messenger and chat was their Skype.

885
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:38,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess you're right.

886
01:11:38,822 --> 01:11:41,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft and Facebook already have some ties.

887
01:11:41,503 --> 01:11:49,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't do their own thing, or could Sony, although based on history, I don't think Sony would pull it off very well.

888
01:11:49,486 --> 01:11:50,026
[SPEAKER_04]: But you never know.

889
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:50,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be surprised.

890
01:11:50,966 --> 01:11:54,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony might have bought a company that fell off my radar that could do it.

891
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:55,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So who knows?

892
01:11:57,068 --> 01:11:59,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I am also just totally like...

893
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass hypothesizing, making shit up.

894
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:06,470
[SPEAKER_04]: But who wouldn't want to get like a Facebook for gamers?

895
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:13,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would seem like... And I think there are some startups out there kind of trying to capitalize on that a bit.

896
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:15,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But nobody's really struck gold with that idea yet.

897
01:12:15,352 --> 01:12:19,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't believe that the publishers themselves aren't trying to do that a little bit.

898
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:19,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Miiverse.

899
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:22,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of moving that direction a little bit.

900
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:24,674
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as Nintendo can.

901
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:26,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

902
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:52,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was just like a fad.

903
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just trying.

904
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:55,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people buy it.

905
01:12:55,951 --> 01:13:01,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on 3DS this week.

906
01:13:01,174 --> 01:13:04,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Omerta, City of Gangsters on Xbox 360.

907
01:13:07,297 --> 01:13:08,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say that I think that's it.

908
01:13:09,438 --> 01:13:11,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there wasn't that much coming out this week.

909
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:29,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess technically within the week, next Sunday they're going to be having the Zombie U Nintendo Wii U 32GB Deluxe set.

910
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a Zombie U and a digital copy of Nintendo Land.

911
01:13:33,887 --> 01:13:36,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not going to have much of that hard drive left over.

912
01:13:38,228 --> 01:13:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how Ubisoft waited for that to go to the factory before they fucked Nintendo.

913
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:41,989
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

914
01:13:44,102 --> 01:13:44,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

915
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hey, let's make this deal.

916
01:13:46,363 --> 01:13:47,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, let's make this deal.

917
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:50,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and fuck you, huh?

918
01:13:50,846 --> 01:13:52,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's business.

919
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:53,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That is business.

920
01:13:54,728 --> 01:13:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Japan, checking out the Japanese releases.

921
01:13:56,989 --> 01:14:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: On Valentine's Day, which happens to be release day in Japan, PlayStation 3, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, price drops for Dragon's Dogma and Lollipop Chainsaw because Lollipop Chainsaw is getting the Valentine's edition on February 14th.

922
01:14:10,556 --> 01:14:12,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though this is a steaming, festering pile of poo?

923
01:14:12,927 --> 01:14:14,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, even though it's a steaming fest.

924
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an opinion.

925
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff on the Xbox 360.

926
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:19,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought I said that?

927
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, most of this is price reductions.

928
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:31,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Lollipop Chainsaw, Kinect Star Wars, Gears of War 3, Disneyland Adventures, Forza 4, Dragon's Dogma, Dance Central 2, all of those getting price reductions this week in Japan.

929
01:14:32,894 --> 01:14:42,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as new stuff goes, Aliens, Colonel Marines, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, and Ginga Force come out this week in Japan.

930
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:43,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all new things.

931
01:14:43,919 --> 01:14:44,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

932
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,181
[SPEAKER_08]: About that Aliens, Colonial Marines, I actually want that game.

933
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

934
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:49,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Why's that?

935
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:52,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, and God, why can I never remember his damn name?

936
01:14:52,844 --> 01:14:55,305
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who played Bishop is reprising his role.

937
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:56,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

938
01:14:56,346 --> 01:14:57,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know who else he voiced?

939
01:14:58,347 --> 01:14:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Admiral Hackett.

940
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

941
01:15:00,681 --> 01:15:01,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you.

942
01:15:01,701 --> 01:15:02,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you.

943
01:15:02,662 --> 01:15:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation Vita in Japan this week gets Sakura So No Pet Na Kanojo in regular and limited editions, and Silent Hill Book of Memories gets its Japanese release.

944
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:12,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Pets?

945
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:13,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in time.

946
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than Girls Butts.

947
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:20,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in time for Valentine's Day Silent Hill game on the Vita.

948
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:27,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nothing on the Wii U, but Tank Tank Tank is out in the near future, although I thought that was going free-to-play or something was happening.

949
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

950
01:15:28,978 --> 01:15:30,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on my list for some reason for next week.

951
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:38,182
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like a demo or something that's coming out that you can unlock parts of the demo or something if you pay money.

952
01:15:38,262 --> 01:15:38,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

953
01:15:38,602 --> 01:15:40,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

954
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:49,887
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 3DS this week, Marugo 3D Nanami to Ishiho Nagakubo English Josatsu no Kotsu Riron Hen.

955
01:15:50,468 --> 01:15:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that?

956
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

957
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:56,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a cute anime girl though because you know that's everything.

958
01:15:58,251 --> 01:15:58,571
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

959
01:15:58,611 --> 01:15:59,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one screenshot I have.

960
01:16:00,232 --> 01:16:01,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That could just be the box art.

961
01:16:01,372 --> 01:16:02,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The game probably has nothing to do with that.

962
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:07,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what that is, but it's not any big series.

963
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly checking to see if they're still putting stuff out on the PSP.

964
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:11,835
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.

965
01:16:11,995 --> 01:16:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP getting some releases this week.

966
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:17,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Robot Tamashi from Bandai Namco this week on the PSP.

967
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:21,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, how about the other side of the Atlantic?

968
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:24,747
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as I can make my iPad go there.

969
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:30,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have on the 12th, we have Aliens Colonial Marines.

970
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And to answer your earlier question about the game, courtesy of Tigerclaw, Lance Henriksen.

971
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:37,452
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

972
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:41,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was some sort of Icelandic sounding name.

973
01:16:43,774 --> 01:16:44,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Was he a Stargate guy?

974
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:46,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I associate him with Stargate?

975
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:47,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't he in Atlantis?

976
01:16:48,835 --> 01:16:50,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I associate him with Stargate for some reason.

977
01:16:50,276 --> 01:16:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped watching Stargate after season 8, so... There's been a fuck ton of Stargate, too.

978
01:16:55,599 --> 01:16:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't been following... Just the SG-1 series.

979
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't been following Stargate since the original movie that the guy who made Independence Day did all those years ago, there's been a fuck ton of Stargate that's been happening.

980
01:17:06,504 --> 01:17:07,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know.

981
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what... But no MMO, frown.

982
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:12,128
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

983
01:17:12,548 --> 01:17:17,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Becky and I used to marathon SG-1 because I have all those box sets I'm probably going to sell.

984
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And we both decided that season 4 sucks.

985
01:17:21,156 --> 01:17:22,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an ex that was really into Stargate.

986
01:17:22,698 --> 01:17:23,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good show.

987
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:24,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to hate it.

988
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:25,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Season 7 was good.

989
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:29,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, a few more news stories for you guys then we'll get into the classic game of the week.

990
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:30,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

991
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

992
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:38,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so let's talk about the independent console that's coming out, OUYA!

993
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:50,892
[SPEAKER_06]: OUYA is going to be making its way out for Kickstarter backers in March, but if you didn't get in on that action, then you can actually pick one up at retail.

994
01:17:50,972 --> 01:17:56,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and the store that's into everything electronics nowadays.

995
01:17:57,094 --> 01:18:03,018
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop, you can buy one for $99 there or an extra controller for $49.99.

996
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:04,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

997
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:14,366
[SPEAKER_04]: If the new Xbox doesn't play used games, there will be more Ouya merchandise at GameStop than there will be Xbox Lube or 720 or whatever they call it.

998
01:18:16,888 --> 01:18:19,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're going to really have to grease you up to get you to buy one of those.

999
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:30,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to go with that, of course, they're saying that, yeah, you may buy an Ouya this year, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be an Ouya 2 next year or an Ouya 3 the year after that.

1000
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,056
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they're planning on doing a new one each year.

1001
01:18:33,596 --> 01:18:35,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, they've partnered up with Double Fine and...

1002
01:18:58,347 --> 01:18:58,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see here.

1003
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:03,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Bettner, who is the creator of Words With Friends.

1004
01:19:03,789 --> 01:19:06,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be bringing The Cave and Reds to OUYA.

1005
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:08,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1006
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:10,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are pretty big games.

1007
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:11,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard of Reds.

1008
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:14,653
[SPEAKER_06]: But The Cave, I'm well aware of, because that just came out.

1009
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:15,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

1010
01:19:18,123 --> 01:19:28,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Last but not least, this month, of course, to go along with the whole Kickstarter backers getting their consoles next month, they are going through the approval process right now.

1011
01:19:28,885 --> 01:19:30,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a little disappointed.

1012
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:33,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, two-thirds of this I'm okay with.

1013
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically looking at games being submitted to them, and they're checking for intellectual property infringement, malware, and excessive pornography.

1014
01:19:43,428 --> 01:19:45,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that they added excessive in there.

1015
01:19:45,809 --> 01:19:47,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little, a little titty's okay.

1016
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,410
[SPEAKER_06]: A little pornography is alright.

1017
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:53,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So note to OUYA developers, a little titty's okay.

1018
01:19:53,932 --> 01:19:55,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think there should be excessive pornography.

1019
01:19:56,053 --> 01:19:59,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, that should be the title of a game, Excessive Pornography, the game.

1020
01:20:00,554 --> 01:20:01,414
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

1021
01:20:02,775 --> 01:20:06,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, dare I say, is that an OLR dream game, Excessive Pornography?

1022
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Excessive Pornography, that's the internet, okay.

1023
01:20:09,077 --> 01:20:09,918
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the internet.

1024
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:11,300
[SPEAKER_04]: That's everybody's dream game.

1025
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not an OLR dream game.

1026
01:20:13,402 --> 01:20:14,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the internet's dream game.

1027
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:21,109
[SPEAKER_04]: The excessive pornography featuring random pictures of low cats for no reason.

1028
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the internet right there.

1029
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so they're supposed to be doing that.

1030
01:20:28,076 --> 01:20:31,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said the process should begin middle or the end of this month.

1031
01:20:31,299 --> 01:20:31,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course...

1032
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:34,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1033
01:20:34,727 --> 01:20:35,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1034
01:20:35,368 --> 01:20:40,772
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I know I have one game spoken for when that comes out.

1035
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:47,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chat, some strong opinions about the whole yearly upgrades of the Ouya.

1036
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:54,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma in chat says, a new Ouya each year is suicide, to which a lot of people jumped in and said iPhone, iPad.

1037
01:20:54,985 --> 01:20:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I even said the Nintendo DS called and said you're wrong.

1038
01:20:58,768 --> 01:20:59,589
[SPEAKER_04]: New Ouya every year.

1039
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:01,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that suicide to admit that this early?

1040
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:03,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, because here's the thing.

1041
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:10,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, you may be buying this console right now and you're like, oh, they're going to have a new one next year.

1042
01:21:11,002 --> 01:21:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything about this console is meant to be hacked.

1043
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:14,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1044
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:16,568
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1045
01:21:32,816 --> 01:21:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: each time around.

1046
01:21:33,617 --> 01:21:38,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really have a problem with that if that's going to be the way they're going to go about it because it's optional.

1047
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, you can hack this thing apart and play emulators on it.

1048
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell do you need a quad core processor for that shit?

1049
01:21:45,783 --> 01:21:46,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't.

1050
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:49,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Comment from RossDLUT in our chat room.

1051
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: The OUYA is an open platform.

1052
01:21:51,885 --> 01:21:53,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see excessive porn on it anyway.

1053
01:21:54,427 --> 01:21:54,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

1054
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:57,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It has access to the internet.

1055
01:21:57,728 --> 01:21:58,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it have a web browser?

1056
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it connected to the internet?

1057
01:22:01,897 --> 01:22:03,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Excessive porn for all!

1058
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:03,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1059
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:12,562
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one thing we can look forward to with an always connected Xbox system, is it's always going to have access to pornography on the internet.

1060
01:22:12,902 --> 01:22:13,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox!

1061
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:14,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Tits!

1062
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:17,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine?

1063
01:22:18,285 --> 01:22:19,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine?

1064
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:21,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows me Britney Spears' greatest hits.

1065
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:23,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what I said!

1066
01:22:24,284 --> 01:22:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Xbox, pornography, Illumina Room, just like boobs flying at you at every angle.

1067
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:32,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, this is next gen.

1068
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:40,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seriously, okay, if Microsoft could come out at E3 and show that as the demo and then just slip in there, by the way, it won't play used games, but it will totally show you tits.

1069
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:42,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Then people will be like, forgiven.

1070
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: You're forgiven.

1071
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:45,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything negative we said about the used games thing.

1072
01:22:45,758 --> 01:22:47,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to play used games, but it can do this.

1073
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, whoa.

1074
01:22:55,264 --> 01:22:56,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.

1075
01:23:00,246 --> 01:23:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, would you buy one?

1076
01:23:01,527 --> 01:23:07,509
[SPEAKER_04]: If Illumaroom would not play used games, would it show you all the boobies you could dream of?

1077
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:10,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking about it.

1078
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:13,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Katy Perry, can you get up in your face and be knocking that back and forth?

1079
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:17,533
[SPEAKER_04]: That picture of Katy Perry, all over your walls, everywhere.

1080
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:20,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, that's pretty hard to say no to, Rob.

1081
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:24,822
[SPEAKER_06]: and Sigma the Luma Room because it's all going to be interactive too.

1082
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:26,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You can walk up into that and just like smack.

1083
01:23:29,186 --> 01:23:31,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put your face all up in it.

1084
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:35,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Achievement unlocked.

1085
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:37,294
[SPEAKER_08]: No one can resist to motorboat.

1086
01:23:40,196 --> 01:23:41,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Cobra Triangle 2.

1087
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:42,196
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1088
01:23:44,097 --> 01:23:45,377
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys.

1089
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:50,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when gaming was so simple, a retro gaming story for you guys.

1090
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:57,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we were picturing a Luma Room projecting boobies all over the walls, you didn't have this in these classic games.

1091
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is still pretty cool, a way to make it modern.

1092
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Capcom Arcade Cabinet.

1093
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:05,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about this game for a little bit on the show.

1094
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:07,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, the details coming out about this game.

1095
01:24:07,382 --> 01:24:09,823
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to come out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

1096
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:11,664
[SPEAKER_04]: on February 19th.

1097
01:24:12,024 --> 01:24:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: A teaser trailer went out this week showing the games that will be in it.

1098
01:24:15,085 --> 01:24:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Tiger, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins, Legendary Wings, Commando, Avengers Section Z, and I am really excited about this, Pirate Ship Higemaru is coming out as well.

1099
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that game.

1100
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:29,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun little puzzler.

1101
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Reminds me a lot of like Pango.

1102
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,091
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1103
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:52,140
[SPEAKER_04]: In the trailer, it says that you can play these games online with friends.

1104
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:59,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So finally, somebody getting the retro thing right and making it so that I can play the games online across the internets.

1105
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:01,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty excited about this.

1106
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:05,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the games play well, but it sounds pretty cool.

1107
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:10,465
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, would this be something you're interested in at all, or no, because you kind of already have the retro stuff?

1108
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:13,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, honestly, all those games that you listed are games that we own.

1109
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:14,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1110
01:25:16,087 --> 01:25:18,868
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool though, it's cool for people who don't already have this stuff, yeah.

1111
01:25:19,089 --> 01:25:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the modernization, being able to play online.

1112
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:22,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds fun.

1113
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:27,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Casual mode, I think, was advertised too, maybe to make the arcade games a little easier.

1114
01:25:27,473 --> 01:25:30,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe so that you can actually beat Ghosts and Goblins, maybe?

1115
01:25:30,214 --> 01:25:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that's what that means.

1116
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:33,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan can beat it.

1117
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:36,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dan's a freak, and I mean that in the most loving way possible.

1118
01:25:37,577 --> 01:25:40,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week

1119
01:25:49,508 --> 01:25:52,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I believe is also a Capcom game, although not one that's been announced.

1120
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1121
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:55,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like you knew.

1122
01:25:56,029 --> 01:25:59,050
[SPEAKER_08]: But you ruined how I wanted to introduce it, though.

1123
01:25:59,070 --> 01:25:59,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1124
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:04,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I wanted you to play the YouTube clip so that you could get the... Well, I gave a hint.

1125
01:26:04,111 --> 01:26:04,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't tell you the game.

1126
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:07,252
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, play the little opening start on YouTube.

1127
01:26:07,332 --> 01:26:10,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not in the Capcom Hits collection, I'll tell you that much.

1128
01:26:10,572 --> 01:26:10,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1129
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:14,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a clip from this week's Classic Game of the Week.

1130
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:17,174
Mm-hmm.

1131
01:26:19,094 --> 01:26:19,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

1132
01:26:19,895 --> 01:26:20,615
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL Internet.

1133
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:22,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if... There we go.

1134
01:26:26,117 --> 01:26:27,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1135
01:26:27,398 --> 01:26:29,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a little bit of buffering today.

1136
01:26:29,499 --> 01:26:30,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1137
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:31,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have loaded this in advance.

1138
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't.

1139
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because I missed the cue sound.

1140
01:26:39,223 --> 01:26:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1141
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:40,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1142
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:40,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming up.

1143
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,397
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be enough for people to get what the game is.

1144
01:26:46,578 --> 01:26:47,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?

1145
01:26:47,778 --> 01:26:55,304
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, also known in the US as Super Pocket Fighter 2 Turbo.

1146
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:02,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Also known as, we had all these art assets from Puzzle Fighter, we needed to make another game out of it.

1147
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:07,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that actually didn't... I think this came out around the same time.

1148
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:08,086
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out in 97.

1149
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:19,231
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a CPS2 arcade machine, and it came out on the PlayStation, which kept the Pocket Fighter title for the American and European release.

1150
01:27:19,271 --> 01:27:22,652
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out on the WonderSwan, the Sega Saturn, and the PS2.

1151
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:24,473
[SPEAKER_08]: It was part of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

1152
01:27:25,733 --> 01:27:31,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically got all these characters in Super Deformed and they beat the crap out of each other using very cutesy attacks.

1153
01:27:33,075 --> 01:27:42,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It also has characters from Street Fighter Alpha, Dark Stalker, Street Fighter 3, and from Red Earth.

1154
01:27:43,918 --> 01:27:46,959
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is totally on my list of CPS3 games that I want to play.

1155
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:49,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never gotten to play a copy of that.

1156
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it also has just a whole ton of different characters, um, that make appearances throughout the game.

1157
01:27:56,585 --> 01:27:57,766
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just little cameos.

1158
01:27:58,447 --> 01:28:04,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically it's standard fighting, um, and they have power-ups that match, um, their, um...

1159
01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:09,195
[SPEAKER_08]: The characters that actually came from Red Earth, that system.

1160
01:28:09,816 --> 01:28:20,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the little orbs that you can catch that are thrown as your opponent to basically mimic the elemental hits in Darkstalkers.

1161
01:28:20,705 --> 01:28:26,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can turn people to stone, you can freeze them, and then you start with one of each of those.

1162
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:26,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1163
01:28:28,365 --> 01:28:30,286
[SPEAKER_08]: You have two bars and three sub-bars.

1164
01:28:30,446 --> 01:28:32,388
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a life bar and a super bar.

1165
01:28:33,008 --> 01:28:38,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have your mighty combo, which I always laughed at that.

1166
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:43,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Your sub-bars are basically your level of your special moves.

1167
01:28:43,475 --> 01:28:47,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And your levels correspond to different colors.

1168
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:51,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So some people have extra, some don't.

1169
01:28:52,121 --> 01:28:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically every time you hit a character, gems pop out.

1170
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:01,307
[SPEAKER_08]: to, uh, power up.

1171
01:29:02,649 --> 01:29:04,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's where it gets Jump Fighter from.

1172
01:29:05,151 --> 01:29:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, four buttons punch, kick, special, taunt.

1173
01:29:08,774 --> 01:29:10,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Which taunt is, of course, the best thing ever.

1174
01:29:12,497 --> 01:29:13,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um...

1175
01:29:14,278 --> 01:29:36,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, you also have flash combos or costume combos where if you press a combination of punch or kick buttons after striking the opponent with a punch button, then they actually will change into different costumes during the sequence, except for you, and has a very different strong attack at the end.

1176
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:38,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some examples.

1177
01:29:38,694 --> 01:29:41,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Chun-Li turns into Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.

1178
01:29:41,796 --> 01:29:42,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Felicia turns into Mega Man.

1179
01:29:45,241 --> 01:29:49,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember Ibuki had her little schoolgirl outfit and all of that.

1180
01:29:50,436 --> 01:30:00,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So the characters in the game, you have Ryu, you have Ken, you have Zangief, you have Chun-Li, you have Sakura, and Ibuki, all from the Street Fighter series.

1181
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:05,362
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Morigen, Sienko, or Lele as she was in Japan, and Felicia.

1182
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have Tessa.

1183
01:30:08,684 --> 01:30:14,886
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan she was Tabasa, which I think was supposed to be like Tabitha, but why didn't they just call her Tabitha over here?

1184
01:30:15,087 --> 01:30:15,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know.

1185
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:32,830
[SPEAKER_08]: and she's the only Red Earth character in the game you also have secret characters you have Gouki or Akuma and he's very powerful and then you have Dan and basically his story is probably the most hilarious one

1186
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:38,074
[SPEAKER_08]: He's looking for students to start a school, so he's trying to get Sakura to be his student.

1187
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:48,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But she left the school after three days and wrote him a letter saying that she's already mastered everything that he could teach her and that his moves are worthless in a fight.

1188
01:30:48,419 --> 01:30:49,780
[SPEAKER_08]: She calls him a loser, and he cries.

1189
01:30:51,561 --> 01:30:55,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all he knocks out are gems of the same color, I want to say.

1190
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:59,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe that's in Puzzle Fighter, when all he drops are red gems.

1191
01:30:59,905 --> 01:31:00,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway...

1192
01:31:03,015 --> 01:31:05,816
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just a fun little game.

1193
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:12,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite fighting games of all time, and it's just completely cracked out.

1194
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:16,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I've played this game an awful lot.

1195
01:31:16,998 --> 01:31:18,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've played it like once.

1196
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:19,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1197
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:23,959
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the little part where she turned into Jill Valentine, and then, of course, the video buffered, but oh well.

1198
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:25,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that's the game.

1199
01:31:26,059 --> 01:31:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1200
01:31:26,559 --> 01:31:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is, your classic game of the week, Pocket Fighter, or...

1201
01:31:31,311 --> 01:31:33,073
[SPEAKER_08]: which I've got two copies of.

1202
01:31:34,575 --> 01:31:35,916
[SPEAKER_08]: On different systems, on different systems.

1203
01:31:35,936 --> 01:31:37,818
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of your collection that you counted up this week.

1204
01:31:37,838 --> 01:31:39,180
[SPEAKER_08]: But my favorite to play is on Saturn.

1205
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:40,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1206
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:42,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's awesome with the Saturn controller.

1207
01:31:43,284 --> 01:31:44,806
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1208
01:31:44,946 --> 01:31:45,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that, sorry.

1209
01:31:46,408 --> 01:31:49,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to load something else that's coming up later in the show.

1210
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, isn't it a blast?

1211
01:31:51,912 --> 01:31:52,172
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1212
01:31:53,092 --> 01:31:55,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1213
01:31:55,514 --> 01:31:57,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got plenty more show to come.

1214
01:31:57,655 --> 01:32:03,397
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fugle Question of the Week coming up when we get back, as well as some rapid-fire news and movie and gaming news.

1215
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one sounds like it could be pretty cool.

1216
01:32:06,919 --> 01:32:10,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you when we get back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1217
01:32:10,941 --> 01:32:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go anywhere.

1218
01:32:17,105 --> 01:32:24,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 492nd episode in progress here as we go into the second half of the show.

1219
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: February the 10th of 2013 and boy the internet's having some lulls tonight.

1220
01:32:29,353 --> 01:32:38,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's the snowstorms back east or what but yeah we were having some problems playing off YouTube earlier and Twitter's all clogged up with crap on the Grammys.

1221
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I blame the Grammys for this?

1222
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame the Grammys for everything.

1223
01:32:42,722 --> 01:32:45,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I see all these people posting status updates about the Grammys and I'm just like

1224
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1225
01:33:06,055 --> 01:33:09,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They just released the whole show at once, so go watch all 10 episodes or whatever.

1226
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:17,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of breaks the conventional weekly show, so how do you not spoil something that you could have just blown through in a weekend?

1227
01:33:17,845 --> 01:33:18,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you do it with movies.

1228
01:33:19,787 --> 01:33:20,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

1229
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:22,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a really long movie.

1230
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:23,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a miniseries.

1231
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a Lord of the Rings extended cut.

1232
01:33:28,754 --> 01:33:29,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly right.

1233
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:32,411
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1234
01:33:33,872 --> 01:33:38,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let us move on with some rapid-fire news.

1235
01:33:39,455 --> 01:33:40,936
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1236
01:33:41,276 --> 01:33:41,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1237
01:33:43,177 --> 01:33:46,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge.

1238
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:48,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that Wii exclusive game?

1239
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not a Wii exclusive anymore.

1240
01:33:52,282 --> 01:33:56,045
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually kind of interesting because you remember the Wii version was actually published by Nintendo.

1241
01:33:56,425 --> 01:34:02,309
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they will be coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 April 2nd.

1242
01:34:02,989 --> 01:34:05,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's being published, of course, by Tecmo Koei.

1243
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:08,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.

1244
01:34:08,493 --> 01:34:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to have all the additional stuff in there.

1245
01:34:10,614 --> 01:34:15,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you can kind of think of it as like a Game of the Year edition, except your game didn't win Game of the Year.

1246
01:34:16,738 --> 01:34:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Re-release of the cheaper version edition with extra stuff in it.

1247
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:27,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, not so much of that exclusiveness anymore.

1248
01:34:30,991 --> 01:34:40,762
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have a glimpse of one of the first next-gen games, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, which, I gotta be honest, looks a lot like Monster Hunter, but

1249
01:34:42,045 --> 01:34:43,046
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1250
01:34:43,066 --> 01:34:43,627
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1251
01:35:04,176 --> 01:35:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyberpunk or whatever.

1252
01:35:05,596 --> 01:35:08,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently the game is supposed to be open world.

1253
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:18,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be, I guess, they say the world's going to be larger than Skyrim and larger than any of the environments featured in the first two Witcher games.

1254
01:35:20,405 --> 01:35:21,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks pretty.

1255
01:35:22,746 --> 01:35:27,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the subtitle Wild Hunt, but

1256
01:35:29,249 --> 01:35:29,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a cool game.

1257
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's due out in 2014.

1258
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:38,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They say for PC and high-end platforms or next-gen consoles, obviously.

1259
01:35:40,472 --> 01:35:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's always an option.

1260
01:35:41,873 --> 01:35:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, one of the news announcements while we're out was Grand Theft Auto V was delayed to September.

1261
01:35:49,295 --> 01:35:52,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of something I alluded to, I think, the last time we talked, maybe.

1262
01:35:53,256 --> 01:35:57,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some people ask me on Twitter, Loki, so how are you doing with all this news?

1263
01:35:57,658 --> 01:35:58,398
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you coping?

1264
01:35:58,418 --> 01:35:58,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

1265
01:36:10,422 --> 01:36:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay?

1266
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:11,843
[SPEAKER_06]: One day at a time.

1267
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:13,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need one day at a time?

1268
01:36:13,584 --> 01:36:21,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We honestly didn't know what we're going to do as far as like... Because it was kind of like, oh, you know, we'll play Modern Warfare 3 for a while.

1269
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:31,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, by the time we're getting bored of it, we'll have Grand Theft Auto V. And then now it's delayed another, you know, potentially four months from what we were expecting.

1270
01:36:31,217 --> 01:36:33,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, I don't know what we're going to do now.

1271
01:36:34,059 --> 01:36:34,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

1272
01:36:37,327 --> 01:36:37,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1273
01:36:55,988 --> 01:37:09,976
[SPEAKER_06]: basically to those of you who were seeing various conspiracy theories about there being some other ulterior motive for this delay rest assured they're all nonsense literally the only reason we delayed the release is because we want the game to be as good as it needs to be

1274
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:13,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throwing it out there, could it be too late?

1275
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:20,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes when games come out too close to another system being launched, they get cannibalized a little bit.

1276
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:21,309
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1277
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto V is too big for that?

1278
01:37:23,832 --> 01:37:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's too big for that.

1279
01:37:24,633 --> 01:37:30,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I always kind of say that's why people missed Final Fantasy XII, is it kind of landed in a scenario like that, but...

1280
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 6 on the next-gen consoles.

1281
01:37:57,478 --> 01:38:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even fathom what that would be like, but yes.

1282
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:01,501
[SPEAKER_04]: If they sell.

1283
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:36,742
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some other actual classic games that are part of this, including Time Pilot, Asteroids, Centipede, and yes, Loki, Frogger.

1284
01:38:38,063 --> 01:38:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple Intellivision games in there, too.

1285
01:38:39,603 --> 01:38:41,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Shark Shark and Astro Smash, which I thought was interesting.

1286
01:38:41,744 --> 01:38:43,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to wait in line to play those games?

1287
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:45,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on your vehicle.

1288
01:38:45,245 --> 01:38:46,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I play on roller skates?

1289
01:38:46,226 --> 01:38:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

1290
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want, in the privacy of your own home.

1291
01:38:49,047 --> 01:38:52,228
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, playing Frogger on roller skates is difficult.

1292
01:38:52,248 --> 01:38:53,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1293
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:54,752
[SPEAKER_08]: You will not think it is.

1294
01:38:55,092 --> 01:38:57,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Spy Hunter on roller skates was awesome.

1295
01:38:57,855 --> 01:39:01,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, they did have a Spy Hunter machine at the roller rink when I was growing up.

1296
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:03,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1297
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:04,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1298
01:39:04,121 --> 01:39:11,569
[SPEAKER_08]: The roller rink that I used to go to still had their Frogger when I went back like 10 years ago.

1299
01:39:12,426 --> 01:39:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: What if PlayStation Home is the next-gen console?

1300
01:39:15,729 --> 01:39:18,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, this is PlayStation Home.

1301
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:19,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in your home.

1302
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:20,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you're trolling.

1303
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:22,416
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, next up.

1304
01:39:23,277 --> 01:39:24,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Another rumor, folks.

1305
01:39:24,438 --> 01:39:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We love our rumors, don't we?

1306
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's about Sonic.

1307
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:32,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently the next Sonic game to be announced is supposed to be Sonic Adventure 3.

1308
01:39:33,647 --> 01:39:36,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic Adventure 3 sounds probable, doesn't it?

1309
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:04,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Who remembers a classic arcade game by Capcom called Gunsmoke?

1310
01:40:04,695 --> 01:40:05,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I do it in a classic game?

1311
01:40:16,221 --> 01:40:16,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1312
01:40:16,601 --> 01:40:17,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1313
01:40:17,162 --> 01:40:17,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.

1314
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Or as one of my favorite video review shows calls it, Gun.Smoke.

1315
01:40:21,966 --> 01:40:22,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Gun.Smoke.

1316
01:40:23,027 --> 01:40:25,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because not to be confused with the TV show Gun.Smoke.

1317
01:40:25,429 --> 01:40:26,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing to do with that.

1318
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:34,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But Gun.Smoke had a freeware remake done of it, which I'm sure was not legal at all.

1319
01:40:35,318 --> 01:40:37,460
[SPEAKER_04]: But, well, somebody did their own little remake.

1320
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:40,443
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to keep the NES port of the version intact.

1321
01:40:40,803 --> 01:40:43,546
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to rip the assets from the arcade game or whatever.

1322
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:47,651
[SPEAKER_04]: They played the original a whole bunch of times trying to make it just perfect.

1323
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:52,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole little, again, here I go playing a YouTube, but hopefully this one will actually work.

1324
01:40:52,196 --> 01:40:52,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1325
01:40:52,937 --> 01:40:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty spot on to me.

1326
01:40:54,599 --> 01:40:56,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I remember from the NES one.

1327
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, I love the boss that throws all the bombs and then he loses his pants.

1328
01:41:25,405 --> 01:41:28,607
[SPEAKER_08]: So, was that your series, Rob?

1329
01:41:28,807 --> 01:41:29,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1330
01:41:29,968 --> 01:41:40,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Bethesda put out an announcement that the Rage, the official toolkit for Rage is out on Steam, and it's going to be 35 plus gigabytes.

1331
01:41:41,456 --> 01:41:52,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, no, it's out, but to quote John Carmack, he's saying, the toolkit release is not something that we consider consumer friendly, but it does let you get a good look inside the construction process.

1332
01:41:54,184 --> 01:41:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So, pretty cool, huh?

1333
01:41:56,886 --> 01:42:21,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, EA has zero intention of patching a loot exploit in Dead Space 3 Basically, it lets you pretty much farm for resources that would cost you currency and microtransactions And EA is saying, okay, go for it, we don't care The microtransactions are just convenience

1334
01:42:23,511 --> 01:42:42,079
[SPEAKER_08]: and when I saw this, thank you Catastrophic Moggy for giving me this link when we had our lovely, for me, 3am chat but Farmville is going to have an animated series out done by Brett Ratner you know what else he's given us?

1335
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:48,562
[SPEAKER_08]: X-Men Last Stand, That Turd Rush Hour movies, I think were him Red Dragon

1336
01:42:50,995 --> 01:42:56,021
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds like terrible fan rumor stuff, so I hope that's what it is.

1337
01:42:56,602 --> 01:43:05,953
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the Wall Street Journal, it will be produced by Ratner in association with 611 Media, a Canadian television company.

1338
01:43:07,054 --> 01:43:08,095
[SPEAKER_08]: and producers.

1339
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:12,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Other producers are Kirk Shank, Charles Bishop and Nina Gelb.

1340
01:43:13,018 --> 01:43:14,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say the Canadian television company?

1341
01:43:14,919 --> 01:43:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1342
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when somebody asked me what about all the bad things Canada did, I will remember this one.

1343
01:43:19,502 --> 01:43:20,863
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can always forgive Canada.

1344
01:43:21,163 --> 01:43:21,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1345
01:43:21,503 --> 01:43:23,144
[SPEAKER_04]: They did give us You Can't Do That on television.

1346
01:43:23,484 --> 01:43:24,245
[SPEAKER_08]: For two reasons.

1347
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:24,545
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1348
01:43:25,086 --> 01:43:25,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Rush.

1349
01:43:26,147 --> 01:43:26,628
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1350
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:28,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Neil Peart is the best drummer in the universe.

1351
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do love me some Alanis.

1352
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:31,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Haters gonna hate.

1353
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:32,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And Canada's worst driver.

1354
01:43:33,976 --> 01:43:35,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, watch it on YouTube.

1355
01:43:35,237 --> 01:43:36,198
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is awesome.

1356
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:41,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm gonna give a preemptive F you to the people who won season 8 just saying you guys don't need to be driving.

1357
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:43,641
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1358
01:43:45,082 --> 01:43:47,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1359
01:43:47,325 --> 01:43:51,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a ton of responses this week on the Fugle Question of the Week, which is great.

1360
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We love hearing from all of our listeners.

1361
01:43:53,112 --> 01:43:54,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, the Fugle Question of the Week.

1362
01:43:54,974 --> 01:43:57,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Take Facebook and Google and smash those words together.

1363
01:43:57,918 --> 01:43:58,498
[SPEAKER_04]: You get Fugle.

1364
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: and we ask a question of our fan communities each week.

1365
01:44:02,062 --> 01:44:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys give us answers and we read some of them on the show.

1366
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:06,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to be able to read them all tonight.

1367
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were too good this week.

1368
01:44:08,769 --> 01:44:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So please visit our fan communities at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see the answers in their entirety.

1369
01:44:16,436 --> 01:44:19,379
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with Google Plus once I, of course, tell you the question.

1370
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:20,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short one tonight.

1371
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:27,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've all heard the rumor about the next Xbox blocking used games.

1372
01:44:27,914 --> 01:44:29,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you believe this rumor could be true?

1373
01:44:30,096 --> 01:44:33,859
[SPEAKER_04]: For that matter, how much do you tend to believe industry rumors?

1374
01:44:39,764 --> 01:44:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Over on Google+, Techie Q says My stance on game industry rumors has to be to take them with a grain of salt This leads to less heartache if a particular rumor doesn't come true or vice versa Isn't that the truth?

1375
01:44:52,715 --> 01:44:57,579
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already people saying I'm not going to buy the next console Based on rumors alone

1376
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:00,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

1377
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: and E3VL or Evil says on Google Plus, sources are barely creditable these days.

1378
01:45:20,844 --> 01:45:27,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing the internet being first on a news site is better than having long wait times to confirm information when it comes to rumors and speculation.

1379
01:45:27,728 --> 01:45:35,654
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone tries to discredit the website later down the line, they can label the article as it was just a rumor, as if it was some magical phrase to get them out of the situation.

1380
01:45:35,754 --> 01:45:39,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, one of those whole, it's become about hits, hits, hits.

1381
01:45:40,497 --> 01:45:52,002
[SPEAKER_04]: and certainly the ESA only fosters that attitude when it's all about the hits to get your site validated by them so you may be blessed by the ESA Pope to go to E3.

1382
01:45:53,988 --> 01:45:54,889
[SPEAKER_08]: The ESA Pope.

1383
01:45:55,109 --> 01:45:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

1384
01:45:56,169 --> 01:46:02,294
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to email the ESA Pope and say, please, I would like to be blessed to go to your E3 event.

1385
01:46:02,334 --> 01:46:07,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm imagining... You stand in front of the gates and your website is judged.

1386
01:46:07,497 --> 01:46:10,959
[SPEAKER_04]: How many hits did ye accumulate in December of last year?

1387
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And ye are worthy or no reply?

1388
01:46:14,822 --> 01:46:16,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm picturing what his Popemobile looks like.

1389
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,945
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with the glass probably pulled by light cycles.

1390
01:46:20,146 --> 01:46:20,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1391
01:46:20,506 --> 01:46:23,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually envision that the ESA Pope is basically Dame Edna.

1392
01:46:24,361 --> 01:46:25,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's Dame Edna.

1393
01:46:26,483 --> 01:46:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: My hello, my puppets.

1394
01:46:29,725 --> 01:46:35,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Orange Lounge Radio is applying to go to E3.

1395
01:46:35,649 --> 01:46:36,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are they?

1396
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:40,812
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Orange Lounge have to do with a video game?

1397
01:46:41,072 --> 01:46:42,733
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you mentioned Dame Edna.

1398
01:46:42,793 --> 01:46:44,174
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I found the other day?

1399
01:46:44,995 --> 01:46:49,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The picture I did for Extifer of Dame Edna saying Pandarens.

1400
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:52,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Random.

1401
01:46:53,513 --> 01:46:57,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Why, there's no game or, you know, video in their title.

1402
01:46:58,358 --> 01:46:59,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Attack Radio?

1403
01:46:59,879 --> 01:47:01,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of you!

1404
01:47:05,445 --> 01:47:07,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on.

1405
01:47:09,138 --> 01:47:09,639
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX USE GAME THING

1406
01:47:26,776 --> 01:47:27,938
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about the whole unlock fee?

1407
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:57,498
[SPEAKER_06]: It's money-grubbing because all the excuses that they were saying before that, oh, it's going to be all the developers lose out on money.

1408
01:47:57,518 --> 01:47:59,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Developers aren't getting paid for that anyways.

1409
01:48:00,059 --> 01:48:04,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you pay the developer and they may have commissions or whatever based on it, but

1410
01:48:04,942 --> 01:48:10,645
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're being sold to distributors or retailers or whatever, it doesn't matter if they sell through.

1411
01:48:13,286 --> 01:48:20,069
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to put them out of business if you get rid of used games because that's how they make their money because your margins in your games are terrible.

1412
01:48:20,209 --> 01:48:32,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless all of a sudden they start giving retailers way better costs on goods, then that's the only thing that's going to really drive new games because if it becomes more profitable to sell a new title than it does used games,

1413
01:48:33,254 --> 01:48:55,708
[SPEAKER_04]: then they're going to go that route Brandon C on Facebook five hours ago saying something we brought up here on the show the only way to enforce it would be some sort of always online requirement and Sony and Microsoft coming together to make it happen there's no way Microsoft would block used games without Sony agreeing to do the same so funny enough that point I brought up earlier with the new access of evil huh

1414
01:48:57,049 --> 01:49:19,887
[SPEAKER_04]: RedTheHaze replies in part I think people are overreacting to the news because everyone's excited for the new generation and any information even rumors are given a lot of attention gamers should just shut up and finish their backlogs already yeah shut up and go eat your backlog no dessert for you that's actually really good advice kids in China have no backlog

1415
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I made Bob turn red.

1416
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:26,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1417
01:49:27,421 --> 01:49:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was a witty retort.

1418
01:49:29,122 --> 01:49:29,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very true.

1419
01:49:33,664 --> 01:49:34,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1420
01:49:34,424 --> 01:49:41,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary Baxter on Facebook replies, I take everything I hear with a grain of salt until someone with real pull in the company confirms it.

1421
01:49:41,527 --> 01:49:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this does sound like Microsoft would do to get more sales on titles that most people would wait and pick up used from the evil G or a pawn shop.

1422
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:52,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But until an official spokesperson says yay or nay, all we can do is wait.

1423
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:58,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, VXChaseNXV says, it already happened.

1424
01:49:58,743 --> 01:50:01,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, non-code based digital downloads.

1425
01:50:01,705 --> 01:50:02,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Industry rumors are silly.

1426
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:09,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Peers spin in exactly the same way as positive announcements, but are often able to be traced back to something specific.

1427
01:50:12,153 --> 01:50:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: One more here from DarkCharger.

1428
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:43,588
[SPEAKER_04]: While these are still unsubstantiated rumors, I could totally see a future where all game purchases are tied to a user account or gamertag via a key that ships with the disc or linked via digital download.

1429
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thought.

1430
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:51,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even name before, which I'm sure we've all got to be thinking about, but what if your Xbox has to be always online?

1431
01:50:52,536 --> 01:50:54,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live goes down sometimes.

1432
01:50:55,098 --> 01:50:55,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at tonight.

1433
01:50:55,918 --> 01:50:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got those snowstorms going on that are knocking things out.

1434
01:50:59,281 --> 01:50:59,661
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

1435
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:03,303
[SPEAKER_04]: What if the internet was too choppy and you couldn't maintain your connection?

1436
01:51:03,343 --> 01:51:04,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just hosed?

1437
01:51:04,403 --> 01:51:06,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you and your $60 game?

1438
01:51:06,463 --> 01:51:13,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't they learn from Ubisoft that tried to do this shit with their DRM and how well that worked?

1439
01:51:13,545 --> 01:51:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the infrastructure in place to where that's a guarantee that you're going to have an internet connection.

1440
01:51:23,407 --> 01:51:26,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't see that that would be a viable option.

1441
01:51:28,449 --> 01:51:34,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, they could try crazy things if they want, but it doesn't mean it's going to work.

1442
01:51:35,393 --> 01:51:36,834
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm going to read one more answer.

1443
01:51:36,854 --> 01:51:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to end it there, but I got to do this one last answer because I think this is pretty good.

1444
01:51:40,395 --> 01:51:43,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're all good, but this one kind of brings up a different point here I want to read.

1445
01:51:44,176 --> 01:51:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's SSJ100Matt on Facebook.

1446
01:51:46,297 --> 01:51:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put the tinfoil hat on and say I believe it, only because I think that Microsoft purposely leaked this rumor to gauge the community's reaction and plan their approach from there.

1447
01:51:55,701 --> 01:51:56,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to stop there.

1448
01:51:57,541 --> 01:51:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they think was going to happen?

1449
01:51:59,662 --> 01:52:01,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, the community is going to love this.

1450
01:52:02,224 --> 01:52:03,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really?

1451
01:52:05,207 --> 01:52:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with if you're going to gauge interest is there's no upside to that.

1452
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:11,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're going to get rid of your ability to play used games.

1453
01:52:11,652 --> 01:52:13,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

1454
01:52:13,714 --> 01:52:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was like, we're going to get rid of the ability for you to play used games, but all the games that are in retail for $20 cheaper than they were now, then that would be okay.

1455
01:52:21,721 --> 01:52:24,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with not being able to play used games but I can get my games cheaper at launch.

1456
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:27,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with that instead of... Yes, yes.

1457
01:52:27,466 --> 01:52:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yes.

1458
01:52:28,267 --> 01:52:32,671
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be... I would be totally okay with all of this if all games were $19.99.

1459
01:52:35,293 --> 01:52:35,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

1460
01:52:36,674 --> 01:52:40,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Would suddenly this not be such bad news if games weren't $60 anymore?

1461
01:52:40,538 --> 01:52:41,058
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Halo 5 was $20?

1462
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:44,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not a big deal.

1463
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big deal, is it?

1464
01:52:46,591 --> 01:52:47,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, you're right.

1465
01:52:47,672 --> 01:52:49,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Take away my ability to play used games.

1466
01:52:49,453 --> 01:52:54,677
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're willing to put that commitment in, so am I. I usually don't buy games until they drop down that low now.

1467
01:52:55,537 --> 01:52:58,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, continuing on with the comment here.

1468
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:04,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Microsoft has seen enough from companies like EA where they seem to have gotten away with charging for passes for online play in their games.

1469
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:07,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's only a matter of time before we see console makers doing this.

1470
01:53:07,886 --> 01:53:11,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But I anticipate Microsoft coming up with a creative way to charge for it.

1471
01:53:11,348 --> 01:53:23,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps they can bundle it with your yearly Xbox Live fee, like a Diamond Club that pays for unlimited use of used or borrowed games in exchange for discounts or specials on the Xbox Live Marketplace, much like PlayStation Plus.

1472
01:53:24,237 --> 01:53:32,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That way they'll still get money, encourage gamers to spend more money in the marketplace, and make people like they're not getting charged a second or third time for the same game.

1473
01:53:33,243 --> 01:53:36,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a thought, but at Microsoft, if you're listening and like that idea, call me.

1474
01:53:37,405 --> 01:53:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's an ugly idea.

1475
01:53:41,788 --> 01:53:47,771
[SPEAKER_04]: To the guy sitting in the boardroom, that's a beautiful idea, but SSJ100, Matt, that is an ugly idea, and I'm almost a little ashamed that I read it.

1476
01:53:48,011 --> 01:53:48,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about what he's saying.

1477
01:53:50,412 --> 01:53:56,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it blocks out used games, but if you're an Xbox Live Diamond member, that restriction is lifted.

1478
01:53:57,715 --> 01:53:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That is ugly.

1479
01:53:58,735 --> 01:54:04,678
[SPEAKER_06]: That would come back to bite him in the ass so fast, it's not even funny.

1480
01:54:05,098 --> 01:54:05,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1481
01:54:06,499 --> 01:54:08,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if they've already thought of it.

1482
01:54:08,459 --> 01:54:09,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you kind of see it?

1483
01:54:12,131 --> 01:54:13,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you kind of see it?

1484
01:54:13,573 --> 01:54:15,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost worse than just blocking.

1485
01:54:16,215 --> 01:54:17,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It is almost.

1486
01:54:18,437 --> 01:54:19,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about like...

1487
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:22,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel dirty.

1488
01:54:22,947 --> 01:54:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to bathe after reading that.

1489
01:54:25,247 --> 01:54:30,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is one of the stories we're covering, but the other day, Sony's stock price went down 10%.

1490
01:54:30,769 --> 01:54:39,031
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't make these really crazy decisions to pull this kind of crap on their consumer.

1491
01:54:39,091 --> 01:54:40,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to play it safe.

1492
01:54:40,631 --> 01:54:41,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the same with Microsoft.

1493
01:54:41,752 --> 01:54:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to play it safe, too.

1494
01:54:43,132 --> 01:54:46,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they can get rid of used game sales that way, because that's...

1495
01:54:47,453 --> 01:55:14,666
[SPEAKER_06]: it's seriously it's a gamble because unless you know both of them are doing it then and and I still think even if Nintendo would have to do it too and also the fact that you have to completely forget the fact that there's all these older consoles out there GameGuru in chat sums it up perfectly live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says so I have to pay $60 a year to not only play games online but to play used games fuck that shit fuck that shit

1496
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:19,395
[SPEAKER_08]: My SNES is looking better and better.

1497
01:55:19,435 --> 01:55:22,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you said $60 a year, because $60 a year is for gold.

1498
01:55:22,897 --> 01:55:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Why stop at $60?

1499
01:55:24,218 --> 01:55:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the diamond plan.

1500
01:55:27,499 --> 01:55:28,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll throw in a free movie.

1501
01:55:30,281 --> 01:55:31,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Free rental on Xbox movies.

1502
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:34,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a free rental on an Xbox movie.

1503
01:55:34,503 --> 01:55:36,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel dirty.

1504
01:55:38,123 --> 01:55:39,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Fugle Question of the Week.

1505
01:55:39,664 --> 01:55:44,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You get your honorary member card along with a bottle of lube to commemorate the Xbox.

1506
01:55:45,308 --> 01:55:48,871
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if you get the diamond plan, then they'll throw in a wedge for you to bend over.

1507
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:53,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly that name of Xbox Lube sounds more and more appropriate.

1508
01:55:53,634 --> 01:55:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if y'all are buying it, you better lube yourself up.

1509
01:55:57,317 --> 01:55:58,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going the route of Sony.

1510
01:55:58,858 --> 01:55:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Latin.

1511
01:55:59,458 --> 01:56:00,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Lube.

1512
01:56:03,981 --> 01:56:05,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that name even better.

1513
01:56:05,202 --> 01:56:06,383
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Lube.

1514
01:56:06,783 --> 01:56:07,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Lube.

1515
01:56:10,376 --> 01:56:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some real news.

1516
01:56:11,918 --> 01:56:17,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop all this wank and get into, oh, other wank about movies and stuff, right, Loki?

1517
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:22,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so let's talk about shit that's never going to happen while I'm still alive.

1518
01:56:23,907 --> 01:56:29,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So Valve's looking to make a Portal or Half-Life movie with J.J.

1519
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:30,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Abrams.

1520
01:56:30,331 --> 01:56:31,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

1521
01:56:31,571 --> 01:56:32,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So J.J.

1522
01:56:32,272 --> 01:56:39,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Abrams says, we're going to try to figure out if we can make a Half-Life or a Portal movie together, basically said Gabe Newell.

1523
01:56:40,437 --> 01:56:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess they've...

1524
01:56:43,695 --> 01:56:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1525
01:56:45,676 --> 01:56:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: No timetable's been talked about or anything.

1526
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's put it this way, we're not going to see this anytime soon.

1527
01:56:54,742 --> 01:57:00,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we'll see Half-Life 3 before we'll see a Portal movie and Half-Life movie.

1528
01:57:01,327 --> 01:57:04,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome, but also consider the fact that, you know...

1529
01:57:06,468 --> 01:57:08,189
[SPEAKER_06]: JJ Abrams is a little busy right now.

1530
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:13,253
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a Star Trek movie coming out and a Star Wars movie he's working on.

1531
01:57:13,373 --> 01:57:16,616
[SPEAKER_08]: How much lens flare will this one have?

1532
01:57:17,556 --> 01:57:19,378
[SPEAKER_06]: An amazing amount of lens flare.

1533
01:57:20,278 --> 01:57:22,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be crazy.

1534
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:24,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with those portals being all shiny and everything.

1535
01:57:24,722 --> 01:57:26,583
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of lens flare that we had there.

1536
01:57:27,784 --> 01:57:28,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The potential is staggering.

1537
01:57:29,696 --> 01:57:51,370
[SPEAKER_06]: yes um so of course you know brief announcement enough to tease people no and they're not going to give anybody any sort of release dates because they would only have to delay them indefinitely like they do with Half-Life 3 you guys what if Half-Life 3 is a movie that's it that's the catch what if they're already like movies anyway with just some gameplay thrown in here and there

1538
01:57:51,857 --> 01:57:52,418
[SPEAKER_06]: New ARG, New ARG

1539
01:58:10,347 --> 01:58:10,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't J.J.

1540
01:58:10,968 --> 01:58:12,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Abrams kind of busy though?

1541
01:58:12,408 --> 01:58:13,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Star Wars?

1542
01:58:13,969 --> 01:58:16,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a big deal.

1543
01:58:16,931 --> 01:58:20,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he signed on for the next movie, but isn't that going to be like the next trilogy?

1544
01:58:20,433 --> 01:58:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because that could take a long time.

1545
01:58:21,793 --> 01:58:23,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they just going to say fuck you to all the books?

1546
01:58:24,034 --> 01:58:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are saying fuck you to all the books, which I'm totally okay with.

1547
01:58:27,116 --> 01:58:28,518
[SPEAKER_08]: JJ Abrams is only on board to direct episode 7.

1548
01:58:44,013 --> 01:58:46,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is okay because 4, 5, and 6 had different directors too.

1549
01:58:46,975 --> 01:58:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Lucas did the first one but he didn't do 5 and 6.

1550
01:58:50,536 --> 01:58:55,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I will never, ever recognize the quote, first three quote as being canon.

1551
01:58:56,119 --> 01:58:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: No one will, honey.

1552
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody will.

1553
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:58,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

1554
01:58:58,641 --> 01:59:03,423
[SPEAKER_06]: For number 8 and 9 they've got Brett Ratner and Joel Schumacher.

1555
01:59:03,443 --> 01:59:03,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to hell.

1556
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:06,505
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be nipples on everybody.

1557
01:59:06,725 --> 01:59:09,526
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's, um, fuck what's his name, Uwe Boll.

1558
01:59:11,427 --> 01:59:11,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god.

1559
01:59:12,008 --> 01:59:17,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna make it a zombie movie that's gonna be steampunk and... And Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it.

1560
01:59:17,351 --> 01:59:18,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody freeze.

1561
01:59:20,433 --> 01:59:21,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody chill.

1562
01:59:22,395 --> 01:59:24,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I am your grandfather.

1563
01:59:26,457 --> 01:59:27,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you feel the ice?

1564
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You know...

1565
01:59:33,535 --> 01:59:35,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have a lot of Arnold movies to catch up on.

1566
01:59:35,856 --> 01:59:36,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1567
01:59:36,376 --> 01:59:37,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care how terrible the movie is.

1568
01:59:37,476 --> 01:59:38,396
[SPEAKER_06]: That new one flopped.

1569
01:59:39,456 --> 01:59:39,956
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1570
01:59:40,157 --> 01:59:42,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are setting their expectations too high.

1571
01:59:42,677 --> 01:59:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a popcorn movie, okay?

1572
01:59:44,697 --> 01:59:47,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Was really like Commando that deep of a movie?

1573
01:59:47,658 --> 01:59:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1574
01:59:48,558 --> 01:59:53,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Being the governor of California wasn't the best career choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger, let's be real.

1575
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:54,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like a noble thing to do.

1576
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, he gives tank rides to the press.

1577
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:59,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched a video on that.

1578
02:00:00,181 --> 02:00:00,961
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1579
02:00:02,122 --> 02:00:04,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has his own tank that he drives around.

1580
02:00:04,402 --> 02:00:05,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know what?

1581
02:00:05,743 --> 02:00:08,583
[SPEAKER_06]: When he was in the military, he was a tank driver.

1582
02:00:08,963 --> 02:00:10,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's pretty awesome.

1583
02:00:10,504 --> 02:00:15,645
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in chat says, Star Wars Episode VIII Explosions directed by Michael Bay.

1584
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Michael Bay the director of Independence Day or is that Roland Emmerich?

1585
02:00:18,685 --> 02:00:19,985
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Roland Emmerich.

1586
02:00:20,125 --> 02:00:21,366
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who needs to direct.

1587
02:00:21,586 --> 02:00:24,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Boys would be... You know what?

1588
02:00:24,586 --> 02:00:25,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1589
02:00:25,166 --> 02:00:27,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Independence Day is one of those movies that only gets better with time.

1590
02:00:30,068 --> 02:00:30,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch 2012?

1591
02:00:32,769 --> 02:00:34,090
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've only seen clips of it.

1592
02:00:34,491 --> 02:00:35,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long-ass movie.

1593
02:00:36,032 --> 02:00:41,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You know a movie I did see was The Day After Tomorrow where they're literally running after ice.

1594
02:00:41,936 --> 02:00:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like The Happening.

1595
02:00:42,936 --> 02:00:43,937
[SPEAKER_04]: They're running after wind.

1596
02:00:43,977 --> 02:00:44,257
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1597
02:00:44,397 --> 02:00:49,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I flipped a table when they were running toward the little fire in the building, the fireplace.

1598
02:00:50,461 --> 02:00:51,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I just flipped my table.

1599
02:00:51,522 --> 02:00:58,387
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to seriously watch 2012 because they escape from an earthquake via plane two or three times.

1600
02:01:00,007 --> 02:01:02,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the same scene.

1601
02:01:02,068 --> 02:01:03,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, did we just do this?

1602
02:01:04,009 --> 02:01:06,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what's going on?

1603
02:01:07,111 --> 02:01:11,152
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolfInChat says, fun fact, Independence Day's original script was Stargate 2.

1604
02:01:11,553 --> 02:01:14,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard that before, too, that Independence Day started as Stargate 2.

1605
02:01:15,174 --> 02:01:15,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that.

1606
02:01:15,634 --> 02:01:16,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

1607
02:01:16,275 --> 02:01:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

1608
02:01:17,595 --> 02:01:18,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, it changed a lot, but...

1609
02:01:19,356 --> 02:01:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: There was also, I think, something in the original script that explained why the Apple thing worked, why they were able to hack it with a Mac, is that they had already been working on breaking down the code on the one ship that they had.

1610
02:01:33,565 --> 02:01:35,146
[SPEAKER_04]: They had all this stuff written out.

1611
02:01:35,426 --> 02:01:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are people trying to explain the logic in the movie?

1612
02:01:37,628 --> 02:01:38,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's...

1613
02:01:38,188 --> 02:01:39,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the thing is, they had it explained.

1614
02:01:39,969 --> 02:01:46,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember sitting there in the theater when they first showed the preview and the aliens, like, you know, how old were we all when that movie came out?

1615
02:01:46,754 --> 02:01:47,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You would have been a little younger.

1616
02:01:47,594 --> 02:01:49,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in college the first time.

1617
02:01:49,195 --> 02:01:50,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a freshman in college.

1618
02:01:50,476 --> 02:01:52,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that every day.

1619
02:01:53,298 --> 02:01:55,159
[SPEAKER_06]: The second, the third, and the fourth.

1620
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, every day of the movie, it was just like, okay, we're on the second.

1621
02:01:59,362 --> 02:02:00,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're on the third.

1622
02:02:00,223 --> 02:02:00,723
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the fourth.

1623
02:02:00,763 --> 02:02:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing it every single day.

1624
02:02:02,244 --> 02:02:07,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, though, when that trailer first came out with the alien ship came out and it blew up the White House and everybody's like,

1625
02:02:08,388 --> 02:02:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little long from that right now

1626
02:02:34,249 --> 02:02:34,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember what else?

1627
02:02:34,869 --> 02:02:36,049
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they have What's-His-Face?

1628
02:02:36,429 --> 02:02:39,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is not a tangent you all asked for, but it's Orange Lounge Radio, people.

1629
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what made the movie Independence Day?

1630
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:44,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what made that fucking movie?

1631
02:02:44,671 --> 02:02:45,451
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog surviving?

1632
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:48,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Harvey Firestein is in Independence Day.

1633
02:02:49,312 --> 02:02:49,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1634
02:02:49,952 --> 02:02:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to call my mother.

1635
02:02:52,073 --> 02:02:52,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1636
02:02:57,454 --> 02:02:58,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved him.

1637
02:03:02,642 --> 02:03:05,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Best choice of casting ever.

1638
02:03:08,224 --> 02:03:10,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like how they were advertising, you don't know who's going to die.

1639
02:03:11,845 --> 02:03:14,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And I pretty much pegged everyone who was going to die in that movie.

1640
02:03:16,747 --> 02:03:17,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're looking.

1641
02:03:19,588 --> 02:03:20,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

1642
02:03:22,689 --> 02:03:23,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1643
02:03:23,569 --> 02:03:24,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find a clip.

1644
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:25,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find one.

1645
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it when he's in the car?

1646
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:27,471
[SPEAKER_06]: My bed's actually going to load.

1647
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:28,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1648
02:03:28,031 --> 02:03:28,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1649
02:03:28,371 --> 02:03:28,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1650
02:03:28,671 --> 02:03:30,772
[SPEAKER_04]: There's at least this one little clip.

1651
02:03:30,792 --> 02:03:31,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1652
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1653
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:41,650
Oh, crap.

1654
02:03:43,071 --> 02:03:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I love him.

1655
02:03:45,332 --> 02:03:49,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I remember from that, you know, was it residents of L.A.

1656
02:03:49,274 --> 02:03:59,399
[SPEAKER_06]: are being warned not to fire, or was it like, or use their firearms at the alien spacecraft, or discharge their firearms at the alien spacecraft?

1657
02:03:59,539 --> 02:04:00,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

1658
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:00,900
[SPEAKER_04]: A warning.

1659
02:04:01,961 --> 02:04:03,902
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatupG said, he said forget his lawyer.

1660
02:04:03,922 --> 02:04:04,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1661
02:04:04,462 --> 02:04:07,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta call my mother, and I gotta call my lawyer.

1662
02:04:07,043 --> 02:04:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, forget my lawyer.

1663
02:04:10,410 --> 02:04:11,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we gotta move on.

1664
02:04:11,551 --> 02:04:13,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can have like RuPaul in the next one?

1665
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:18,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And to answer Dungeon Buster, no, I do not have the Independence Day game.

1666
02:04:19,258 --> 02:04:21,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not anywhere at all in the collection.

1667
02:04:22,681 --> 02:04:25,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Aliens are coming to us from Mars.

1668
02:04:25,804 --> 02:04:27,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they need to sashay away.

1669
02:04:30,749 --> 02:04:31,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a dragon?

1670
02:04:31,369 --> 02:04:33,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Because RuPaul being in... Oh, forget it.

1671
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:36,491
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1672
02:04:36,872 --> 02:04:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to sissy that walk.

1673
02:04:38,052 --> 02:04:38,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1674
02:04:39,133 --> 02:04:39,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1675
02:04:39,654 --> 02:04:40,414
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1676
02:04:41,595 --> 02:04:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it finally my turn?

1677
02:04:42,535 --> 02:04:43,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Because fuck.

1678
02:04:43,176 --> 02:04:44,657
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have to talk about Skylanders real quick.

1679
02:04:44,677 --> 02:04:46,298
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we even talking about?

1680
02:04:46,778 --> 02:04:47,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Movies.

1681
02:04:47,379 --> 02:04:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1682
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:48,579
[SPEAKER_04]: J.J.

1683
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:49,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Abrams.

1684
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:50,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow.

1685
02:04:50,721 --> 02:04:51,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, J.J.

1686
02:04:51,822 --> 02:04:54,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Abrams, for derailing the show in an epic manner.

1687
02:04:54,643 --> 02:04:56,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's a lens flare for you.

1688
02:04:57,365 --> 02:04:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, blind.

1689
02:04:58,126 --> 02:04:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1690
02:04:59,246 --> 02:05:00,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Skylanders.

1691
02:05:00,147 --> 02:05:04,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what a great way to follow up a Harvey Fierstein story than talking about Skylanders.

1692
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Skylanders swap force is coming out.

1693
02:05:07,551 --> 02:05:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You thwop them.

1694
02:05:09,733 --> 02:05:12,094
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 special figures with torsos and bottom halves.

1695
02:05:12,114 --> 02:05:13,315
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to do the accent for the whole thing.

1696
02:05:13,735 --> 02:05:13,855
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1697
02:05:14,235 --> 02:05:16,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You link the two pieces together.

1698
02:05:16,497 --> 02:05:18,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You can combine the pieces in different ways.

1699
02:05:18,718 --> 02:05:44,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, oh god, a whole new collection crap Now you gotta collect heads and feet Instead of just, you know, the figures themselves You can mix and match Although, in theory, it's a neat way to evolve the concept, I guess For what it's worth It's also gonna make you buy a brand new portal Because the old portal is not compatible with the new characters Oh, bastards Bastards That's an $80 purchase right there, buddy

1700
02:05:44,688 --> 02:05:46,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also being done by Vicarious Visions.

1701
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not being done by Toys for Bob, who did the original.

1702
02:05:50,073 --> 02:05:52,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Toys for Bob coming up with a new money-making scheme right now.

1703
02:05:52,816 --> 02:05:57,881
[SPEAKER_06]: All they're doing is putting out new characters because there is a thing... They made tons of money, so yeah.

1704
02:05:59,186 --> 02:06:02,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, Wii, and 3DS.

1705
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:05,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting that it's on Wii U and Wii.

1706
02:06:05,754 --> 02:06:09,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii version being done by Beenox, 3DS by nSpace.

1707
02:06:09,337 --> 02:06:11,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they've been contracted out because they don't care.

1708
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,121
[SPEAKER_06]: They know that people buy the characters.

1709
02:06:13,182 --> 02:06:14,723
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care about the game.

1710
02:06:14,743 --> 02:06:16,245
[SPEAKER_06]: They just want people to buy characters.

1711
02:06:16,705 --> 02:06:24,191
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think Skylanders isn't a thing, like that people are making too big of a deal out of Skylanders, you're probably right.

1712
02:06:24,251 --> 02:06:27,273
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality is, walk into Target or Best Buy.

1713
02:06:27,313 --> 02:06:33,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at Best Buy last night because, I don't know, we were like, oh yeah, you can actually get those K-Cup coffee things pretty cheap at Best Buy.

1714
02:06:33,517 --> 02:06:34,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we were there for.

1715
02:06:35,419 --> 02:06:36,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Marshall's.

1716
02:06:36,119 --> 02:06:41,083
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an aisle in the video game section, an entire aisle dedicated to Skylanders.

1717
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll blow your mind.

1718
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:47,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon, of course, Disney Infinity and all this other stuff will be competing with it.

1719
02:06:47,831 --> 02:06:50,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney Infinity, can you imagine compared to the Skylanders stuff?

1720
02:06:50,772 --> 02:06:52,632
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have so much.

1721
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:53,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Entire stores.

1722
02:06:54,233 --> 02:07:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Activision on their earnings call announced 100 million Skylanders toys have been sold.

1723
02:07:01,815 --> 02:07:02,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1724
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1725
02:07:02,996 --> 02:07:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually from their press conference at Toy Fair 2013.

1726
02:07:05,899 --> 02:07:07,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, not from the earnings call.

1727
02:07:08,081 --> 02:07:11,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, $500 million in sales in the U.S.

1728
02:07:11,685 --> 02:07:12,626
[SPEAKER_04]: alone.

1729
02:07:13,127 --> 02:07:15,349
[SPEAKER_04]: $195 million of that from Skylanders Giants.

1730
02:07:17,251 --> 02:07:17,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a thing.

1731
02:07:18,613 --> 02:07:20,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it or not, it's a thing.

1732
02:07:21,124 --> 02:07:46,985
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it's because people blindly collect those toys and now that they have to buy new characters and version 3's of their characters honestly if I were 8 I'd want it too I mean I'm trying to put it in that perspective is that it's easy for me to sit here and laugh at it but whoever fucking thought of this is a genius and if I was a kid I would fucking want it but I gotta wonder what's gonna happen when Infinity comes out cause that's gonna cut them off at the knees I think I did see the trailer for that and I liked it

1733
02:07:47,265 --> 02:07:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're all going to... I mean, it's not going to end there.

1734
02:07:50,367 --> 02:07:51,628
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1735
02:07:51,668 --> 02:07:57,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you don't think Nintendo wants that near-field communication shit to work so they can bring on the fucking Pokemon?

1736
02:07:57,672 --> 02:07:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: They've talked about that before.

1737
02:07:58,853 --> 02:08:03,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all Nintendo has to fucking do is announce Pokemon for Wii U with actual Pokemon.

1738
02:08:03,796 --> 02:08:04,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Collect them all.

1739
02:08:05,057 --> 02:08:06,238
[SPEAKER_05]: You will collect them all.

1740
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Each character is going to be $10.

1741
02:08:10,621 --> 02:08:13,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's got a lot of stuff they could whip out and put on the table if they wanted to.

1742
02:08:14,764 --> 02:08:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me.

1743
02:08:16,044 --> 02:08:21,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about needing lube When they whip that out Is your body ready for this, bitch?

1744
02:08:22,610 --> 02:08:27,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on, DarkSakura By the way, Rob, did you see my suggestion in chat?

1745
02:08:28,696 --> 02:08:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: No Mr. Spanky needs a New York Jewish cousin named Harvey Spanklestein Nobody understands the Mr. Spanky joke anymore There's people who get it Like four or five I miss Mr. Spanky, Rob

1746
02:08:42,171 --> 02:08:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR is not on PC anymore.

1747
02:08:43,932 --> 02:08:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1748
02:08:44,752 --> 02:08:46,593
[SPEAKER_04]: How old is DDR PC these days?

1749
02:08:46,693 --> 02:08:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Good lord.

1750
02:08:47,714 --> 02:08:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I could probably find it on abandonware sites.

1751
02:08:49,695 --> 02:08:51,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how old DDR PC is.

1752
02:08:51,116 --> 02:08:53,897
[SPEAKER_08]: You could probably find it unwrapped and boxed in my house.

1753
02:08:54,617 --> 02:08:56,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no, wrapped and boxed in my house, which is true.

1754
02:08:57,839 --> 02:09:00,400
[SPEAKER_08]: So, speaking of Konami, how's that?

1755
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:11,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the UK studio dude, David Cox, said that they want to consider putting out Castlevania Mirror of Fate on HD platforms.

1756
02:09:12,287 --> 02:09:14,768
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is coming out on the 5th in the US for the 3DS.

1757
02:09:15,229 --> 02:09:25,354
[SPEAKER_08]: But he said that the whole game is actually already done in high def, that they actually shrunk it and removed bones and changed animations to make it DS-sized, or 3DS-sized.

1758
02:09:25,915 --> 02:09:27,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, in fact, the quote right here is...

1759
02:09:31,959 --> 02:09:56,016
[SPEAKER_08]: at Mercury S team we have an HD version of the game sitting there in a computer somewhere so I mean I guess all the other Castlevania games have sold very well but the cover art is really pretty but I'm really not sure how well it's going to sell I mean maybe it will, it's a Castlevania game hard to go wrong there sorry Castlevania 64

1760
02:09:59,635 --> 02:10:05,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see them doing something like this for maybe a Nintendo console because it's a 3DS game.

1761
02:10:05,617 --> 02:10:08,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, hey, there's a perfect Wii U tie-in right there.

1762
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:08,698
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1763
02:10:09,458 --> 02:10:15,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually like to... You can have that little Metroidvania map on your little Wii U... Did they say this is another Metroidvania-style one?

1764
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.

1765
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just making that up.

1766
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:24,823
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of like a port of Lords of Shadows, so it's a hack-and-slash.

1767
02:10:27,382 --> 02:10:28,123
[SPEAKER_06]: God of Belmont.

1768
02:10:28,483 --> 02:10:29,183
[SPEAKER_08]: God of Belmont.

1769
02:10:29,343 --> 02:10:30,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much, yeah.

1770
02:10:32,464 --> 02:10:33,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Whip of War.

1771
02:10:34,085 --> 02:10:35,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't even follow those anymore.

1772
02:10:36,425 --> 02:10:36,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1773
02:10:37,005 --> 02:10:37,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't buy it, by the way.

1774
02:10:38,286 --> 02:10:38,686
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1775
02:10:39,086 --> 02:10:41,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So Atari, of course, not doing that great.

1776
02:10:41,447 --> 02:10:45,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've heard that they were talking about declaring bankruptcy and stuff.

1777
02:10:45,408 --> 02:10:45,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did that.

1778
02:10:46,528 --> 02:10:47,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And the U.S.

1779
02:10:48,009 --> 02:10:54,631
[SPEAKER_06]: branch of Atari, they closed, I guess, $2 million in debtor in possession financing.

1780
02:10:55,571 --> 02:10:59,613
[SPEAKER_06]: and also I guess they're supposed to be expecting some other money coming in.

1781
02:11:00,034 --> 02:11:12,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now they're looking at restructuring and with that probably going to be selling off assets and properties including all your favorite Atari franchises.

1782
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:13,560
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1783
02:11:33,169 --> 02:11:34,050
[SPEAKER_04]: and do something with that.

1784
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Sword Quest?

1785
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:35,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1786
02:11:35,931 --> 02:11:55,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was an Atari 2600 series and it never finished but they were like doing like a real, the games were so hard, they were doing like a real contest to give away like these real swords and crowns and shit that were valued at all this money back in the 80s and I think Earth World, Fire World and Water World all came out but the last one, Air World, never did.

1787
02:11:55,504 --> 02:11:56,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.

1788
02:11:56,204 --> 02:12:02,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Water World was like right at the death stroke of Atari so I think it's like one of those like hard to find cartridges.

1789
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:07,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyway, sorry, I'm just thinking of all these obscure Atari franchises people ought to gobble up.

1790
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:09,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1791
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:11,363
[SPEAKER_04]: New Marvel Madness, please.

1792
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:13,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1793
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:14,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 720?

1794
02:12:17,473 --> 02:12:18,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1795
02:12:19,074 --> 02:12:24,660
[SPEAKER_04]: One place that would not be selling these Atari remake games if things keep going the way they're going is HMV.

1796
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:29,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a chain I've heard of, but I think these are big over in the UK, or at least bigger than they are here.

1797
02:12:29,044 --> 02:12:30,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're only in the UK.

1798
02:12:30,505 --> 02:12:30,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they?

1799
02:12:31,106 --> 02:12:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say I've heard the name before.

1800
02:12:34,289 --> 02:12:36,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe because they partner with somebody over here, I don't know.

1801
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:43,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, HMV, this does affect the UK mostly, which has had a lot of bad news when it comes to game retailers lately.

1802
02:12:44,073 --> 02:12:50,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Closing 66 of their 220 stores, which means 930 people out of a job as a result.

1803
02:12:50,716 --> 02:12:51,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Really a bummer.

1804
02:12:52,457 --> 02:12:54,738
[SPEAKER_04]: These stores closing in the next one or two months.

1805
02:12:55,539 --> 02:12:57,920
[SPEAKER_04]: A quote from Joint Administrator Nick Edwards.

1806
02:13:16,710 --> 02:13:17,210
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1807
02:13:35,399 --> 02:13:35,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1808
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:40,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Down to 500 and down to 500 in the UK too.

1809
02:13:41,067 --> 02:13:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine when we get to the point where GameStop will do that?

1810
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:45,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a lot of GameStops out there.

1811
02:13:45,413 --> 02:13:46,515
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already closing stores.

1812
02:13:46,555 --> 02:13:48,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some of them are already starting to close.

1813
02:13:49,379 --> 02:13:50,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting pretty crazy.

1814
02:13:51,341 --> 02:13:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, our thoughts to those that were impacted by jobs.

1815
02:13:54,383 --> 02:13:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully something, a similar retail operation will come to take their place, we will hope.

1816
02:14:00,767 --> 02:14:05,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on and get into some listener feedback in the form of emails.

1817
02:14:06,351 --> 02:14:07,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys email us.

1818
02:14:09,212 --> 02:14:19,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we sort through the spam and find the emails that were actually from legit listeners and we read some of our favorites here on the program.

1819
02:14:19,241 --> 02:14:21,402
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, pick some out and read them for us.

1820
02:14:21,943 --> 02:14:26,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well I will go with the oldest to newest because we got two weeks worth of emails.

1821
02:14:28,068 --> 02:14:33,192
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, well I didn't put a nickname on it so I'm just, oh no, it's HoneyBadger.

1822
02:14:33,893 --> 02:14:36,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys, this is HoneyBadger don't take shit from no one.

1823
02:14:36,826 --> 02:14:39,147
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Sam, aka Honey Badger on Steam.

1824
02:14:39,667 --> 02:14:42,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I am ecstatic to hear the positive views on PC gaming.

1825
02:14:43,248 --> 02:14:50,831
[SPEAKER_08]: The largest complaint and truth I hear from console gamers is instability with games on PC because it's up to the end user to set the graphics options.

1826
02:14:51,372 --> 02:14:56,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you go over the top with graphics levels your video card can't handle, you get instability.

1827
02:14:56,794 --> 02:15:05,257
[SPEAKER_08]: NVIDIA has looked into this and will be releasing a tool that analyzes your specs and has them set per game configuration that will give you the best performance and visual appeal.

1828
02:15:05,898 --> 02:15:10,933
[SPEAKER_08]: thanks for this show I hope to see you on Steam PS I want to add Rob and Loki on Steam if that's possible

1829
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:13,411
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Steam.

1830
02:15:13,591 --> 02:15:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add lots of people that listen to the show.

1831
02:15:15,631 --> 02:15:16,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, we're in there too.

1832
02:15:17,012 --> 02:15:18,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Just look on me and link from there.

1833
02:15:18,892 --> 02:15:19,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1834
02:15:19,493 --> 02:15:20,873
[SPEAKER_04]: OL Army, I think it's called.

1835
02:15:20,893 --> 02:15:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: There are Orange Lounge Radio fans.

1836
02:15:21,993 --> 02:15:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a VOG Network one.

1837
02:15:23,194 --> 02:15:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I really should be pimping that one because we want to, you know, all the VOGgy people.

1838
02:15:27,515 --> 02:15:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: But join them both.

1839
02:15:28,556 --> 02:15:29,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Our VOGgies.

1840
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1841
02:15:30,176 --> 02:15:32,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a name for the VOG listeners?

1842
02:15:32,317 --> 02:15:32,897
[SPEAKER_04]: VOGLets.

1843
02:15:33,377 --> 02:15:33,857
[SPEAKER_04]: VOGLets?

1844
02:15:34,177 --> 02:15:34,678
[SPEAKER_08]: VOGLets.

1845
02:15:34,998 --> 02:15:35,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Our little VOGLets.

1846
02:15:36,418 --> 02:15:37,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have a VOG house.

1847
02:15:39,299 --> 02:16:01,570
[SPEAKER_04]: but anyhow join those communities and yes Loki and I are in there and of course you know PC gaming it's a part of gaming and sometimes we I mean honestly I play games on my PC more than anything else because World of Warcraft is on PC and there's a lot of stuff you can't deny and especially is great on PC like Path of Exile I talked about earlier you're just not going to see that on consoles

1848
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:02,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Age 2

1849
02:16:13,237 --> 02:16:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe something like that doesn't already exist

1850
02:16:42,289 --> 02:16:44,852
[SPEAKER_04]: He explains it and I think, God, why isn't that already out there?

1851
02:16:44,872 --> 02:16:45,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea.

1852
02:16:45,794 --> 02:16:49,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know what we used to do to test our graphics capabilities?

1853
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:51,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to use the Final Fantasy XI graphics test.

1854
02:16:52,583 --> 02:16:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1855
02:16:53,769 --> 02:17:14,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and that was pretty cute and it was a neat way of Yeah, the benchmark thing The benchmark thing I like that thing a lot too We used to use that to test if we could handle certain games because basically if we could handle Final Fantasy XI we could handle anything else that came out around the same time Yeah, it would show you the frame rate once it ran the whole thing like how many frames were processed But now my graphics card will seriously handle anything Yeah, yeah So I haven't had a reason to check

1856
02:17:15,259 --> 02:17:17,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I should run the Final Fantasy XI benchmark just for lols.

1857
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it would be gorgeous with my current graphics card.

1858
02:17:20,401 --> 02:17:23,162
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only so much you can do with that thing, trust me.

1859
02:17:23,202 --> 02:17:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of am nostalgic now.

1860
02:17:27,523 --> 02:17:29,784
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 beta starting.

1861
02:17:30,004 --> 02:17:30,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need another game.

1862
02:17:31,084 --> 02:17:32,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually kind of considering dropping WoW.

1863
02:17:32,805 --> 02:17:34,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just wait for it to go free to play.

1864
02:17:34,485 --> 02:17:35,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about XIII, of course.

1865
02:17:35,986 --> 02:17:36,526
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean XI?

1866
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:37,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Or XI.

1867
02:17:39,327 --> 02:17:39,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1868
02:17:39,807 --> 02:17:40,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, OLR.

1869
02:17:41,047 --> 02:17:41,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey.

1870
02:17:42,048 --> 02:17:42,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey.

1871
02:17:43,308 --> 02:17:44,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey.

1872
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:44,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord.

1873
02:17:45,691 --> 02:17:48,914
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, allow me to elaborate on my Twitter post from last week.

1874
02:17:49,095 --> 02:17:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's fantastic.

1875
02:17:50,136 --> 02:17:51,457
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Rostel UT, by the way.

1876
02:17:52,078 --> 02:17:57,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's fantastic to see people giving deep silver shit over the Dead Island Riptide statue fiasco.

1877
02:17:57,404 --> 02:17:57,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that thing.

1878
02:17:58,245 --> 02:17:59,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have no idea what he's talking about, but okay.

1879
02:18:00,527 --> 02:18:05,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the horrible bust that was the woman all chopped up that they were selling?

1880
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:06,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that.

1881
02:18:07,712 --> 02:18:18,938
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's disheartening to see that in every comment section and seemingly every YouTube video gamers are giving shit to people who speak out against the promotion either brushing it aside as no big deal or making sexist remarks themselves.

1882
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:26,503
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the ESA loves to talk a great game about how many women play video games but given how uniform the audience reaction tends to be when things like this come up

1883
02:18:26,943 --> 02:18:27,003
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1884
02:18:27,023 --> 02:18:27,103
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1885
02:18:55,467 --> 02:19:23,978
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube commenting is not like a like Google is not trying to change the whole YouTube commenting thing to clear out the cesspool a little bit every time you log into YouTube don't you want to use your real name don't you want to change everything to your real name why aren't you using your real name like literally Google asked me today why aren't you using your real name it's like fuck off I don't want to use my real name and I'm not the problem because I don't comment on YouTubes but Yahoo Yahoo needs to do that too Yahoo comments

1886
02:19:24,958 --> 02:19:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1887
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:26,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1888
02:19:28,781 --> 02:19:32,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, go back to the comment.

1889
02:19:32,504 --> 02:19:40,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it really would matter how much of the market is female gaming because you still have most of the decisions being made by men.

1890
02:19:40,770 --> 02:19:41,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it.

1891
02:19:42,672 --> 02:19:46,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes into more of a sociopolitical realm than just...

1892
02:19:47,395 --> 02:19:48,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's playing the games?

1893
02:19:48,556 --> 02:19:52,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and yeah, I think it is actually still predominantly guys.

1894
02:19:52,901 --> 02:19:55,224
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have a much larger female gaming base now.

1895
02:19:56,145 --> 02:20:05,615
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's... And it's really hard to say because, again, like you were talking about, there's that anonymity, you know, that you can say it and get away with it.

1896
02:20:05,695 --> 02:20:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know...

1897
02:20:08,939 --> 02:20:13,422
[SPEAKER_08]: What if that was your mom you were gaming against and you, you know, were saying something?

1898
02:20:13,703 --> 02:20:18,346
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it was another fucking human being with feelings and, you know, thoughts and so forth?

1899
02:20:18,426 --> 02:20:24,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and the vile things people say on YouTube about, like, these teenage girls that do their vlogs.

1900
02:20:24,831 --> 02:20:26,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just being dumb teenage girls.

1901
02:20:26,932 --> 02:20:29,194
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all a dumb teenage girl at one point.

1902
02:20:30,035 --> 02:20:30,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we were.

1903
02:20:30,535 --> 02:20:31,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real, right?

1904
02:20:31,676 --> 02:20:31,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1905
02:20:31,916 --> 02:20:34,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, people are going like, you should just kill yourself.

1906
02:20:35,819 --> 02:20:37,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's several people who have.

1907
02:20:37,881 --> 02:20:38,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1908
02:20:39,130 --> 02:20:39,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1909
02:20:40,451 --> 02:20:40,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1910
02:20:41,412 --> 02:20:49,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on a psychological point of view, when you deal with people that young, well, basically you're dealing with people whose brains aren't going to be fully developed until they're 25.

1911
02:20:50,319 --> 02:20:51,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not a slight.

1912
02:20:51,259 --> 02:20:52,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That is just a reality.

1913
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:53,001
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fact.

1914
02:20:53,841 --> 02:20:55,943
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't believe me, look at National Geographic.

1915
02:20:55,963 --> 02:20:56,884
[SPEAKER_08]: They wrote a whole article on it.

1916
02:20:57,704 --> 02:21:02,488
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, you're dealing with people who are not fully developed.

1917
02:21:02,588 --> 02:21:06,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically that level of suggestibility.

1918
02:21:06,151 --> 02:21:07,773
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have a way of filtering anything out.

1919
02:21:07,993 --> 02:21:13,818
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all what's in front of you with no long-term consequence that's really pressing.

1920
02:21:14,979 --> 02:21:29,681
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you also think of it that way, your gamer base, if you're thinking as mostly teenage and that male demographic between teenage to 27, you're also dealing with a huge number of people whose brains are not fully developed.

1921
02:21:30,342 --> 02:21:30,822
[SPEAKER_08]: End of story.

1922
02:21:30,882 --> 02:21:31,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Brains are not fully developed.

1923
02:21:32,123 --> 02:21:33,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Those neural pathways are not all there.

1924
02:21:34,283 --> 02:21:41,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as an adult, yeah, I can sit and tell myself, okay, well, they're not using all of their potential.

1925
02:21:41,226 --> 02:21:42,346
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no faculties yet.

1926
02:21:43,006 --> 02:21:45,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You can stop and tell yourself, yeah, these people are just trolls.

1927
02:21:45,807 --> 02:21:46,587
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know any better.

1928
02:21:48,588 --> 02:21:49,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they don't care.

1929
02:21:49,389 --> 02:21:52,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But they need to get the shit scared out of them.

1930
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:52,652
[SPEAKER_08]: But they do.

1931
02:21:52,712 --> 02:21:53,493
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the thing.

1932
02:21:54,774 --> 02:22:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I would like to see is that if you have a warning button that instantly turns on whatever camera is connected so you can see their face.

1933
02:22:03,539 --> 02:22:03,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1934
02:22:04,519 --> 02:22:08,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or... Cameras turning on randomly.

1935
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: That's big brother talk.

1936
02:22:10,461 --> 02:22:11,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not realistic.

1937
02:22:11,281 --> 02:22:23,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but I mean, there should be... When you're dealing with the type of brain activity that deals only with immediacy and not long-term consequence, you need to make an immediate consequence.

1938
02:22:24,493 --> 02:22:38,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to go on a tangent, but you got those people that were on Twitter and these stupid kids that when Obama got re-elected, there were all these people making tweets that were like, I can't believe that N-word got re-elected and saying just idiotic shit on their Twitter, right?

1939
02:22:38,978 --> 02:22:42,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what happens, these websites go out and just basically dox them.

1940
02:22:43,339 --> 02:22:48,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it's this guy that goes to this high school and he's on this scholarship for the college and these kids are like...

1941
02:22:49,201 --> 02:23:08,523
[SPEAKER_04]: These kids are losing their scholarships over it and I'm not saying like maybe they shouldn't but it's kind of like they're dumbass kids and the dumbass kids don't need to have their lives ruined necessarily but they need that reality check and the parents could really use the smack on the head too because they didn't just learn it watching the TV's.

1942
02:23:08,976 --> 02:23:26,663
[SPEAKER_08]: well honestly though that's a reflection of the caliber of person that these schools are getting and a school has a reputation to maintain too if it's going to come out you know that they're admitting somebody with that particular view set to their school and their school does not share that view set they have the right to deny them

1943
02:23:28,368 --> 02:23:32,513
[SPEAKER_04]: RDG Singe in the chat saying, I know a few adults whose lobes never fully developed.

1944
02:23:32,594 --> 02:23:34,737
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT pointing out it's not all kids either.

1945
02:23:34,817 --> 02:23:35,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't that the truth?

1946
02:23:35,638 --> 02:23:36,078
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1947
02:23:36,098 --> 02:23:38,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're talking a lot about teenagers and so forth.

1948
02:23:38,141 --> 02:23:42,728
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if a 30-year-old guy is sitting there trolling Twitter with all this stuff, then you know what?

1949
02:23:42,768 --> 02:23:44,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little harder to feel sorry for somebody.

1950
02:23:45,191 --> 02:23:47,272
[SPEAKER_04]: whose brain is fully developed and should know better.

1951
02:23:47,372 --> 02:23:52,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, I mean, you're also dealing with the fact that we are a society of instant gratification.

1952
02:23:52,555 --> 02:23:58,038
[SPEAKER_08]: We're, especially now with the anonymity, the nastiest side of people are becoming public.

1953
02:23:58,838 --> 02:23:59,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1954
02:23:59,419 --> 02:24:03,201
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're going to be, you know, think that their anonymity can hide them, let them be exposed.

1955
02:24:03,621 --> 02:24:04,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I have zero problem with that.

1956
02:24:04,802 --> 02:24:05,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Let their boss find out.

1957
02:24:07,045 --> 02:24:08,106
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1958
02:24:29,739 --> 02:24:59,041
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody has that but I mean in the end you want to think about how you're reflecting on yourself you know I try yeah I get a little bit bitchier than normal on the show because it's sometimes funny but at the same time this is me this is who I am I try not to portray myself in any other way than the person that I am and so on the same token that's all we can ever consider these people that we're interacting with through a video game this is who this person is oh my god who talks like this I don't want to be around this person anymore and

1959
02:24:59,301 --> 02:25:00,061
[SPEAKER_08]: How do they have friends?

1960
02:25:01,002 --> 02:25:03,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Technist in our chat room, and I think we'll move on after this comment.

1961
02:25:03,764 --> 02:25:07,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people forget that there is no such thing as true anonymity on the internet.

1962
02:25:08,046 --> 02:25:08,546
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

1963
02:25:08,566 --> 02:25:09,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

1964
02:25:10,487 --> 02:25:11,388
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the rest of the email.

1965
02:25:12,228 --> 02:25:19,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I know logically that I shouldn't be basing an entire group of people on the internet, but that's just exhausting when it's all you see from gamers 90% of the time.

1966
02:25:20,293 --> 02:25:21,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Regards, Ross Steele, UT.

1967
02:25:22,014 --> 02:25:23,415
[SPEAKER_04]: GamersHateEverything.com

1968
02:25:23,956 --> 02:25:26,919
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, do you have problems with your balls?

1969
02:25:47,319 --> 02:25:47,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me finish.

1970
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:51,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to clarify, of course the ball doesn't ricochet directly from the slot machine into the bumper.

1971
02:25:52,002 --> 02:25:54,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It is hit by the right flipper first, then hits the bumper and drains.

1972
02:25:54,504 --> 02:25:56,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Timing on the flipper is a major factor as well.

1973
02:25:56,865 --> 02:26:04,290
[SPEAKER_08]: To be perfectly honest, I haven't actually touched my Twilight Zone machine except to take a picture of my cat on it in probably six months, so I probably can't answer that question.

1974
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:09,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I can say that there are lots of cheap maneuvers, but keep in mind these were meant to make money.

1975
02:26:11,314 --> 02:26:12,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1976
02:26:31,889 --> 02:26:32,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for Mailbags?

1977
02:26:32,749 --> 02:26:33,050
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1978
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:36,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to email us in the future.

1979
02:26:36,711 --> 02:26:40,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, one more time, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Please do email us.

1980
02:26:40,793 --> 02:26:43,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a lot of lovely emails and we would love a few more.

1981
02:26:43,194 --> 02:26:45,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1982
02:26:46,255 --> 02:26:47,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to actually read something from Becky.

1983
02:26:48,116 --> 02:26:48,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1984
02:26:48,517 --> 02:26:49,337
[SPEAKER_08]: That Julian said.

1985
02:26:49,958 --> 02:26:50,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1986
02:26:50,498 --> 02:26:53,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so she's playing the first Mass Effect again.

1987
02:26:53,921 --> 02:26:55,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And Julian is her six-year-old?

1988
02:26:55,482 --> 02:26:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Her five-year-old.

1989
02:26:55,922 --> 02:26:56,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Five-year-old.

1990
02:26:56,322 --> 02:26:57,643
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to be six, though, in a couple months.

1991
02:26:57,963 --> 02:26:58,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Close enough.

1992
02:26:58,224 --> 02:26:58,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Right after my birthday.

1993
02:26:58,984 --> 02:26:59,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I was close.

1994
02:26:59,464 --> 02:26:59,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I rounded.

1995
02:27:00,125 --> 02:27:00,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1996
02:27:01,606 --> 02:27:04,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The line from Joker, I want to be there when you make that son of a bitch pay.

1997
02:27:04,508 --> 02:27:06,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And Julian says, you're not going to make him pay.

1998
02:27:06,069 --> 02:27:06,930
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to make him die.

1999
02:27:09,892 --> 02:27:11,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So I felt that needed to be shared.

2000
02:27:13,763 --> 02:27:19,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with a few more news stories before we get to... Oh, I'm sorry, we've got FUs of the Week to do.

2001
02:27:20,186 --> 02:27:21,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost overlooked the FUs of the Week.

2002
02:27:21,707 --> 02:27:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to myself for damn near overlooking the FUs of the Week.

2003
02:27:25,029 --> 02:27:27,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the part of the show every week where we get angsty.

2004
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:27,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2005
02:27:27,710 --> 02:27:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, cuz.

2006
02:27:45,838 --> 02:27:54,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, first off, um, F you to people who don't understand what following distance is, and try to get all up in yours and then change lanes into your following space.

2007
02:27:56,041 --> 02:28:07,985
[SPEAKER_08]: In California, we have what's called the three-second rule, where we pick a landmark when the car in front of you, when the tail of your car passes it, you count three seconds until you hit that same part with the front of your car, and that's following distance.

2008
02:28:08,325 --> 02:28:10,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in Alabama, it's two seconds, but whatever.

2009
02:28:11,105 --> 02:28:12,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just because Alabama's fucking...

2010
02:28:13,326 --> 02:28:13,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say it.

2011
02:28:13,926 --> 02:28:15,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say Alabama's backwards.

2012
02:28:15,187 --> 02:28:15,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm from there.

2013
02:28:15,947 --> 02:28:16,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I escaped.

2014
02:28:18,188 --> 02:28:21,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, F you to there being ads now on the AIM app on my iPad.

2015
02:28:22,990 --> 02:28:29,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to the winners slash losers of Canada's Worst Driver.

2016
02:28:29,952 --> 02:28:32,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they were both really awful.

2017
02:28:32,173 --> 02:28:34,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, these people are hazards on the road.

2018
02:28:34,034 --> 02:28:34,694
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to kill people.

2019
02:28:35,094 --> 02:28:37,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally, they are that stupid.

2020
02:28:37,935 --> 02:28:44,917
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are a bad driver, if everyone around you tells you you're a bad driver, and no amount of practice is helping you, stop fucking driving!

2021
02:28:45,657 --> 02:28:46,217
[SPEAKER_08]: End of story.

2022
02:28:46,537 --> 02:28:48,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That goes to everybody in the world who's a bad driver.

2023
02:28:49,498 --> 02:28:50,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, I'm a great driver.

2024
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:58,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a thank you to my husband, who greeted me the other night with a three terabyte hard drive.

2025
02:28:59,101 --> 02:28:59,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

2026
02:29:00,721 --> 02:29:01,461
[SPEAKER_06]: You're spoiled.

2027
02:29:01,882 --> 02:29:02,742
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I love him.

2028
02:29:04,011 --> 02:29:04,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

2029
02:29:05,752 --> 02:29:14,615
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the lingering part of the stomach bug here that I have, which is making me feel extremely bloated, like I'm full of just like... Pizza?

2030
02:29:15,195 --> 02:29:16,695
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't even have that much pizza.

2031
02:29:16,715 --> 02:29:19,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I only had like two slices of pizza.

2032
02:29:19,376 --> 02:29:20,036
[SPEAKER_08]: You're full of bloat?

2033
02:29:20,697 --> 02:29:26,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so basically, I mean, it's gonna obviously cause me to lose weight, I guess, which is good, but it's still very uncomfortable.

2034
02:29:27,199 --> 02:29:28,759
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it's all water while you're sick.

2035
02:29:28,999 --> 02:29:30,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you start eating, you'll retain again.

2036
02:29:32,834 --> 02:29:33,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

2037
02:29:34,114 --> 02:29:38,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure I'm super vague in how I put this.

2038
02:29:40,236 --> 02:29:58,382
[SPEAKER_04]: In response to some things I've seen on Twitter, I just want to say an F you to somebody who tries to call out someone else's faults on things that happened in the past when that person themselves have lots of faults in their past that they have not apologized for and maybe ought to.

2039
02:29:59,582 --> 02:30:00,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

2040
02:30:02,796 --> 02:30:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I got to say about that.

2041
02:30:19,582 --> 02:30:24,967
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we don't need those Wii U's, you know, because we've got other things to keep us occupied.

2042
02:30:24,987 --> 02:30:39,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you think you guys are all fancy with your Miiverse channels and stuff like that, but hey, there's Xbox Verse in Japan, and Xbox Verse, I guess it's Hakuverse, and...

2043
02:30:41,212 --> 02:30:49,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, like all things on the internet that are somewhat unregulated, it is full of penises.

2044
02:30:50,023 --> 02:30:52,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Penis art, penis art, penis art.

2045
02:30:52,746 --> 02:30:53,588
[SPEAKER_06]: TTP.

2046
02:30:54,669 --> 02:30:56,231
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of cock on your desktop there.

2047
02:30:57,398 --> 02:30:58,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2048
02:30:58,658 --> 02:30:59,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, Chris Cock.

2049
02:31:00,039 --> 02:31:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's... Yes.

2050
02:31:04,199 --> 02:31:06,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

2051
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:10,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, it's out there, so that's kind of neat, I guess.

2052
02:31:11,581 --> 02:31:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they've got exactly the website here.

2053
02:31:15,182 --> 02:31:15,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2054
02:31:15,642 --> 02:31:26,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at xbox.verse.jp is where you can check it out, and I'm not sure how you can actually go about posting on there and stuff, but...

2055
02:31:28,903 --> 02:31:29,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox.verse.jp

2056
02:31:49,064 --> 02:31:57,648
[SPEAKER_04]: There was that whole little story about the particular game too that was causing excessive TP.

2057
02:31:57,728 --> 02:32:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just surprised there's that big of a community around an Xbox in Japan.

2058
02:32:02,411 --> 02:32:10,796
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you hear things online, you would think that there was no fans of Xbox in Japan whatsoever, but I guess it's not doing as terrible as you might think.

2059
02:32:12,057 --> 02:32:17,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of penis, I mean, you know, why not another story that has to do with this?

2060
02:32:17,683 --> 02:32:25,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And Custom Made 3D is an upcoming erotic game that's coming out with a very special attachment.

2061
02:32:25,573 --> 02:32:27,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's called... Sorry.

2062
02:32:27,895 --> 02:32:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2063
02:32:28,496 --> 02:32:30,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Juicy Air.

2064
02:32:30,697 --> 02:32:31,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this trolling?

2065
02:32:31,737 --> 02:32:32,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this story for real?

2066
02:32:33,138 --> 02:32:34,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this for real or am I being trolled?

2067
02:32:34,578 --> 02:32:35,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's for real.

2068
02:32:35,118 --> 02:32:36,199
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an actual website.

2069
02:32:36,299 --> 02:32:36,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

2070
02:32:36,959 --> 02:32:37,359
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2071
02:32:37,399 --> 02:32:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a cup?

2072
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:39,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the website.

2073
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:40,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

2074
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cup.

2075
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:51,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a wireless masturbation toy that reacts in real time to your stroke speed and depth, making this motion control, you know what?

2076
02:32:51,684 --> 02:32:55,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So just pull a sausage out of the fridge and go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2077
02:32:55,507 --> 02:33:00,231
[SPEAKER_04]: In-game characters react accordingly too with different characters reacting differently.

2078
02:33:00,712 --> 02:33:05,956
[SPEAKER_04]: This peripheral has an analog stick and an action button as well as a right and left click.

2079
02:33:06,376 --> 02:33:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly the term clicking your mouse has a whole new meaning.

2080
02:33:11,501 --> 02:33:14,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even have to take your hands off your wiener while you're playing.

2081
02:33:15,484 --> 02:33:15,984
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2082
02:33:18,286 --> 02:33:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: This story has been met with the response of dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot in chat room.

2083
02:33:25,709 --> 02:33:29,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Rdgsinge in our chat room says, are there any special plans for episode 500?

2084
02:33:29,872 --> 02:33:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Own a cup.

2085
02:33:31,372 --> 02:33:34,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, after this story, there are now.

2086
02:33:35,234 --> 02:33:36,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be staying home.

2087
02:33:39,356 --> 02:33:41,778
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our full video review of Custom Aid 3D.

2088
02:33:44,545 --> 02:33:50,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if there's going to be one of those on... Oh, God.

2089
02:33:50,969 --> 02:33:51,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2090
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:53,070
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2091
02:33:53,571 --> 02:33:55,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Guru, talk about playing with your Wii.

2092
02:33:56,627 --> 02:33:57,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's pictures of it.

2093
02:33:57,848 --> 02:33:58,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up yourself.

2094
02:33:59,009 --> 02:34:00,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We Jokes are seven years old.

2095
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:01,391
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

2096
02:34:01,451 --> 02:34:01,711
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2097
02:34:02,472 --> 02:34:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2098
02:34:03,112 --> 02:34:06,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Just look up what an Ona Cup is and you'll see what it looks like.

2099
02:34:06,074 --> 02:34:08,276
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2100
02:34:08,336 --> 02:34:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely you want to follow that story on our Skype line.

2101
02:34:11,679 --> 02:34:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Penis!

[SPEAKER_04]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2104
02:34:18,604 --> 02:34:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

2105
02:34:21,030 --> 02:34:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteel UT in chat says, as long as we don't have to see the cup being used.

2106
02:34:24,393 --> 02:34:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It could just be above the waist shots, that's all.

2107
02:34:31,558 --> 02:34:34,660
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2108
02:34:34,741 --> 02:34:39,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we wait for some calls, there's always last minute stories and Twitter topics.

2109
02:34:41,406 --> 02:34:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last minute stories, Loki?

2110
02:34:42,506 --> 02:34:44,708
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2111
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:47,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2112
02:34:47,779 --> 02:34:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have anything.

2113
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:51,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at... So much for that.

2114
02:34:52,203 --> 02:34:53,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to look and see.

2115
02:34:53,484 --> 02:34:55,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I had something, but it wasn't very important.

2116
02:34:56,166 --> 02:34:57,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2117
02:34:58,628 --> 02:35:00,130
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of just a random tangent here.

2118
02:35:00,510 --> 02:35:04,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The phone's blowing up, so write down your thought and we'll come back to it later because I want to get to the phone calls.

2119
02:35:04,634 --> 02:35:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2120
02:35:05,614 --> 02:35:06,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2121
02:35:06,715 --> 02:35:07,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

2122
02:35:07,716 --> 02:35:08,717
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a blast from the past.

2123
02:35:08,757 --> 02:35:09,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven's Dolphin.

2124
02:35:09,518 --> 02:35:11,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy fucking shit.

2125
02:35:11,199 --> 02:35:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Raven's Dolphin.

2126
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:13,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

2127
02:35:13,401 --> 02:35:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I love...

2128
02:35:14,562 --> 02:35:15,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You live, beware.

2129
02:35:16,343 --> 02:35:16,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I live.

2130
02:35:17,363 --> 02:35:18,384
[SPEAKER_04]: What a blast from the past.

2131
02:35:18,404 --> 02:35:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is from your grave?

2132
02:35:20,865 --> 02:35:22,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I have risen from my grave.

2133
02:35:22,205 --> 02:35:25,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I escaped from the mental institution to call you guys.

2134
02:35:25,447 --> 02:35:26,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell have you been?

2135
02:35:27,248 --> 02:35:28,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around.

2136
02:35:30,189 --> 02:35:32,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still doing your tech and games thing?

2137
02:35:32,270 --> 02:35:33,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

2138
02:35:33,370 --> 02:35:34,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?

2139
02:35:34,051 --> 02:35:35,851
[SPEAKER_00]: We're celebrating six years this month.

2140
02:35:36,251 --> 02:35:39,653
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually became very successful and I want to thank you guys for giving me inspiration.

2141
02:35:39,873 --> 02:35:45,615
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, it cracked me up, because I would see that all around the internet, the Tekken games thing, and I'm like, wow, that shit really blew up, didn't it?

2142
02:35:45,655 --> 02:35:47,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, good for him, good for you, good for you.

2143
02:35:47,576 --> 02:35:49,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it worked out very well.

2144
02:35:49,336 --> 02:35:52,418
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to Comic-Con, we went to Otakon, we did some things.

2145
02:35:53,178 --> 02:35:54,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get blessed by the E3 Pope yet?

2146
02:35:55,559 --> 02:35:57,619
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we did not, but I'm not worried.

2147
02:35:57,939 --> 02:35:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon, you'll get there, buddy, you'll get there.

2148
02:36:00,679 --> 02:36:01,240
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.

2149
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:01,740
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.

2150
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: But I came to call you not to talk about me.

2151
02:36:04,703 --> 02:36:05,864
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's you guys.

2152
02:36:06,224 --> 02:36:09,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys were talking about the Pokemon thing about gotta catch them all.

2153
02:36:09,687 --> 02:36:09,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2154
02:36:10,888 --> 02:36:13,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the Wii U has built-in RFID chips.

2155
02:36:13,830 --> 02:36:14,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure does.

2156
02:36:14,191 --> 02:36:15,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could really easily do it.

2157
02:36:15,912 --> 02:36:16,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

2158
02:36:16,373 --> 02:36:17,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they could.

2159
02:36:18,114 --> 02:36:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't they at one point you were supposed to be able to tap your credit card on that?

2160
02:36:21,097 --> 02:36:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2161
02:36:21,457 --> 02:36:22,077
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's the thing.

2162
02:36:22,157 --> 02:36:23,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of the stories that we didn't talk about.

2163
02:36:23,859 --> 02:36:25,180
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working on that still.

2164
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:28,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even coming out until, like, fall.

2165
02:36:28,883 --> 02:36:31,385
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, way to implement all your technology.

2166
02:36:31,565 --> 02:36:38,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but remember way back when I first talked about the Wii U and how it's like the Winchester Mystery House where you'll find all these doors that go nowhere and shit that's not finished built yet?

2167
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:43,053
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Wii U. So that part is currently still under construction.

2168
02:36:43,233 --> 02:36:44,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sort of stuck in the seance room.

2169
02:36:45,355 --> 02:36:45,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

2170
02:36:46,476 --> 02:36:48,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ubisoft just locked another door.

2171
02:36:48,597 --> 02:36:49,117
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

2172
02:36:49,238 --> 02:36:49,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure did.

2173
02:36:51,179 --> 02:36:52,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure did.

2174
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:52,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

2175
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead.

2176
02:36:53,661 --> 02:36:54,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one more thing.

2177
02:36:54,681 --> 02:36:55,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep this short.

2178
02:36:55,922 --> 02:36:57,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the Rayman Legend thing.

2179
02:36:57,343 --> 02:36:57,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

2180
02:36:58,832 --> 02:37:01,613
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, it was bad PR from Ubisoft.

2181
02:37:01,633 --> 02:37:04,794
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have just said it was coming out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox.

2182
02:37:05,034 --> 02:37:08,115
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have just said, oh, it's an exclusive and then yanked the thing out.

2183
02:37:08,535 --> 02:37:10,716
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say I understand why they did it.

2184
02:37:11,717 --> 02:37:15,038
[SPEAKER_00]: But I felt like they should have played that way better than they did.

2185
02:37:16,098 --> 02:37:17,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a Wii U owner by chance?

2186
02:37:18,099 --> 02:37:19,199
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a Wii U owner.

2187
02:37:19,319 --> 02:37:20,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I own a PlayStation.

2188
02:37:20,159 --> 02:37:20,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I own everything.

2189
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:22,560
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm on Steam now.

2190
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:24,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought Mass Effect, so I will be playing it.

2191
02:37:25,009 --> 02:37:26,691
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to be listening to this show, I better be playing it.

2192
02:37:27,172 --> 02:37:28,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we've raised you well.

2193
02:37:28,894 --> 02:37:31,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know you were a lot younger when you first started listening to OLR.

2194
02:37:31,858 --> 02:37:32,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so proud.

2195
02:37:32,339 --> 02:37:33,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You are making us proud.

2196
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:34,241
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to play multiplayer.

2197
02:37:34,561 --> 02:37:36,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, are you playing Mass Effect on PC?

2198
02:37:37,450 --> 02:37:38,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got one and two.

2199
02:37:38,371 --> 02:37:41,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it during the Steam sale, so I didn't play a lot of it yet.

2200
02:37:41,654 --> 02:37:43,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I will play it, DarkSakura.

2201
02:37:43,596 --> 02:37:43,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't kill me.

2202
02:37:43,976 --> 02:37:44,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.

2203
02:37:44,577 --> 02:37:44,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I own it.

2204
02:37:45,217 --> 02:37:45,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buy it.

2205
02:37:46,018 --> 02:37:48,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know when you get to three so we can play multiplayer together.

2206
02:37:49,902 --> 02:37:51,964
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing better than Bobby Blackwolf in that regard.

2207
02:37:52,004 --> 02:37:54,846
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to know.

2208
02:37:55,167 --> 02:37:55,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

2209
02:37:56,348 --> 02:37:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2210
02:37:56,808 --> 02:37:57,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else to say.

2211
02:37:57,589 --> 02:37:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, you're a Wii U owner.

2212
02:37:58,890 --> 02:38:00,351
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of the Wii U?

2213
02:38:00,431 --> 02:38:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling about your purchase?

2214
02:38:01,673 --> 02:38:01,773
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2215
02:38:02,353 --> 02:38:05,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, my mom bought it, and I like the thing itself.

2216
02:38:06,495 --> 02:38:09,676
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me, I think my favorite feature is, it's remote.

2217
02:38:11,117 --> 02:38:14,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that TV thing, did you check it out during the Super Bowl?

2218
02:38:15,219 --> 02:38:15,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

2219
02:38:16,239 --> 02:38:22,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked it out when the Broncos were playing, and when they scored that touchdown, and then they lost, and I'm like, I'm done with this.

2220
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:30,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I was waiting for the Beyonce concert last weekend while I was sick, and I had the TV thing going on, and I was like, oh, these guys are throwing a football around before the Beyonce concert.

2221
02:38:31,113 --> 02:38:31,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check this out.

2222
02:38:32,154 --> 02:38:37,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually kind of fun to look at the feedback people were giving on me.

2223
02:38:37,436 --> 02:38:51,401
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it was just dumb internet shit, but it was kind of neat to have that right in front of me as I'm watching this game on the TV, which, believe it or not, there were some pretty lousy things that happened in the game that even I was like, wow, the 49ers are getting their ass kicked.

2224
02:38:51,661 --> 02:38:52,702
[SPEAKER_04]: in the first half of this game

2225
02:39:11,796 --> 02:39:39,669
[SPEAKER_04]: but my favorite meme that's come out of the whole thing is Tard, Tartar Sauce the grumpy cat saying blackout and then Tartar Sauce holding the plug or the Bane references were all over Twitter of course and that happened but my favorite gif I saw was the one where all the lights go out to bring this call full circle Raven's Dolphin when all the lights go out and then you see the stadium above and it goes out and then Team Rocket shows up that cracked me up that was great that was the winner

2226
02:39:40,123 --> 02:39:42,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, that was my favorite part of the whole Super Bowl.

2227
02:39:42,765 --> 02:39:44,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people staring at the screen, what are we doing?

2228
02:39:44,886 --> 02:39:47,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the beats after it were like, thank you, internet.

2229
02:39:47,268 --> 02:39:48,469
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you're awesome.

2230
02:39:48,709 --> 02:39:50,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this Beyonce's fault?

2231
02:39:50,450 --> 02:39:53,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Beyonce's performance so fierce that she blew the fucking power?

2232
02:39:53,832 --> 02:39:54,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that was my favorite.

2233
02:39:55,053 --> 02:39:55,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite.

2234
02:39:56,394 --> 02:39:57,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good, too.

2235
02:39:57,635 --> 02:39:59,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw her at the inauguration.

2236
02:39:59,376 --> 02:40:00,457
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't blow out anyone.

2237
02:40:00,957 --> 02:40:01,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2238
02:40:01,457 --> 02:40:03,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Raven's Dolphin, please, pimp your shit.

2239
02:40:04,079 --> 02:40:05,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's six years, you've earned it.

2240
02:40:06,741 --> 02:40:08,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Six years, thanks to you guys.

2241
02:40:08,602 --> 02:40:09,943
[SPEAKER_00]: The website's called

2242
02:40:10,253 --> 02:40:24,431
[SPEAKER_00]: techandgames.com it lives quite well with 833 fans on Facebook doesn't matter that's someone else's stuff I'm not like I didn't create that but you voted each and every one of them so you go boy

2243
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:27,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you, Rob, for the time, and I know you have other calls.

2244
02:40:28,101 --> 02:40:28,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime.

2245
02:40:28,721 --> 02:40:29,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2246
02:40:29,382 --> 02:40:29,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear from you.

2247
02:40:29,902 --> 02:40:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, bye.

2248
02:40:30,182 --> 02:40:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a stranger.

2249
02:40:30,942 --> 02:40:33,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2250
02:40:33,483 --> 02:40:36,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, 1877 GameOLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLaundry.

2251
02:40:36,104 --> 02:40:40,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to cut you off earlier, but when I saw that one popping up, I was like, blast from the past, holla.

2252
02:40:40,426 --> 02:40:42,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what I was talking about now.

2253
02:40:43,687 --> 02:40:44,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that how it goes?

2254
02:40:46,909 --> 02:40:53,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Tiger Claw giving us a gif here in the chat room and I just want to make sure that... Oh, god damn it.

2255
02:40:54,113 --> 02:40:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great live radio.

2256
02:40:55,353 --> 02:41:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure this is the right one because if it is, I insist that Ranma, our Tumblr administrator... What is the Tumblr?

2257
02:41:01,076 --> 02:41:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Orange Lounge Radio?

2258
02:41:02,057 --> 02:41:06,459
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.Tumblr.com I insist that this go on the Orange Lounge Radio Tumblr.

2259
02:41:06,779 --> 02:41:07,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is it.

2260
02:41:07,479 --> 02:41:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2261
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

2262
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:09,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Please repost that.

2263
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:09,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

2264
02:41:11,021 --> 02:41:12,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I insist that that be reposted.

2265
02:41:14,999 --> 02:41:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877 GameOLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2266
02:41:21,845 --> 02:41:23,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones and take another call.

2267
02:41:23,366 --> 02:41:24,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2268
02:41:24,367 --> 02:41:24,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2269
02:41:25,368 --> 02:41:26,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Ragenator.

2270
02:41:26,709 --> 02:41:28,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ragenator in video.

2271
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:29,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you.

2272
02:41:30,252 --> 02:41:30,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Peekaroo.

2273
02:41:31,413 --> 02:41:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

2274
02:41:33,735 --> 02:41:37,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would have talked about this last week if there was a show last week.

2275
02:41:38,659 --> 02:41:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, rub it in.

2276
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sick.

2277
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:41,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub it in.

2278
02:41:41,681 --> 02:41:43,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to rub anything in, but

2279
02:41:44,589 --> 02:41:53,854
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the, since you kind of briefly talked about the topic in today's show, I have a somewhat related question.

2280
02:41:54,575 --> 02:42:01,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with all this talk about the Xbox 720, assuming that's what the final name is going to be called.

2281
02:42:01,178 --> 02:42:03,039
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lube is the name of the week.

2282
02:42:03,099 --> 02:42:04,200
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Lube.

2283
02:42:05,641 --> 02:42:07,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the PlayStation 4.

2284
02:42:07,742 --> 02:42:11,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of begs the question, at this point, do we really need

2285
02:42:12,142 --> 02:42:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: a new system from either Microsoft or the PlayStation 3 or from Sony.

2286
02:42:17,263 --> 02:42:18,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about it.

2287
02:42:18,903 --> 02:42:22,164
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 is, at this point, is really hitting stride.

2288
02:42:23,224 --> 02:42:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And from my viewpoint, Microsoft still has a lot of life left with the 360.

2289
02:42:29,685 --> 02:42:37,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't see them really improving graphics all that much with the next systems.

2290
02:42:39,357 --> 02:42:41,942
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a lot of great games coming out.

2291
02:42:43,926 --> 02:42:49,898
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can possibly see is doing like a 4K resolution or 8K, but

2292
02:42:50,936 --> 02:42:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: But nobody's, you can't, look at how well that went for 3D on the PlayStation 3.

2293
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Even that really hasn't cracked yet.

2294
02:42:58,181 --> 02:43:06,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all assume PlayStation 4 is going to do this 4K, super high HD thing because Sony makes TVs and they want to sell a few of those too.

2295
02:43:07,207 --> 02:43:11,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, I want to go back to the question you were really asking and ask the panel here.

2296
02:43:11,750 --> 02:43:17,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great question because we've kind of answered this before a little bit but not since some of this news came up.

2297
02:43:17,654 --> 02:43:19,755
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 4 and Xbox Lube.

2298
02:43:20,095 --> 02:43:20,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we really need it?

2299
02:43:21,316 --> 02:43:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming this year.

2300
02:43:22,857 --> 02:43:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it necessary?

2301
02:43:23,737 --> 02:43:24,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the industry need it?

2302
02:43:25,058 --> 02:43:27,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you sell games for a living.

2303
02:43:27,459 --> 02:43:28,019
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

2304
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:31,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these systems needed right now?

2305
02:43:31,541 --> 02:43:37,984
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I don't think Nintendo... See, I'm surprised that they're not waiting to put these systems out because the Wii U...

2306
02:43:39,045 --> 02:43:39,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Vita

2307
02:44:01,902 --> 02:44:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what they were trying to beat.

2308
02:44:04,323 --> 02:44:07,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The price point's too high, and it's just, there's not any games coming out.

2309
02:44:08,105 --> 02:44:21,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of, like, you know, part of the reason I said, and I said this at the end of last year, we're making predictions for this year, and I originally predicted we wouldn't have the PlayStation 4, and my reason essentially was, we don't need one, and Sony has the Vita to work on still and so forth.

2310
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:25,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, my opinion really hasn't changed, Ragenator.

2311
02:44:25,512 --> 02:44:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we

2312
02:44:26,732 --> 02:44:31,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that it's necessary at all, not yet anyway I think that they should be pushing any type of release until far later

2313
02:44:49,935 --> 02:44:50,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we don't need it.

2314
02:44:51,076 --> 02:44:54,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a system that... I understand the investor pressure, though.

2315
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:54,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2316
02:44:55,260 --> 02:45:03,809
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, you know, I think that they need to keep working on strengthening what they have using the existing technology and then bringing out something really mind-blowing.

2317
02:45:04,289 --> 02:45:07,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator, go ahead and get your thought out now that the call's back and then we can move on.

2318
02:45:08,333 --> 02:45:08,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2319
02:45:08,753 --> 02:45:14,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, you know, at least with the higher resolution TVs out there and possible...

2320
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:21,321
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, using PS4 and Xbox 360 and 720 to work with those.

2321
02:45:21,922 --> 02:45:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble is, the adoption rate with the higher resolution TVs is pretty low, and from my perspective, the one problem with the adoption of those high resolution TVs is that

2322
02:45:36,929 --> 02:45:42,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really a whole lot of content, if any, for those higher resolution TVs.

2323
02:45:42,432 --> 02:46:05,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if broadcast TV and cable companies were to really go balls to the wall and support that stuff, plus now you have higher resolution videos, like, you know, whatever next-gen Blu-ray comes out or whatever, if that supports the high resolution, plus the games, then I can see...

2324
02:46:06,337 --> 02:46:17,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Something new coming out or something that we can't even think of right off the bat that next system could potentially do that current systems can't do.

2325
02:46:17,847 --> 02:46:23,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's a good point because high definition in itself took a long time for us to really adopt.

2326
02:46:24,133 --> 02:46:27,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still not a big adoption rate because look at Blu-ray.

2327
02:46:27,374 --> 02:46:30,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Blu-ray, people aren't replacing their DVD collections with Blu-ray.

2328
02:46:30,416 --> 02:46:33,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at least high-def TVs right now are pretty much all you can buy.

2329
02:46:33,837 --> 02:46:35,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even really buy standard def.

2330
02:46:35,578 --> 02:46:42,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can secondhand, of course, but you can't even really walk into a Best Buy and find a standard def TV maybe way in the back or something.

2331
02:46:42,701 --> 02:46:44,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's all about HDTV.

2332
02:46:44,682 --> 02:46:50,924
[SPEAKER_04]: At least now that's finally catching on where it's really the mainstream, but that took like 10 years to get there, a very long time.

2333
02:46:51,244 --> 02:46:52,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the middle of that,

2334
02:46:52,745 --> 02:46:57,268
[SPEAKER_04]: was the 360 and the PlayStation 3, which was like our first HD gaming.

2335
02:46:57,649 --> 02:47:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe the 4K thing is a preemptive strike.

2336
02:47:00,651 --> 02:47:01,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

2337
02:47:01,952 --> 02:47:02,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be way too early.

2338
02:47:03,193 --> 02:47:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Ragenator, gotta let you go to get more calls.

2339
02:47:05,695 --> 02:47:06,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you so much for the call, buddy.

2340
02:47:07,476 --> 02:47:08,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, no problem.

2341
02:47:08,116 --> 02:47:08,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2342
02:47:09,257 --> 02:47:10,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for the video.

2343
02:47:10,818 --> 02:47:15,142
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2344
02:47:17,463 --> 02:47:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT saying VHS was around nearly 10 years after DVD.

2345
02:47:22,285 --> 02:47:24,466
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, you have the overlap that happens too.

2346
02:47:24,486 --> 02:47:27,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but A-Tracks didn't totally last that many years.

2347
02:47:27,887 --> 02:47:39,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Also consider that these older generation systems could probably push better graphics because the original Xbox and even the PlayStation 2, some games did output to HD, like 720p and 1080i.

2348
02:47:42,833 --> 02:47:45,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming the games support it.

2349
02:47:46,154 --> 02:47:47,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them, but some of them did.

2350
02:47:49,515 --> 02:47:49,835
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2351
02:47:50,716 --> 02:47:56,318
[SPEAKER_04]: While we wait for another call, maybe possibly, let's go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.

2352
02:47:56,338 --> 02:47:57,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to bring it up on the desktop here.

2353
02:47:57,878 --> 02:48:02,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually use my iPad for it, but I left that in the other room like a genius.

2354
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:04,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll pull that up here.

2355
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:06,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I know at least there was a couple things from Tigerclaw in there.

2356
02:48:08,319 --> 02:48:12,547
[SPEAKER_04]: of course it would help if I sign in as the right account help, someone buy me time

2357
02:48:13,523 --> 02:48:17,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm broke, so we'll have... Words.

2358
02:48:19,246 --> 02:48:21,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rob is actually signing into Twitter right now, everybody.

2359
02:48:22,187 --> 02:48:27,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I am filling time so that we do not have... Except I can't remember the password to the stinking Twitter account because when you manage... Burrito!

2360
02:48:27,550 --> 02:48:29,751
[SPEAKER_04]: When you manage four... The password is not burrito.

2361
02:48:30,071 --> 02:48:31,892
[SPEAKER_04]: When you manage four Twitter accounts... Don't tell them that.

2362
02:48:32,793 --> 02:48:34,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to see how many people try to log in with the wrong word.

2363
02:48:35,094 --> 02:48:35,554
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2364
02:48:36,234 --> 02:48:39,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Log them out of his account because, you know, Twitter hacks and...

2365
02:48:39,756 --> 02:48:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

2366
02:49:02,921 --> 02:49:04,522
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the opening.

2367
02:49:05,402 --> 02:49:08,944
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little screen that talks about the Namco Museum and the network features.

2368
02:49:09,404 --> 02:49:13,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And look very closely at the high scoreboard, and you'll see some familiar names.

2369
02:49:14,247 --> 02:49:19,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big thank you to the OLR fans, or fan, who put us in a game.

2370
02:49:19,629 --> 02:49:20,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Much thanks.

2371
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:22,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get any better than that, right?

2372
02:49:22,811 --> 02:49:24,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can quit now.

2373
02:49:24,972 --> 02:49:25,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it in a video game.

2374
02:49:25,913 --> 02:49:26,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I could die.

2375
02:49:26,793 --> 02:49:27,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I can die now.

2376
02:49:28,234 --> 02:49:29,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like butter.

2377
02:49:29,775 --> 02:49:32,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you haven't checked it out yet, Bungie Fair Tossing.

2378
02:49:32,876 --> 02:49:39,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, especially with this unfortunate news about XNA this week where even though Microsoft hasn't updated it in three years, they basically said they're not going to.

2379
02:49:41,058 --> 02:49:46,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Really unfortunate that indie games probably not going to be a thing on the Xbox Lube.

2380
02:49:46,759 --> 02:49:47,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2381
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:48,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just left to hypothesize.

2382
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they've got something newer, bigger, better coming out, I hope.

2383
02:49:51,761 --> 02:49:52,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, support XNA.

2384
02:49:53,101 --> 02:49:54,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Support the indie games.

2385
02:49:54,962 --> 02:49:56,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like indie games are cooked up overnight.

2386
02:49:57,223 --> 02:50:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these guys started it a long time ago before they made these announcements about XNA.

2387
02:50:03,687 --> 02:50:06,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Support indie games and start with Bungie Ferritossing.

2388
02:50:06,549 --> 02:50:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one to pick.

2389
02:50:08,650 --> 02:50:10,591
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of tweets from Tigerclaw.

2390
02:50:10,611 --> 02:50:11,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read a couple of them here.

2391
02:50:12,932 --> 02:50:16,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this one's a My Little Pony story, but it's one... But no one cares, Skip.

2392
02:50:16,954 --> 02:50:22,597
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, it's worth reading, because they were actually making a fighting game, My Little Pony MLP Fighting is Magic.

2393
02:50:23,298 --> 02:50:41,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, surprise, surprise, a cease and desist from Hasbro's legal representatives, and this was posted to their site at main6.com, asking them to stop the distribution of any materials that My Little Pony characters, names, locations, or elements from the show, including YouTube, Twitch, and so forth.

2394
02:50:43,127 --> 02:50:49,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They attempted to negotiate Hasbro for the continued use of the property for their voluntary project, but they didn't get an answer.

2395
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:52,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this really surprise anybody?

2396
02:50:52,932 --> 02:50:59,114
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to make a fan game like that or something, just do it on the download, release it, then do a cease and desist.

2397
02:50:59,154 --> 02:50:59,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the internet.

2398
02:50:59,915 --> 02:51:00,675
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to do?

2399
02:51:00,855 --> 02:51:02,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hype it up.

2400
02:51:02,916 --> 02:51:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to recruit people, I guess that's one thing, but try to do it on the download because the more you hype it up...

2401
02:51:07,478 --> 02:51:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The more visibility it's going to get, and then the company has an obligation to protect their trademarks and so forth to put the C&D out there.

2402
02:51:16,383 --> 02:51:22,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think fighting ponies was what they wanted to have happen.

2403
02:51:23,528 --> 02:51:27,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Obi-Wan Jabroni on OLR says, Hey, OLR, give me a shout-out.

2404
02:51:27,070 --> 02:51:28,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking 5 a.m.

2405
02:51:28,311 --> 02:51:28,511
[SPEAKER_04]: here.

2406
02:51:28,951 --> 02:51:29,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you?

2407
02:51:29,572 --> 02:51:30,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 5 a.m.

2408
02:51:30,152 --> 02:51:31,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the UK?

2409
02:51:31,513 --> 02:51:32,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you maybe in the military?

2410
02:51:33,294 --> 02:51:34,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be the Mideast.

2411
02:51:34,756 --> 02:51:35,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2412
02:51:35,376 --> 02:51:38,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But shout out to you for it being pretty late.

2413
02:51:39,099 --> 02:51:42,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do a shout, but then Rob's landlord would get complaints from the neighbors.

2414
02:51:44,763 --> 02:51:47,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go listen to this week's Horde House and get a scream and shout.

2415
02:51:47,645 --> 02:51:48,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

2416
02:51:49,006 --> 02:51:50,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to one more call here on Skype.

2417
02:51:50,768 --> 02:51:51,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2418
02:51:51,749 --> 02:51:52,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2419
02:51:53,018 --> 02:51:53,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2420
02:51:54,078 --> 02:51:57,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I say My Little Pony and then all of a sudden, look who's on the line.

2421
02:51:57,079 --> 02:51:58,040
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Actdeft?

2422
02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:05,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, BlackBull's gonna hate me for this, but yeah, I wanna talk about the Fighting This Magic game.

2423
02:52:06,402 --> 02:52:10,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only letting you do it because it's relevant to gaming talk right now.

2424
02:52:12,244 --> 02:52:19,146
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing getting pulled was good news for you guys because it gives you an excuse to talk about it and be relevant, so go for it while you can.

2425
02:52:20,037 --> 02:52:25,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, oh, Black Wolf.

2426
02:52:26,401 --> 02:52:33,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, yeah, I'm pretty, well, sad that it got the cease and desist letter.

2427
02:52:33,965 --> 02:52:39,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Though, yeah, it was eventually going to happen because it got a lot of media attention.

2428
02:52:40,029 --> 02:52:49,615
[SPEAKER_03]: An article went up on GameSpot, and it also was competing to be the eighth game featured on the EVO tournament this year.

2429
02:52:52,626 --> 02:53:17,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it caught a lot of attention And it was almost finished They were pretty much on the final stage of development Well that means it's going to leak to the internet anyway And they'll just say, oh our computer was hacked And the finished version leaked to the internet Like that'll happen Didn't that happen to the Chrono Trigger thing that Square Enix shut down?

2430
02:53:17,784 --> 02:53:18,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive it did

2431
02:53:19,305 --> 02:53:21,507
[SPEAKER_08]: The music from that came out.

2432
02:53:21,727 --> 02:53:23,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it hits the internet, it's never coming off.

2433
02:53:23,788 --> 02:53:28,932
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were that close to finishing it, it'll leak in its beta form.

2434
02:53:28,952 --> 02:53:35,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll find a way to do it where they will be able to wash their hands of any legal ramifications.

2435
02:53:36,557 --> 02:53:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely you can see with all this attention, wasn't it getting to be a little too big for something that they really... If they didn't have Hasbro's sign-off on it, is this really that surprising?

2436
02:53:47,628 --> 02:53:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it isn't.

2437
02:53:48,788 --> 02:53:58,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, it was eventually going to happen, though most of us were expecting the game to be released.

2438
02:53:59,532 --> 02:54:04,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually looking forward to playing it because it was already leaked before.

2439
02:54:05,114 --> 02:54:07,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's already out on the internet.

2440
02:54:07,516 --> 02:54:10,179
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it on the Pirate Bay and other sites.

2441
02:54:10,359 --> 02:54:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well then shit.

2442
02:54:12,121 --> 02:54:12,941
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't shut that down.

2443
02:54:13,001 --> 02:54:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's a pretty early build of it.

2444
02:54:16,685 --> 02:54:20,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's somewhat buggy and it isn't complete.

2445
02:54:21,329 --> 02:54:48,006
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah even then it looked like a pretty good game it was like a regular game even a good fighting game and it was featured on EVO on their indie showcase last year so yeah it was like I said many people even in the fighting community were expecting a lot of it so yeah I just want to make sure it was still a good fighting game without the marijuana right?

2446
02:54:49,457 --> 02:54:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do drugs, so yeah.

2447
02:54:50,818 --> 02:54:51,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, alright.

2448
02:54:51,818 --> 02:54:52,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

2449
02:54:52,398 --> 02:54:54,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good answer.

2450
02:54:54,579 --> 02:54:55,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Winners don't do drugs.

2451
02:54:56,020 --> 02:54:56,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yes, that's right.

2452
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:59,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Winners don't do drugs, and that is the real message here.

2453
02:54:59,902 --> 02:55:04,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I gotta let you go before Black Wolf pulls the plug on the show, so take care, buddy.

2454
02:55:05,664 --> 02:55:06,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You too, thanks.

2455
02:55:06,525 --> 02:55:06,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2456
02:55:09,795 --> 02:55:11,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2457
02:55:12,156 --> 02:55:14,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I think My Little Pony Call will do that.

2458
02:55:15,797 --> 02:55:16,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fucking with you guys.

2459
02:55:17,818 --> 02:55:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one more tweet because TigerCloud said a bunch of stories.

2460
02:55:20,679 --> 02:55:22,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do at least one more of these here.

2461
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do this one.

2462
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:25,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pinball story.

2463
02:55:25,441 --> 02:55:26,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is always relevant.

2464
02:55:27,281 --> 02:55:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool pinball actually.

2465
02:55:28,722 --> 02:55:32,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars pinball announced by Zen Studios.

2466
02:55:32,816 --> 02:55:33,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yes to this.

2467
02:55:34,917 --> 02:55:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Zen Studios is partnering with LucasArts for a Star Wars pinball.

2468
02:55:39,379 --> 02:55:40,060
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome.

2469
02:55:40,100 --> 02:55:42,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see this little table shot here?

2470
02:55:42,821 --> 02:55:43,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat.

2471
02:55:43,201 --> 02:55:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little Boba Fett and C-3PO.

2472
02:55:44,902 --> 02:55:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

2473
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:50,401
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this coming to?

2474
02:55:50,421 --> 02:55:58,526
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be Pinball FX 2 and it'll be available on Live Arcade, Windows 8, PlayStation Network, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Crossbuy.

2475
02:55:59,407 --> 02:56:00,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this supposed to be on Wii U at some point too?

2476
02:56:01,608 --> 02:56:02,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

2477
02:56:02,188 --> 02:56:02,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

2478
02:56:04,571 --> 02:56:05,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats to Zen Studios.

2479
02:56:05,832 --> 02:56:07,714
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hell of a partnership to land there.

2480
02:56:07,854 --> 02:56:08,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, you guys.

2481
02:56:09,596 --> 02:56:09,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2482
02:56:10,316 --> 02:56:13,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for our Twitter topics tonight.

2483
02:56:13,880 --> 02:56:18,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us tweets in the future.

2484
02:56:18,524 --> 02:56:19,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And that does it for the Skype line tonight.

2485
02:56:20,166 --> 02:56:27,553
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get through and you have something you want to say, please email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or tweet us for next week.

2486
02:56:28,254 --> 02:56:33,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Since there was no last minute stories, I believe that brings us to another close of an episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2487
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:37,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us and supporting us through another week.

2488
02:56:37,284 --> 02:56:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: We are an independently produced show, literally done out of somebody's dining room.

2489
02:56:43,090 --> 02:56:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we don't dine.

2490
02:56:43,931 --> 02:56:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: We have radio stuff set up anywhere.

2491
02:56:45,512 --> 02:56:46,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I dine sometimes.

2492
02:56:46,413 --> 02:56:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I snack.

2493
02:57:09,571 --> 02:57:10,451
[SPEAKER_04]: My head still hurts.

2494
02:57:10,471 --> 02:57:11,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel way too full.

2495
02:57:38,934 --> 02:57:39,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Still feeling bloaty?

2496
02:57:40,615 --> 02:57:41,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

2497
02:57:41,155 --> 02:57:42,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncomfortably so.

2498
02:57:43,397 --> 02:57:43,717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2499
02:57:43,757 --> 02:57:46,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than how you were feeling yesterday, though.

2500
02:57:46,419 --> 02:57:47,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than Friday, yes.

2501
02:57:47,579 --> 02:57:47,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2502
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:48,180
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2503
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:50,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2504
02:57:50,601 --> 02:57:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great, safe week, everybody, and we'll be back to do it all again next week.

2505
02:57:54,203 --> 02:57:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?

2506
02:57:54,804 --> 02:57:55,164
[SPEAKER_04]: See you then.

2507
02:57:55,384 --> 02:57:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

2508
02:57:56,325 --> 02:57:59,387
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2509
02:57:59,987 --> 02:58:04,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2510
02:58:04,810 --> 02:58:05,411
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!

2511
02:58:35,999 --> 02:58:36,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!
