Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, February 10th, 2013, a Wii U exclusive game is pushed back to go multi-platform.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Controversial rumors surround the next Xbox.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could J.J. Abrams make a Portal movie after Star Wars?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio back on this February 10th for our 492nd episode after a week off last week.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll tell you why and give you all our sorry excuses in a minute.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But first, say hello to the well-rested and ready to go back for another week of OLR,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
my co-hosts DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I'm unemployed.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And you're unemployed. Funemployed is the preferred term.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh no. Not really having a lot of fun because I had what also caused the show to...

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes. And if I didn't say it, my name is Rob Roberts. I can't remember if I introduced myself or not.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No you're not.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, yes I am. How dare you question me?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Anyway, there is no question that we are also joined every week by the one and only...

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Who wants to die for art?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who wants to die for art? Oh, Loki. Techmaster Loki definitely doesn't want to die for art.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No I don't.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But he almost did over this weekend.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't almost die.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And he's dying for that pizza he's eating right now.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, see that's the thing is my stomach hasn't stretched out I guess.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It only takes like a day for it to go back I guess.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And so I even got a small and I'm only able to eat half of it right now.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's good.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, that's portion control right? Even though you want to eat the whole thing.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yep.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's alright I've already done my part. You know, sickness. Drop five pounds.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Speaking of sickness, it's a big part of the reason why we weren't here last week.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I actually got really sick. I was out of work on a Friday and a Monday.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And no I was not just trying to extend my weekend. I actually had the worst of it on Saturday and Sunday.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's just the head cold from hell. I don't know what else to say about it.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Might have been a flu or something.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I obviously didn't want these two coming over and getting sick.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Except I already had it.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah I think you were sick anyway.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was actually sick for about seven days.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was like yeah I'll just come over anyway.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah I know. Loki was like god dammit I'll come over. I'll just do the show by myself.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we gotta talk about the news that's going on. It's such a busy week in gaming.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm like I know. I know it sucks to lose this week but let it go Loki.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So finally let it go.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And last week was also this little football game. A lot of people seem to care about what's going on.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I know our local sports ball team lost which made a lot of people really unhappy.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I wore my team colors that day.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I wore my N7 shirt.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And hid in the back room playing Mass Effect 2.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here's a question for you.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Would you play a football game on Xbox if it was Turians vs. Humans vs. Corians or whatever?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I sincerely doubt that's ever going to happen. Yeah I would play it.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Really it's not going to happen in a company that owns both of those franchises?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I really don't think it's going to happen.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Dark Sakura presents Turian Ball actually.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Turian Balls might be a whole different type of game that Dark Sakura would want to present.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But anyway let's get into that face though. I wish this were a video show. It's not. It's Orange Laundromat Radio.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was picturing it but all of my favorite fan artists have other plans.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How many X-rated Mass Effect fan art sites have you looked up in your time Dark Sakura?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Technically only one.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But there's a few tumblers that I follow.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh I see. I see.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But if you don't go to their main page then it doesn't count.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because it's just they got reblogged and there's nothing you can do about it right?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh well. Oops.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Alright.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Before we get into how was our gaming weeks. You know one of the big things that did come up the week that we were off.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Loki I don't know if you heard about that one. I'm sure you did.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sony kind of came out of nowhere and announced that they were going to.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They did an announcement of an announcement.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And you know how much do we hate this shit in the gaming industry.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But it's a little different this time.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Technically it's an announcement of a conference.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well okay. But we let Sony slide a little bit because all the rumor and all the buzz is that this big thing they're going to be doing on February 20th is the big unveil of the PlayStation 4.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because if it's not it's going to be very disappointing.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right? It's kind of like they have to.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's like hey we got PlayStation Home. I don't fucking care.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well it's funny because when that was all unfolding I was at work and I was like on one of my 15 minute breaks at work like trying to furiously catch up on Twitter and I saw what some of the other indie podcasters I follow were saying on it and like OMG PlayStation 4.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I said why are we getting off. What if this isn't like a PlayStation Vita conference like a Nintendo Direct style. Here's the upcoming Vita games.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like why are we all so quick.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why are we all so quick to assume it's PlayStation 4.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But then what ended up Forbes or Wall Street Journal or one of those more financial magazines or excuse me newspapers went with a rumor which they don't typically tend to do unless they really put a lot of stock in it that yes it's going to be PlayStation 4.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And you know I I've said on Orange Lawn Radio I don't believe that Sony is under any obligation to put PlayStation 4 out this year.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We've talked you know we talked at the end of last year about what might be the big shocker next year and I even kind of said that PlayStation 4 might not happen this year.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But you know I'm OK being wrong. It happens. Oh my God games analysts sometimes don't know that yet.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean it's true. But come on you're right. Sony has even if it's Vita Vita Vita Vita and then little tiny teaser about PlayStation 4.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They will have said something about PlayStation 4 which they have to do at this point. Right. No I think they have to.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sony doesn't have to say what Sony doesn't want to say.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But the disappointment would be so huge now that everybody's hyped it up like if if it wasn't PlayStation 4 Sony would have already said stop getting your hopes up.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The fact that they haven't come out and made a very clear statement it's not PlayStation 4 would have troll says a lot troll.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't think it's a troll. Sony's not in a position to do something like that.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But now that you're looking you know going up to this February 20th conference it makes a lot of sense.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They're trying to get around the typical convention cycle of release your news to E3.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They purposely are doing this ahead of Microsoft a couple weeks after one of their execs even said we have no reason to show our cards before Microsoft which is a very interesting sort of turnaround.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's also the week before destination PlayStation where they meet with all their retail partners and stuff like that.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So perhaps you know this is ahead of that and game developers conferences in March too right.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So you know they might they might have some things to say or show about that because certainly you've got to have the third party support and get the other developers on board pretty early as another company is learning the hard way this week.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We'll get into that later.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's very interesting now because Sony will be the talk of everything between February and whenever Microsoft finally announces whatever they're doing which could be E3 at this point.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Although why not announce it a little earlier. It won't be because that's not how they did the 360.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's true it's not how they did the 360.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know I just have another thought about Sony keeping quiet for the sake of raising that speculation and gathering interest.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I mean that even if they don't mention anything more than like a little teeny thing about the PS4 they're building all the suspense and getting people interested in what they're going to say.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh yeah it's definitely it's definitely the hype machine is in full force now and that's you know what 2013 is going to be is it's going to be the year of the as somebody called it this week Gen 4 consoles.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think Sony themselves called it Gen Gen 4 consoles in an unrelated discussion.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So what's the Nintendo minus five.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I know right. It's like oh I see the console generations didn't start till Sony got to the table.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think it's in reality what we're getting into the ninth generation.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know that the Magnavox it was the Odyssey the Fairchild were considered Gen 1.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Atari was Gen 2.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So because yeah the Odyssey the Magnavox Odyssey came out in 79 and the Fairchild Channel F I think came out right around the same time or right before that maybe.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And then there were the eighth generation Texas Instruments systems came out in 81 so did the 2600.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well all this numerology aside and you know whoever gets to come out there with their big wand and say I dub this the eighth generation of games.

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is definitely all about you know this year is going to be about what's next.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And for this for the second or third time in this show's history talking about next gen gaming.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So it's going to be a very exciting year.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One of the thing though I think and I wanted to touch on this is I find it very interesting that Sony is kind of going to the Web.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They're taking their case to the Internet.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I find it a move very inspired in part by what Nintendo Direct is doing.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And you know Sony got a lot of shit the year they unveiled the PlayStation 3 and rightfully so.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That press conference was a hot mess.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean we made fun of it on this show for years and years.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Giant enemy crabs five hundred ninety nine U.S. dollars Ridge Racer Africa.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That was a no Africa was the next year was it.

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah I think you know I don't think it was.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well whatever it was a fucking mess.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean it was a it was an awesome mess and we loved it as gamers but Sony doesn't want to make that same mistake twice.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So why not have a nice polished pre-edited presentation that they deliver directly to the Internet's which I also think is fascinating is that.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
E3 is losing some of its relevance in that regard.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now I'm I'm not out here saying E3 is dead.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh my God.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And you know E3 has its place.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's important.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes but it's very interesting that E3 is not going to have the big reveals of either of these consoles although certainly some of the big game announcements and some of the specifications release dates prices.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A lot of that probably won't come out tell E3.

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't expect you're going to know the release date and the price of this machine on February 20th.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Not going to happen.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I feel very confident in saying that because Sony does kind of want to size up what their competition is doing before they're ready to announce something like that.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And just the price of parts can can fluctuate that much in the time period between February and when this thing actually gets released.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So anything that you are looking forward to or not out of this particular event on the 20th because it's only 10 days away at this point.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No I'm not even really considering anything.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I just can't.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It'd be nice to see what they had planned for the Vita already.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know as I mentioned on Twitter I got rid of mine.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So yes someone was interested in making an offer on it before someone put it on eBay.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah I noticed that all came up.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That was in the two week break.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You sold your Vita during two week break.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So you know there there's really nothing coming out for the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's just not really not a whole lot of stuff that excites me about that.

159
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I don't know.

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I mean it would be interesting to see what they have the offer what's going to be unique.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Once again it's going to have to be something that's like kind of this big wow factor thing.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's that's really what did it for the Wii.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The Wii may not have been technologically superior but it was like hey look you're going to be able to play games a completely different way than you've ever played games before.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And that's why it took off.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Now that everybody kind of has the same type of thing it's I mean they tried it with the Wii U and it just didn't quite have the same.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No now you're going to be able to play games using this tablet and the TV.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well you kind of people were used tablets is on new thing.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's I don't know.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It didn't have the same splash.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I just really hope that this you know new console you know I think we've heard a lot about not necessarily this console may not be so much about the technological aspect of it but kind of the way it integrates itself.

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The gaming you know a true entertainment box and that whole you know social gaming becoming more prevalent and Gaikai integration you know how is that going to be a factor and so forth.

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
One thing I really fear though is that I really fear all the execs sitting in the boardroom and we all know just about every bad decision made in gaming starting in a boardroom somewhere right.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I'm really worried that everybody's just tapping into Facebook.

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We've got to have a piece of Facebook gaming.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Facebook is gaming.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's what people want.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
People want Facebook and they want the mobile games and the OUYA and that that's what the people want.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And we've got to have like a one button integration that goes to Facebook and so forth and we've got to have games playable on Facebook that are on the PlayStation 3.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I'm just like God I hope not because that really feels like a step backwards to me.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If we go all like Farmville on PlayStation 3 that can be one element of it.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I really hope that's not the focus.

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't think that they're going to do that because they've been kind of more you know core audience.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Once again you know in this the same thing what I've been reading all these you know oh there's rumors that the Xbox is not going to be able to play used games.

184
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh there's rumors that the PlayStation 3 is not going to be able to play used games.

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well then you know I guess I'll just have to get an Xbox you know because the PlayStation doesn't you know it's not going to be able to play used games.

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hey no one's forcing to buy a new console.

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No one is forcing.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In fact here's the thing is if people don't like it enough and they don't buy the console guess what they have to do something else.

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Publishers will make games for the consoles that are actually selling and are out there if you know the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox whatever the next system is going to be called.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Flop or if they're just not selling well you're going to still be able to get awesome new games on the current platforms that you have now.

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then they'll have to come out and retool something until it's to what you like.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So that's the thing is no one's forcing you at gunpoint to buy a new console for the next generation.

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I don't understand why anybody should feel you know like that this is your own choice.

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Just listen to what their options are and then make a decision.

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or hey trust me if you decide not to buy a new console there's plenty of games you know seven generations worth of games that you can go play.

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Going to the chat room of course we always do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And a big thank you to all those of you that have turned up live tonight.

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know we have a lot of competition going on tonight with the silly Grammys on TV which I think are one of the worst of all the award shows.

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But people still seem to want to watch it anyway so there's that.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Walking Dead is going on right now the premiere which you know okay at least I can understand that one a little more.

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But that is why you have the DVR.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But anyway for whatever reason people it's a little thinner in chat tonight but we do appreciate those you guys that have turned out tonight to say hello.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And leave some of the comments at live.vognetwork.com.

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
WhatupG says Jack Trenton said that they didn't believe in not making a system where you couldn't play used games on.

206
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I you know I know we're going to get into this a little more later in the show but I just don't think Sony or Microsoft for that matter is that stupid.

207
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I mean again every bad decision comes from a boardroom somewhere.

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's incredibly ballsy to try something like that.

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think that's a good way to put it. That would be a ballsy move.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's basically saying hey you know buy sell trade retailers we don't need you.

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And when they say buy sell trade retailers we mean GameStop and they need GameStop.

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And that's just going back to what you said Loki.

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It just encourages people not to buy it and so publishers are stuck making games for the systems we already have.

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's got to be everybody's on board or not. And even then if everybody's on board with it people will go elsewhere.

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I mean at this point they're not the only companies making consoles.

216
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I mean granted you know there's going to be you know the Ouya which is Android based and stuff and that may not be what you're looking for.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But it's open. It's more open than these consoles are.

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So if they try to do something like that which they're not I just don't see it working out for them.

219
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Act Deaf in our chat room and the PSP didn't catch up at all.

220
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Vita seems like it's going the way of the PSP or worse.

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is the Vita host at this point? Do you think Sony?

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean I know you just sold yours this week so maybe I can already tell your perspective.

223
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But has Sony written the Vita off? Is the Vita done for?

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't think they've written it off but they sure didn't start off very well.

225
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because the problem was they outsourced a lot of their big games for the Vita.

226
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like the Resistance game which should have been one that should have been a system seller right there.

227
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's going to be an awesome first person shooter that will really shut off the Vita.

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And it was terrible.

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And then you have that same company for whatever reason also do Call of Duty.

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Which you know Call of Duty should have been a system seller right there.

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You have a portable first person shooter Call of Duty game that's going to be fucking awesome.

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're going to be able to take it on the road and have the console quality experience on the road.

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And it sucks because you have the same company that made the really terrible first person shooter Resistance game do that.

234
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And now you know they had even like Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which was supposed to be alright.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But I don't think it was you know it's I don't know if it sold systems.

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But now they're kind of you know the thing was now the next game that's supposed to be this.

237
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh this is really going to define the system is Killzone.

238
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Which that's cool that it's a first person shooter in Killzone.

239
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But I just I'm not a big fan of the Killzone franchise.

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So for me looking at the outlook of what's coming out for the Vita there just wasn't anything there for me.

241
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's why I got rid of it because I just had nothing I wanted to play on it.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What happened about what happened with things like Final Fantasy 10 remake?

243
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh well that that's still way the hell down there.

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And who cares it's a remake of Final Fantasy 10.

245
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well the whole HD part there's some parts about that that are relevant to my interests.

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Whatever I mean I just I played 10 already.

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I agree that you can't you know you can't support your system with nothing but remakes Nintendo.

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But you know it's it's it helps.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's just not I mean that's that's nice in addition to other things but it just wasn't what I was looking for.

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And granted maybe I should have tried you know like Little Big you know Little Big Planet or something like that.

251
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I don't even touch Little Big Planet anymore on the PlayStation 3.

252
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I just didn't see myself buy another Little Big Planet game not to play.

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And I tried PlayStation you know All-Stars Battle Royale and they just it wasn't my thing.

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean I'm not even really a huge fan of Smash Brothers but at least Smash Brothers seemed like I don't know it was kind of more fun.

255
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess I can identify not really identify the characters but you know the characters were a little bit more.

256
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know how to really put it.

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's just like I don't really have any I guess any attachments to any of these characters in the Sony game.

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I guess it's like you know Jack and Daxter. Cool. I haven't really played any of those games or Sly Cooper.

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know I I don't really care about that series. There just wasn't a lot of stuff there.

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Now if they announce Grand Theft Auto and it was coming out in March that'd be a whole different story.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'd probably be still keeping that system or it just if they announce hey Grand Theft Auto is coming to the Vita.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah I'd be still sticking on to that but it's just nothing that I really wanted for it was coming out.

263
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And it was kind of the same problem with the 3DS because remember the 3DS was when they were talking about 3DS it was like hey Saints Row DJ Hero coming to the 3DS.

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was like fuck yes. That is that sold the system for me Saints Row on the go and and DJ Hero that'd be pretty awesome.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And then neither one came out so I was like ah fuck that.

266
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah that was disappointing.

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But really overall what it is is it's just I don't have time for portable gaming anymore.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's like I don't go anywhere. I don't need a portable system. So there's really no need for me to have this.

269
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Some comments from chat. Tiger Claw says Sly Cooper is awesome and Act Def says Loki you should totally play Sly Cooper for real.

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well then cool I can pick it up on my PS3 but I'm not it once again it's just I didn't I don't need a portable system anymore.

271
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's what it is. I just don't need it because I don't I don't ever find myself like commuting.

272
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Or something like that like on a train for a long distance time where I you know kill time.

273
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I just don't have any of that so I'll stick to console gaming for now.

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
All right well we'll see what develops in the Sony front in about 10 more days.

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Meanwhile let's talk about what we have been playing in gaming the past couple weeks while we've been gone.

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What a little segment we call how is your gaming week. Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Busy actually. I played some Mass Effect 2 of course.

278
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I actually don't think I logged into WoW at all which is weird.

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I started Dragon Age 2 which I really like the game.

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I liked it when I played it before it just you know killed my hand to play on the Xbox.

281
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I'm playing it on PC and I'm having a really good time with it.

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And we have had another addition to our gaming family.

283
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Dan got a new driving wheel and has set up a three monitor rig which I think I put photos of before.

284
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But he also found out that Borderlands 2 will work with it so it was funny watching him play three monitors.

285
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh wow I didn't know Borderlands 2 did that set up that's awesome.

286
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah and what else was it that I was playing?

287
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh yeah we got another Super Nintendo that came with a box of games and among them was Pocky and Rocky 2.

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Which goes for oh unboxed a good 90 bucks on eBay.

289
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a pretty rare Super Nintendo game.

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's got a whole batch for 50.

291
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Where did you find all this?

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Goodwill.

293
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh really?

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Wow.

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You know what else I got at Goodwill?

297
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
An earring Magic Ken.

298
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
In the box.

299
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's awesome though.

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
For 10 bucks.

301
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You found such a gaming motherlode I guess of sorts.

302
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Since we've already got a bajillion other Super Nintendos we're gonna sell this one with a copy of Super Mario World.

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We'll put it up on Craigslist and I'll share the link later.

304
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Dan's also selling his old driving rig.

305
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And I got a copy of Mega Man X out of it cause you got dupes so I can't complain.

306
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well we've got a bunch of other dupes too but Dan and I sat all that night that first night and played Jeopardy together.

307
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like the deluxe Jeopardy and he's like I don't know what area to pick now I know all this other stuff what about this?

308
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I was like just pick the French Revolution.

309
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And then I started answering all the questions in the French Revolution cause you know me I'm a stupid history nerd.

310
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And he was like oh my god you knew all those.

311
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was like yeah you married a smart woman hi.

312
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And like Wheel of Fortune we played Wheel of Fortune and Super Tech Mobile.

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But the best Super Nintendo board game was Clue and I have it.

314
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It was awesome.

315
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It was kind of not like the board game actually.

316
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We had it like it came with like what else came in that pack was some Super Scope stuff like Yoshi's Island.

317
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Not Yoshi's Island Yoshi's Safari.

318
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The Super Bazooka was so cool.

319
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We don't have a Super Scope though so that's gonna probably be on our list cause I liked Yoshi's Safari.

320
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The Super Bazooka was so awesome that little game that came with it was pretty cool.

321
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I liked Blastress.

322
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah Blastress.

323
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah we've got like a bajillion Super Scope 6 copies now.

324
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And another Mario paint even though we have no mouse.

325
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We have the mouse pad we have no mouse.

326
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And what else Battle Clash not Battle Clash.

327
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Battle Chess?

328
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No not Battle Chess it was another Super Scope game that's like.

329
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I know what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah.

330
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

331
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The other Super Scope 6 game.

332
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Or Metal something.

333
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah.

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah something tank thing.

335
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm sure somebody in chattel yelled out but yeah.

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We also what else came in that collection?

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I said Wheel of Fortune right?

338
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No Wheel of Fortune came with it.

339
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Killer Instinct also came with it.

340
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What'd you find?

341
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Battle Clash.

342
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Battle Clash that's it.

343
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Was the game I think you were thinking of.

344
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There was also this is the long list of games that supported the Super Scope.

345
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Battle Clash, Bazooka Blitzkrieg, The Hunt for Red October had bonus games in it.

346
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Lamborghini American Challenge had mini games.

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Lemmings 2 The Tribes had calibration.

348
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Metal Combat, Falcon's Revenge, Operation Thunderbolt I remember that one.

349
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think we got that one too.

350
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
T2 the Arcade Game, 10 Star, X Zone, and Yoshi Safari.

351
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And that of course is besides the Super Scope 6 game in the game itself.

352
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We got something like I want to say 12 games or so with the system.

353
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So Dan and I also sat down because he took a few days off and I'm fun employed.

354
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We catalogued all of our games that we have at our house right now.

355
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And this isn't including what we've loaned out or what's not at the house given that would be our Atari.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
All of our Atari games which would be 2600, 5200, 7800.

357
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We did get links though with links at the house.

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Our Cliccovision Intellivision and Odyssey.

359
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Odyssey 2 collection.

360
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we catalogued 1279 individual games.

361
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And we had dupes of some of them.

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's a lot of games.

363
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Now some of the games are also duped in that too but we also counted in the box and out of the box.

364
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And special editions and regular editions are separate.

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So I would say independent skews. How does that work?

366
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Fair enough.

367
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Even though you're not a Best Buy but that works.

368
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I forgot that we had two copies of Cyberbots.

369
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But Dan and I are actually starting to think about selling off some of our dupes.

370
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So we're giving friends and OLR listeners first crack.

371
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So I'll let you guys know when that's happening.

372
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Alright. Very retro-tastic week it sounds like. It's awesome.

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?

374
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What have you been sick?

375
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Let's see what did I do.

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I played a bit of Minecraft I built.

377
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm not really sure what it is. Small bridge I guess.

378
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh yeah I played that too.

379
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I just noticed our dynamic map is not working correctly.

380
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's showing someone else's world which is not of my interest.

381
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I actually played a little bit of Saints Row the third today because I had left some of my games at work and I wanted to play those.

382
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Saints Row happened to be in my bag.

383
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Then I realized I don't have my save game anymore because I only have one more thing I have to do.

384
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
100% all the achievements. Well actually 100% all the activities.

385
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I can't find my save for Saints Row anymore.

386
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I have no idea where it's at.

387
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's on a memory card somewhere and I think I deleted it actually so.

388
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Damn. That kind of sucks.

389
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I really don't want to play that game again.

390
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I mean maybe later on but it's not.

391
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I just don't want to do all those activities again because some of those are really annoying.

392
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then let's see what else.

393
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I also played a little bit of Forza Horizon just mainly working on some decals.

394
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I played a small bit. Well we played some Borderlands 2 this week.

395
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And just kind of going through all the missions again because New Game Plus it wouldn't.

396
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Wanted to do all the side missions but we're just kind of doing that right now.

397
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Did the Minecraft easter egg which is kind of fun.

398
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And what else did I do? Let's see.

399
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Skyrim. More Skyrim. My modded game on PC.

400
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's getting really buggy.

401
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Probably because I'm not supposed to put 87 mods on it.

402
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I actually removed some because I had 90 something there at one point.

403
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But yeah lots of mods in that game.

404
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's awesome because the game is so large.

405
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Once again I don't know. I can't remember what's part of the game and what's a mod.

406
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
At least some of this stuff. I mean obviously The Realm of Chuck Norris wasn't in the original Skyrim.

407
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But it's fun.

408
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And I did try the Dovah Bear mod and it got annoying.

409
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Because Dovah Bear like most of the other NPCs in some games it just kept walking in front of me.

410
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And like trapping me in places because it just wouldn't get out of my way.

411
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I wanted to attack things and just stand there growling.

412
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I'm like fuck it you know by the time you're done doing your little growling animation.

413
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And you know finally go try to attack something.

414
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm just going to go kill it instantly because I'm super powered anyways.

415
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So I don't fucking need you Dovah Bear.

416
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So I got rid of that mod.

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But yeah that's pretty much my game week.

418
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And of course sold the Vita. So that was it.

419
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
My gaming week.

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Last week when I was sick I played a lot more Ni No Kuni.

421
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Which I talked about on a previous episode of the show.

422
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Still enjoying it even though I'm about to that 15-16 hour mark.

423
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And of course I've taken a pretty big break the past few days.

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But I don't know. I played a lot of console games when I was sick.

425
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So I've kind of not been wanting to do that because I haven't been sick since Monday.

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But I do still intend on finishing Ni No Kuni at some point.

427
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm doing a lot of PC gaming this week. Warcraft of course.

428
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because there's a lot going on on that front.

429
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But there's another PC game I've actually spent quite a bit of time with.

430
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That I've been getting into quite a bit.

431
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I think this game is pretty rad.

432
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And would you believe it? It's a free game.

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Which really surprises the hell out of me.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because the quality of it is pretty darn good.

435
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Path of Exile is the name of the game.

436
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And I don't know if you guys are familiar with this game at all.

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Path of Exile is a free game.

438
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And it is put out by Gear Grinder Games.

439
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I might have messed that up. Sorry.

440
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't have the notes in front of me.

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But it's got microtransactions in it.

442
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But they are very big on saying that they want to do ethical microtransactions.

443
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
They don't want to do the type of microtransactions that would hold you back in a Zynga game.

444
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Like an energy meter running out or something.

445
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They sell cosmetics, spell effects, pets.

446
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And if you look at their marketplace, that is the kind of stuff they're selling.

447
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Along with extra character slots and extra stash things and so forth.

448
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The money factor is not holding the game back, whatever.

449
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Which I believe technically the game is still considered open beta right now.

450
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And probably will be in beta for a long time.

451
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Kind of like Gmail is.

452
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Path of Exile is a Diablo clone of sorts for lack of a better term.

453
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's the best way I could explain it to you.

454
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you've played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2 or even Diablo 3.

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You pretty much get the gist of what Path of Exile is going to be like.

456
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And it does have the fully online integration.

457
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Where you can get other people to join your game while you're going.

458
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And you can party up to take on mobs that will be of an increased difficulty.

459
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's see.

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Also, there are six classes in the game.

461
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And everything is kind of based around the three kind of guiding stats of intelligence, strength, dexterity.

462
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And so you have one class that's very focused in each of those areas.

463
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Like I play a witch, which is the intelligence focused class.

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But then there's other classes that are like strength meets dexterity.

465
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Strength meets intelligence, which I think is like the Templar.

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And so on and so on.

467
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And everything is very dictated by the colors that go along with those stats.

468
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because you get gems that are those colors.

469
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Most items have sockets in them.

470
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All the abilities are driven by gems.

471
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And where this game gets really interesting is that you get gems that modify abilities if you have them in a connected socket.

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like for example, let's say I have a blue gem that makes fire.

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I do like a little fire bolt.

474
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, when I beat a quest later on, I might get another gem that's called Fork.

475
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And if I put Fork and I tie it in a socket that adjoins with the fire spell.

476
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will get a fireball that forks.

477
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So it splits up.

478
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So it's pretty cool because it kind of gives it this way of like developing your own spells in a way.

479
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
There is no gold in the game.

480
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Which I found very interesting at first.

481
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But everything is basically barter.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The scrolls of Identify and the scrolls of Town Portal kind of become your currency.

483
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Which is really interesting to me.

484
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The way you level up your characters is basically Final Fantasy X's Crystallarium.

485
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I can't really explain it any better.

486
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But it's this gigantic map where you move through all these different talents.

487
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And I think the level cap in the game is like 100.

488
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So you can imagine this leveling chart is gigantic.

489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And there are so many ways that you could screw up your build.

490
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Because one of the tiny drawbacks is that there are very few ways to respec.

491
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You can respec a little bit limited one point or two.

492
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But if you screw up your class, you're stuck with it and you'll have to roll again or whatever.

493
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But yeah.

494
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Did I mention this game is free?

495
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So how can I sit here and really complain about it at all?

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The graphics are really good.

497
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They're optimized very well.

498
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Especially because I even have problems in games like Diablo 3 and Warcraft sometimes.

499
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But the graphics are optimized very well in Path of Exile.

500
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I guess the only maybe little drawback I would say is that I feel like the camera is always zoomed in too much.

501
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And although you can zoom in a little bit to kind of see your character a different way for screenshots or whatever.

502
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You can't zoom out enough which can kind of be a bitch in multiplayer modes.

503
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But that is one tiny ass gripe in the scope of what is really a great game.

504
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That if you're a fan of Diablo or Torchlight or any of that stuff, this game is free.

505
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And I will be honest to god surprised if this game can pull it off and sustain itself on this model.

506
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That's the only thing. I kind of look at this and go, how can this company not be bankrupt in a year?

507
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I've been enjoying it enough where I almost just want to kick them 20 bucks just to say, well done.

508
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Applause.

509
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll just buy something stupid like more character slots or something just to support the game.

510
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Like I actually kind of want to do that. It's weird, huh?

511
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But I want to support a company that I think is doing a pretty awesome thing here.

512
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah, so Path of Exile. I recommend it. I do.

513
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Even though the game is still in beta and so forth, it's fun.

514
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And hopefully we'll only get better with time as it gets out of beta.

515
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So, well done.

516
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That was pretty much my gaming week. So we'll move on to some housekeeping news.

517
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook and Google Plus.

518
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So please find us on social media. We appreciate it.

519
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Also want to give a shout out to our friends at Automate Jam Session.

520
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's one of the other shows you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

521
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
They are about to hit 100 shows this week.

522
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So congratulations to Rama, Ari Rockefeller, the whole gang over there at Anime Jam Session.

523
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
By the way, to celebrate their 100th episode, they're switching to a live show.

524
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They're going to be live at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights from here on out.

525
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So, grats to all those folks at Anime Jam Session. Winner is you.

526
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And good luck. Live radio is a lot of fun, especially when your internet starts cutting out.

527
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's a good thing that Blizzard didn't wait a few more days. You wouldn't even really host.

528
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Especially if you try to open your mouth to say something and you belch into the microphone.

529
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's always fun too. Especially if the microphones start smelling like it.

530
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Alright, that does it for housekeeping. Let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.

531
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's been pretty damn busy, hasn't it, Logie?

532
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yes. So one of the announcements this week was that Rayman Legends has been delayed.

533
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh no. It was originally supposed to be one of the bigger Wii U releases for people that bought the Wii U.

534
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It was one of the games that they were kind of touting at even E3.

535
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And the other bit of news that goes along with that, not only has it been delayed in September,

536
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
but now it's not going to be exclusive to the Wii U anymore. It's also coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

537
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Because they want to make money.

538
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Exactly. Because they said that the reason that they have the delay is because it's not done yet.

539
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And they said, well, we could put out the Wii U version now and then do the other ones later in September,

540
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
but we usually release all of our stuff simultaneously.

541
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's not a standard practice. We just do this on a case-by-case basis.

542
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Basically, here's what it is, folks. If you think about it, this is going to be a game that they're going to want to market.

543
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Why would you double your marketing spend so that the Wii U people, the very few of them that may buy this game, get advertised too?

544
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So basically, it's better just to wait, put the extra polish on the Wii U version of the game, put it out on the other consoles,

545
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
make some additional content, market it all at the same time in September.

546
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What does suck, though, about that is what the hell is now coming out for the Wii U?

547
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Because, honestly, that was going to be the only game for the Wii U in February, so now you have two months with no Wii U games.

548
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
When's Pikmin out, March?

549
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
No, Pikmin got delayed.

550
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh boy. Not good.

551
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
There's no first-party title.

552
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The LEGO game is the only first-party title that they have for...

553
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I mean, it's not really Nintendo that they're, I guess, publishing it.

554
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
There's a lot of stuff in March, but let me put it this way. I looked at the list of stuff coming out for the Wii U.

555
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
There's maybe about eight games until the end of the year so far that have been announced.

556
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I'm including all of the, like, Zelda HD and all that stuff.

557
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, there's literally not a lot to go around right now.

558
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Well, then, to play Devil's Advocate, yes, I can see where the audience for this Rayman game will expand quite a bit by delaying the game and doing it on 360 and PlayStation 3.

559
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I get that, but at the same time, you had a captive audience of fans waiting for something to really justify their system's purchase, waiting for something big on the system.

560
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I think you had a lot of people that were ready to buy this game two weeks before they pulled the plug.

561
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean, there's a lot of people really not happy with Ubisoft.

562
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Like, Ubisoft personally went to Nintendo's house and punched them in the balls.

563
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That is how some people are really taking this news.

564
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, but Ubisoft right now is pulling in profit hand over fist, so I don't really think that it's going to hurt them that badly.

565
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Okay, well, entertain my point for a minute here, whether I really believe this or not.

566
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What about the concept that there was a captive audience in the Wii U audience, and now, in September, you're going to get your game notice in September?

567
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I mean, Rayman, yes, it has its fans, and it's always going to appeal, especially as, like, a kid-friendly type of game, where I've seen a lot of people on the internet saying,

568
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
well, now it's got to go up against Grand Theft Auto. How short-sighted of a statement is that? I'm sorry.

569
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If you were one of those people saying that, I'm smacking you upside the head, wake up call.

570
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Do those two games really have the same audiences?

571
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Counteradvocate.

572
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Hello. Yeah, I know.

573
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Family, where it's a decision between buying something for the kids or buying something for the grown-ups.

574
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,000
However, all that being said, when you're at September, you're knocking down the Christmas season's door, and those games are going to be a dime a dozen.

575
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Those family games.

576
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So, why wasn't the opportunity seized to really have Nintendo fans' full, undivided attention?

577
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
A smaller audience? Yes. A loyal audience? Clearly.

578
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Loki, any thoughts on that?

579
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Once again, I just think it just comes down to money, and it's because they're going to spend less money in marketing that.

580
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I mean, they could just put it out the Wii U version without any marketing, but then, you know, they're not going to make a whole ton of money off of that.

581
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I mean, granted, they've already kind of marketed it with demos and stuff like that, but once again, you have to consider what the install base of the Wii U is.

582
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's not very large, and what percentage of those people are going to buy Rayman Legends?

583
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Being that it's the only game in two months, maybe quite a few of them, but it's still not a big chunk.

584
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean, if you could guarantee all of them would buy it, maybe that might be worth it, but it's just not going to happen.

585
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They know third-party attachment rates on these things are not good.

586
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I want to share a point, and I will credit this to Bobby, because it's something he said on his show, so please support Mr. Bobby Black Wolf.

587
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Bobby Black Wolf Show, 5 o'clock here at VOG, 8 o'clock Eastern.

588
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He talked about how Nintendo gets this rap all the time, where it's all about the first-party games.

589
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And, you know, Nintendo does great for first-party and their stuff, but they don't do enough for third-party.

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So, here they go, they put out their system, and the reason why they have this big blank slate is that they wanted the third-parties to be able to carry this.

591
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's that they didn't want to flood the market with their own stuff, because they wanted the third-parties to have a chance to shine, to have a chance to sell their games.

592
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And, to be fair, ZombiU has done very well in that category, also an Ubisoft game.

593
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But, you know, the system's launch was Mario and Nintendo Land, and there's not going to be anything else until Christmas.

594
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So, third-parties, here you go, here's your chance to shine.

595
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And, instead of taking that chance, Ubisoft has literally shit on them.

596
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like, literally taken a dump all over that offering from Nintendo.

597
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, whether it's a good business decision or not, that's pretty much what happened.

598
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because Nintendo did put a lot of stock and investment in this whole, you know,

599
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:51,000
we got Rayman Legends coming, dah-dah-dah, and we got an exclusive demo, dah-dah-dah, only to get the literally shit on by Ubisoft with this.

600
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So, I mean, can we really complain about how Nintendo doesn't support third-parties when this is how the third-parties respond?

601
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Well, okay, I'm sorry, but, you know, to play, I guess, devil's advocate there,

602
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't really think that the whole blank space right here is to allow for third-parties.

603
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I think it's that Nintendo's development is fucked up.

604
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And that's because they had stuff for first quarter that they were going to put out first-party titles, and they're just not fucking done yet.

605
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And it's not a matter of them, oh, we're being gracious to these third-parties.

606
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:37,000
They have nothing coming out. They're probably, like, panicked that, oh, there's two months where there's no games for our system coming out at retail.

607
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I mean, that's not good. That doesn't look good, especially since the support for the Wii has dropped off immediately.

608
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It wasn't like the PlayStation 2 and stuff were, hell, you know, there is still PlayStation 2 games coming out last year.

609
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I mean, a couple, but that's still many years after the system's done, versus the Wii U comes out?

610
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Nothing this year. Like, there's, like, three games for the Wii coming out, and that's it.

611
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's just nothing. Just drop down to nothing, and there's nothing for your new system either.

612
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's just like they said, fuck you guys, we're just going to go the other platforms.

613
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I've been playing Devil's Advocate a lot. Here's my honest opinion. Here's what I really think.

614
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Now that I've shared all this other stuff, here's what I really think.

615
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The Ubisoft decision, from a purely business and nothing else perspective, it does make sense.

616
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And so, as disappointing as that is, as a Wii U owner, honestly, I probably wasn't going to buy the game anyway.

617
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Rayman was not the system seller for me anyway.

618
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I think Nintendo is in a situation exactly like the 3DS situation,

619
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and it's really ridiculous that they're in that situation yet again, but I think the only way out of it,

620
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean, the 3DS is in a great place now, and Nintendo is essentially going to have to repeat history.

621
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
They're going to have to eat shit. They're going to have to cut the price of the Wii U.

622
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's the only thing now, and we're going to get another one of those E3s this year,

623
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
where Reggie comes out on stage and says, you fucking want games? Bam.

624
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Here's a game. Here's a game. Here's a game. Here's a game. Fuck you, I'm out.

625
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That's going to be their E3 this year. It's going to be just like the year that this all went down with 3DS.

626
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And that'll be that. And then a year from now, we're all going to sit here going,

627
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
how did we ever doubt Nintendo and the Wii U? Will the Wii U be the force to be reckoned with the Wii was?

628
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No. But if these, I mean, who's to say these other consoles are going to necessarily be a force to be reckoned with either?

629
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We're all assuming that PlayStation 4 and Xbox, whatever it's called, are going to be these, you know,

630
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
consoles that are the forces to be reckoned with. However, if it serves me right,

631
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we've had a lot of nasty rumors going around about both of these consoles and things they might do

632
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and missteps they might make of their own that could really piss people off in convincing them to spend $500 on these new consoles.

633
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And if that happens and you're the soccer mom come Christmas time,

634
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
do you want to buy one of these $500 consoles that doesn't play used games?

635
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Or do you want to buy this other console that has the Nintendo name on it, that has Mario's face on it,

636
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that just had its price slashed by 50 bucks to play games that albeit are not that much better technologically than the ones that are out now?

637
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Believe it, believe it, that could happen all over again. History could very well repeat itself.

638
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Even though we're all sitting here laughing at Nintendo right now, don't count them out.

639
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It is way too early and Nintendo is far too stubborn to let it go.

640
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I also have the special superpower of Lucky Bitch Powers because seriously,

641
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I mean, have you not noticed that just when things seem, you know, about to be down for Nintendo,

642
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:55,000
they pull something out of their ass or something turns around or just one little thing will work in their favor and it all turns around, right?

643
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Lucky Bitch Powers.

644
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We'll see though. A lot can happen between now and E3. It's going to be a very interesting year. Can't wait.

645
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
A note for our live listeners. We are aware that the show is cutting out a little bit here and there and a lot of you are having to reload.

646
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We're sorry about it. The same problem was affecting Bobby's show tonight so we actually think it does not originate with us

647
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and, you know, I know we had some lullsy internet-related issues here at the studio that were causing problems for live listeners.

648
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We actually think it's because our provider is located in the Northeast where there was just that big blizzard

649
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
so it would make sense that that is wreaking havoc when the show is being relayed to all of you.

650
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So we're really sorry about it but it's a little bit out of our control.

651
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Blame God.

652
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's really the problem is our choice to go with blizzard cooling for our server.

653
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Exactly, right?

654
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Should have gone with, you know, water or air. No, blizzard! It's better.

655
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Alright. Did you get all that Rayman stuff out that you went to sell?

656
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, they're going to have an exclusive demo.

657
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Great. Hey, good luck, Nintendo man, that they know how to show appreciation.

658
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
They're going to have you guys put out another...

659
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Ubisoft's going to put out another demo, another exclusive Rayman Legends demo.

660
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
At some point.

661
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Ross Steele in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the third parties aren't going to go back to Nintendo.

662
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's not going to happen.

663
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I think that's a bold as fuck statement.

664
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
There... I don't know. I mean, there's some other stuff that we may talk about later on that...

665
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Well, why don't I throw this out there as far as third parties go.

666
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Activision, interesting little development during their earnings call where Bobby Kotick was asked about, you know,

667
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Skylanders and so forth, how the console sales with that all goes.

668
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
He said, quote, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U.

669
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We're concerned about the install base for six to eleven years old, six to eleven year olds.

670
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So, of course, this caused all the blogs to run with Activision is concerned about Nintendo because he did use that.

671
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You know, we're concerned.

672
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
OK, we'll see.

673
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I don't think I wouldn't worry about this too long term, but it does show.

674
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Nintendo really has to show a clear future on how that console is going to print money very soon.

675
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Here's one for you, since I see it's on our show.

676
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
EA.

677
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There's no EA sports games for the Wii or Wii U this year so far.

678
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah, I noticed that.

679
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And that's up through August through Madden.

680
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
No Tiger, no.

681
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And it even goes with 2K.

682
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
No MLB game.

683
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There's no NCAA and no Madden.

684
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I mean, that's.

685
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Interesting that they just completely Madden.

686
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I mean, it must have flopped big time on, you know, the Wii U for the launch.

687
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I don't know if FIFA I could see FIFA being on there, but right now, no Wii U titles sports wise.

688
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And who knows, maybe they'll continue with other franchises of theirs.

689
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Let's not forget, though, despite the fact we say all the third parties are abandoning ship, which I think it's a little early to say that for sure.

690
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Remember, one place where Wii U and Nintendo themselves have really endeared themselves and don't count out what this base can do for your console is indies.

691
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
There's a lot of indie developers that are really liking what Nintendo is doing right now.

692
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Don't count them out.

693
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And just because EA doesn't put out any sports games this year on the Wii does not mean that they're not going to put any sports games for next year.

694
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Just right now, they don't have Madden coming out.

695
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And let's be honest, maybe Madden just doesn't sell very well on the Wii.

696
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I mean, I know we haven't, as far as a retail perspective, didn't sell much of it. It's always PS3, Xbox 360 heavy.

697
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Maybe people have all started realizing that it's the same game every year.

698
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Nope, they haven't figured that out yet.

699
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Still number one selling sports game.

700
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Rama in our chat room suggests Tecmo Bowl for Wii U, please.

701
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It could be an interesting time for somebody.

702
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Then they tried that for the Wii and how well did that sell?

703
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, that's true.

704
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
This could be an interesting time for somebody else to come in and do their knockoff game.

705
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean, it couldn't be NBA or NFL officially, but...

706
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You have to know there's no football game that's as good as Super High Impact. End of story.

707
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
High Impact Wii U.

708
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
No Super Garris Ball.

709
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Anything is possible.

710
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah, Super Garris Ball.

711
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Guys.

712
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Mega Man Soccer.

713
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Even I think the joke is getting old.

714
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Which is funny. When we were cataloging our games, I completely forgot that we had Mega Man Soccer.

715
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't know if you noticed on Twitter, someone was saying that they...

716
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Oh, was it like a Mass Effect spoof of... was it...

717
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Gangnam Style or something like that?

718
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, what was that wallpaper that everyone's been... their phone wallpaper now?

719
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No, no. It wasn't that.

720
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I was replying to someone's tweet and it was about something that had to do with Mass Effect.

721
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And like, oh, I'm surprised there hasn't been a... you guys should do a Mass Effect...

722
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, it was like, you guys should do a Mass Effect parody song to Gangnam Style or something like that.

723
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And I was like, I'm sure someone's already done that to Mass Effect.

724
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And sure enough, they had like a Mass Effect Gangnam Style.

725
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I think it was like Garris Style or something like that.

726
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There is this wallpaper for a phone circulating that's Garris and Caden.

727
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah, it was Garris Style.

728
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's just a still.

729
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah, I'm kind of spent on Gangnam Style after the Pistachio commercial.

730
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Wait a minute, were you watching a football game on TV? Yes, you were. You wouldn't have seen that.

731
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
No.

732
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Aha! Aha! Objection!

733
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Hulu.

734
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Oh, fine.

735
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

736
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Girl, don't even.

737
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, I will.

738
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Well, there is a developer called AK Studios.

739
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
A-C-K-K, which makes me think of Bill the Cat now.

740
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
They've put out an announcement.

741
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
They're working on a 3D RPG that is inspired by Earthbound and The World Ends With You.

742
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And it's going to be on the Wii U eShop.

743
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's codename is Project Y2K.

744
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Aren't they like 13 years too late for that name?

745
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But there is a teaser up for it.

746
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And basically they're saying that basically right now it's concept art, finalized script and storyline, and graphics and gameplay engine.

747
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I forgot this story was on our show roll tonight. What did I just say?

748
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What did I just say about indies and the Wii U?

749
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That it could make for a very interesting marriage. That's all I'm saying.

750
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
If Nintendo finally actually puts its stock in this.

751
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Isn't it more like Wii U leaving one mistress for another Nintendo?

752
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Well, it would be quite the change for Nintendo.

753
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Because remember three years ago fans had to start a letter writing campaign to get games like Xenoblade, which should have been an obvious put that out here in the States please.

754
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And Last Story, which has done well for XSeed.

755
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And now Pandora's Tower.

756
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Maybe Nintendo finally could be doing this turnaround where they're like, maybe gamers here want this shit. This could be a niche for us.

757
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So they're changing their polygamy for a harem.

758
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
However you want to phrase it.

759
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm just trying to think of a good analogy.

760
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That'll work.

761
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I want a harem.

762
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Who doesn't want a harem?

763
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Except you'd have to pay for all of this, nevermind.

764
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Alright, moving on then I guess.

765
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Let's see, we've talked crap about Sony, we've talked crap about Nintendo. Who are we leaving out, Loki?

766
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We're going to talk about Microsoft.

767
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:54,000
As we get close to E3, and I'm sure it's just not going to quit until they make their final announcements.

768
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Let's talk about random Xbox next generation rumors.

769
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So starting off, the next Xbox will always be online and will use Blu-ray.

770
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That works so well.

771
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Kind of a big duh with the Blu-ray because either it's going to be Blu-ray of their own proprietary format, obviously something that's going to be...

772
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Butch, Microsoft can't use Blu-ray, Loki. That's a Sony product.

773
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That's stupid.

774
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That doesn't make any sense. You're talking crazy.

775
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
They can totally do that. I'm surprised actually they don't use HD DVD because that's technology that they have access to and no one's using it for anything.

776
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Sony was also one part of Blu-ray and I also want to remind everybody, Microsoft kind of sucks some dick to get Final Fantasy XI on its console early on which had this whole play online front end.

777
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Who owns play online? I'm dropping the mic now.

778
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Anyways, so yeah, there's rumors going around that it's supposed to be always online which I guess is supposed to somehow tie in with maybe, I don't know, the way you use games work.

779
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean, some way to, I guess, cut into the second hand game market by authenticating your games or something.

780
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't really know. There's no real specifics on that, on why that's even an important fact down there.

781
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The other one is, of course, that there's going to have some sort of, they say, natural speech detection and speech attacks which I know they've been trying to do that kind of crap with the Kinect and I always think it's very, like, useless.

782
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I mean, just like, oh, I plug in the Kinect and Kinect, I want you to do this, you know, or Kinect.

783
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah, but you have functional hands.

784
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I understand that, but I'm saying that they try to, they're trying to improve on this front right here and, you know, to play devil's advocate, that's really only benefiting a small percentage of their market base.

785
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I'm talking about, like, as far as, I don't really know how much further they're going to go with this as far, how this is going to play into the next gen console other than, like, you know.

786
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I believe this is actually, you know, even though this is all rumors and we should take it with a grain of salt, I believe this part, the text-to-speech part, is absolutely true.

787
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And I think the proof is in something that's actually going on in the 360 right now. There's, in the Kinect channel or whatever it is, you go into the Kinect thing, there's an app you can download that is nothing but, and maybe somebody in chat can help me fill in the gap here with the name of it,

788
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:41,000
but it's something where you actually launch it up and it attracts, like, you can earn achievements and avatar gear if you're willing to do this Kinect experiment where you just read phrases.

789
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And you're just reading phrases over and it'll make some background noise sometimes and it's things about, like, movies and all this stuff.

790
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So, like, they're trying to collect different accents and the way people talk through this channel. They're trying to collect all this information, which is really weird when you consider, well, they've already implemented a lot of this.

791
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So they're gearing for something else. So I think the proof is there that this is happening.

792
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:21,000
They're trying to get it more user-friendly instead of saying, like, Xbox, play DVD or play, you know, Xbox search X-Files, play, you know, it's like you can say, where can I find the X-Files? Or where can I watch X-Files?

793
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You should talk like GLaDOS.

794
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I would believe that, you know, they're gonna show, like, a video or something of the new Xbox where somebody walks in as they're getting home from work, hanging up their jacket or whatever, and somebody's walking in going, Xbox, play last night's episode of The Walking Dead.

795
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And the Xbox will just magically turn on and maybe it powers on your TV too or something, I don't know, through an infrared communication. And then there it goes. It starts playing The Walking Dead.

796
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And so they're gonna, that'll be like a thing.

797
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, and I hope that we get another one of those stupid demonstrations where they're saying in front of the Kinect and like, oh, I'm virtually trying on outfits. Or, oh, I'm gonna scan in my skateboard logo or whatever so it can appear on my object in game.

798
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh, wait, all that shit that they promised us for the Kinect and never fucking came through with? I guess, you know, getting a vague color for my car, which, by the way, with that fucked up camera was always like a whitish-pinkish color no matter what the lighting in the room.

799
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I guess that's much better. Oh, by the way, the whole internet connection thing was, of course, supposed to be that whole, oh, it's not gonna play these games because it's gonna be always connected to the internet and it's gonna be tied in.

800
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Basically, they're saying like you have a one-time code you use and that's it. And then your disk is useless, I guess. It doesn't make any sense. It's not gonna happen.

801
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I mean, once again, like I said, you're not being forced to buy a new console and they're not gonna cut out, I mean, seriously, if they cut out GameStop, who's gonna sell their console? Yes, I understand there's other retailers out there that sell consoles, but...

802
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They all want to sell used games, too.

803
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But those GameStops aren't going out of business because those guys aren't selling consoles. All they're saying is, hey, you know what, you should buy a PS4 instead. Why? Because it plays better games. Oh, and because you can sell your games back.

804
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:26,000
To go back to another point is, you know, talking about the little demos showing all the stuff that they are saying it's gonna do that it doesn't do. Think back to when the Xbox 360 was in previews at E3.

805
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:36,000
We all sat on that floor with the pounding noise that was awful. But it was talking about a lot of things that really didn't happen until more recently.

806
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You know, so I think that it's not necessarily that it is going to do all this. That they want it to do all this and it will eventually do all that. You can't expect instant gratification.

807
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You know, oh, we're gonna have all this. Well, it's gonna happen right away. No, it's not. You have to keep in mind, you know, what happens in reality and, you know, keep on top of the technology.

808
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And so help me keep Peter Molyneaux out of E3.

809
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm gonna put my tinfoil hat on for a minute and just do a what if. I don't really think this, but I think it's worth going down an avenue exploring here for a little bit.

810
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Because like you say, Loki, if the Xbox doesn't play used games and the PlayStation 4 does, then Microsoft might as well seal its own fate right now because they won't be sold in GameStop.

811
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But what if, tinfoil hat, what if Sony and Microsoft are in cahoots. We've heard about the rumors about the trademark or whatever that the Sony discs would be tied to the console.

812
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So we've had this rumor about Sony already. What if Sony and Microsoft have had secret meetings and it's not unheard of that competitors will have meetings about mutually beneficial topics.

813
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Because maybe EA brought them both to the table or somebody else. Okay, so what if they have both decided that used games will not be playable on the consoles? Then what happens?

814
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Then what happens? Then you have people, and this is just, it's really only gonna, it's perception, because let's be honest here, like a lot of the games I buy, I may not necessarily sell used later on.

815
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's just perception in that sense, but there's really nothing forcing me, it's gonna, if buying games, let's say that you can't afford to buy brand new games.

816
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And I understand that. Let's say you're on a tight budget and you need to trade in those old games to make up the money to buy the new games.

817
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Okay, so you can't do that anymore because that option's gone. So what are you gonna do? You're gonna have to train yourself to now wait six months for them to drop the price of the game.

818
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Still buying it new, but you're not buying it full price. And that's what's gonna happen. See, that's the problem. You can get rid of your second hand sales, but you're still gonna have to drop the price of that game at some point.

819
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And now they're just buying it brand new at that same cost. So I don't see why, what's the point in, I don't understand where they're hurting their sales right now, when it's just gonna hurt them down the road anyways, when they start writing off the inventory.

820
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Well, in my whole little tinfoil hat scenario, I agree now with RossTealUT in our chat room. Nintendo would be the only winner in that pact.

821
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Absolutely. Go back to what I said at the beginning of the show where Nintendo can dig themselves out of this hole if Sony and Microsoft fucked themselves, and this would be one way to do it.

822
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Now, I'm gonna take the tinfoil hat off, put it on the table. Here's what I really think. I don't necessarily think these rumors are false, just like I don't think that the rumors about the PlayStation 4 disc protection or whatever is false.

823
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:39,000
However, Microsoft's had a real problem with dev kits. And where do most of these rumors start? They start from disgruntled devs and so forth. Loki, did you not buy a dev kit on eBay?

824
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Not eBay, but yeah.

825
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay. Now, here's the thing. I don't think Microsoft really wants you to have one of those. And it seems to me like a lot of that shit's been floating out there randomly where anybody could get it.

826
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So my thought is, maybe the dev kits always require you to be online, and the dev kits will always be reading or talking to, you know, Microsoft or what have you, to make sure that these games don't leak early.

827
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Because what Microsoft's really trying to combat is not the used game market, but day zero piracy, because that is what hurts the most, is the piracy that gets out there before the game even goes on sale.

828
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You mean like Halo 4 being linked to, like, what, four weeks early, two weeks early?

829
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Ding, ding, ding, absolutely, Loki. That is absolutely it. And I would even say it would be realistic to see that perhaps a game goes on sale digitally just a couple days before it goes on sale in tangible form, not much to GameStop chagrin and so forth.

830
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That's a direction I could see, like, where they go down the line again, and it is all about combating piracy.

831
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That I would see and would understand if that's what they're doing.

832
01:04:48,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And to require an online only console, it's just not going to happen anyways, because not everyone has internet. I mean, even now, our internet, especially high speed internet, not everyone has high speed internet or has reliable high speed internet.

833
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I mean, there's a lot of things that can go wrong.

834
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:21,000
27% of Xbox is never online, according to an Ars Technica article that cited a 2010 study. Granted, in three years a lot can happen, but we could still really, it's got to be above 10%, which is, you know, a number that can't be ignored.

835
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah, so I mean, and let's just say now I understand that some of those may have gone online at some point, but doesn't mean that they're always online. Like, I know, like, sometimes my Xbox doesn't have an internet connection, depending on where I'm using it and stuff.

836
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And that would kind of suck that, oh, I can't play a game on this because, because of some reason, I don't know, if they really want to combat piracy or something, what they could do if you're going to do a one time code thing is have it like a PC game.

837
01:05:48,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Like I have my Grand Theft Auto games and stuff where I can revoke that code at some point, say I want to trade it in or whatever, and I revoke that code and then that way, okay, you don't have that code, you can't really play this game on the system.

838
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That could be one way to do it.

839
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I mean, they'd be trying to hose the rental market because the rental market wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of that one.

840
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yeah, but they don't really care about the rental markets.

841
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Interesting. Interesting. All right, well, we will see in the coming months.

842
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And if it all sucks, if all the consoles suck, there's always Steam and Steam's going to have those same games that are on consoles.

843
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I mean, obviously not the Microsoft first party or Sony first party, but you're going to have a lot of those multiplatform games.

844
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:38,000
By the way, don't expect Sony or Microsoft to be very forthcoming about this in their press conferences or whatever, you know, Sony is doing on February 20th.

845
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
These questions will have to be asked point blank and they will be asked by journalists at E3.

846
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And that is where the answer will be found is when those interviews come out. We shall see.

847
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:58,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, error.

848
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Meanwhile, let's talk about somebody else that's in some trouble right now, Zynga.

849
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Oh boy, it's just been bad news after bad news after bad news.

850
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And, you know, we've had a lot of financial reports lately and apparently another one came out here.

851
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Zynga did pretty bad in 2012. They posted a $209.4 million loss.

852
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
That's not as bad as 2011 when it was a $404.3 million loss.

853
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But keep in mind, they've closed some places since then. They've had to make some cutbacks.

854
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
So, yeah, I don't know if they're going to be shutting down other games or what or what the future holds.

855
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But they're still losing money. Maybe the Facebook thing is over.

856
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
This is, well, I guess maybe not over, but it's not the huge thing that people once thought it was.

857
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Which, again, I would caution Sony and Microsoft in their whole trying to capture that market and so forth.

858
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Look at what's happening to Zynga. It's kind of a fad. Don't marry Facebook. It's only going to get ugly.

859
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You can't play catch up. You just have to come up with something new.

860
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Why marry Facebook when you can make your own Facebook?

861
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And I have a hard time believing Microsoft doesn't want to make their own.

862
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Maybe not necessarily like, you know, the exact same thing that Facebook does.

863
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
But what if they could take some of the parts of Facebook and kind of make Xbox Live a new version of that?

864
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't know. I could see where they maybe want to make their own thing as opposed to just trying to marry something that's already out there.

865
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But then again, it didn't work so well for Apple, so I don't know.

866
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
We here at Microsoft are now going to partner with the new MySpace.

867
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, the new MySpace, as funny as that joke is to make, the new MySpace is really about music and not so much like games or anything else.

868
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I mean, it's really about music and artistry, because that's kind of what MySpace turned into when everybody left it.

869
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It was all artists trying to promote themselves. So, you know, it's kind of like they were all each other's friends.

870
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
MySpace now is trying to compete with Pitchfork.

871
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And Pinterest. But it's like a Pinterest of music is what it is.

872
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's a pinfork.

873
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I was lucky enough to get invited to the thing as in preview or whatever.

874
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And it looked nice, but there was nothing there for me.

875
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I was honestly only there to see how I could pimp Orange Lawn's radio and, you know, the podcast stuff I do.

876
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Like, you know, what's in it for me? Then couldn't find it.

877
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
So not really on it.

878
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

879
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Dark Saga.

880
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, we know of that game company, right?

881
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Sure. Flower, Journey.

882
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well, this is just a little interesting. More put it in here, yeah, just for the interest side of it.

883
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And to help people keep things in perspective.

884
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
When Journey shipped, they were bankrupt.

885
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
They could not pay their employees.

886
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
They, you know, really just went ahead and shipped out the game, you know, with a prayer that they wouldn't lose more.

887
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And as it turned out, you know, that's put them back up, you know, in the top and kept them alive.

888
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So it's just, you know, you think of all these companies that are pretty much, we've been saying sinking ship, sinking ship,

889
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:25,000
but really all it takes is that one shining, you know, gemstone out there that's gonna, you know, bring them back.

890
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Just thought this would be a good one for perspective.

891
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Yeah. Along with that, you know, the old tale about Final Fantasy and why it was called Final Fantasy.

892
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And I'm talking about the original NES version.

893
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It was called Final Fantasy because it was going to be SquareSoft's last game because they were pretty much out of money.

894
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And then, hooray, Final Fantasy ended up being a cash cow.

895
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And so, you know, they've moved on very well since then.

896
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
But yeah, this is kind of a similar sort of story, so.

897
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So just, you know, want to put it out there. Indie developers, don't give up.

898
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You know, you never know what's going to happen.

899
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You never know what's going to happen.

900
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Just don't make shit and you'll be okay.

901
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

902
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Going to the last story a little bit, Technus wants to clarify, Microsoft already has a deal with Facebook.

903
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That's why you see Bing Maps and Bing Translate on Facebook.

904
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I don't know what the limit of exclusivity it would be to that.

905
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I know it's a hard word to pronounce, isn't it? Exclusiveness.

906
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Exclusivity?

907
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
That still doesn't stop Microsoft from necessarily doing their own thing.

908
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
What does Facebook get out of it?

909
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Maybe the Skype integration thing?

910
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Because that was something they were really hyping up for their messenger and chat was that, you know, their Skype.

911
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So yeah, I guess you're right.

912
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Microsoft and Facebook already have some ties.

913
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't do their own thing.

914
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Nor could Sony, although I don't, like, based on history, I don't think Sony would pull it off very well.

915
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
But you never know. I might be surprised.

916
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Sony might have bought a company that fell off my radar that could do it.

917
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So, who knows?

918
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I am also, like, just totally, like, mass hypothesizing, making shit up.

919
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But who wouldn't want to get, like, a Facebook for gamers?

920
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I mean, that would seem like, and I think there are some startups out there kind of trying to capitalize on that a bit.

921
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But nobody's really struck gold with that idea yet.

922
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I wouldn't believe that the publishers themselves aren't trying to do that a little bit.

923
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Look at Miiverse.

924
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Kind of moving that direction a little bit.

925
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
As much as Nintendo can.

926
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming to a game store near you very soon.

927
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Loki, we'll start with you on the US dates.

928
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
This week, the big game coming out would be Aliens Colonial Marines on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC.

929
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Also, Brain Age concentration training out on the 3DS.

930
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Actually, I think today.

931
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Brain Age is still a thing?

932
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I thought that was just, like, a fad.

933
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
They were just trying.

934
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, people buy it.

935
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on 3DS this week.

936
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Omerta, City of Gangsters on Xbox 360.

937
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And I want to say that I think that's it.

938
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Because there wasn't that much coming out this week.

939
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Technic... I guess it's...

940
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
What's today here?

941
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I guess technically within the week.

942
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Next Sunday, they're going to be having the Zombie U Nintendo Wii U 32GBi Deluxe set.

943
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It's going to be a Zombie U and a digital copy of Nintendo Land.

944
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So you're not going to have much of that hard drive left over.

945
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I like how Ubisoft waited for that to go to the factory before they fucked Nintendo.

946
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Anyhow.

947
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, hey, let's make this deal.

948
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, and fuck you, huh?

949
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I know. That's business. That is business.

950
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Going to Japan, checking out the Japanese releases.

951
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
On Valentine's Day, which happens to be release day in Japan.

952
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
PlayStation 3, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II.

953
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Price drops for Dragon's Dogma and Lollipop Chainsaw.

954
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because Lollipop Chainsaw is getting the Valentine's edition on February 14th.

955
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Even though it's a steaming festering pile of poo?

956
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yes, even though it's a steaming festering pile of poo.

957
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
That's an opinion.

958
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Lots of stuff on the Xbox 360. Who would have thought I said that?

959
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Of course, most of this is price reductions.

960
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Lollipop Chainsaw connects Star Wars, Gears of War 3, Disneyland Adventures,

961
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Forza 4, Dragon's Dogma, Dance Central 2, all of those getting price reductions this week in Japan.

962
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And as far as new stuff goes, Aliens, Colonel Marines, Combat Wings,

963
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
The Great Battles of World War II, and Giga Force come out this week in Japan.

964
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Those are all new things.

965
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You know what?

966
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
On the 14th? What?

967
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
About that, Aliens, Colonial Marines, I actually want that game.

968
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yeah? Why's that?

969
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Because, and God, why can't I never remember his damn name?

970
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
The guy who played Bishop is reprising his role.

971
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Oh, that's cool.

972
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
But you know who else? He voiced Admiral Hackett.

973
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Of course. Oh, you. Oh, you.

974
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
PlayStation Vita in Japan this week gets Sakura no Pet na Kanojo in regular and limited editions.

975
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And Silent Hill Book of Memories gets its Japanese release.

976
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Girls' Pets?

977
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Just in time. Better than girls' butts.

978
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Just in time for Valentine's Day Silent Hill game on the Vita.

979
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Absolutely nothing on the Wii U, but Tank Tank Tank is out in the near future,

980
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
although I thought that was going free to play or something was happening.

981
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I don't know. It's on my list for some reason for next week.

982
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
They have like a demo or something that's coming out that you can...

983
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Like a retail version.

984
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Unlock parts of the demo or something if you pay money. I don't know. It's weird.

985
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
On the 3DS this week, Marugo 3D Na Nami Tu Ishiho Na Ga Kubo English Jo Satsu no Kotsu Riron Hen.

986
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What the hell is that? I don't know.

987
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's got a cute anime girl, though.

988
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Because, you know, that's everything.

989
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That's it. That's the one screenshot I have.

990
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
That could just be the box art. The game probably has nothing to do with that.

991
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So I don't know what that is, but it's not any big series.

992
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Quickly checking to see if they're still putting stuff out on the PSP.

993
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
They are. PSP getting some releases this week.

994
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Battle Robot Tamashi from Bandai Namco this week on the PSP.

995
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Dark Sakura, how about the other side of the Atlantic?

996
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
As soon as I can make my iPad go there.

997
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
We only have on the 12th, we have Aliens Colonial Marines.

998
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And to answer your earlier question about the game, courtesy of Tiger Claw, Lance Henriksen.

999
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That's it. I knew it was some sort of Icelandic sounding name.

1000
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Was he a Stargate guy? Why do I associate him with Stargate?

1001
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I think, wasn't he in Atlantis?

1002
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I associate him with Stargate for some reason.

1003
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I stopped watching Stargate after season 8, so.

1004
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There's been a fuck ton of Stargate, too.

1005
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Just the SG-1 series.

1006
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If you haven't been following Stargate since the original movie that the guy who made Independence Day did all those years ago,

1007
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
there's been a fuck ton of Stargate that's been happening. Just so you know.

1008
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
But no MMO frown.

1009
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You know what, Becky and I used to marathon SG-1 because I have all those box sets I'm probably gonna sell.

1010
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And we both decided that season 4 sucks.

1011
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I had an ex that was really into Stargate. It's a good show. I'm not gonna hate it.

1012
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Season 7 was good.

1013
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Alright, a few more news stories for you guys and then we'll get into the classic game of the week. Loki.

1014
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Alright, so let's talk about the independent console that's coming out.

1015
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Ouya!

1016
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Ouya is gonna be making its way out for Kickstarter backers in March, but if you didn't get in on that action, then you can actually pick one up at retail.

1017
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It's gonna be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and the store that's into everything electronics nowadays, GameStop.

1018
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You can buy one for $99 there or an extra controller for $49.99.

1019
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Think about it. If the new Xbox doesn't play used games, there will be more Ouya merchandise at GameStop than there will be Xbox Lube or 720 or whatever they call it.

1020
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yeah, they're gonna really have to grease you up to get you to buy one of those.

1021
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And then to go with that, of course, they're saying that, yeah, you may buy an Ouya this year, but it doesn't mean that there's not gonna be an Ouya 2 next year or an Ouya 3 the year after that.

1022
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:39,000
In fact, they're planning on doing a new one each year because they can take advantage of better, faster processors and falling prices and that kind of stuff.

1023
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:49,000
They figure, hey, you know what? If there's consoles coming out there that, or I should say tablets that are making new iterations each year, why not the Ouya, I guess?

1024
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So I guess we can expect some more of those.

1025
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And then, of course, they've partnered up with Double Fine and, well, let's see here, Paul Bettner, who is the creator of Words with Friends.

1026
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And they're gonna be bringing the Cave and Reds to Ouya, I guess. These are pretty big games.

1027
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I've never heard of Reds, but the Cave I'm well aware of because that just came out.

1028
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And then, last but not least, this month, of course, to go along with the whole Kickstarter backers getting their consoles next month, they are going through the approval process right now.

1029
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And I'm a little disappointed. I mean, out of some, like two-thirds of this, I'm okay.

1030
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:43,000
They're basically looking at games being submitted to them and they're checking for intellectual property infringement, malware, and excessive pornography.

1031
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I'm glad that they added excessive in there.

1032
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So a little, a little titty's okay.

1033
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
A little pornography is alright.

1034
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So no to Ouya developers, a little titty's okay.

1035
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I still think there should be excessive pornography. I mean, hell, that should be the title of a game, Excessive Pornography, the game.

1036
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
That would be awesome.

1037
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Is that, dare I say, is that an OLR dream game, Excessive Pornography?

1038
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Excessive Pornography, that's the internet, okay. That's just the internet.

1039
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That's everybody's dream game. That's not an OLR dream game.

1040
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That's the internet stream game.

1041
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
The Excessive Pornography, featuring random pictures of low cats for no reason.

1042
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That's the internet, right there.

1043
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But, yeah, so they're supposed to be doing that and they said the process should begin in the middle of the end of this month.

1044
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And of course, I don't know, we'll see once, at least I know I have one game spoken for when that comes out.

1045
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Going to the chat, some strong opinions about the whole yearly upgrades of the Ouya.

1046
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Rama in chat says, a new Ouya each year is suicide.

1047
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
To which a lot of people jumped in and said iPhone, iPad, I even said the Nintendo DS called and said you're wrong.

1048
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
New Ouya every year, is that suicide to admit that this early?

1049
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Well, no, because here's the thing. Remember, you may be buying this console right now and you're like, oh, they're going to have a new one next year.

1050
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But everything about this console is meant to be hacked.

1051
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
So, they could sell you, hey, we have an upgraded processor, boom, put it in your console.

1052
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Or go buy that. Or, hell, hey, we're going to use Tegra 4 now or something like that.

1053
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
If you want to put a Tegra 4 chip in there, here's the board to do it.

1054
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And they can sell you parts. It may not cost you as much as buying a brand new console each time around.

1055
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So, I don't really have a problem with that, if that's going to be the way they're going to go about it.

1056
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Because it's optional. I mean, hell, you can hack this thing apart and play emulators on it.

1057
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
What the hell do you need a quad-core processor for that shit? I mean, you don't.

1058
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Comment from RossDielUT in our chat room, the Ouya is an open platform. We're going to see excessive porn on it anyway.

1059
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Good point.

1060
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It has access to the internet.

1061
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Will it have a web browser?

1062
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Is it connected to the internet?

1063
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Excessive porn for all! Yay!

1064
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That is one thing we can look forward to with an always connected Xbox system, is it's always going to have access to pornography on the internet.

1065
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Xbox! Tits!

1066
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Can you imagine?

1067
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Can you imagine?

1068
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It shows me Britney Spears' greatest hits.

1069
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
That's not what I said!

1070
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Xbox pornography and Lumen Room and just like boobs flying at you at every angle.

1071
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Yeah! This is next gen!

1072
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Like seriously, okay, if Microsoft could come out at E3 and show that as the demo and then just slip in there.

1073
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
By the way, it won't play used games, but it will totally show you tits.

1074
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Then people will be like, forgiven. You're forgiven.

1075
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Everything negative we said about the used games.

1076
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
It's not going to play used games, but it can do this.

1077
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's like, whoa!

1078
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Whoa!

1079
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.

1080
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Dark Sakura, would you buy one?

1081
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
If Aluma Room would not play used games, would it show you all the boobies you could dream of?

1082
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm thinking about it.

1083
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Like Katy Perry can get up in your face and be knocking that back and forth.

1084
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
That picture of Katy Perry, all over your walls, everywhere.

1085
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Oh no, that's pretty hard to say no to, Rob.

1086
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And see, with Aluma Room, because it's all going to be interactive, you could walk up into that and just like, smack.

1087
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Just put your face all up in it.

1088
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Achievement unlocked.

1089
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
No one can resist motorboat.

1090
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
It's like Cobra Triangle 2.

1091
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Alright, one more story for you guys.

1092
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Back when gaming was so simple.

1093
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
A retro gaming story for you guys.

1094
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Before we were picturing Aluma Room projecting boobies all over the walls.

1095
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You didn't have this in these classic games.

1096
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But this is still pretty cool, a way to make it modern.

1097
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It's the Capcom Arcade Cabinet.

1098
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
We've been talking about this game for a little bit on the show.

1099
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Finally, the details coming out about this game.

1100
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
It's going to come out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on February 19th.

1101
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
A teaser trailer went out this week showing the games that will be in it.

1102
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Black Tiger, 1943.

1103
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Ghosts and Goblins, Legendary Wings, Commando, Avengers Section Z.

1104
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And I am really excited about this.

1105
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Pirate Ship Higemaru is coming out as well.

1106
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I love that game, it's a fun little puzzler.

1107
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Reminds me a lot of like, Pingo.

1108
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
But anyway, the games individually will be four bucks.

1109
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
But if you want to get a bundle of three games, it will be ten dollars.

1110
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Except the very first pack is like, discounted or whatever, five dollars.

1111
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That is Avengers 1943 and Black Tiger.

1112
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Here's the best part.

1113
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
In the trailer, it says that you can play these games online with friends.

1114
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So finally, somebody getting the retro thing right.

1115
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And making it so that I can play the games online across the internets.

1116
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Pretty excited about this.

1117
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I hope the games play well.

1118
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But it sounds pretty cool.

1119
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Dark Sakura, would this be something you're interested in at all?

1120
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Or no, because you kind of already have the retro stuff?

1121
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Honestly, all those games that you listed are games that we own.

1122
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So, um, it's cool though.

1123
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's cool for people who don't already have this stuff, yeah.

1124
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
The modernization, being able to play online.

1125
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Yeah, that sounds fun.

1126
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Casual mode I think was advertised too.

1127
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Maybe to make the arcade games a little easier.

1128
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Maybe so that you can actually beat ghosts and goblins, maybe?

1129
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm assuming that's what that means.

1130
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Well, Dan can beat it.

1131
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Well, Dan's a freak. And I mean that in the most loving way possible.

1132
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah.

1133
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Uh, let's go. Speaking of classic games, I don't even need a segue this week.

1134
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
We're already talking about classic games.

1135
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So let's go to the classic game of the week.

1136
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Which I believe is also a Capcom game, although not one that's been announced.

1137
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yes it is.

1138
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh, it's like you knew.

1139
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But you ruined how I wanted to introduce it though.

1140
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1141
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Because I wanted you to play the YouTube clip so that you could get the...

1142
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Well, I gave a hint. I didn't tell you the game.

1143
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Well, play the little opening start on YouTube.

1144
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And it's not in the Capcom Hits collection. I'll tell you that much.

1145
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Here we go. Here is a clip from this week's classic game of the week.

1146
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000


1147
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
LOL internet. I don't know if...

1148
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
There we go.

1149
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah. We're getting a little bit of buffering today.

1150
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I'm sorry. I should have loaded this in advance.

1151
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Advance again.

1152
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's because I missed the cue sound.

1153
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Anyway, I'll do it.

1154
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Here it is. It's coming up.

1155
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
That should be enough for people to get what the game is.

1156
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
All right. What is it, Darkseid?

1157
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, also known in the US as Super Pocket Fighter 2 Turbo.

1158
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Also known as we had all these art assets from Puzzle Fighter.

1159
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
We needed to make another game out of it.

1160
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Well, Matt, I think this came out around the same time. It came out in 97.

1161
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It was a CPS2 arcade machine.

1162
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And it came out on the PlayStation, which kept the Pocket Fighter title for the American and European release.

1163
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
It came out on the Wonderswan, the Sega Saturn, and the PS2 as part of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

1164
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It's basically got all these characters in Super Deformed.

1165
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And they beat the crap out of each other using very cutesy attacks.

1166
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It also has characters from Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalker, Street Fighter 3, and from Red Earth.

1167
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
That game is totally on my list of CPS3 games that I want to play.

1168
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I've never gotten to play a copy of that.

1169
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It also has just a whole ton of different characters that make appearances throughout the game.

1170
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You know, just little cameos.

1171
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So basically it's standard fighting.

1172
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And they have power-ups that match the characters that actually came from Red Earth, that system.

1173
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And then little orbs that you can catch that are thrown as your opponent to basically mimic the elemental hits in Darkstalkers.

1174
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So you can turn people to stone. You can freeze them.

1175
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And then you start with one of each of those.

1176
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
You have two bars and three sub-bars.

1177
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
You have a life bar and a super bar.

1178
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And then you have your mighty combo, which I always laughed at that.

1179
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Your sub-bars are basically your level of your special moves.

1180
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And your levels correspond to different colors.

1181
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
So some people have extras, some don't.

1182
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But basically every time you hit a character, gems pop out.

1183
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And then you pick up the gems to power up.

1184
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So that's where it gets gem-biter from.

1185
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And basically four buttons.

1186
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Punch, kick, special, taunt.

1187
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Which taunt is of course the best thing ever.

1188
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So anyway, you also have flash combos or costume combos.

1189
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Where if you press a combination of punch or kick buttons after striking the opponent with a punch button,

1190
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,000
then they actually will change into different costumes during the sequence, except for you.

1191
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
And has a very different strong attack at the end.

1192
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Here are some examples.

1193
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Chilly turns into Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.

1194
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Felicia turns into Mega Man.

1195
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And I remember Ibuki had her little schoolgirl outfit and all of that.

1196
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So the characters in the game, you have Ryu.

1197
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You have Ken, you have Zangief, you have Chun-Li, you have Sakura and Ibuki, all from the Street Fighter series.

1198
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
You have Morigen, Sienkou, or Lele as she was in Japan, and Felicia.

1199
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And then you have Tessa in Japan, who is also in Japan.

1200
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Tabasa, which I think was supposed to be Tabitha, but why didn't they just call her Tabitha over here?

1201
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I don't know.

1202
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And she's the only Red Earth character in the game.

1203
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You also have secret characters.

1204
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
You have Gohki, or Akuma, and he's very powerful.

1205
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
And then you have Dan.

1206
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And basically his story is probably the most hilarious one.

1207
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
He's looking for students, he's looking for students, he's looking for students.

1208
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He's looking for students to start a school, so he's trying to get Sakura to be his student.

1209
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But she left the school after three days and wrote him a letter saying that she's already mastered everything that he could teach her,

1210
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and that his moves are worthless in a fight, and she calls him a loser.

1211
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And he cries.

1212
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And I think all he knocks out are gems of the same color, I want to say.

1213
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Or maybe that's in Puzzle Fighter, when all he drops are red gems.

1214
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Anyway.

1215
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It is just a fun little game. It's one of my favorite fighting games of all time, and it's just completely cracked out.

1216
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I don't know if I've played this game an awful lot. I think I've played it like once.

1217
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oh, I see. There's the little part where she turned into Jill Valentine, and then of course the video buffered, but oh well.

1218
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Yeah, so that's the game.

1219
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Nice. So there it is, your classic game of the week, Pocket Fighter.

1220
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Which I've got two copies of. On different systems, on different systems.

1221
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
As part of your collection that you counted up this week.

1222
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
But my favorite to play is on Saturn.

1223
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000


1224
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Because it's awesome with the Saturn controller.

1225
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And that's it.

1226
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Not that, sorry. I was trying to load something else that's coming up later in the show.

1227
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Live radio, isn't it a blast?

1228
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Alright. We are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come.

1229
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
The Frugal Question of the Week coming up when we get back, as well as some rapid fire news and movie and gaming news.

1230
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And this one sounds like it could be pretty cool.

1231
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
We'll see you when we get back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.

1232
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1233
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Live with our 492nd episode in progress here, as we go into the second half of the show.

1234
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:31,000
February the 10th of 2013. And boy, the internet's having some lols tonight. I don't know if it's the snowstorms back east or what.

1235
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But yeah, we were having some problems playing off YouTube earlier.

1236
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And Twitter's all clogged up with crap on the Grammys. Should I blame the Grammys for this?

1237
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I blame the Grammys for everything.

1238
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I see all these people posting status updates about the Grammys and I'm just like judging you all.

1239
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Because the Grammys aren't even that good.

1240
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But whatever. People feel the need to watch it for whatever reason.

1241
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
The Walking Dead stuff I get. Unless people are spoiling it. In which case, you're an asshole.

1242
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You shouldn't spoil TV shows like that.

1243
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
But now what do you do now that we have shows like, what's that called? That House of Cards? It's on Netflix.

1244
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Where it's like, they just released the whole show at once. So go watch all 10 episodes or whatever.

1245
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It kind of breaks the conventional weekly shows. So how do you not spoil something that you could have just blown through on a weekend?

1246
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I don't know how you do it with movies.

1247
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I guess that's true. It's like a really long movie. It's a miniseries.

1248
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It's like a Lord of the Rings extended cut.

1249
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Exactly, right?

1250
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Anyhow, let us move on with some rapid fire news.

1251
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Alright.

1252
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Let's see.

1253
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge. Remember that Wii exclusive game?

1254
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah, it's not a Wii exclusive anymore.

1255
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
This is actually kind of interesting because remember the Wii version was actually published by Nintendo.

1256
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,000
However, they will be coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 April 2nd.

1257
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And it's being published of course by Tecmo Koei.

1258
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And yeah, so they're going to have all that additional stuff in there.

1259
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I guess kind of think of it like a Game of the Year edition except your game didn't win Game of the Year.

1260
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Re-release of the cheaper version edition with extra stuff in it.

1261
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So yeah, not so much of that exclusiveness anymore.

1262
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
We may have a glimpse of one of the first next gen games.

1263
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt, which I got to be honest looks a lot like Monster Hunter, but whatever.

1264
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It's going to be the cover of the next Game Informer and it is also a next gen title they announced.

1265
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Especially running on CD Projekt's Red Engine 3, which I guess will be used for that game.

1266
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I don't know if that's going to be the same engine that they're going to run on.

1267
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
The, what was it, Cyberpunk or whatever.

1268
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But apparently the game is supposed to be open world.

1269
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's going to be, I guess, I think you could say the world is going to be larger than Skyrim.

1270
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And larger than any of the environments featured in the first two Witcher games.

1271
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And it looks pretty.

1272
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the subtitle Wild Hunt, but it could be a cool game.

1273
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And it's due out in 2014.

1274
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
They say for PC and high end platforms, or next gen consoles obviously.

1275
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
So that's always an option.

1276
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And last but not least, one of the news announcements while we're out was Grand Theft Auto 5 was delayed to September.

1277
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Kind of something that I alluded to I think the last time we talked maybe.

1278
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That Grand Theft Auto they were looking at to see if it was ready.

1279
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And if it was ready it was going to be coming out at the end of May.

1280
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
If not, it's going to be pushed and it got pushed.

1281
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I've had some people ask me on Twitter, Loki, so how are you doing with all this news?

1282
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
How are you coping?

1283
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Are you okay?

1284
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
One day at a time.

1285
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
We honestly didn't know what we were going to do as far as like...

1286
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Because it was kind of like, oh, we'll play Modern Warfare 3 for a while and then by the time we're getting bored of it we'll have Grand Theft Auto 5.

1287
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And now it's delayed another potentially four months from when we were expecting it.

1288
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We're like, I don't know what we're going to do now.

1289
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It was tough.

1290
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
But obviously it's for polish.

1291
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Some people were like, oh, they're delaying it so they can get our next gen consoles.

1292
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Dad, your next gen consoles are coming out in September.

1293
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
No, no, that's stupid.

1294
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And they even said, you know, basically to those of you who were seeing various conspiracy theories about there being some other ulterior motive for this delay, rest assured they're all nonsense.

1295
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Literally the only reason we delayed the release is because we want the game to be as good as it needs to be.

1296
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Just throwing it out there, could it be too late?

1297
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Because sometimes when games come out too close to another system being launched, they get cannibalized a little bit.

1298
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,000


1299
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 is too big for that?

1300
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
No, it's too big for that.

1301
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I always kind of say that's why people missed Final Fantasy XII because it kind of landed in a scenario like that.

1302
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I think if anything, if you think about it, it could cannibalize the sales of the next gen consoles because look at it.

1303
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Like if they don't have a strong lineup for the next gen consoles, they'd be like, well, I don't need to buy a new Xbox.

1304
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I can just have a regular Xbox 360 and play Grand Theft Auto 5 that just came out or the next Assassin's Creed game or, you know, all these big titles that are coming out in the fall.

1305
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Some folks in the chat room saying Grand Theft Auto 6 on the next gen consoles.

1306
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I can't even fathom what that would be like, but yes.

1307
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
If they sell.

1308
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Well, how about some more classic stuff? Another old school gaming compilation announced this past week, PlayStation Home Arcade.

1309
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's something available on the Vita.

1310
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:18,000
What happens is that you can buy these arcade games that you can play on the Vita and then you also get them in your PlayStation Home in those little cabinets.

1311
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And some of the games that are actually free are things that you see free in PlayStation Home.

1312
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Like what is the Icebreaker or something like that? I don't know what it's called.

1313
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:36,000
But there's some other like actual classic games that are a part of this, including Time Pilot, Asteroids, Centipede, and yes, Loki, Frogger.

1314
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
A couple of television games in there too, Shark Shark and Astro Smash, which I thought was interesting.

1315
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Do you have to wait in line to play those games on?

1316
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Not on your Vita.

1317
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Can I play on roller skates?

1318
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And the privacy of your own home.

1319
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
For the record, playing Frogger on roller skates is difficult.

1320
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
You will not think it is.

1321
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Playing Spy Hunter on roller skates was awesome.

1322
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And yes, they did have a Spy Hunter machine at the roller rink when I was growing up.

1323
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Why? I don't know.

1324
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
The roller rink that I used to go to still had their Frogger when I went back like 10 years ago.

1325
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:18,000
What if PlayStation Home is the next gen console? It's like, this is PlayStation Home. It's in your home.

1326
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Okay, now you're trolling.

1327
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Alright, next up. Another rumor, folks. We love our rumors, don't we?

1328
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:33,000
This one's about Sonic, and apparently the next Sonic game to be announced is supposed to be Sonic Adventure 3.

1329
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Hmm. Apparently there were some registered domains back in July, and people were speculating on this.

1330
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But apparently, I don't know what this latest rumor is that's going on, but the game was going to be revealed for current gen and next gen platforms on February 2nd and 3rd.

1331
01:39:52,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That never actually happened, though. This is all, of course, internet speculation, but, I mean, Sonic Adventure 3 sounds probable, doesn't it?

1332
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:09,000
It sounds like it has a good enough chance as any of the other Sonic games that they put out, in which case it's like a coin toss, whether it'll do well.

1333
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Who remembers a classic arcade game by Capcom called Gunsmoke?

1334
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Didn't I do it in a classic game?

1335
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Maybe. I don't remember. Hopefully.

1336
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Or as one of my favorite video review shows calls it, Gun.Smoke?

1337
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Yeah, Gun.Smoke. Yeah, because not to be confused with the TV show Gunsmoke. It had nothing to do with that.

1338
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:37,000
But Gun.Smoke had a freeware remake done of it, which I'm sure was not legal at all, but, well, somebody did their own little remake.

1339
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
They wanted to keep the NES port of the version intact. They didn't want to rip the assets from the arcade game or whatever.

1340
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:52,000
They played the original a whole bunch of times trying to make it just perfect, and there's a whole little, again, here I go playing a YouTube, but hopefully this one will actually work.

1341
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Not bad. Looks pretty spot on to me. That's what I remember from the NES one.

1342
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Oh man, I love the boss that throws all the bombs and then he loses his pants.

1343
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What I remember about the NES one, though, was the slow-mo, because you could hit start over and over again and make it run in that slow-mo mode, and even the NES Advantage had that little button on it that was just, hit start as fast as you can.

1344
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Hey, bullet time before bullet time.

1345
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That's the only way you could beat Gun.Smoke, by the way. Unless you're Dan or something.

1346
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Oh, my man. He is so awesome.

1347
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So, was that your series?

1348
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Well, Bethesda put out an announcement that the Rage, the official toolkit for Rage is out on Steam, and it's going to be 35 plus gigabytes.

1349
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Well, actually, no, it's out, but to quote John Carmack, he's saying the toolkit release is not something that we consider consumer friendly, but it does let you get a good look inside the construction process.

1350
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So, pretty cool, huh?

1351
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Also, EA has zero intention of patching a loot exploit in Dead Space 3.

1352
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Basically, it lets you pretty much farm for resources that would cost you currency and microtransactions, and EA is saying, okay, go for it. We don't care.

1353
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
The microtransactions are just convenience.

1354
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:39,000
And when I saw this, thank you Catastrophic Moggy for giving me this link when we had our lovely, for me, 3 a.m. chat, but Farmville is going to have an animated series out done by Brett Ratner.

1355
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
You know what else he's given us? X-Men Last Stand, That Turd.

1356
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Rush Hour movies, I think were him.

1357
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Red Dragon.

1358
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
So, yeah, and actually...

1359
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
This sounds like terrible fan rumor stuff, so I hope that's what it is.

1360
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:06,000
According to the Wall Street Journal, it will be produced by Ratner in association with 611 Media, a Canadian television company.

1361
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And other producers are Kirk Schenk, Charles Bishop, and Nina Gelb.

1362
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Did you say the Canadian television company?

1363
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,000


1364
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Well, when somebody asked me, what about all the bad things Canada did, I will remember this one.

1365
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
But I can always forgive Canada.

1366
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I know, they did give us You Can't Do That on television.

1367
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
For two reasons.

1368
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Rush.

1369
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That's true.

1370
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Because Neil Peart is the best drummer in the universe.

1371
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And I do love Misa Milanis, Haters Gonna Hate.

1372
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And Canada's Rush Driver. Seriously, watch it on YouTube. The show is awesome.

1373
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And I'm going to give a pre-emptive F you to the people who won season 8, just saying you guys don't need to be driving.

1374
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
That's it.

1375
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Alright, let's move on to the Frugal Question of the Week. We got a ton of responses this week on the Frugal Question of the Week.

1376
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Which is great. We love hearing from all of our listeners.

1377
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But yes, the Frugal Question of the Week.

1378
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Take Facebook and Google and smash those words together, you get Frugal.

1379
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And we ask a question of our fan communities each week.

1380
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You guys give us answers and we read some of them on the show.

1381
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I am not going to be able to read them all tonight.

1382
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
You guys were too good this week.

1383
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So please visit our fan communities at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see the answers in their entirety.

1384
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
We'll start with Google Plus once I, of course, tell you the question.

1385
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
It's a short one tonight, but a good one.

1386
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I think we've all heard the rumor about the next Xbox blocking used games.

1387
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Do you believe this rumor could be true?

1388
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
For that matter, how much do you tend to believe industry rumors?

1389
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
We get a lot of rumors. How do you feel about this one and do rumors carry a lot of weight with you?

1390
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Over on Google Plus, Tech EQ says, my stance on game industry rumors has to be to take them with a grain of salt.

1391
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
This leads to less heartache if a particular rumor doesn't come true or vice versa.

1392
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Isn't that the truth? There's already people saying I'm not going to buy the next console based on rumors alone.

1393
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It's a little early to call that, don't you think?

1394
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I think that's also kind of going back to what we were talking about in part A where, you know,

1395
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Rayman Legends and how all the fans are pissed off about it right now.

1396
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Come September they're going to just buy the game anyways.

1397
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
E3VL or Evil says on Google Plus, sources are barely creditable these days.

1398
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Seeing the internet being first on a news site is better than having long wait times to confirm information when it comes to rumors and speculation.

1399
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
If anyone tries to discredit the website later down the line, they can label the article as,

1400
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
it was just a rumor, as if it was some magical phrase to get them out of the situation.

1401
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
So, you know, one of those whole, it's become about hits, hits, hits.

1402
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And certainly the ESA only fosters that attitude when it's all about the hits to get your site validated by them.

1403
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So you may be blessed by the ESA Pope to go to E3.

1404
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
The ESA Pope.

1405
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Well, that's what it is. You have to email the ESA Pope and say, please, I would like to be blessed to go to your E3 event.

1406
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And then they judge, you are, you stand in front of the gates and your website is judged.

1407
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:14,000
How many hits did you accumulate in December of last year and ye are worthy or no reply?

1408
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Now I'm picturing what his Pope mobile looks like, you know, with the glass and probably pulled by light cycles.

1409
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Yes. I actually envisioned that the ESA Pope is basically Dame Edna.

1410
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yes, it's Dame Edna.

1411
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Why hello my puppets. Oh, it's Orange Lounge Radio is applying to go to E3. Who are they?

1412
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
What does Orange Lounge have to do with a video game?

1413
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
By the way, you mentioned Dame Edna. You know what I found the other day?

1414
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
The picture I did for Xtaphir of Dame Edna saying pandarens.

1415
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Random.

1416
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
No game or, you know, video in their title.

1417
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Gamer tag radio. I've never heard of you.

1418
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Anyhow, moving on. That's a Twitter joke, by the way. He'll appreciate that joke. I know.

1419
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Moving on, going to Facebook and talking about rumors over there.

1420
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Critical Myth from our friends over at the Critical Myth show, Monday, Wednesday, Fridays here on VOG.

1421
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Critical Myth says, I think they will attempt it, talking about the Xbox use game thing,

1422
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and have some way of linking a game to your Xbox Live account.

1423
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But I also think that they will come to an agreement with the evil G and other used game outlets to make the online pass concept into a game unlock fee.

1424
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So basically you buy it new, no fee, get it used, pay to play.

1425
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
What do you think about the whole unlock fee?

1426
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It's money grubbing because all the excuses that they were saying before that, oh, it's gonna be, you know, all the developers lose all their money.

1427
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Developers aren't getting paid for that anyways. I mean, you pay the developer and they may have commissions or whatever based on it,

1428
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
but when they're being sold to, you know, distributors or retailers or whatever, it doesn't matter if they sell through.

1429
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,000
It's just, you're gonna put them out of business if you get rid of used games, because that's how they make their money,

1430
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
because your margins in your games are terrible.

1431
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Unless all of a sudden they start giving, you know, retailers way better costs on goods,

1432
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:32,000
then that's the only thing that's gonna really drive new games, because if it becomes more profitable to sell a new title than it does used,

1433
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
then they're gonna, you know, go that route.

1434
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Brandon C. on Facebook five hours ago was saying something we brought up here on the show.

1435
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,000
The only way to enforce it would be some sort of always online requirement and Sony and Microsoft coming together to make it happen.

1436
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
There's no way Microsoft would block used games without Sony agreeing to do the same.

1437
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
So, funny enough, that point I brought up earlier with the...

1438
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
The new axis of evil, huh?

1439
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah. Red the Haze replies in part,

1440
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I think people are overreacting to the news because everyone's excited for the new generation and any information,

1441
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
even rumors, are given a lot of attention.

1442
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Gamers should just shut up and finish their backlogs already.

1443
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah. Shut up and go eat your backlog.

1444
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
No dessert for you. That's actually really good advice.

1445
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Kids in China have no backlog.

1446
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I made Bob turn red. That was awesome.

1447
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Well, that was a witty retort. It's very true.

1448
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Let's see. Gary Baxter on Facebook replies,

1449
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I take everything I hear with a grain of salt until someone with real pull in the company confirms it.

1450
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
However, this does sound like Microsoft would do to get more sales on titles that most people would wait and pick up used from the evil G or a pawn shop.

1451
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
But until an official spokesperson says yea or nay, all we can do is wait.

1452
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Let's see. VX Jason XV says, it already happened. Hello, non-code based digital downloads.

1453
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Industry rumors are silly. Peers spin in exactly the same way as positive announcements, but are often able to be traced back to something specific.

1454
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
One more here from Dark Charger.

1455
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
It wouldn't be all that surprising. Online passes were already signs of things to come.

1456
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
The next generation is bound to do even more to cripple our out and out eliminate the used market as we know it.

1457
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,000
The key we'll really boil down to is implementation. If it's clunky, inconvenient, or overly restrictive, it's going to be a non-starter.

1458
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:43,000
While these are still unsubstantiated rumors, I could totally see a future where all game purchases are tied to a user account or gamertag via a key that ships with a disk or linked via digital download.

1459
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Good thought. We didn't even name before, which I'm sure we've all got to be thinking about, but what if your Xbox has to be always online?

1460
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Xbox Live goes down sometimes. Look at tonight. We've got those snowstorms going on that are knocking things out.

1461
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:06,000
What if the internet was too choppy and you couldn't maintain your connection? Are you just hosed? Screw you and your $60 game?

1462
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Shouldn't they learn from Ubisoft that tried to do this shit with their DRM and how well that worked?

1463
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Honestly, I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the infrastructure in place to where that's a guarantee that you're going to have an internet connection.

1464
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I just don't see that that would be a viable option.

1465
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Now, granted, they could try crazy things if they want, but it doesn't mean it's going to work.

1466
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Alright, I'm going to read one more answer. I was going to end it there, but I've got to do this one last answer because I think this is pretty good.

1467
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I think they're all good, but this one kind of brings up a different point here I want to read.

1468
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It's SSJ100Matt on Facebook.

1469
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I'm going to put the tinfoil hat on and say, I believe it, only because I think that Microsoft purposely leaked this rumor to gauge the community's reaction and plan their approach from there.

1470
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I've got to stop there. What did they think was going to happen?

1471
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Oh, yes, the community is going to love this. I mean, really?

1472
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,000
The problem with if you're going to gauge interest is there's no upside to that.

1473
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Oh, we're going to get rid of your ability to play used games.

1474
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Hooray!

1475
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,000
If it was like, we're going to get rid of the ability for you to play used games, but all the games that are going to retail for $20 cheaper than they were now, then that would be okay.

1476
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I'm okay with not being able to play used games, but I can get my games cheaper at launch. I'm fine with that.

1477
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yes, yes, actually, yes. I would be totally okay with all of this if all games were $19.99.

1478
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Think about it. Would suddenly this not be such bad news if games weren't $60 anymore? What if Halo 5 was $20?

1479
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yeah, that's not a big deal.

1480
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
It's not a big deal, is it? Okay, yeah, you're right. Take away my ability to play used games. If you're willing to put that commitment in, so am I.

1481
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I usually don't buy games until they drop down that low now.

1482
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Anyhow, continuing on with the comment here. I think Microsoft has seen enough from companies like EA where they seem to have gotten away with charging for passes for online play in their games.

1483
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I think it's only a matter of time before we see console makers doing this, but I anticipate Microsoft coming up with a creative way to charge for it.

1484
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Perhaps they can bundle it with your yearly Xbox Live fee, like a diamond club that pays for unlimited use of used or borrowed games in exchange for discounts or specials on the Xbox Live Marketplace, much like PlayStation Plus.

1485
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:33,000
That way, they'll still get money, encourage gamers to spend more money in the marketplace, and make people like they're not getting charged a second or third time for the same game.

1486
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Just a thought, but at Microsoft, if you're listening and like that idea, call me. Oh, that's an ugly idea.

1487
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
To the guy sitting in the boardroom, that's a beautiful idea, but that is an ugly idea, and I'm almost a little ashamed that I read it.

1488
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Think about what he's saying. Yes, it blocks out used games, but if you're an Xbox Live diamond member, that restriction is lifted.

1489
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
That is ugly.

1490
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
That would come back to bite him in the ass so fast. It's not even funny.

1491
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Oh, God.

1492
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if they've already thought of it.

1493
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Can't you kinda see it?

1494
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Can't you kinda see it?

1495
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
It's almost worse than just blocking.

1496
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It is almost.

1497
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Talk about like...

1498
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Well, let's just...

1499
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I feel dirty. I need to bathe after reading that.

1500
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Here's the thing, and I don't think this is one of the stories we're covering, but the other day, Sony's stock price went down 10%.

1501
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:40,000
They can't make these really crazy decisions to pull this kind of crap on their consumer. They have to play it safe.

1502
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I think the same with Microsoft is they have to play it safe, too. I don't think that they can get rid of used game sales that way, because that's...

1503
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Seriously, it's a gamble, because unless both of them are doing it, then...

1504
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And I still think even if Nintendo would have to do it, too.

1505
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And also the fact that you have to completely forget the fact that there's all these older consoles out there.

1506
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Game Guru in chat sums it up perfectly.

1507
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Live.vognetwork.com. Game Guru says,

1508
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,000
So I have to pay $60 a year to not only play games online, but to play used games. Fuck that shit. Fuck that shit.

1509
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
My SNES is looking better than mine.

1510
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Well, you said $60 a year, because $60 a year is for gold.

1511
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Why stop at $60? This is the diamond plan. Maybe they'll throw in a free movie.

1512
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Free rental on Xbox movies.

1513
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Free rental on an Xbox movie. Oh, I feel dirty. Thank you, Frugal Question of the Week.

1514
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
You get your honorary member card along with a bottle of lube and commemorate the Xbox.

1515
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And, you know, if you get the diamond plan, then they'll throw in a wedge for you to bend over.

1516
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Suddenly that name of Xbox lube sounds more and more appropriate, because if y'all are buying it, you better lube yourself up.

1517
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
It's going the route of Sony. It's Latin. It's lube.

1518
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I like that name even better. The Xbox lube.

1519
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Alright, let's get into some real news. Let's stop all this wank and get into, oh, other wank about movies and stuff, right, Loki?

1520
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Yeah, so let's talk about shit that's never gonna happen while I'm still alive.

1521
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So Valve's looking to make a Portal or Half-Life movie with J.J. Abrams. Yeah, that's right.

1522
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:39,000
So J.J. Abrams says, we're gonna try to figure out if we can make a Half-Life or a Portal movie together, basically said Gabe Newell.

1523
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And I guess they've, I don't know, no timetable's been talked about or anything.

1524
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And let's put it this way, we're not gonna see this anytime soon.

1525
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I mean, I think we'll see Half-Life 3 before we'll see a Portal movie and Half-Life movie.

1526
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,000
It would be awesome, but also consider the fact that, you know, J.J. Abrams is a little busy right now.

1527
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
He's got a Star Trek movie coming out and Star Wars movie he's working on, so.

1528
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
How much lens flare will this one have?

1529
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
An amazing amount of lens flare. It'll be crazy, especially with those Portals being all shiny and everything.

1530
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
There's a lot of lens flare to be had there.

1531
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
The potential is staggering.

1532
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Yes. So of course, you know, brief announcement, enough to tease people.

1533
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:40,000
No, they're not gonna give anybody any sort of release dates because they would only have to delay them indefinitely like they do with Half-Life 3.

1534
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:46,000
You guys, what if Half-Life 3 is a movie? That's it. That's the catch.

1535
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
What if they're already like movies anyway with just some gameplay thrown in here and there?

1536
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:01,000
What if the source code for Half-Life 3 has been hidden in all the other Valve games that they put out in some secret encrypted code and then if you decrypt it all and put it together you can play Half-Life 3.

1537
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It's been in front of your eyes the whole time and he's just laughing maniacally.

1538
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
New ARG, new ARG.

1539
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Isn't J.J. Abrams kind of busy though? Like, you know, Star Wars, it's kind of a big deal.

1540
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I know he's signed on for the next movie, but isn't that gonna be like the next trilogy? I mean, because that could take a long time.

1541
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Are they just gonna say fuck you to all the books?

1542
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Yes, they are saying fuck you to all the books, which I'm totally okay with.

1543
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm totally okay with after like the first seven of them.

1544
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Can you imagine trying to keep everything in line with how many books there are? It'd just be insane.

1545
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
No, it's not gonna be, it's gonna be a totally new thing and I'm okay with that.

1546
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:46,000
J.J. Abrams I believe is only on board to direct episode seven, which is okay because four, five, and six had different directors too.

1547
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
So, Lucas did the first one but he didn't do five and six.

1548
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I will never, ever recognize the quote, first three quote as being canon.

1549
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
No one will, honey. Nobody will.

1550
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
That's alright, for number eight and nine they've got Brett Ratner and Joel Schumacher.

1551
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
God, I hell.

1552
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
There'll be nipples on everybody.

1553
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
No, it's um, fuck what's his name, Ewey Bowl.

1554
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Oh god.

1555
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I'm gonna make it a zombie movie that's gonna be steampunk and...

1556
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it.

1557
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Everybody freeze. Everybody chill.

1558
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I am your grandfather.

1559
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Can you feel the ice?

1560
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:35,000
You know, I still have a lot of Arnold movies to catch up on and I'm sorry, I don't care how terrible the movie...

1561
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
That new one flopped.

1562
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That's fine because people are setting their expectations too high. It's a popcorn movie, okay?

1563
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Was really like commando that deep of a movie? I mean, come on.

1564
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Being the governor of California wasn't the best career choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger, let's be real.

1565
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
It seemed like a noble thing to do.

1566
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Dude, he gives tank rights to the press.

1567
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I watched a video on that. That's awesome.

1568
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
And he has his own tank that he drives around.

1569
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Because, you know what, when he was in the military, he was a tank driver. So that's pretty awesome.

1570
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Uh, Black Wolf in chat says, Star Wars Episode VIII Explosions directed by Michael Bay.

1571
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Is Michael Bay the director of Independence Day or is that Roland Emmerich?

1572
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
That's Roland Emmerich.

1573
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
That's who needs to direct.

1574
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Bad Boys would be. You know what?

1575
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I'm sorry, Independence Day is one of those movies that only gets better with time.

1576
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Have you? Now, did you watch 2012?

1577
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Uh, no. I've only seen clips of it.

1578
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
It's a long ass movie, but...

1579
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You know what movie I did see was The Day After Tomorrow, where they're literally running after ice.

1580
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It's almost like The Happening. They're running after wind.

1581
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You know what? I flipped a table when they were running toward the little fire in the building, the fireplace.

1582
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I just flipped my table.

1583
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:57,000
You have to seriously watch 2012 because they escaped from an earthquake via plane two or three times.

1584
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
It's like the same scene. It's like, didn't we just do this?

1585
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I mean, how would, what's going on?

1586
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Black Wolf and Chat says, fun fact, Independence Day's original script was Stargate 2.

1587
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I have heard that before too, that Independence Day started as Stargate 2.

1588
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I can see that.

1589
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
It makes sense. It does.

1590
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I mean, obviously it changed a lot, but...

1591
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,000
You know, there was also, I think, something in the original script that explained why the Apple thing worked.

1592
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Why they were able to hack it with Mac is that they had already been working on breaking down the code on the one ship that they had.

1593
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
They had, like, all the stuff written out.

1594
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Why are people trying to explain the logic in the movie? I mean, that's...

1595
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Well, the thing is, they had it explained.

1596
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I just remember sitting there in the theater when they first showed the preview and the aliens...

1597
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Like, you know, how old were we all when that movie came out? Well, you would have been a little younger.

1598
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I was in college the first time.

1599
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I saw that every day. The second, the third, and the fourth.

1600
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
It's like every day of the movie, it was just like, okay, we're on the second.

1601
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Okay, we're on the third. We're on the fourth.

1602
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
We're going to be an alien every single day.

1603
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Remember, though, when that trailer first came out with the alien ship came out and it blew up the White House and everybody's like, fuck yeah!

1604
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Like, I remember that to this day. Everybody's sitting there in the theater going, fuck yeah!

1605
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I have to say, though, for as crappy as that movie was, they did actually do a few cinemagraphic innovations.

1606
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Too bad it didn't help the rainings.

1607
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
TigerKlonChat saying, I read the director wants to make Independence Day 2 and 3 at some point.

1608
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I think it's a little long from that right now.

1609
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
God can only hope. Do you remember what else?

1610
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
What if they have what's-his-face?

1611
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I know this is not a tangent you all asked for, but it's Orange Lawn's radio, people.

1612
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Do you know what made the movie Independence Day? Do you know what made that fucking movie?

1613
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
The dog surviving?

1614
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Harvey Fierstein is in Independence Day.

1615
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Oh, God, I've got to call my mother.

1616
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I know!

1617
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I loved him.

1618
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Best choice of casting ever.

1619
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I just like how they were advertising, you don't know who's going to die.

1620
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
And I pretty much pegged everyone who was going to die in that movie.

1621
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Oh, you're looking.

1622
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Oh, crap.

1623
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Let's see. I'm trying to find a clip. I can't find one.

1624
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Oh, here we go. Here we go. There's at least this one little clip. Here we go. Here we go.

1625
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Oh, crap.

1626
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I love him.

1627
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I love him.

1628
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I think I remember from that, you know, was it residents of L.A. are being warned not to fire or was it like or use their firearms at the alien spacecraft or discharge their firearms at the aliens?

1629
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Yes. Yes. No warning.

1630
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
What up? G said he said forget his lawyer. That's right.

1631
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I got to call my mother and I got to call my lawyer. I forget my lawyer.

1632
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
All right. We got to move.

1633
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So they can have like RuPaul in the next one.

1634
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And to answer Dungeon Bester, no, I do not have the Independence Day game. It is not anywhere at all in the collection.

1635
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Aliens are coming to us from Mars. Well, they need to sashay away.

1636
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Is that a dragon?

1637
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
RuPaul being in. Oh, forget it.

1638
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Dark Sakura, you need to sissy that walk. All right.

1639
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
All right. Moving on.

1640
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Is it finally my turn? Because, fuck.

1641
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
No, I have to talk about Skylanders.

1642
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Who are we even talking about?

1643
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Movies. Oh, that's right.

1644
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
J.J. Abrams somehow.

1645
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Thank you, J.J. Abrams, for derailing the show in an epic manner.

1646
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Now here's a lens flare for you.

1647
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Ah, blind.

1648
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Skylanders. Hey, what a great way to follow up a Harvey Fierstein story than talking about Skylanders.

1649
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Skylanders Swap Force is coming out. You swap them. 16 special figures with torsos and bottom hats.

1650
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
You have to do the accent for the whole thing.

1651
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
No. You link the two pieces together. You can combine the pieces in different ways.

1652
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So it's like, oh, God, a whole new collection crap. Now you've got to collect heads and feet instead of just, you know, the figures themselves.

1653
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You can mix and match. Although, in theory, it's a neat way to evolve the concept, I guess, for what it's worth.

1654
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's also going to make you buy a brand new portal because the old portal is not compatible with the new characters.

1655
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Oh, bastards. Bastards.

1656
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
That's an $80 purchase right there, buddy.

1657
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:52,000
It's also being done by Vicarious Visions. It is not being done by Toys for Bob, who did the original Toys for Bob coming up with a new money-making scheme right now.

1658
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
All they're doing is putting out new characters because there is a thing. They made tons of money.

1659
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, Wii, and 3DS. Interesting that it's on Wii U and Wii.

1660
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:11,000
The Wii version being done by Binox, 3DS by N-Space because they've been contracted out because they don't care.

1661
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
They know that people buy the characters. They don't care about the game. They just want people to buy characters.

1662
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:23,000
And if you think Skylanders isn't a thing, like that people are making too big of a deal out of Skylanders, you're probably right.

1663
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:32,000
But the reality is, walking to Target or Best Buy, like I was at Best Buy last night because, I don't know, we were like, oh yeah, you can actually get those K-Cup coffee things pretty cheap at Best Buy.

1664
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
That's what we were there for.

1665
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Go to Marshalls.

1666
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
There was an aisle in the video game section, an entire aisle dedicated to Skylanders. It'll blow your mind.

1667
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Soon, of course, Disney Infinity and all this other stuff will be competing with it, but my God.

1668
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Disney Infinity, can you imagine compared to the Skylanders stuff? They're going to have so much.

1669
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Entire stores. Anyway, Activision on their earnings call announced 100 million Skylanders toys have been sold.

1670
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Wow. Oh, I'm sorry, that was actually from their press conference at Toy Fair 2013. Excuse me, not from the earnings call.

1671
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:15,000
But yeah, 500 million in sales in the US alone, 195 million of that from Skylanders Giants.

1672
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It's a thing, like it or not, it's a thing.

1673
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Yeah, it's because people will blindly collect those toys.

1674
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
And now that they have to buy new characters and version 3s of their characters.

1675
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Honestly, if I were 8, I'd want it to. I mean, I'm trying to put it in that perspective, is that it's easy for me to sit here and laugh at it.

1676
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
But whoever fucking thought of this is a genius. And if I was a kid, I would fucking want it.

1677
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
But I got to wonder what's going to happen when Infinity comes out, because that's going to cut them off at the knees, I think.

1678
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I did see the trailer for that and I liked it.

1679
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Well, they're all going to, I mean, it's not going to end there.

1680
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Wait, you don't think Nintendo wants that near field communication shit to work so they can bring on the fucking Pokemon?

1681
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
They've talked about that before. That's all Nintendo has to fucking do, is announce Pokemon for Wii U with actual Pokemon.

1682
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
You will collect them all. You will collect them all.

1683
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Each character is going to be $10.

1684
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Nintendo's got a lot of stuff they could whip out and put on the table if they wanted to. Believe me.

1685
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Talk about needing lube.

1686
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
When they whip that out.

1687
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Is your body ready for this, bitch?

1688
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.

1689
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
By the way, Rob, did you see my suggestion in chat?

1690
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
No.

1691
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Mr. Spanky needs a New York Jewish cousin named Harvey Spanklestock.

1692
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
He understands the Mr. Spanky joke anymore. That's the problem.

1693
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
There's people who get it?

1694
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Like four or five.

1695
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I miss Mr. Spanky, Rob.

1696
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Because DDR is not on PC anymore.

1697
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I know. How old is DDR PC these days?

1698
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Good lord.

1699
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I could probably find it on abandonware sites. That's how old DDR PC is.

1700
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,000
You could probably find it unwrapped and boxed in my house. I mean, wrapped and boxed in my house, which is true.

1701
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So, speaking of Konami, how's that?

1702
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Anyway, the UK studio dude, David Cox, said that they want to consider putting out Castlevania Mirror of Fate on HD platforms.

1703
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
The game is coming out on the 5th in the US for the 3DS.

1704
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
But he said that the whole game is actually already done in high def.

1705
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:25,000
That they actually shrunk it and removed bones and changed animations to make it DS sized, or 3DS sized.

1706
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So, yeah, in fact, the quote right here is, at Mercury S-Team we have an HD version of the game sitting there in a computer somewhere.

1707
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:47,000
So, I mean, I guess all the other Castlevania games have sold very well, but the cover art is really pretty.

1708
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
But I'm really not sure how well it's going to sell.

1709
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I mean, maybe it will. It's a Castlevania game.

1710
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Hard to go wrong there. Sorry, Castlevania 64.

1711
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I could see them doing something like this for maybe a Nintendo console, because it's a 3DS game.

1712
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Maybe, hey, there's a perfect Wii U tie-in right there.

1713
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
There you go.

1714
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
You can have that little Metroidvania map on your little Wii U.

1715
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Did they say this is another Metroidvania style one?

1716
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Oh, I don't know. I'm just making that up.

1717
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:25,000
It's sort of like a port of Lords of Shadows, so it's a hack and slash.

1718
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
God of Belmont.

1719
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Pretty much, yeah.

1720
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Whip of War.

1721
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Can't even follow those anymore.

1722
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Moving on.

1723
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I wouldn't buy it, by the way.

1724
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
So Atari, of course, not doing that great.

1725
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
We've heard that they were talking about declaring bankruptcy and stuff, so they did that.

1726
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And the U.S. branch of Atari, they closed, I guess, $2 million in debt or in possession financing.

1727
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
And also, I guess, they're supposed to be expecting some other money coming in.

1728
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
But right now, they're looking at, I guess, restructuring.

1729
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:12,000
And with that, probably going to be selling off assets and properties, including all your favorite Atari franchises.

1730
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:21,000
So I'm guessing that they're going to basically be selling off this stuff and still sticking around to make new things?

1731
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Or are they just going to go away?

1732
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
That's the only thing I didn't understand about it.

1733
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
So yeah, you can possibly buy Pong, combat, all that fun stuff.

1734
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
You know what somebody needs to buy is Sword Quest and do something with that. Remember Sword Quest?

1735
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:35,000


1736
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Nope. Oh, it was an Atari 2600 series that never finished, but the games were so hard.

1737
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:49,000
They were doing a real contest to give away these real swords and crowns and shit that were valued at all, this money back in the 80s.

1738
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:55,000
And I think Earthworld, Fireworld, and Waterworld all came out, but the last one, Airworld, never did.

1739
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And I think Waterworld was right at the death stroke of Atari, so I think it's one of those hard to find cartridges.

1740
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Yeah, anyway, sorry, I'm just thinking of all these obscure Atari franchises people ought to gobble up. Anyhow.

1741
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
New Marvel Madness, please.

1742
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Right? Like 720.

1743
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Alright, moving on. One place that would not be selling these Atari remake games if things keep going the way they're going is HMV.

1744
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Not a chain I've heard of, but I think these are big over in the UK, or at least bigger than they are here.

1745
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I think they're only in the UK.

1746
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Are they? I want to say I've heard the name before, but maybe because they partner with somebody over here, I don't know.

1747
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:43,000
But anyway, HMV, this does affect the UK mostly, which has had a lot of bad news when it comes to game retailers lately.

1748
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Closing 66 of their 220 stores, which means 930 people out of a job as a result. Really a bummer.

1749
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
These stores closing in the next one or two months.

1750
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
A quote from joint administrator Nick Edwards.

1751
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
This step has been taken in order to enhance the prospects of securing the business's future as a going concern.

1752
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
We continue to receive strong support from staff and are extremely grateful to them for their commitment during an understandably difficult period.

1753
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
All other key stakeholders remain very supportive and I continue to be hopeful of securing a future for the restructure business.

1754
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So hopefully closing these stores will allow the rest of them to get stronger, we'll see.

1755
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:27,000
But I know over here in the US, Blockbuster, I didn't even realize they still had as many stores as they did, but they're closing a lot more.

1756
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
The one in Thomas, I think, just started their big sale.

1757
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yeah, and remember when Blockbusters used to be on every corner and now it's like, wow.

1758
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Down the 500 and down the 500 in the UK too.

1759
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Can you imagine when we get to the point where GameStop will do that? Because there's a lot of GameStops out there.

1760
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:46,000


1761
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Yeah, some of them are already starting to close.

1762
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Getting pretty crazy.

1763
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:59,000
So anyway, our thoughts to those that were impacted by jobs, hopefully something, a similar retail operation will come to take their place, we will hope.

1764
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Anyhow, let's move on and get into some listener feedback in the form of emails.

1765
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Every week you guys email us.

1766
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we sort through the spam and find the emails that were actually from legit listeners.

1767
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,000
And we read some of our favorites here on the program. DarkSakura, pick some out and read them for us.

1768
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Okay, well I will go with the oldest to newest because we got two weeks worth of emails.

1769
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:33,000
This one, well I didn't put a nickname on it so I'm just, oh no, it's Honey Badger.

1770
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Hi guys, this is...

1771
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Honey Badger don't take shit from no one.

1772
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
This is Sam, aka Honey Badger on Steam. I am ecstatic to hear the positive views on PC gaming.

1773
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:50,000
The largest complaint and truth I hear from console gamers is instability with games on PC because it's up to the end user to set the graphics options.

1774
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Of course, if you go over the top with graphics levels your video card can't handle, you get instability.

1775
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Nvidia has looked into this and will be releasing a tool that analyzes your specs and has them set per game configuration that will give you the best performance and visual appeal.

1776
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Thanks for this show, I hope to see you on Steam.

1777
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
PS, I want to add Rob and Loki on Steam if that's possible.

1778
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:16,000
We have an Orange Launch Radio community on Steam. You can have lots of people that listen to the show and yes, we're in there too.

1779
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Just look on me and link from there.

1780
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Yes, O.L. Army I think it's called. There are Orange Launch Radio fans and there's a VoG network one. I really should be pimping that one because we want to, you know, all the VoG people, but join them both.

1781
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Our VoGies?

1782
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Yes, do we have a name for the VoG listeners?

1783
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
VoGlets.

1784
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
VoGlets, VoGlets, our little VoGlets.

1785
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
We can have a VoG house.

1786
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:53,000
But anyhow, join those communities and yes, Loki and I are in there. And of course, PC gaming, it's a part of gaming and sometimes we, I mean honestly, I play games on my PC more than anything else because World of Warcraft is on PC.

1787
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And there's a lot of stuff you can't deny and especially is great on PC like Path of Exile I talked about earlier, you're just not going to see that on consoles.

1788
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I've gotten to where I really prefer Dragon Age 2 on PC because of the whole tap and auto attack. The fact that I don't have to map certain attacks just to my trigger buttons, I can actually map them onto my number pad.

1789
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:23,000
And that's not to say I dislike consoles because certainly I love consoles too. I own them all and there's certain things that consoles do that PCs don't do well when it comes to the optimization and so forth.

1790
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:31,000
So you know what, there's room for both though. I think most people, despite the whole console versus PC wars, most people probably play on both no matter what they say.

1791
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Although, Mass Effect series, much better on PC.

1792
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Whatever, alright. The other thing I wanted to throw out there, the optimization thing, I can't believe something like that doesn't already exist.

1793
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Like it's one of those things, he explains it and I think, God, why isn't that already out there? It's a great idea.

1794
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Do you know what we used to do to test our graphics capabilities? We used to use the Final Fantasy XI graphics test.

1795
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1796
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
And that was pretty cute and it was a neat way of...

1797
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,000


1798
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,000


1799
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:57,000


1800
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,000
We used to use that to test if we could handle certain games because basically if we could handle Final Fantasy XI we could handle anything else that came out around the same time.

1801
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Yeah, I would show you the frame rate once it ran the whole thing, like how many frames were processed.

1802
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
But now my graphics card will seriously handle anything.

1803
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:12,000


1804
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
So I haven't had a reason to check.

1805
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I should run the Final Fantasy XI benchmark just for lolz.

1806
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I bet it would be gorgeous with my current graphics card.

1807
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Let's not go down this path again.

1808
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
There's only so much you can do with that thing, trust me.

1809
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I kind of am nostalgic now.

1810
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
14 beta starting.

1811
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I don't need another game, I'm actually kind of considering dropping lolz.

1812
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I'll just wait for it to go free to play, I'm talking about 13 of course.

1813
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
You mean 11?

1814
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Moving on.

1815
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Hey, hey, O-L-R.

1816
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Hey, hey.

1817
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1818
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Hey, good lord.

1819
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
First off, allow me to elaborate on my Twitter post from last week.

1820
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I think it's fantastic, this is RawStillUT by the way.

1821
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I think it's fantastic to see people giving deep silver shit over the Dead Island Riptide statue fiasco.

1822
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Oh, that thing.

1823
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Yeah, I have no idea what he's talking about, but okay.

1824
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Remember the horrible bust that was the woman all chopped up that they were selling us?

1825
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Oh yeah, that.

1826
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,000
However, it's disheartening to see that in every comment section and seemingly every YouTube video,

1827
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:18,000
gamers are giving shit to people who speak out against the promotion, either brushing it aside as no big deal or making sexist remarks themselves.

1828
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
You know the ESA loves to talk a great game about how many women play video games,

1829
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
but given how uniform the audience reaction tends to be when things like this come up,

1830
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I wonder if that stat is being buttressed by Facebook and mobile and the market for full featured games is still mostly male.

1831
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Is there really any hope for the gaming industry to make the moves necessary to bring women into the AAA game market?

1832
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,000
And more importantly, will the traditional gaming market continue to greet women with come ons and sexist garbage?

1833
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Wait, people say stupid shit on the internet when they can hide behind their monitor?

1834
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
No.

1835
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Get out!

1836
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
YouTube commenting is not like a, like Google is not trying to change the whole YouTube commenting thing to clear out the cesspool a little bit.

1837
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Every time you log into YouTube, don't you want to use your real name?

1838
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
No.

1839
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Don't you want to change everything to your real name? Why aren't you using your real name?

1840
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Like literally, Google asked me today, why aren't you using your real name?

1841
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:18,000
It's like, fuck off. I don't want to use my real name and I'm not the problem because I don't comment on YouTubes.

1842
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I comment on YouTube, but only on CookieMyDog.

1843
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Oh my god, Yahoo needs to do that too. Yahoo comments? Oh my god.

1844
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Oh my god.

1845
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Well, um, go back to the comment. Yeah, well, if you, I don't think it really would matter how much of the market is female gaming because you still have most of the decisions being made by men.

1846
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I hate to say it, you know. It goes into more of a, I would say, socio-political realm than just who's playing the games.

1847
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
I mean, and yeah, I think it is actually still predominantly guys, but you have a much larger female gaming base now.

1848
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:05,000
But it's, and it's really hard to say because, again, like you were talking about, there's that anonymity, you know, that you can say it and get away with it.

1849
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:13,000
But, you know, what if that was your mom you were gaming against and you, you know, were saying something?

1850
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,000
What if it was another fucking human being with feelings and, you know, thoughts and so forth?

1851
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Like, and the vile things people say on YouTube about like these teenage girls that do their vlogs and they're just being dumb teenage girls.

1852
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:34,000
We were all a dumb teenage girl at one point. Let's be real, right? And, you know, people are going like, you should just kill yourself.

1853
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And there's several people who have. Like, really? Really?

1854
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Also in a psychological point of view, you know, when you deal with people that young, well, basically you're dealing with people whose brains aren't going to be fully developed until they're 25.

1855
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And that's not a slight. That is just a reality.

1856
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
That's fact. If you don't believe me, look at National Geographic. They wrote a whole article on it.

1857
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:06,000
But anyway, you know, you're dealing with people who are not fully developed. It's basically, you know, that level of suggestibility.

1858
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
They don't have a way of filtering anything out. It's all what's in front of you with no long term consequence to that's really pressing.

1859
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:29,000
So, you know, but if you also think of it that way, your gamer base, if you were thinking as mostly teenage and, you know, that male demographic between teenage to 27, you're also dealing with a huge number of people whose brains are not fully developed.

1860
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
End of story. Brains are not fully developed. Those neural pathways are not all there.

1861
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:42,000
And so, you know, as an adult, yeah, I can sit and tell myself, okay, well, they're not using all of their potential. They have no faculties yet.

1862
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:49,000
You know, you can stop and tell yourself, yeah, these people are just trolls. They don't know any better, you know, or maybe they don't care.

1863
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
But they need to get the shit scared out of them.

1864
02:21:52,000 --> 02:22:01,000
But they do. See, that's the thing. What I, this is what I would like to see is that if you have a warning button that instantly turns on whatever camera is connected so you can see their face.

1865
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:22,000
That's it, you know, or the cameras turning on randomly. That's big brother talk. That's not, I know, but I mean, there, there should be, when you're dealing with the type of brain activity that deals only with immediacy and not long term consequence, you need to make an immediate consequence.

1866
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Not well, I mean, not to go like on a tangent, but you got those people that were on Twitter and these stupid kids that when Obama got reelected, there are all these people making tweets that were like, I can't believe that and word got reelected and saying just, just idiotic shit on their Twitter.

1867
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Right. And so what happens, these websites go out and just basically doc some like, you know, it's this guy that goes to this high school and he's on this scholarship of the college and these kids look at anonymous.

1868
02:22:49,000 --> 02:23:05,000
These kids are losing their scholarships over it. And I'm not saying like maybe they shouldn't, but it's kind of like they're dumb ass kids and the dumb ass kids don't need to have their lives ruined necessarily, but they need that reality check and the parents could really use the snack on the head too.

1869
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Because they didn't just learn it watching the TVs.

1870
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Well, honestly, though, that's a reflection of the caliber of person that these schools are getting. And a school has a reputation to maintain too. If it's going to come out, you know, that they're admitting somebody with that particular view set to their school and their school does not share that view set, they have the right to deny them.

1871
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:35,000
R.D.G. Singe in the chat saying, I know a few adults whose lobes never fully developed. Rasteel UT pointing out it's not all kids either. Ain't that the truth?

1872
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:47,000
That's true. You know, we're talking a lot about teenagers and so forth. But yeah, if a 30 year old guy sitting there trolling Twitter with all this stuff, then you know what? It's a little harder to feel sorry for somebody whose brain is fully developed and should know better.

1873
02:23:47,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, you're also dealing with the fact that we are a society of instant gratification. We're especially now with the anonymity, the nastiest, the nastiest side of people are becoming public. And you know what? If they're going to be, you know, think that their anonymity can hide them, let them be exposed. I have zero problem with that. Let their boss find out.

1874
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:14,000
You know, that's why I don't put anything on the Internet that I would not tell, you know, an employer. I mean, there's certain things I wouldn't tell an employer.

1875
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I don't know, because I say things on this show I wouldn't necessarily want like co-workers to hear. It's not that I'm like embarrassed about it or anything, but it's just kind of like, you know, I have my professional side, then I have my side where I let it all hang out. You know, it's kind of like it's not okay for those worlds to cross.

1876
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Everybody has that. But I mean, in the end, you want to think about how you're reflecting on yourself. You know, I try. Yeah, I get a little bit bitchier than normal on the show because it's sometimes funny. But at the same time, this is me. This is who I am. I try not to portray myself in any other way than the person that I am.

1877
02:24:47,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And so on the same token, that's all we can ever consider these people that we're interacting with through a video game. This is who this person is. Oh, my God. Who talks like this? I don't want to be around this person anymore. How do they have friends?

1878
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:07,000
TechNist in our chat room, and I think we'll move on after this comment. I think people forget that there is no such thing as true anonymity on the Internet.

1879
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
No, it's not. Let's move on.

1880
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:21,000
There's the rest of the email. I know logically that I shouldn't be basing an entire group of people on the Internet, but that's just exhausting when it's all you see from gamers 90% of the time. Regards, rawstealut.

1881
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Gamershateeverything.com.

1882
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:30,000
OK. We also have a two part to email question from Robert M.

1883
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Dark soccer on the actual Twilight Zone table. Do you have the problem of the ball exiting the slot machine, ricocheting directly off the outside of the right town square bumper and draining immediately down the middle?

1884
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I must need to manage my tilting better. And then dark soccer. Do you have problems with your balls? Let me finish.

1885
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Just to clarify, of course the ball doesn't ricochet directly from the slot machine into the bumper. It is hit by the right flipper first, then hits the bumper and drains. Timing on the flipper is a major factor as well.

1886
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:04,000
To be perfectly honest, I haven't actually touched my Twilight Zone machine except to take a picture of my cat on it in probably six months, so I probably can't answer that question.

1887
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Although I can say that there are lots of cheap maneuvers, but keep in mind these were meant to make money.

1888
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Putting in natural drains, magnets, that's going to happen. But wait until you have the Powerball, because then sometimes you don't have to worry about the magnets when you're running with Powerball.

1889
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,000
You know, I had a fun time playing a Twilight Zone that was all Powerballs. That was pretty great.

1890
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Nice. The ceramic balls that don't, you know, because of the magnets.

1891
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
The end. That's it for mailbags? That's it.

1892
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Alright, mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. If you want to email us in the future, again one more time, that's mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. Please do email us.

1893
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,000
We get a lot of lovely emails and we would love a few more. Mailbag at orangelauntrady.com.

1894
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
So I have to actually read something from Becky.

1895
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Sure. That Julian said. Go for it.

1896
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Okay, so she's playing the first Mass Effect again.

1897
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
And Julian is her six year old? Five year old.

1898
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
He's going to be six though in a couple months. Close enough. Right after my birthday.

1899
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I was close. I rounded. Yeah.

1900
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It's the line from Joker. I want to be there when you make that son of a bitch pay.

1901
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
And Julian says, you're not going to make him pay. You're going to make him die.

1902
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So I felt that needed to be shared.

1903
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Alright. Let's move on with a few more news stories before we get to. Oh, I'm sorry. We got FUs of the Week to do.

1904
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I almost overlooked the FUs of the Week. FU to myself for damn near overlooking the FUs of the Week.

1905
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
It's the part of the show every week where we get angsty. Why? I don't know. Cause.

1906
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here. This is fucked up.

1907
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:51,000
First off, FU to people who don't understand what following distance is.

1908
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
And try to get all of the end years and then change lanes into your following space.

1909
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
In California, we have what's called the three second rule. When you pick a landmark, when the car in front of you.

1910
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:06,000
When the tail of your car passes it, you count three seconds until you hit that same part with the front of your car.

1911
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
And that's following distance. Well, in Alabama, it's two seconds, whatever.

1912
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I can say it. I can say Alabama is backwards. I'm from there. I escaped.

1913
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Also FU to there being ads now on the AIM app on my iPad.

1914
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:29,000
And FU to the winners slash losers of Canada's Worst Driver.

1915
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Because they were both really awful and I mean these people are hazards on the road. They're gonna kill people.

1916
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I mean, I'm literally, they are that stupid. If you are a bad driver. If everyone around you tells you you're a bad driver.

1917
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:46,000
And no amount of practice is helping you, stop fucking driving. End of story.

1918
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
That goes to everybody in the world who's a bad driver. Me, I'm a great driver.

1919
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:59,000
And I have a thank you to my husband who greeted me the other night with a three terabyte hard drive. Yeah.

1920
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
You're spoiled.

1921
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
No, I love him.

1922
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Loki?

1923
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:14,000
FU to the lingering part of the stomach bug here that I have, which is making me feel extremely bloated. Like I'm full of just pizza.

1924
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,000
No, I didn't even have that much pizza. I only had like two slices of pizza.

1925
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Yeah, so basically, I mean, it's gonna obviously cause me to lose weight, I guess, which is good, but it's still very uncomfortable.

1926
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
You know, it's all water while you're sick. Once you start eating, you'll retain again.

1927
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Is that it?

1928
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah, that's it.

1929
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I want to make sure I'm super vague in how I put this in response to some things I've seen on Twitter.

1930
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I just want to say an FU to somebody who tries to call out someone else's faults on things that happened in the past when that person themselves have lots of faults in their past that they have not apologized for and maybe ought to.

1931
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
So, just saying.

1932
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
That's all I got to say about that.

1933
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Doesn't that go back to the cardinal rule of everything?

1934
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Don't be a dick.

1935
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
But some people don't know how.

1936
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about a few more news stories before we get to Twitter and Skype line.

1937
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
See, we don't need those Wii U's, you know, cause we've got other things to keep us occupied.

1938
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I know you think you guys are all fancy with your Miiverse channels and stuff like that, but hey, there's Xboxverse in Japan.

1939
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:37,000
And Xboxverse, I guess it's a Hakuverse.

1940
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:48,000
And apparently, like all things on the internet that are somewhat unregulated, it is full of penises.

1941
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Penis art, penis art, penis art.

1942
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
TTP.

1943
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
That's a lot of cock on your desktop there.

1944
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Yeah.

1945
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Oh look, Chris cock.

1946
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
That's...

1947
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Yes.

1948
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
So, interesting.

1949
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
But hey, it's out there, so that's kind of neat, I guess.

1950
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I don't know if they've got exactly the website here.

1951
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Let's see, it's at xbox.verse.jp is where you can check it out.

1952
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
And I'm not sure how you can actually go about posting on there and stuff.

1953
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:33,000
But it's interesting, there's a sweaty picture of Gabe Newall, looks like, on my desktop now.

1954
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I'm not really sure what that's from.

1955
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
But, cool.

1956
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I had to look, it was actually pretty amusing.

1957
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,000
So, yeah, xbox.verse.jp.

1958
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:53,000
There was that whole little story about the particular game too that was causing excessive...

1959
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Tintin, yeah.

1960
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I'm just surprised there's that big of a community around an Xbox in Japan.

1961
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:07,000
The way you hear things online, you would think that there was no fans of Xbox in Japan whatsoever.

1962
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
But I guess it's not doing as terrible as you might think.

1963
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Well, speaking of penis, I mean, you know, why not another story that has to do with this?

1964
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Custom Made 3D is an upcoming erotic game that's coming out with a very special attachment.

1965
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
It's called...

1966
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Sorry.

1967
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,000
It's called The Juicy Air. Like, is this trolling? Like, is this story for real?

1968
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Like, is this for real or am I being trolling?

1969
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I think it's for real, they have an actual website.

1970
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Oh my god, alright.

1971
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Let's go to the website.

1972
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
It's a cup.

1973
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:51,000
It is a wireless masturbation toy that reacts in real time to your stroke speed and depth, making this motion control... you know what?

1974
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:55,000
So just pull sausage out of the fridge and go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1975
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
In-game characters react accordingly too with different characters reacting differently.

1976
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
This peripheral has an analog stick and an action button as well as a right and left click.

1977
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Suddenly the term clicking your mouse has a whole new meaning.

1978
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
You don't even have to take your hands off your wiener while you're playing.

1979
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
There you go.

1980
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
This story has been met with the response of... in chatroom.

1981
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,000
rdgsinge in our chatroom says, are there any special plans for episode 500?

1982
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
On a cup.

1983
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Well, after this story there are now.

1984
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I'll be staying home.

1985
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,000
That's our full video review of SMA3D.

1986
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I wonder if there's gonna be one of them.

1987
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I wonder if there's gonna be one of those on...

1988
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Res Trans Vibrator 2.0.

1989
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Oh, God. All right.

1990
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
What?

1991
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Game Guru, talk about playing with your Wii.

1992
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Yes, there's pictures of it. Look it up yourself.

1993
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Wii jokes are seven years old. What the hell? All right, that's it.

1994
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Just look up what an Ona cup is and you'll see what it looks like.

1995
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Surely you want to follow that story on our Skype line.

1996
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
1-877-

1997
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Penis!

1998
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:19,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio. All one word.

1999
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,000
rostielut in chat says, as long as we don't have to see the cup being used.

2000
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
It could just be above the waist shots, that's all.

2001
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

2002
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
And while we wait for some calls, there's always last minute stories and Twitter topics.

2003
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Any last minute stories, Logie?

2004
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:49,000
No. I don't really have anything. I was looking at...

2005
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
So much for that.

2006
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I was just trying to look and see. I had something, but it wasn't very important.

2007
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Oh, yeah. This is kind of just a random tangent here.

2008
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Let me ask you, the phone's blowing up, so write down your thought and we'll come back to it later because I want to get to the phone calls.

2009
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2010
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Oh my God. It is a blast from the past. Raven's Dolphin.

2011
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Holy fucking shit. It's Raven's Dolphin. Oh my God.

2012
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I live.

2013
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
You live. Beware. I live. What a blast from the past. How are you?

2014
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Wise from your grave.

2015
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I have risen from my grave. I escaped from the mental institution to call you guys.

2016
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Where the hell have you been?

2017
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I've been around.

2018
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Are you still doing your tech and games thing that just blew up?

2019
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
I am. And guess what? We're celebrating six years this month.

2020
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
It actually became very successful and I want to thank you guys for giving me inspiration.

2021
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,000
No, I know. It cracked me up because I would see that all around the internet, the tech and games thing, and I'm like, wow, that shit really blew up, didn't it?

2022
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I'm like, good for him. Good for you. Good for you.

2023
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Yeah, it worked out very well. We went to Comic Con. We went to Otacon. We did some things.

2024
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Did you get blessed by the E3 Pope yet?

2025
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
No, we did not, but I'm not worried.

2026
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Soon. You'll get there, buddy. You'll get there.

2027
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:05,000
It's happening. It's happening. But I came to call you not to talk about me, God. It's you guys.

2028
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And you guys were talking about the Pokemon thing about gotta catch them all?

2029
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:10,000


2030
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
And, you know, the Wii U has built-in RFID chips, so they could really easily do it.

2031
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Yes, they could. Weren't they at one point you were supposed to be able to tap your credit card on that thing?

2032
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Yeah. See, that's the thing. That was one of the stories that we didn't talk about. They're working on that still. It's not even coming out until fall.

2033
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
It's like, yeah, way to implement all your technology.

2034
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Yeah, but remember way back when I first talked about the Wii U and how it's like the Winchester Mystery House where you'll find all these doors that go nowhere and shit that's not finished built yet?

2035
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,000
That's the Wii U. So that part is currently still under construction.

2036
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
We're sort of stuck in the seance room.

2037
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Sort of. And Ubisoft just locked another door. But anyway.

2038
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Sure did. Sure did.

2039
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Yeah, go ahead.

2040
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I just have one more thing. I'm going to keep this short. It's about the Rayman legend thing.

2041
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:07,000
For me, it was bad PR from Ubisoft. They should have just said it was coming out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox. They should have just said, oh, it's an exclusive and then yanked the thing out.

2042
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:14,000
But I want to say I understand why they did it. But I felt like they should have played that way better than they did.

2043
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Are you a Wii U owner by chance?

2044
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I am a Wii U owner. I own a PlayStation. I own everything. I'm on Steam now. I bought Mass Effect, so I will be playing it. If I want to be listening to this shit, I better be playing it.

2045
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I feel like we've raised you well. I know you were a lot younger when you first started listening to OLR.

2046
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I'm so proud. You are making us proud.

2047
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Wait, are you playing Mass Effect on PC?

2048
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I only got one and two. I bought it during the Steam sale, so I didn't play a lot of it yet. I will play it. Dark Soccer. Don't kill me. I have it. I own it. I'll buy it.

2049
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Let me know when you get to three so we can play multiplayer together.

2050
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:53,000
You're doing better than Bobby Black Wolf in that regard. That's good enough.

2051
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:01,000
What was I going to say? I don't know. I don't know what else to say. Oh, yes. You're a Wii U owner. What do you think of the Wii U? How are you feeling about your purchase?

2052
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:09,000
No, I have to say my mom bought it and I like the thing itself. Me, I think my favorite feature is it's a remote.

2053
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:14,000
You know what? That TV thing, did you check it out during the Super Bowl?

2054
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I did. I checked it out when the Broncos were playing and when they scored that touchdown and then they lost. I'm done with this.

2055
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I was waiting for the Beyonce concert last weekend while I was sick and I had the TV thing going on and I was like, oh, these guys are throwing a football around before the Beyonce concert.

2056
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I'll check this out. It was actually kind of fun to look at the feedback people were giving on me. A lot of it was just dumb internet shit, but it was kind of neat to have that right in front of me as I'm watching this game on the TV.

2057
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Which, believe it or not, there were some pretty lullsy things that happened in the game that even I was like, wow, the 49ers are getting their ass kicked in the first half of this game.

2058
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I kept hearing all of the men not use their inside voice while I was in the back room playing Mass Effect.

2059
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:09,000
One of my favorites was when the blackout happened. I love the memes with the WWE with Undertaker and they're creating Beyonce as She-Hulk. I'm like, okay, that's funny.

2060
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Beyonce as She-Hulk was great. But my favorite meme that's come out of the whole thing is Tard, Tardar Sauce, the Grumpy Cat.

2061
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:19,000


2062
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Saying blackout and then Tardar Sauce holding the plug.

2063
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Or the Bane references were all over Twitter, of course, and that happened. But my favorite gif I saw was the one where all the lights go out.

2064
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:38,000
To bring this call full circle, Ravenstaufen, when all the lights go out and then you see the stadium above and it goes out and then Team Rocket shows up, that cracked me up.

2065
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:39,000


2066
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:40,000


2067
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I'm sorry. That was my favorite part of the whole Super Bowl. It's like people staring at the screen, what are we doing? And then the beats after it were like, thank you, internet. This is why you're awesome.

2068
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Was this Beyonce's fault? Was Beyonce's performance so fierce that she blew the fucking power? Like, that was my favorite. That's my favorite.

2069
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
That was good, too. And I saw her at the inauguration. She didn't blow on anyone.

2070
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Well, Ravenstaufen, please, pimp your shit. It's six years, you've earned it.

2071
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Six years thanks to you guys. The website's called techandgames.com. It lives quite well with 833 fans on Facebook. It doesn't matter. That's someone else's stuff. I'm not like, ugh. I didn't create that.

2072
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
But you've earned each and every one of them, so you go, boy.

2073
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Yeah, thank you, Rob, for the time and I know you have other calls.

2074
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Anytime. Take care, buddy. Good to hear from you.

2075
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:30,000


2076
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:31,000


2077
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Hi. 1877 Game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundry. Sorry, Loki. I didn't mean to cut you off earlier. When I saw that one popping up, I was like, blast from the past. Holla.

2078
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,000
I don't even remember what I was talking about, though.

2079
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Isn't that how it goes? Let's see. Tigerclaw giving us a GIF here in the chat room, and I just want to make sure. Oh, God damn it. This is great live radio.

2080
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I just want to make sure this is the right one, because if it is, I insist that Rama, our Tumblr administrator. What is the Tumblr? Is it OrangeLaundryRadio?

2081
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
OrangeLaundryRadio.tumblr.com.

2082
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I insist that this go on the OrangeLaundryRadio Tumblr. Yes, this is it. Perfect.

2083
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Please repost that. Perfect. Yes, I insist that that be reposted.

2084
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Alright. 1877 Game O-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundryRadio. If you want to give us a call, let's go to the phones and take another call.

2085
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLaundryRadio. Who's this?

2086
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

2087
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Hey, Raginator in video. I see you. Peek-a-roo. What's up?

2088
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Well, I would have talked about this last week if there was a show last week.

2089
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Yeah, rub it in. I was sick. Rub it in.

2090
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Well, I wasn't trying to rub anything in, but since you kind of briefly talked about the topic in today's show, I have a somewhat related question.

2091
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Now, with all this talk about the Xbox 720, assuming that's what the final name is going to be called, and...

2092
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
The Lube is the name of the week. The Xbox Lube.

2093
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Or the PlayStation 4. That kind of begs the question, at this point, do we really need a new system from either Microsoft or the PlayStation 4?

2094
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I mean, think about it. PlayStation 3 is, at this point, really hitting stride.

2095
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:30,000
And, from my viewpoint, Microsoft still has a lot of life left with the 360.

2096
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I mean, I can't see them really improving graphics all that much with the next systems.

2097
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And there's a lot of great games coming out. The only thing I can possibly see is doing like a 4K resolution or 8K, but...

2098
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:57,000
But nobody's... You can't... Look at how well that went for 3D on the PlayStation 3. Even that really hasn't cracked yet.

2099
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:06,000
I think we can all assume PlayStation 4 is going to do this 4K super high HD thing, because Sony makes TVs, and they want to sell a few of those, too.

2100
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:17,000
But I want to go back to the question you were really asking, and ask the panel here. I think that's a great question, because we've kind of answered this before a little bit, but not since some of this news came up.

2101
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:24,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox Lube. Do we really need it? They're coming this year. Is it necessary? Does the industry need it?

2102
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Loki, you sell games for a living. What do you think? Do they need it? Are these systems needed right now?

2103
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:38,000
No, because I don't think Nintendo... See, I'm surprised that they're not waiting to put these systems out, because the Wii U...

2104
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:47,000
It's just not doing that well right now. It's not like stealing the thunder from them as much as like the Wii kind of did when that first came out, and everyone was trying to get their hands on it.

2105
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:58,000
But at the same time, I think the sales for their software and hardware are kind of slowing, so they need to put something else out. Especially Sony. Sony, all their stuff is kind of slowing down right now, so they need to...

2106
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:01,000
But they can't support the systems they're putting out, Vita.

2107
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Well, I don't know what they're trying. The Vita price point's too high, and there's not any games coming out.

2108
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:18,000
I'm kind of... Part of the reason I said, and I said this at the end of last year when making predictions for this year, and I originally predicted we wouldn't have the PlayStation 4, and my reason essentially was, we don't need one.

2109
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And Sony has the Vita to work on still, and so forth. So actually, my opinion really hasn't changed, Raginator. I don't think we need PlayStation 4.

2110
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
I'll go back to something I sort of touched on.

2111
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Hold on a sec, Raginator, because Dark Soccer wants to jump in, too. Oh, great, his call bugged out anyway. I swear to God I didn't click a button, but Dark Soccer, your thought while we reconnect.

2112
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Well, I don't think that it's necessary at all. Not yet, anyway. I think that they should be pushing any type of release until far later. We don't need it. They've got a system that...

2113
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I understand the investor pressure, though.

2114
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Yeah. But still, you know, I think that they need to keep working on strengthening what they have using the existing technology, and then bringing out something really mind-blowing.

2115
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Raginator, go ahead and get your thought out now that the call's back, and then we can move on.

2116
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Sure. Yeah, I was going to say, you know, at least with the higher resolution TVs out there, and if possible, you know, using PS4 and 720 to go work with those, the trouble is the adoption rate with the higher resolution TVs is pretty low.

2117
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:42,000
And from my perspective, the one problem with the adoption of those higher resolution TVs is that there's not really a whole lot of content, if any, for those higher resolution TVs.

2118
02:45:42,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Now, if Rock, SKD, and cable companies were to really go balls to the wall and support that stuff, plus now you have higher resolution videos, like, you know, whatever next-gen Blu-ray comes out or whatever, if that supports the higher resolution, plus the gains, then I can see something new coming out, or something that we can't even think of right off the bat.

2119
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:17,000
That next system could potentially do that current systems can't do.

2120
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:24,000
That's, you know what, that's a good point, because high definition in itself took a long time for us to really adopt. High definition...

2121
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:30,000
It's still not a big adoption rate, because look at Blu-ray. Blu-ray is still not... People aren't replacing their DVD collections with Blu-ray.

2122
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Yeah, but even at least high-def TVs right now are pretty much, like, all you can buy. Like, you can't even really buy standard def... Well, you can't secondhand, of course.

2123
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
But you can't even really, like, walk into a Best Buy and find a standard def TV, you know, maybe way in the back or something.

2124
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I mean, it's all about HDTV, at least now that's finally catching on where it's really the mainstream, but that took, like, ten years to get there, a very long time.

2125
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,000
But in the middle of that was the 360 and the PlayStation 3, which was, like, our first HD gaming.

2126
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:03,000
So maybe the 4K thing is a preemptive strike, but I don't know, it could be way too early.

2127
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Anyway, RageNator, gotta let you go to get more calls, but thank you so much for the call, buddy.

2128
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Sure, no problem.

2129
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Take care, and thanks for the video.

2130
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:16,000
One 877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2131
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:25,000
RasteelUT saying, VHS was around nearly ten years after DVD. That's true, you have the overlap that happens, too.

2132
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Yeah, but Atrex didn't totally last that many years.

2133
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I also consider that, I mean, these older generation systems could probably push better graphics, because the original Xbox and even the PlayStation 2, some games did output to HD, like 720p and 1080i.

2134
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:48,000
You know, assuming the games support it. Not all of them, but some of them did.

2135
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Alright, while we wait for another call, maybe possibly, let's go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.

2136
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Actually, I'm gonna bring it up on the desktop here. I usually use my iPad for it, but I left that in the other room like a genius.

2137
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,000
So I'll pull that up here. I know at least there was a couple things from Tiger Claw in there.

2138
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Of course, it would help if I sign in as the right account.

2139
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Help, someone buy me time.

2140
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I'm broke, so I won't have, no. Words.

2141
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Rob is actually signing into Twitter right now, everybody. I am filling time so that we do not have to-

2142
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Except I can't remember the password to the stinking Twitter account, because when you manage-

2143
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Burrito!

2144
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
When you manage for Twitter, the password is not burrito. When you manage for Twitter accounts-

2145
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Don't tell them that. I'd love to see how many people try to log in with the wrong word.

2146
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,000
That's true, huh?

2147
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Log him out of his account because, you know, Twitter hacks and-

2148
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Nah.

2149
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Alright, I see a bunch of stories here from Tiger Claw, but first, let me do a tweet from YYR who is surfing around the PlayStation Network and said,

2150
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Hey, this is on sale right now on PSN. It's the Namco Museum. That's right, I saw that for sale in the PlayStation 3 store.

2151
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Why is this important? Namco Museum is the PlayStation 3 game where we have a cameo. Remember this cameo?

2152
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Yes, it is.

2153
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:09,000
We're in the opening. There's a little screen that talks about the Namco Museum and the Network features.

2154
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,000
And look very closely at the high scoreboard, and you'll see some familiar names.

2155
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:19,000
And a big thank you to the OLR fans, or fan, who put us in a game.

2156
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Much thanks.

2157
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:26,000
It doesn't get any better than that, right? Like, I can quit now. I made it in a video game.

2158
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
I can die.

2159
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
I can die now.

2160
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
It's like butter.

2161
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,000
And if you haven't checked it out, you have bungee fair tossing.

2162
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Yes, especially with this unfortunate news about XNA this week where even though Microsoft hasn't updated it in three years,

2163
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:46,000
they basically said they're not going to. Really unfortunate that indie games are probably not going to be a thing on the Xbox lube.

2164
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:51,000
I don't know, we're just left to hypothesize. Maybe they've got something newer, bigger, better coming out, I hope.

2165
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:57,000
But yes, support the indie games. Because it's not like indie games are cooked up overnight.

2166
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:02,000
A lot of these guys started it a long time ago before they made these announcements about XNA.

2167
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:08,000
So, support indie games and start with bungee fair tossing. That's a good one to pick.

2168
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:12,000
A bunch of tweets from Tigerclaw. I'll read a couple of them here.

2169
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,000
This one's a My Little Pony story, but it's one-

2170
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,000
But no one cares, Skip.

2171
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:23,000
No, no, no. It's worth reading. Because they were actually making a fighting game, My Little Pony, MLP fighting is magic.

2172
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Well, surprise, surprise. A cease and desist from Hasbro's legal representatives, and this was posted to their site at main6.com,

2173
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:40,000
asking them to stop the distribution of any materials that My Little Pony characters, names, locations, or elements from the show,

2174
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
including YouTube, Twitch, and so forth.

2175
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:50,000
They attempted to negotiate Hasbro for the continued use of the property for their voluntary project, but they didn't get an answer.

2176
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Does this really surprise anybody?

2177
02:50:52,000 --> 02:51:00,000
If you're going to make a fan game like that or something, just do it on the down low, release it, then do a cease and desist, it's on the internet, what are you going to do?

2178
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Don't hype it up. I mean, if you're trying to recruit people, I guess that's one thing, but try to do it on the down low,

2179
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:13,000
because the more you hype it up, the more visibility it's going to get, and then the company has an obligation to protect their trademarks and so forth,

2180
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:22,000
to put the C&D out there. So, and I don't think fighting ponies was what they wanted to have happen.

2181
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Obi-Wan Jabroni on OLR says, hey, OLR, give me a shout out. It's fucking 5 a.m. here.

2182
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Where are you where it's 5 a.m.? Is that the UK? Are you maybe in the military? That could be the mid-east, I don't know.

2183
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,000
But shout out to you for it being pretty late.

2184
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I could do a shout, but then Rob's landlord would get complaints from the neighbors, so.

2185
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,000
You can go listen to this week's Hoard House and get a scream and shout, that's all I'm going to say.

2186
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Let's go to one more call here on Skype. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2187
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Hey, this is Acdeft.

2188
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,000
It's like I say My Little Pony and then all of a sudden, look who's on the line. What's up, Acdeft?

2189
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Well, Black Wolf's going to hate me for this, but yeah, I want to talk about the fighting this magic game.

2190
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:10,000
I'm only letting you do it because it's relevant to gaming talk right now.

2191
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:17,000
This thing getting pulled was good news for you guys because it gives you an excuse to talk about it and be relevant.

2192
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
So go for it while you can.

2193
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Yeah, well. Oh, Black Wolf. Anyways, yeah, I'm pretty, well, sad that it got the cease and desist letter.

2194
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Though, yeah, it was eventually going to happen because it got a lot of media attention.

2195
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:50,000
An article went up on GameSpot and it also was competing to be the eighth game featured on the EVO tournament this year.

2196
02:52:50,000 --> 02:53:01,000
And like I said, it caught a lot of attention and it was almost finished.

2197
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:06,000
They were pretty much on the final stage of development.

2198
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Well, that means it's going to leak to the Internet anyway.

2199
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:13,000
And they'll just say, oh, our computer, our computer was hacked and the finished version leaked to the Internet.

2200
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Like that'll happen. Didn't that happen to the Chrono Trigger thing that Square Enix shut down?

2201
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Most positive it did.

2202
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
There was music from that came out.

2203
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Yeah. Once it hits the Internet, it's never coming off.

2204
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:28,000
If they were that close to finishing it, it'll leak in its like beta form or something.

2205
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:34,000
You know, they'll find a way to do it where they will be able to wash their hands of any legal ramifications.

2206
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:41,000
But, I mean, surely you can see with all this attention, wasn't it getting to be a little too big for something that they really...

2207
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I mean, if they didn't have Hasbro's sign off on it, is this really not surprising?

2208
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:51,000
No, it isn't. Like I said, it was eventually going to happen.

2209
02:53:51,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Though most of us that were expecting the game to be released, we're actually looking forward to playing it because it was already leaked before.

2210
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:10,000
So it's already out on the Internet. You can get it on the Pirate Bay and other sites.

2211
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Oh, well then shit. You can't shut that down.

2212
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:21,000
It was a pretty early build of it, so it's somewhat buggy and it isn't complete.

2213
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:26,000
But, yeah, even then it looked like a pretty good game.

2214
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:31,000
It was like a regular game, even. A good fighting game.

2215
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:36,000
And it was featured on EVO on their Indie Showcase last year.

2216
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Yeah, like I said, many people, even in the fighting community, were expecting a lot of it.

2217
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I just want to make sure. It was still a good fighting game without the marijuana, right?

2218
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
I don't do drugs, so yeah.

2219
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Okay, alright. Good answer. Very good answer.

2220
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Winners don't do drugs.

2221
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Alright, yes, that's right. Winners don't do drugs. And that is the real message here.

2222
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Alright, I gotta let you go before Black Wolf pulls the plug on the show, so take care, buddy.

2223
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
You too. Thanks. Bye.

2224
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2225
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I think My Little Pony Call will do that.

2226
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Just fucking with you guys.

2227
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Let's do one more tweet, because Tigerclad said a bunch of stories.

2228
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I want to do at least one more of these here.

2229
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Ooh, we'll do this one. It's a pinball story.

2230
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Pinball is always relevant.

2231
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Very cool pinball, actually.

2232
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Star Wars Pinball announced by Zen Studios.

2233
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Hell yes to this.

2234
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Zen Studios is partnering with LucasArts for a Star Wars pinball.

2235
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:43,000
This is awesome. Did you see this little table shot here that has like...

2236
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Oh, that's neat.

2237
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Yeah, a little Boba Fett and C-3PO. It's awesome.

2238
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:52,000
What is this coming to? This is going to be Pinball FX2.

2239
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:58,000
And it'll be available on Live Arcade, Windows 8, PlayStation Network, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Cross Buy.

2240
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Isn't this supposed to be on Wii U at some point, too?

2241
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I think so. That's awesome.

2242
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Congrats to Zen Studios. That's a hell of a partnership to land there.

2243
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Good job, you guys.

2244
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:13,000
All right. That's going to do it for our Twitter topics tonight.

2245
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Again, twitter.com... Excuse me.

2246
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Yeah, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us tweets in the future.

2247
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
And that does it for the Skype line tonight.

2248
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:23,000
If you didn't get through and you have something you want to say, please email us.

2249
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2250
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Or tweet us for next week.

2251
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Since there was no last minute stories, I believe that brings us to another close of an episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2252
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us and supporting us through another week.

2253
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
We are an independently produced show.

2254
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Literally done out of somebody's dining room.

2255
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Where we don't dine. We have radio stuff set up anywhere.

2256
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
I dine. Sometimes.

2257
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Yeah, you bring Panda Express in there once in a while.

2258
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
He brings pizza. It works out.

2259
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:54,000
But anyway, all we ask... We don't ask for your money or anything like that.

2260
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:57,000
All we ask... Help spread the word. Help grow our family.

2261
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Give us a nice review on whatever website you found this through. Be it iTunes or what have you.

2262
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
And just tell a friend about Orange Lounge Radio.

2263
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Help us get some word of mouth out there.

2264
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:11,000
And grow our community of awesome people that chat with us every Sunday night.

2265
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
And interact with us throughout the week as they listen on the podcast.

2266
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,000
And leave comments on VOG Network and so forth.

2267
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Anyhow, I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2268
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,000
And we'll start tonight with Dark Sakura. Final thought.

2269
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
My head still hurts.

2270
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
My final thought is...

2271
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Why is my Balthier doll just sitting over there lying on its side like that?

2272
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
He needs to be fixed promptly.

2273
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2274
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I feel way too full.

2275
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Still feeling bloaty? Sorry to hear.

2276
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Uncomfortably so.

2277
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Alright, better than how you were feeling yesterday though.

2278
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Better than Friday, yes.

2279
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2280
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Have a great, safe week everybody.

2281
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
And we'll be back to do it all again next week, alright?

2282
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
See you then. Good night.

2283
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network.

2284
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:26,000
But you know they were all still true.

2285
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
See you next week.

2286
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Thanks for watching!
