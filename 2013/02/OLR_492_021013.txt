Tonight, February 10th, 2013, a Wii U exclusive game is pushed back to go multi-platform.
Controversial rumors surround the next Xbox, and could J.J.
Abrams make a Portal movie after Star Wars?
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio back on this February 10th for our 492nd episode.
After a week off last week, I'll tell you why and give you all our sorry excuses in a minute.
But first, say hello to the well-rested and ready to go back for another week of OLR, my co-host DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
And I'm unemployed.
And you're unemployed.
Fun employed.
It's the preferred term.
Oh, no.
Not very.
I'm not really having a lot of fun because I had what also caused the show to.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
And if I didn't say it, my name is Rob Roberts.
I can't remember if I introduced myself or not.
No, you're not.
So, yes, I am.
How dare you question me?
Anyway, there is no question that we are also joined every week by the one and only.
Who wants to die for art?
Who wants to die for art?
Oh, Loki, Techmaster Loki definitely doesn't want to die for art.
No, I don't.
But he almost did over this weekend.
I didn't almost die.
And he's dying for that pizza he's eating right now.
Well, see, that's the thing is my stomach hasn't stretched out again.
It only takes like a day for it to go back, I guess.
And so I even got a small and I'm only able to eat half of it right now.
That's good.
Yeah, it's portion control, right?
Even though you want to eat the whole thing.
It's alright, I've already done my part.
Sickness, drop five pounds.
Speaking of sickness, it's a big part of the reason why we weren't here last week.
I actually got really sick.
I was out of work on a Friday and a Monday, and no, I was not just trying to extend my weekend.
I actually had the worst of it on Saturday and Sunday.
It's just...
The head cold from hell.
I don't know what else to say about it.
It might have been a flu or something.
So I obviously didn't want these two coming over and getting sick.
Except I already had it.
Yeah, I think you were sick anyway.
I was actually sick for about seven days.
I was like, yeah, I'll just come over anyway.
Yeah, I know.
Loki was like, God damn it.
I'll come over.
I'll just do the show by myself.
And we got to talk about the news.
It's such a busy week in gaming.
I'm like, I know.
I know.
It sucks to lose this week.
But let it go, Loki.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Here's a question for you.
Would you play a football game on Xbox if it was Turians versus humans versus Corians or whatever?
I sincerely doubt that's ever going to happen.
Yeah, I would play it.
Really?
It's not going to happen to a company that owns both of those franchises?
That's right.
I really don't think it's going to happen.
DarkSakura presents... Turian Ball, actually.
No.
Turian Balls might be a whole different type of game that DarkSakura would want to present.
But anyway, let's get into...
That face, though.
I wish this were a video show.
It's not.
It's Orange Lounge Radio.
I was picturing it, but all of my favorite fan artists have other plans.
How many X-rated Mass Effect fan art sites have you looked up in your time, DarkSakura?
Technically only one.
Oh.
But there's a few tumblers that I follow.
Oh, I see.
I see.
But if you don't go to their main page, then it doesn't count because they got reblogged and there's nothing you can do about it, right?
Oh, well, oops.
Oops.
How Is Our Gaming Weeks?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's like, hey, we got PlayStation Home!
I don't fucking care.
Well, it's funny, because when that was all unfolding, I was at work, and I was on one of my 15-minute breaks at work, trying to furiously catch up on Twitter, and I saw what some of the other indie podcasters I follow were saying on it, and like, OMG, PlayStation 4, and I said, why are we getting all... What if this isn't like a PlayStation Vita conference, like a Nintendo Direct style, here's the upcoming Vita games, like, why are we all so... Because there's nothing coming.
Why are we all so quick to assume it's PlayStation 4?
But then, what ended up, Forbes or Wall Street Journal or one of those more financial magazines, or excuse me, newspapers went with a rumor, which they don't typically tend to do unless they really put a lot of stock in it, that yes, it's going to be PlayStation 4.
and, you know, I've said on Orange Launch Radio, I don't believe that Sony is under any obligation to put PlayStation 4 out this year.
We've talked, you know, we talked at the end of last year about what might be the big shocker next year and I even kind of said that PlayStation 4 might not happen this year.
But, you know, I'm okay being wrong.
It happens.
Oh my God, games analysts sometimes get things wrong.
I don't know that yet.
That's true.
But come on, you're right.
Sony has, even if it's Vita, Vita, Vita, Vita and then little tiny
Sony doesn't have to say what Sony doesn't want to say
Troll Troll Troll
But now that you're looking, you know, going up to this February 20th conference, it makes a lot of sense.
They're trying to get around the typical convention cycle of release your news at E3.
They purposefully are doing this ahead of Microsoft a couple weeks after one of their execs even said, we have no reason to show our cards before Microsoft, which is a very interesting sort of turnaround.
It's also the week before Destination PlayStation where they meet with all their retail partners and stuff like that.
So perhaps, you know, this is ahead of that and Game Developers Conference is in March too, right?
So, you know, they might have some things to say or show about that because certainly you've got to have the third party support and get the other developers on board pretty early as another company is learning the hard way this week, but we'll get into that later.
Yeah.
It's very interesting now because Sony will be the talk of everything between February and whenever Microsoft finally announces whatever they're doing, which could be E3 at this point, although why not announce it a little earlier?
It won't be because that's not how they did the 360.
That's true.
That's not how they did the 360.
DarkSakura?
I don't know.
I just have another thought about Sony keeping quiet for the sake of raising that speculation and gathering interest.
Even if they don't mention anything more than a little teeny thing about the PS4, they're building all the suspense and getting people interested in what they're going to say.
Oh yeah, it's definitely the hype machine is in full force now and that's what 2013 is going to be.
It's going to be the year of the...
As somebody called it this week, Gen 4 consoles.
I think Sony themselves called it Gen 4 consoles in an unrelated discussion.
So what's the Nintendo?
Minus 5?
I know, right?
It's like, oh, I see.
The console generations didn't start until Sony got to the table.
I think it's in reality.
What, we're getting into the 9th generation, I think?
I know that the Magnavox, it was the Odyssey, the Fairchild were considered Gen 1 consoles.
Atari was Gen 2.
The Magnavox Odyssey came out in 79 and the Fairchild Channel F came out right around the same time or right before that maybe.
And then there were the Texas Instruments systems came out in 81 so did the 2600?
NextGenGaming.com
one other thing though I think and I wanted to touch on this is I find it very interesting that Sony is kind of going to the web they're taking their case to the internet I find it a move very inspired in part by what Nintendo Direct is doing and you know Sony got a lot of shit the year they unveiled the PlayStation 3 and rightfully so that press conference was a hot mess I mean we made fun of it on this show for years and years Giant Enemy Crabs 599 US dollars Ridge Racer Africa
That was a... No, Africa was the next year.
Was it?
Yeah, I think it was.
No, I don't think it was.
Well, whatever.
It was a fucking mess.
I mean, it was an awesome mess and we loved it as gamers.
But Sony doesn't want to make that same mistake twice.
So why not have a nice, polished, pre-edited presentation that they deliver directly to the internets?
Which I also think is fascinating is that...
E3 is losing some of its relevance in that regard.
Now, I'm not out here saying E3's dead, oh my god, and you know, E3 has its place, it's important, yes, but it's very interesting that E3 is not going to have the big reveals of either of these consoles, although certainly...
some of the big game announcements and some of the specifications release dates, prices a lot of that probably won't come out till E3 don't expect you're going to know the release date and the price of this machine on February 20th not going to happen I feel very confident in saying that
because Sony does kind of want to size up what their competition is doing before they're ready to announce something like that.
And just the price of parts can fluctuate that much in the time period between February and when this thing actually gets released.
Anything that you are looking forward to or not out of this particular event on the 20th?
Because it's only 10 days away at this point.
No, I'm not even really considering anything.
I just... I don't know.
It'd be nice to see what they had planned for the Vita.
As I mentioned on Twitter, I got rid of mine.
Yeah, someone was interested in making an offer on it before someone put it on eBay.
Yeah, I noticed that all came up.
That was in the two-week break.
You sold your Vita during the two-week break.
Yeah.
So, you know, there's really nothing coming out for the Vita.
And the PlayStation 3, it's just not really... Not a whole lot of stuff that excites me about that.
So...
I don't know.
It would be interesting to see what they have to offer, what's going to be unique.
Once again, it's going to have to be something that's kind of this big wow factor thing.
That's really what did it for the Wii.
The Wii may not have been technologically superior, but it was like, hey, look, you're going to be able to play games a completely different way than you've ever played games before.
And that's why it took off.
Now that everybody kind of has the same type of thing, it's...
Thanks for watching!
I just really hope that this, you know, new console, you know, I think we've heard a lot about not necessarily this console may not be so much about the technological aspect of it, but kind of the way it integrates itself, the gaming, you know, a true entertainment box and that whole, you know, social gaming becoming more prevalent and Gaikai integration, you know, how is that going to be a factor and so forth.
One thing I really fear, though, is that I really fear all the execs sitting in the boardroom, and we all know just about every bad decision made in gaming started in a boardroom somewhere, right?
And I'm really worried that everybody's just tapping into Facebook.
We've got to have a piece of Facebook gaming.
Facebook is gaming.
That's what people want.
People want Facebook, and they want the mobile games and the OUYA, and that's what the people want.
And we've got to have a one-button integration that goes with Facebook and so forth, and
We got to have games playable on Facebook that are on the PlayStation 3.
And I'm just like, God, I hope not.
Because that really feels like a step backwards to me.
If we go all like Farmville on PlayStation 3, that can be one element of it.
But I really hope that's not the focus.
I don't think that they're going to do that because they've been kind of more, you know, core audience.
Once again, you know, and the same thing would have been reading all these, you know,
and so on.
Thanks for watching!
so that's the thing is no one's forcing you at gunpoint to buy a new console for the next generation so I don't understand why anybody should feel you know like that this is your own choice just listen to what their options are and then make a decision or hey trust me if you decide not to buy a new console there's plenty of games you know seven generations worth of games that you can go play
Going to the chat room, of course, we always do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
And a big thank you to all those of you that have turned up live tonight.
I know we have a lot of competition going on tonight with the silly Grammys on TV, which I think are one of the worst of all the award shows, but people still seem to want to watch it anyway, so there's that.
Jack Trenton said that they didn't believe in not making a system where you couldn't play used games on
I know we're going to get into this a little more later in the show, but I just don't think Sony or Microsoft, for that matter, is that stupid.
But, I mean, again, every bad decision comes from a boardroom somewhere.
It's incredibly ballsy to try something like that.
I think that's a good way to put it.
That would be a ballsy move.
That's basically saying, hey, buy, sell, trade retailers, we don't need you.
And when they say buy, sell, trade retailers, we mean GameStop.
They need GameStop.
And that's just going back to what you said, Loki.
It just encourages people not to buy it, and so publishers are stuck making games for the systems they already have.
It's gotta be everybody's on board or not.
And even then, if everybody's on board with it, people will go elsewhere.
I mean...
At this point, they're not the only companies making consoles.
I mean, granted, there's going to be the Ouya, which is Android-based and stuff, and that may not be what you're looking for, but it's open.
It's more open than these consoles are, so if they try to do something like that, which they're not, I just don't see it working out for them.
Actdeft in our chatroom, and the PSP didn't catch up at all.
The Vita seems like it's going the way of the PSP or worse.
Is the Vita hosed at this point?
Do you think Sony... I mean, I know you just sold yours this week, so maybe I can already tell your perspective.
But has Sony written the Vita off?
Is the Vita done for?
I don't think they've written it off, but they sure didn't start off very well.
Because the problem was they outsourced a lot of their big games for...
Thanks for watching!
and it sucks because you had the same company that made the really terrible first person shooter resistance game do that and now, you know, they had even like Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation which was supposed to be alright but I don't think it was, you know, I don't know if it sold systems but...
The thing was, now the next game that's supposed to be this, oh, this is really going to define the system as Killzone, which, that's cool that it's a first-person shooter in Killzone, but I'm not a big fan of the Killzone franchise.
So for me, looking at the outlook of what's coming out for the Vita, there just wasn't anything there for me.
That's why I got rid of it, because I just had nothing I wanted to play on it.
What happened with things like Final Fantasy X Remake?
Oh, that's still way the hell down there.
And who cares?
It's a remake of Final Fantasy X. Well, the whole HD part, there's parts about that that are relevant to my interests.
I'd check it out, probably.
Whatever, I mean, I just... I played 10 already, so... I agree that you can't... You know, you can't support your system with nothing but remakes, Nintendo.
But, you know, it's... It helps.
It's just not... I mean, that's nice...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It wasn't my thing.
I mean, I'm not even really a huge fan of Smash Bros., but at least Smash Bros.
seemed like... I don't know.
It was kind of more fun.
I guess I can identify... Not really identify the characters, but, you know, the characters were a little bit more... I don't know how to really put it.
It's just like I don't really have any... I guess any attachments to any of these characters in the Sony game, I guess.
It's like, you know, Jak and Daxter, cool.
I haven't really played any of those games.
Or Sly Cooper.
You know, I...
I don't really care about that series there just wasn't a lot of stuff there now if they announced Grand Theft Auto and it was coming out in March that'd be a whole different story I'd probably be still keeping that system or it just if they announced hey Grand Theft Auto is coming to the Vita yeah I'd be still sticking on to that but it's just nothing that I really wanted for it was coming out and it's kind of the same problem with the 3DS because remember the 3DS was when they were talking about 3DS it was like hey Saints Row DJ Hero coming to the 3DS I was like fuck
Yes, that sold the system for me.
Saints Row on the go and DJ Hero, that'd be pretty awesome.
And then neither one came out, so I was like, ah, fuck that.
Yeah, that was disappointing.
But really, overall, what it is is it's just I don't have time for portable gaming anymore.
It's like I don't go anywhere.
I don't need a portable system, so there's really no need for me to have this.
Some comments from chat.
TigerClaw says, Sly Cooper is awesome, and Actdeft says, Loki, you should totally play Sly Cooper for real.
Well, then, cool.
I can pick it up on my PS3, but I'm not.
Once again, it's just I don't need a portable system anymore is what it is.
I just don't need it because I don't.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Busy, actually.
I played some Mass Effect 2, of course.
I actually don't think I logged into WoW at all, which is weird.
And I started Dragon Age 2, which I really like the game.
I liked it when I played it before.
It just, you know, killed my hand to play on the Xbox.
So I'm playing it on PC, and I'm having a really good time with it.
And...
We have had another addition to our gaming family.
What else was it that I was playing?
Oh yeah, we got another Super Nintendo that came with a box of games.
And among them was Pocky and Rocky 2.
Which goes for, oh, unboxed a good 90 bucks on eBay.
It's a pretty rare Super Nintendo game.
We bought the whole batch for 50.
Where did you find all this?
Goodwill.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Wow.
You know what else I got at Goodwill?
An earring magic pen.
In the box.
That's awesome, though.
For $10.
You found such a gaming motherlode, I guess, of sorts.
Well, since we've already got a bajillion other Super Nintendos, we're going to sell this one with a copy of Super Mario World.
We'll put it up on Craigslist, and I'll share the link later.
Dan's also selling his old driving rig.
and I got a copy of Mega Man X out of it because you got dupes so I can't complain.
Well, we've got a bunch of other dupes too but Dan and I sat all that night, that first night and played Jeopardy together.
Like the deluxe Jeopardy and he's like, I don't know what area to pick now.
I know all this other stuff.
What about this?
I was like, just pick the French Revolution and then I started answering all the questions in the French Revolution because you know me, I'm a stupid history nerd and he's like, oh my God, you knew all those.
I was like, yeah, you married a smart woman.
Hi.
and like Wheel of Fortune.
We played Wheel of Fortune and Super Tecmo Bowl.
Superbazooka
Blastrous.
Yeah, Blastrous.
Yeah, we've got like a bajillion Super Scope 6 copies now.
And another Mario Paint, even though we have no mouse.
We have the mouse pad, we have no mouse.
And what else?
Battle Clash?
Not Battle Clash.
Battle Chess?
No, not Battle Chess.
It was another Super Scope game that's like...
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
The other Super Super Six game.
Or Metal something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something tank thing.
I'm sure somebody in chat will yell it out, but yeah.
We also, what else came in that collection?
I said Wheel of Fortune, right?
Yeah.
No.
Wheel of Fortune came with it.
Killer Instinct also came with it.
What'd you find?
Battle Clash Battle Clash, that's it was the game I think you're thinking of there was also this is the long list of games that supported the Super Scope Battle Clash, Bazooka Blitzkrieg The Hunt for Red October had bonus games in it Lamborghini American Challenge had many games Lemmings 2 The Tribes had calibration Metal Combat, Falcon's Revenge, Operation Thunderbolt I remember that one
T2 The Arcade Game, Tin Star, X-Zone, Yoshi Safari
We got something like, I want to say, 12 games or so with the system.
Dan and I also sat down, because he took a few days off and I'm unemployed.
We cataloged all of our games that we have at our house right now, and this isn't including what we've loaned out.
or what's not at the house given that would be our Atari, all of our Atari games which would be 2600, 5200, 7800 we did get Lynx though, Lynx stuff was at the house our Clicovision, Intellivision and Odyssey, Odyssey 2 collection so we cataloged 1279 individual games and we have dupes of some of them
Indipendent Skews
Fair enough Even though you're not a Best Buy, but that works I forgot that we had two copies of Cyberbots But Dan and I are actually starting to think about selling off some of our dupes So we're giving friends and OLR listeners first crack So I'll let you guys know when that's happening
All right, very retrotastic week, it sounds like.
It's awesome.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
What have you been up to?
What have you been sick?
Let's see, what did I do?
I played a bit of Minecraft.
I built, I'm not really sure what it is, a small bridge, I guess.
Oh yeah, I played that too.
And then, um, I just noticed actually our dynamic map's not working correctly.
It's showing up someone else's world, which is not of my interest.
Um, and then I played, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row the 3rd today because, um, I'd left some of my games at work and I wanted to play those, but, um, you know, Saints Row happened to be in my bag and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Damn, that kind of sucks.
I really don't want to play that game again.
I mean, maybe later on, but just not... I don't know.
I just don't want to do all those activities again because some of those are really annoying.
And then, let's see, what else?
I also played a little bit of Forza Horizon, just mainly working on some decals.
I played a small bit... Well, we played some Borderlands 2 this week, and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Skyrim, more Skyrim my modded game on PC it's getting really buggy probably because I'm not supposed to put 87 mods on it I actually removed some because I had 90 something there at one point but
Um, yeah, lots of mods in the game.
It's, it's awesome because the game is so large.
Once again, I don't know, I can't remember what's part of the game and what's a mod, at least some of this stuff.
I mean, obviously the Realm of Chuck Norris wasn't in, um, the original Skyrim, but, uh,
It's fun.
And I did try the Dovah Bear mod and it got annoying because Dovah Bear, like most of the other NPCs in some games, it just kept walking in front of me and trapping me in places because it just wouldn't get out of my way.
And I wanted to attack things and just stand there growling and
Thank you for watching!
My gaming week.
Last week when I was sick, I played a lot more Ni No Kuni, which I talked about on a previous episode of the show.
Still enjoying it, even though I'm about to that 15-16 hour mark.
And of course, I've taken a pretty big break the past few days.
I played a lot of console games when I was sick, so I've not been wanting to do that because I haven't been sick since Monday.
But I do still intend on finishing Ni No Kuni at some point.
Path of Exile Path of Exile
and I don't know if you guys are familiar with this game at all but Path of Exile is a free game and it is put out by Gear Grinder Games.
I might have messed that up, sorry.
I don't have the notes in front of me but it's got microtransactions in it but they are very big on saying that
They want to do ethical microtransactions.
They don't want to do the type of microtransactions that would hold you back in like a Zynga game, like an energy meter running out or something.
They want to sell cosmetics, spell effects, pets.
And if you look at their marketplace, that is the kind of stuff they're selling along with like extra character slots and extra stash things and so forth.
The money factor is not holding the game back, whatever.
Which I believe technically the game is still considered open beta right now.
And probably will be in beta for a long time, kind of like Gmail is.
But Path of Exile is a Diablo clone of sorts, for lack of a better term.
That's the best way I could explain it to you.
If you've played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2 or even Diablo 3, you pretty much get the gist of what Path of Exile is going to be like.
and it does have the fully online integration where you can get other people to join your game while you're going and you can party up to take on mobs that will be of an increased difficulty.
Let's see.
Also, there are six classes in the game and everything is kind of based around the three kind of guiding stats of intelligence,
Strength, Dexterity.
And so you have one class that's very focused in each of those areas.
Like I play a witch, which is the intelligence-focused class.
But then there's other classes that are like Strength meets Dexterity, Strength meets Intelligence, which I think is like the Templar, and so on and so on.
And everything is very dictated by the colors that go along with those stats because you get gems that are those colors.
Most items have sockets in them.
All the abilities are driven by gems.
And where this game gets really interesting is that you get gems that modify abilities if you have them in a connected socket.
Like for example, let's say I have a blue gem that makes fire and I do like a little fire bolt.
Well, when I beat a quest later on, I might get another gem that's called fork.
And if I put fork and I tie it in a socket that joins with the fire spell, I will get a fireball that forks.
It's pretty cool because it gives it this way of developing your own spells in a way.
There is no gold in the game, which I found very interesting at first, but everything is basically barter.
The scrolls of Identify and the scrolls of Town Portal become your currency, which is really interesting to me.
The way you level up your characters is basically Final Fantasy X's Crystallarium.
I can't really explain it any better, but it's this gigantic map where you move through all these different talents.
I think the level cap in the game is like 100.
You can imagine this leveling chart is gigantic.
and so there's so many ways that you could screw up your build because one of the tiny drawbacks is that there's very few ways to respec.
I mean, you can respec a little bit limited, one point or two, but if you screw up your class, you're stuck with it and you'll have to roll again or whatever.
But yeah, I mean did I mention this game's free?
So how can I sit here and really complain about it at all?
The graphics are really good, they're optimized very well Especially, you know, because I even have problems in games like Diablo 3 and Warcraft sometimes But the graphics are optimized very well in Path of Exile
and I guess the only maybe little drawback I would say is that I feel like the camera is always zoomed in too much and although you can zoom in a little bit to you know kind of see your character a different way for screenshots and whatever like you can't zoom out enough which can kind of be a bitch in multiplayer modes but that is one tiny ass gripe in the scope of what is really a great game that if you're a fan of Diablo or Torchlight or any of that stuff this game is free
and I will be honest to God surprised if this game can pull it off and sustain itself on this model.
That's the only thing.
I kind of look at this and go, how can this company not be bankrupt in a year?
But I've been enjoying it enough where I almost just want to kick them 20 bucks just to say, well done, applause.
I'll just buy something stupid like more character slots or something just to support the game.
I actually kind of want to do that.
It's weird, huh?
But I want to support a company that I think is doing a pretty awesome thing here.
Yeah, so Path of Exile.
I recommend it.
I do.
Even though the game's still in beta and so forth, it's fun.
And hopefully we'll only get better with time as it gets out of beta.
So, well done.
That was pretty much my gaming week.
So we'll move on to some housekeeping news.
You can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
We're also on Facebook and Google+, so please find us on social media.
We appreciate it.
Also want to give a shout-out to our friends at Anime Jam Session.
It's one of the other shows you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network on Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
They are about to hit 100 shows this week, so congratulations to Ranma, Ari Rockefeller, the whole gang over there at Anime Jam Session.
By the way, to celebrate their 100th episode
and DarkSakura.
All right, that does it for housekeeping.
Let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.
It's been pretty damn busy, hasn't it, Loki?
Yes.
So one of the announcements this week was that Rayman Legends has been delayed.
Oh, no.
It was originally supposed to be one of the bigger Wii U releases for people that bought the Wii U. It was one of the games that they were kind of touting, not even E3.
And the other bit of news that goes along with that, not only has it been delayed to September, but now it's not going to be exclusive to the Wii U anymore.
It's also coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Because they want to make money.
Exactly.
Because they said that the reason that they have the delay is because it's not done yet.
And, you know, they said, well, we could put out the Wii U version now and then do the other ones later in September.
But we usually release all of our stuff simultaneously.
And we're just, you know, it's not a standard practice.
We just do this on a case-by-case basis.
Basically, here's what it is.
Okay, folks, if you think about it.
This is going to be a game that they're going to want to market.
Why would you double your marketing spend so that the Wii U people, the very few of them that may buy this game, get advertised to?
I mean, so basically, it's better just to wait, put the extra polish on the Wii U version of the game, put it out in the other consoles, make some additional content, market it all at the same time in September.
What does suck, though, about that is...
What the hell is now coming out for the Wii U?
Because, honestly, that was going to be the only game for the Wii U in February.
So now you have two months with no Wii U games.
When's Pikmin out?
March?
No, Pikmin got delayed.
Oh, boy.
Not good.
There's no first party title.
There's the LEGO game, right?
The LEGO game is the only first party title that they have for... I mean, that's... Yeah, it's not really Nintendo, but they're, I guess, publishing it.
But, yeah, that's going to be... There's a lot of stuff in March, but, I mean, let me put it this way.
I looked at the list of stuff coming out for the Wii U. There's maybe about eight games until the end of the year so far that have been announced.
and I'm including all of the like Zelda HD and all that stuff.
I mean, there's literally not a lot to go around right now.
Well, then to play devil's advocate.
Yes, I can see where the audience for this Rayman game will expand quite a bit by delaying the game and doing it on 360 and PlayStation 3.
I get that.
But at the same time, you had a captive audience of
That is how some people are really taking this news
Ubisoft right now is pulling in profit hand over fist, so I don't really think that it's going to hurt them that badly.
Entertain my point for a minute here, whether I really believe this or not.
What about the concept that there was a captive audience in the Wii U audience, and now in September, you're going to get your game notice in September?
I mean, Rayman, yes, it has its fans, and it's always going to appeal, especially as a kid-friendly type of game, where I've seen a lot of people on the internet saying, well, now it's got to go up against Grand Theft Auto.
Hello.
How short-sighted of a statement is that?
I'm sorry.
If you are one of those people saying that, I'm smacking you upside the head.
Wake up call.
Do those two games really have the same audiences?
Counter-advocate.
Hello.
Yeah, I know.
Family.
Yeah.
Where it's a decision between buying something for the kids or buying something for the grown-ups.
however all that being said when you're at September you're knocking down the Christmas season's door and those games are going to be a dime a dozen those family games so why wasn't the opportunity seized to really have Nintendo fans full undivided attention a smaller audience yes a loyal audience clearly Loki any thoughts on that um
I once again, I just think it just comes down to money.
And it's because they're going to spend less money in marketing that.
I mean, they could just put it out the Wii U version without any marketing.
But then, you know, they're not going to make a whole ton of money off of that.
I mean, granted, they've already kind of marketed it with demos and stuff like that.
But once again, you have to consider what the install base of the Wii U is.
It's not very large.
And how many what percentage of those people are going to buy Rayman Legends?
being that's the only game in two months maybe quite a few of them but it's still not a big chunk I mean if you could guarantee all of them would buy it and maybe that might be worth it but it's just it's not gonna happen they know third-party attachment rates on this these things are not not good
I want to share a point, and I will credit this to Bobby because it's something he said on his show, so please support Mr. Bobby Blackwolf.
Bobby Blackwolf Show, 5 o'clock here at VOG, 8 o'clock Eastern.
He talked about how Nintendo gets this rap all the time where it's all about the first-party games, and Nintendo does great for first-party and their stuff, but they don't do enough for third-party games.
So here they go, they put out their system and the reason why they have this big blank slate is that they wanted the third parties to be able to carry this, is that they didn't want to flood the market with their own stuff because they wanted the third parties to have a chance to shine, to have a chance to sell their games.
And to be fair, Zombie U has done very well in that category, also an Ubisoft game.
But, you know, the system's launch was Mario and Nintendo Land and there's not going to be anything else till Christmas.
So third parties, here you go.
Here's your chance to shine.
And instead of taking that chance, Ubisoft has literally shit on them.
like literally taking a dump all over that offering from Nintendo I mean whether it's a good business decision or not that's pretty much what happened because Nintendo did put a lot of stock and investment in this whole you know we got Rayman Legends coming da da da we got an exclusive demo da da da only to get the literally shit on by Ubisoft with this
So I mean, can we really complain about how Nintendo doesn't support third parties when this is how the third parties respond?
Well, okay, I'm sorry, but to play, I guess, devil's advocate there, I don't really think that the whole blank space right here is to allow for third parties.
I think it's that Nintendo's development is fucked up, and that's because they had stuff for first quarter that they were going to put out first-party titles, and they're just not fucking done yet.
And it's not a matter of them, oh, we're being gracious to these third parties.
They have nothing coming up.
They're probably, like...
Thanks for watching!
There's still PlayStation 2 games coming out last year.
I mean, a couple, but that's still many years after the system's done.
Versus the Wii U comes out, nothing this year.
There's like three games for the Wii coming out.
And that's it.
It's just nothing.
Just drop down to nothing.
And there's nothing for your new system either.
It's just like they said, fuck you guys, we're just going to go to the other platforms.
I've been playing Devil's Advocate a lot.
Here's my honest opinion.
Here's what I really think.
Now that I've shared all this other stuff, here's what I really think.
The Ubisoft decision from a purely business and nothing else perspective, it does make sense.
And so as disappointing as that is, as a Wii U owner, honestly, I probably wasn't going to buy the game anyway.
Rayman was not the system seller for me anyway.
I think Nintendo is in a situation exactly like the 3DS situation.
And it's really ridiculous that they're in that situation yet again.
But I think the only way out of it... I mean, the 3DS is in a great place now.
And Nintendo is essentially going to have to repeat history.
They're going to have to eat shit.
They're going to have to cut the price of the Wii U. That's the only thing now.
And we're going to get another one of those E3s this year where Reggie comes out on stage and says...
You fucking want games?
Bam.
Here's a game.
Here's a game.
Here's a game.
Here's a game.
Fuck you.
I'm out.
That's going to be their E3 this year.
It's going to be just like the year that this all went down with 3DS.
And that'll be that.
And then a year from now, we're all going to sit here going, how did we ever doubt Nintendo and the Wii U?
Will the Wii U be the force to be reckoned with the Wii was?
No.
But if these... I mean, who's to say these other consoles...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and things they might do and missteps they might make of their own that could really piss people off in convincing them to spend $500 on these new consoles and if that happens and you're the soccer mom come Christmas time do you want to buy one of these $500 consoles that doesn't play used games or do you want to buy this other console that has the Nintendo name on it that has Mario's face on it that just had its price slashed by 50 bucks to play games that albeit are not that much better technologically than the ones that are out now
Believe it, that could happen all over again.
History could very well repeat itself.
Even though we're all sitting here laughing at Nintendo right now, don't count them out.
It is way too early, and Nintendo is far too stubborn to let it go.
I also have the special superpower of lucky bitch powers.
Because seriously, I mean, have you not noticed that just when things seem, you know, about to be down for Nintendo, they pull something out of their ass or something turns around or just one little thing will work in their favor and it all turns around.
Right?
Yeah.
Lucky bitch powers.
We'll see, though.
A lot can happen between now and E3.
It's going to be a very interesting year.
Can't wait.
A note for our live listeners.
We are aware that the show is cutting out a little bit here and there, and a lot of you are having to reload.
We're sorry about it.
The same problem was affecting Bobby's show tonight, so we actually think it does not originate with us.
I know we had some lousy...
Blame God Blame God
It's really the problem is our choice to go with Blizzard cooling for our server.
Exactly, right?
Should have gone with water or air.
No, Blizzard!
It's better.
Did you get all that Rayman stuff out?
They're going to have an exclusive demo.
Hey, good luck Nintendo, man.
They know how to show appreciation.
They're going to have you guys put out another... Ubisoft's going to put out another demo.
and other exclusive ream and legends demo.
At some point.
Ross Steel and UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the third parties aren't going to go back to Nintendo.
It's not gonna happen.
I think that's a bold as fuck statement.
I don't know.
I mean, there's some other stuff that we may talk about later on that...
Well, why don't I throw this out there as far as third parties go.
Activision, interesting little development during their earnings call where Bobby Kotick was asked about Skylanders and so forth, how the console sales with that all goes.
He said, quote, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U. We're concerned about the install base for 6 to 11 year olds.
So, of course, this caused all the blogs to run with...
Activision is concerned about Nintendo because he did use that you know we're concerned okay we'll see I don't think I wouldn't worry about this too long term but it does show Nintendo really has to show a clear future on how that console is going to print money very soon
Here's one for you, since I see it's not in our show rule.
EA.
There's no EA sports games for the Wii or Wii U this year, so far.
Yeah, I noticed that.
And that's up through August, through Madden.
No Tiger, no... And this even goes with 2K.
No MLB game.
There's no NCAA and no Madden.
I mean, that's...
Thank you for watching!
I don't know.
FIFA.
I could see FIFA being on there.
But right now, no Wii U titles, sports-wise.
And who knows?
Maybe they'll continue with other franchises of theirs.
Let's not forget, though, despite the fact we say all the third parties are abandoning ship, which I think it's a little early to say that for sure, remember one place where Wii U and Nintendo themselves have really endeared themselves, and don't count out what this base can do for your console, is indies.
PS3, Xbox 360 Heavy
Maybe people have all started realizing that it's the same game every year.
Nope, they haven't figured that out yet.
Still the number one selling sports game.
Ranma in our chatroom suggests Tecmo Bowl for Wii U, please.
It could be an interesting time for somebody.
Didn't they try that for the Wii and how well did that sell?
Yeah, that's true.
This could be an interesting time for somebody else to come in and do their knockoff game.
I mean, it couldn't be NBA or NFL officially, but...
you have to know there's no football game that's as good as super high impact end of story
High Impact Wii U. No Super Garrus Ball.
Anything is possible.
Yeah, Super Garrus Ball.
Guys.
Mega Man Soccer.
You know, even I think the joke is getting old.
Which is funny.
We actually, that's when we were cataloging our games, I completely forgot that we had Mega Man Soccer.
I don't know if you noticed on Twitter, someone was saying that they, oh, was it like a Mass Effect spoof of, was it a Gangnam Style or something like that?
Yeah.
Yeah, what was that wallpaper that everyone's been, their phone wallpaper now?
No, no, it wasn't that.
I was replying to someone's tweet, and it was about something that had to do with Mass Effect.
Like, oh, I'm surprised there hasn't been a... You guys should do a Mass Effect... Oh, it was like, you guys should do a Mass Effect parody song to Gangnam Style or something like that.
And I was like, I'm sure someone's already done that to Mass Effect.
And sure enough, they had a Mass Effect Gangnam Style.
I think it was like Garrus Style or something like that.
There is this wallpaper for phone circulating that's Garrus and Kaden.
Yeah, it's Garrus style.
It's just a still.
Yeah, I'm kind of spent on Gangnam Style after the pistachio commercial.
Wait a minute, were you watching a football game on TV?
Yes, you were.
You wouldn't have seen that.
No.
Objection!
Hulu.
Hulu.
Oh, fine.
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
Girl, don't even.
Oh, I will.
Well, there is a developer called Ack Studios, A-C-K-K, which makes me think of Bill the Cat now.
They've put out an announcement.
They're working on a 3D RPG that is inspired by Earthbound and The World Ends With You.
It's going to be on the Wii U eShop.
It's codename is Project Y2K.
Aren't they like 13 years too late for that name?
But there is a teaser up for it and basically they're saying that basically right now it's concept art, finalized script and storyline, and graphics and gameplay engine.
I forgot this story was on our show roll tonight.
What did I just say?
What did I just say about indies and the Wii U?
It could make for a very interesting marriage.
That's all I'm saying.
If Nintendo finally actually puts its stock in this.
Isn't it more like Wii U leaving one mistress for another?
Well, it would be quite the change for Nintendo.
Because remember, three years ago, fans had to start a letter-writing campaign.
to get games like Xenoblade, which should have been an obvious put that out here in the States, please, and Last Story, which has done well for XSEED, and now Pandora's Tower.
Maybe Nintendo finally could be doing this turnaround where they're like, maybe gamers here want this shit.
This could be a niche for us.
So they're changing their polygamy for a harem.
However you want to phrase it.
I'm just trying to think of a good analogy.
I want to hear him.
Who doesn't want to hear him?
Except you'd have to pay for all of this.
Never mind.
All right.
Moving on then, I guess.
All right.
Let's see.
We've talked crap about Sony.
We've talked crap about Nintendo.
Who are we leaving out, Loki?
We're going to talk about Microsoft.
As we get close to E3, and I'm sure it's just not going to quit until they make their final announcements...
Let's talk about random Xbox next generation rumors.
So starting off, the next Xbox will always be online and will use Blu-ray.
Well, kind of a big duh with the Blu-ray because, you know, either it's going to be Blu-ray of their own proprietary format, obviously something that's going to be... But Microsoft can't use Blu-ray, Loki.
That's a Sony product.
That doesn't make any sense.
You're talking crazy.
They can totally do it.
I'm surprised actually they don't use HD DVD because that's technology that they have access to and no one's using it for anything.
Sony was also one part of Blu-ray and I also want to remind everybody Microsoft kind of sucked some dick to get Final Fantasy XI on its console early on which had this whole Play Online front end.
Who owns Play Online?
I'm dropping the mic now.
Anyways, so yeah, there's rumors going around that it's supposed to be always online, which I guess is supposed to somehow tie in with maybe, I don't know, the way used games work?
I mean, some way to, I guess, cut into the second-hand game market by authenticating your games or something?
I don't really know.
There's no real specifics on that, on why that's even an important fact on there.
the other one is of course that there's going to have some sort of they say natural speech detection and speech attacks which I know they've been trying to do that kind of crap with the Kinect and I always think it's very like useless I mean just like oh I plug in the Kinect and Kinect I want you to do this you know or Kinect yeah but you have functional hands
I understand that, but I'm saying that they're trying to improve on this front right here, and to play devil's advocate, that's really only benefiting a small percentage of their market base.
I'm talking about as far as...
I don't really know how much further they're going to go with this, how this is going to play into the next-gen console.
I believe this is actually... Even though this is all rumors and we should take it with a grain of salt, I believe this part, the text-to-speech part, is absolutely true.
And I think the proof is in something that's actually going on in the 360 right now.
There's in the Kinect channel, or whatever it is, you go into the Kinect thing, there's an app you can download that is nothing but...
DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
They're trying to collect different accents and the way people talk through this channel.
They're trying to collect all this information, which is really weird when you consider, well, they've already implemented a lot of this.
So they're gearing for something else.
So I think the proof is there that this is happening.
They're trying to get it more user-friendly instead of saying, like, Xbox, play DVD, or play...
Xbox Search, X-Files, Play, where can I find the X-Files?
Or where can I watch X-Files?
You should talk like GLaDOS.
I would believe that they're going to show a video or something of the new Xbox where somebody walks in as they're getting home from work.
Hanging up their jacket or whatever and somebody's walking in going, Xbox, play last night's episode of The Walking Dead.
And the Xbox will just magically turn on and maybe it powers on your TV too or something, I don't know, through an infrared communication.
And then there it goes.
It starts playing The Walking Dead.
And so they're going to – that will be like a thing.
Oh, and I hope that we get another one of those stupid demonstrations where they're saying in front of the Kinect, like, oh, I'm virtually trying on outfits, or, oh, I'm going to scan in my skateboard logo or whatever so it can appear on my object in-game.
Oh, wait, all that shit that they promised us for the Kinect and never fucking came through with?
I guess, you know, getting a vague color for my car, which, by the way, with that fucked up camera was always like a whitish-pinkish color, no matter what the lighting in the room.
I guess that's much better.
Oh, by the way, the whole internet connection thing was, of course, supposed to be that whole, oh, it's not going to play used games because it's going to be always connected to the internet and it's going to be tied in.
Basically, they're saying, like, you...
Have a one-time code you use and that's it.
And then your disk is useless, I guess.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's not going to happen.
I mean, once again, like I said, you're not being forced to buy a new console and they're not going to cut out... I mean, seriously, if they cut out GameStop, who's going to sell their console?
Yes, I understand there's other retailers out there that sell consoles, but...
They all want to sell used games too.
But those GameStops aren't going out of business because those guys aren't selling consoles.
All they're saying is, hey, you know what?
You should buy a PS4 instead.
Why?
Because it plays better games.
Oh, and because you can sell your games back.
Thanks for watching!
But it was talking about a lot of things that really didn't happen until more recently.
So I think that it's not necessarily that it is going to do all this, that they want it to do all this, and it will eventually do all that.
You can't expect instant gratification.
Oh, we're going to have all this.
Well, it's going to happen right away.
No, it's not.
You have to keep in mind what happens in reality and keep on top of the technology.
And so help me keep Peter Molyneux out of E3.
I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on for a minute and just do a what if.
I don't really think this, but I think it's worth going down an avenue exploring here for a little bit because like you say, Loki, if the Xbox doesn't play used games and the PlayStation 4 does, then Microsoft might as well seal its own fate right now because they won't be sold in GameStop.
But what if, tinfoil hat, what if Sony and Microsoft are in cahoots
We've heard about the rumors about the trademark or whatever that the Sony discs would be tied to the console.
So we've had this rumor about Sony already.
What if Sony and Microsoft have had secret meetings and it's not unheard of that competitors will have meetings about mutually beneficial topics because maybe EA brought them both to the table or somebody else, okay?
So what if they have both decided that used games will not be playable on the consoles?
Then what happens?
and so on.
I understand that.
Let's say you're on a tight budget and you need to trade in those old games to make up the money to buy the new games.
Okay, so you can't do that anymore because that option's gone.
So what are you going to do?
You're going to have to train yourself to now wait six months for them to drop the price of the game.
DarkSakura.com
Well, in my whole little tinfoil hat scenario, I agree now with Ross UT in our chatroom.
Nintendo would be the only winner in that pact.
Absolutely go back to what I said at the beginning of the show where Nintendo can dig themselves out of this hole if Sony and Microsoft fuck themselves, and this would be one way to do it.
Now, I'm going to take the tinfoil hat off, put it on the table.
Here's what I really think.
I don't necessarily think these rumors are false, just like I don't think the rumors about the PlayStation 4 disk protection or whatever is false.
However, Microsoft's had a real problem with dev kits.
And where do most of these rumors start?
They start from disgruntled devs and so forth.
Loki, did you not buy a dev kit on eBay?
Not eBay, but yeah.
Okay.
Now, here's the thing.
I don't think Microsoft really wants you to have one of those.
And it seems to me like a lot of that shit's been floating out there randomly where anybody could get it.
So my thought is maybe the dev kits always require you to be online and the dev kits will always be reading or talking to Microsoft or what have you.
to make sure that these games don't leak early because what Microsoft's really trying to combat is not the used game market but day zero piracy because that is what hurts the most is the piracy that gets out there before the game even goes on sale.
You mean like Halo 4 being leaked four weeks early, two weeks early?
Ding, ding, ding, absolutely, Loki.
That is absolutely it.
And I would even say it would be realistic to see that perhaps a game goes on sale digitally
Just a couple days before it goes on sale in tangible form, not much to GameStop chagrin and so forth.
That's a direction I could see where they go down the line again, and it is all about combating piracy.
That I would see and would understand if that's what they're doing.
And to require an online-only console, it's just not going to happen anyways because not everyone has internet.
I mean, even now, our internet, especially high-speed internet, not everyone has high-speed internet.
Or has reliable high-speed internet.
I mean, there's a lot of things that could go wrong.
27% of Xboxes never online, according to an Ars Technica article that cited a 2010 study.
Granted, in three years a lot can happen, but it's got to be above 10%, which is a number that can't be ignored.
Yeah, so, I mean, and let's just say, now I understand that some of those may have gone online at some point, but does it mean that they're always online?
Like, I know, like, sometimes my Xbox doesn't have an internet connection, depending on where I'm using it and stuff, and that would kind of suck that, oh, I can't play a game on this because...
Because of some reason, I don't know.
If they really want to combat piracy or something, what they could do, if you're going to do a one-time code thing, is have it like a PC game, like I have my Grand Theft Auto games and stuff, where I can revoke that code at some point.
Say I want to trade it in or whatever, and I revoke that code, and then...
That way, okay, you don't have that code, you can't really play this game on the system.
That could be one way to do it.
So then they'd be trying to hose the rental market, because the rental market wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of that one.
Yeah, but they don't really care about the rental market.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Alright, well, we will see in the coming months.
And if it all sucks, if all the consoles suck, there's always Steam.
And Steam's going to have those same games that are on consoles.
I mean, obviously not the Microsoft first party or Sony first party, but you're going to have a lot of those multi-platform games.
By the way, don't expect Sony or Microsoft to be very forthcoming about this in their press conferences or whatever Sony's doing on February 20th.
These questions will have to be asked point blank and they will be asked by journalists at E3 and that is where the answer will be found is when those interviews come out.
We shall see.
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, error.
Meanwhile, let's talk about somebody else that's in some trouble right now, Zynga.
Oh boy, it's just been bad news after bad news after bad news.
And, you know, we've had a lot of financial reports lately.
and apparently another one came out here Zynga did pretty bad in 2012 they posted a 209.4 million dollar loss that's not as bad as 2011 when it was a 404.3 million dollar loss but keep in mind they've closed some places since then they've had to make some cutbacks
I don't know if they're going to be shutting down other games or what, or what the future holds, but they're still losing money.
Maybe the Facebook thing is over.
I guess maybe not over, but it's not the huge thing that people once thought it was, which again, I would caution Sony and Microsoft in their whole trying to capture that market and so forth.
Look at what's happening to Zynga.
It's kind of a fad.
Don't marry Facebook.
It's only going to get ugly.
You can't play catch-up.
You just have to come up with something new.
Why marry Facebook when you can make your own Facebook?
and I have a hard time believing Microsoft doesn't want to make their own maybe not necessarily like you know the exact same thing that Facebook does but what if they could take some of the parts of Facebook and kind of make Xbox Live a new version of that I don't know
I could see where they maybe want to make their own thing as opposed to just trying to marry something that's already out there.
But then again, it didn't work so well for Apple, so I don't know.
We here at Microsoft are now going to partner with the new MySpace.
Well, the new Myspace, as funny as that joke is to make, the new Myspace is really about music and not so much games or anything else.
It's really about music and artistry because that's kind of what Myspace turned into when everybody left it.
It was all artists trying to promote themselves.
It's kind of like they were all each other's friends.
Myspace now is trying to compete with Pitchfork.
and Pinterest.
But it's like a Pinterest of music is what it is.
It's a pin fork.
I was lucky enough to get invited to the thing as in preview or whatever and it looked nice but there was nothing there for me.
I was honestly only there to see how I could pimp Orange Lounge Radio and you know the podcast stuff I do like you know what's in it for me.
Couldn't find it.
So not really on it.
Anyhow let's move on.
Dark Saga.
Well, we know of That Game Company, right?
Sure, Flower, Journey.
Well, this is just a little interesting.
More put it in here, yeah, just for the interest side of it and to help people keep things in perspective.
When Journey shipped, they were bankrupt.
They could not pay their employees.
They really just went ahead and shipped out the game with a prayer that they wouldn't lose more.
And as it turned out, that's put them back up in the top and kept them alive.
So it's just, you know, you think of all these companies that are pretty much, we've been saying sinking ship, sinking ship, but really all it takes is that one shining, you know, gemstone out there that's gonna, you know, bring them back.
Just thought this would be a good one for perspective.
You never know what's going to happen.
You never know what's going to happen.
Just don't make shit and you'll be okay.
Some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
Going to the last story a little bit, Technist wants to clarify, Microsoft already has a deal with Facebook.
That's why you see Bing Maps and Bing Translate on Facebook.
I don't know what the limit of exclusivity it would be to that.
I know it's a hard word to pronounce, isn't it?
Exclusiveness.
Exclusiveness.
Exclusity?
That still doesn't stop Microsoft necessarily doing their own thing.
What does Facebook get out of it?
Maybe the Skype integration thing?
Because that was something they were really hyping up for their Messenger and chat was their Skype.
So yeah, I guess you're right.
Microsoft and Facebook already have some ties.
Doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't do their own thing, or could Sony, although based on history, I don't think Sony would pull it off very well.
But you never know.
I might be surprised.
Sony might have bought a company that fell off my radar that could do it.
So who knows?
I am also just totally like...
Mass hypothesizing, making shit up.
But who wouldn't want to get like a Facebook for gamers?
I mean, that would seem like... And I think there are some startups out there kind of trying to capitalize on that a bit.
But nobody's really struck gold with that idea yet.
I wouldn't believe that the publishers themselves aren't trying to do that a little bit.
Look at Miiverse.
Kind of moving that direction a little bit.
As much as Nintendo can.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I thought that was just like a fad.
They were just trying.
Well, people buy it.
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on 3DS this week.
Omerta, City of Gangsters on Xbox 360.
And I want to say that I think that's it.
Because there wasn't that much coming out this week.
I guess technically within the week, next Sunday they're going to be having the Zombie U Nintendo Wii U 32GB Deluxe set.
It's going to be a Zombie U and a digital copy of Nintendo Land.
So you're not going to have much of that hard drive left over.
I like how Ubisoft waited for that to go to the factory before they fucked Nintendo.
No.
Anyhow.
Yeah, hey, let's make this deal.
I know, let's make this deal.
Oh, and fuck you, huh?
I know, that's business.
That is business.
Going to Japan, checking out the Japanese releases.
On Valentine's Day, which happens to be release day in Japan, PlayStation 3, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, price drops for Dragon's Dogma and Lollipop Chainsaw because Lollipop Chainsaw is getting the Valentine's edition on February 14th.
Even though this is a steaming, festering pile of poo?
Yes, even though it's a steaming fest.
That's an opinion.
Lots of stuff on the Xbox 360.
Who would have thought I said that?
Of course, most of this is price reductions.
Lollipop Chainsaw, Kinect Star Wars, Gears of War 3, Disneyland Adventures, Forza 4, Dragon's Dogma, Dance Central 2, all of those getting price reductions this week in Japan.
And as far as new stuff goes, Aliens, Colonel Marines, Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, and Ginga Force come out this week in Japan.
Those are all new things.
You know what?
About that Aliens, Colonial Marines, I actually want that game.
Yeah?
Why's that?
Because, and God, why can I never remember his damn name?
The guy who played Bishop is reprising his role.
Oh, that's cool.
But you know who else he voiced?
Admiral Hackett.
Of course.
Oh, you.
Oh, you.
PlayStation Vita in Japan this week gets Sakura So No Pet Na Kanojo in regular and limited editions, and Silent Hill Book of Memories gets its Japanese release.
Girls Pets?
Just in time.
Better than Girls Butts.
Just in time for Valentine's Day Silent Hill game on the Vita.
Absolutely nothing on the Wii U, but Tank Tank Tank is out in the near future, although I thought that was going free-to-play or something was happening.
I don't know.
It's on my list for some reason for next week.
They have like a demo or something that's coming out that you can unlock parts of the demo or something if you pay money.
I don't know.
It's weird.
On the 3DS this week, Marugo 3D Nanami to Ishiho Nagakubo English Josatsu no Kotsu Riron Hen.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
It's got a cute anime girl though because you know that's everything.
That's it.
That's the one screenshot I have.
That could just be the box art.
The game probably has nothing to do with that.
So I don't know what that is, but it's not any big series.
Quickly checking to see if they're still putting stuff out on the PSP.
They are.
PSP getting some releases this week.
Battle Robot Tamashi from Bandai Namco this week on the PSP.
Dark Sakura, how about the other side of the Atlantic?
As soon as I can make my iPad go there.
We only have on the 12th, we have Aliens Colonial Marines.
And to answer your earlier question about the game, courtesy of Tigerclaw, Lance Henriksen.
That's it.
I knew it was some sort of Icelandic sounding name.
Was he a Stargate guy?
Why do I associate him with Stargate?
Wasn't he in Atlantis?
I associate him with Stargate for some reason.
I stopped watching Stargate after season 8, so... There's been a fuck ton of Stargate, too.
If you haven't been following... Just the SG-1 series.
If you haven't been following Stargate since the original movie that the guy who made Independence Day did all those years ago, there's been a fuck ton of Stargate that's been happening.
Just so you know.
You know what... But no MMO, frown.
You know what?
Becky and I used to marathon SG-1 because I have all those box sets I'm probably going to sell.
And we both decided that season 4 sucks.
I had an ex that was really into Stargate.
It's a good show.
I'm not going to hate it.
Season 7 was good.
Alright, a few more news stories for you guys then we'll get into the classic game of the week.
Loki.
Loki.
Alright, so let's talk about the independent console that's coming out, OUYA!
OUYA is going to be making its way out for Kickstarter backers in March, but if you didn't get in on that action, then you can actually pick one up at retail.
It's going to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and the store that's into everything electronics nowadays.
GameStop, you can buy one for $99 there or an extra controller for $49.99.
Think about it.
If the new Xbox doesn't play used games, there will be more Ouya merchandise at GameStop than there will be Xbox Lube or 720 or whatever they call it.
Yeah, they're going to really have to grease you up to get you to buy one of those.
And then to go with that, of course, they're saying that, yeah, you may buy an Ouya this year, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be an Ouya 2 next year or an Ouya 3 the year after that.
In fact, they're planning on doing a new one each year.
And then, of course, they've partnered up with Double Fine and...
Well, let's see here.
Paul Bettner, who is the creator of Words With Friends.
And they're going to be bringing The Cave and Reds to OUYA.
I guess.
Those are pretty big games.
I've never heard of Reds.
But The Cave, I'm well aware of, because that just came out.
And then...
Last but not least, this month, of course, to go along with the whole Kickstarter backers getting their consoles next month, they are going through the approval process right now.
And I'm a little disappointed.
I mean, two-thirds of this I'm okay with.
They're basically looking at games being submitted to them, and they're checking for intellectual property infringement, malware, and excessive pornography.
I'm glad that they added excessive in there.
So a little, a little titty's okay.
A little pornography is alright.
So note to OUYA developers, a little titty's okay.
I still think there should be excessive pornography.
I mean, hell, that should be the title of a game, Excessive Pornography, the game.
That would be awesome.
Is that, dare I say, is that an OLR dream game, Excessive Pornography?
Excessive Pornography, that's the internet, okay.
That's just the internet.
That's everybody's dream game.
That's not an OLR dream game.
That's the internet's dream game.
The excessive pornography featuring random pictures of low cats for no reason.
That's the internet right there.
But yeah, so they're supposed to be doing that.
And they said the process should begin middle or the end of this month.
And of course...
I don't know.
We'll see.
At least I know I have one game spoken for when that comes out.
Going to the chat, some strong opinions about the whole yearly upgrades of the Ouya.
Ranma in chat says, a new Ouya each year is suicide, to which a lot of people jumped in and said iPhone, iPad.
I even said the Nintendo DS called and said you're wrong.
New Ouya every year.
Is that suicide to admit that this early?
Well, no, because here's the thing.
Remember, you may be buying this console right now and you're like, oh, they're going to have a new one next year.
But everything about this console is meant to be hacked.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
each time around.
So I don't really have a problem with that if that's going to be the way they're going to go about it because it's optional.
I mean, hell, you can hack this thing apart and play emulators on it.
What the hell do you need a quad core processor for that shit?
I mean, you don't.
Comment from RossDLUT in our chat room.
The OUYA is an open platform.
We're going to see excessive porn on it anyway.
Good point.
It has access to the internet.
Will it have a web browser?
Is it connected to the internet?
Excessive porn for all!
Yay!
That is one thing we can look forward to with an always connected Xbox system, is it's always going to have access to pornography on the internet.
Xbox!
Tits!
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?
It shows me Britney Spears' greatest hits.
That's not what I said!
You know, Xbox, pornography, Illumina Room, just like boobs flying at you at every angle.
It's like, yeah, this is next gen.
Like seriously, okay, if Microsoft could come out at E3 and show that as the demo and then just slip in there, by the way, it won't play used games, but it will totally show you tits.
Then people will be like, forgiven.
You're forgiven.
Everything negative we said about the used games thing.
It's not going to play used games, but it can do this.
It's like, whoa.
Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.
DarkSakura, would you buy one?
If Illumaroom would not play used games, would it show you all the boobies you could dream of?
I'm thinking about it.
Katy Perry, can you get up in your face and be knocking that back and forth?
That picture of Katy Perry, all over your walls, everywhere.
Oh no, that's pretty hard to say no to, Rob.
and Sigma the Luma Room because it's all going to be interactive too.
You can walk up into that and just like smack.
Just put your face all up in it.
Achievement unlocked.
No one can resist to motorboat.
It's like Cobra Triangle 2.
All right.
One more story for you guys.
Back when gaming was so simple, a retro gaming story for you guys.
Before we were picturing a Luma Room projecting boobies all over the walls, you didn't have this in these classic games.
But this is still pretty cool, a way to make it modern.
It's the Capcom Arcade Cabinet.
We've been talking about this game for a little bit on the show.
Finally, the details coming out about this game.
It's going to come out for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
on February 19th.
A teaser trailer went out this week showing the games that will be in it.
Black Tiger, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins, Legendary Wings, Commando, Avengers Section Z, and I am really excited about this, Pirate Ship Higemaru is coming out as well.
I love that game.
It's a fun little puzzler.
Reminds me a lot of like Pango.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
In the trailer, it says that you can play these games online with friends.
So finally, somebody getting the retro thing right and making it so that I can play the games online across the internets.
Pretty excited about this.
I hope the games play well, but it sounds pretty cool.
DarkSakura, would this be something you're interested in at all, or no, because you kind of already have the retro stuff?
Yeah, I mean, honestly, all those games that you listed are games that we own.
So...
It's cool though, it's cool for people who don't already have this stuff, yeah.
Yeah, the modernization, being able to play online.
Yeah, that sounds fun.
Casual mode, I think, was advertised too, maybe to make the arcade games a little easier.
Maybe so that you can actually beat Ghosts and Goblins, maybe?
I'm assuming that's what that means.
Well, Dan can beat it.
Well, Dan's a freak, and I mean that in the most loving way possible.
Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week
Which I believe is also a Capcom game, although not one that's been announced.
Yes, it is.
Oh, it's like you knew.
But you ruined how I wanted to introduce it, though.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Because I wanted you to play the YouTube clip so that you could get the... Well, I gave a hint.
I didn't tell you the game.
All right, well, play the little opening start on YouTube.
And it's not in the Capcom Hits collection, I'll tell you that much.
Here we go.
Here is a clip from this week's Classic Game of the Week.
Mm-hmm.
I know, right?
LOL Internet.
I don't know if... There we go.
Yeah.
We're getting a little bit of buffering today.
I'm sorry.
I should have loaded this in advance.
I didn't.
It's because I missed the cue sound.
Anyway.
Here it is.
It's coming up.
That should be enough for people to get what the game is.
Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?
It's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, also known in the US as Super Pocket Fighter 2 Turbo.
Also known as, we had all these art assets from Puzzle Fighter, we needed to make another game out of it.
Well, that actually didn't... I think this came out around the same time.
It came out in 97.
It was a CPS2 arcade machine, and it came out on the PlayStation, which kept the Pocket Fighter title for the American and European release.
It came out on the WonderSwan, the Sega Saturn, and the PS2.
It was part of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.
It's basically got all these characters in Super Deformed and they beat the crap out of each other using very cutesy attacks.
It also has characters from Street Fighter Alpha, Dark Stalker, Street Fighter 3, and from Red Earth.
That game is totally on my list of CPS3 games that I want to play.
I've never gotten to play a copy of that.
Um, it also has just a whole ton of different characters, um, that make appearances throughout the game.
You know, just little cameos.
So basically it's standard fighting, um, and they have power-ups that match, um, their, um...
The characters that actually came from Red Earth, that system.
And then the little orbs that you can catch that are thrown as your opponent to basically mimic the elemental hits in Darkstalkers.
So you can turn people to stone, you can freeze them, and then you start with one of each of those.
Um...
You have two bars and three sub-bars.
You have a life bar and a super bar.
And then you have your mighty combo, which I always laughed at that.
Your sub-bars are basically your level of your special moves.
And your levels correspond to different colors.
So some people have extra, some don't.
But basically every time you hit a character, gems pop out.
to, uh, power up.
So, that's where it gets Jump Fighter from.
And basically, four buttons punch, kick, special, taunt.
Which taunt is, of course, the best thing ever.
So, um...
Anyway, you also have flash combos or costume combos where if you press a combination of punch or kick buttons after striking the opponent with a punch button, then they actually will change into different costumes during the sequence, except for you, and has a very different strong attack at the end.
Here's some examples.
Chun-Li turns into Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.
Felicia turns into Mega Man.
And I remember Ibuki had her little schoolgirl outfit and all of that.
So the characters in the game, you have Ryu, you have Ken, you have Zangief, you have Chun-Li, you have Sakura, and Ibuki, all from the Street Fighter series.
You have Morigen, Sienko, or Lele as she was in Japan, and Felicia.
And then you have Tessa.
In Japan she was Tabasa, which I think was supposed to be like Tabitha, but why didn't they just call her Tabitha over here?
Don't know.
and she's the only Red Earth character in the game you also have secret characters you have Gouki or Akuma and he's very powerful and then you have Dan and basically his story is probably the most hilarious one
He's looking for students to start a school, so he's trying to get Sakura to be his student.
But she left the school after three days and wrote him a letter saying that she's already mastered everything that he could teach her and that his moves are worthless in a fight.
She calls him a loser, and he cries.
I think all he knocks out are gems of the same color, I want to say.
Or maybe that's in Puzzle Fighter, when all he drops are red gems.
Anyway...
It is just a fun little game.
It's one of my favorite fighting games of all time, and it's just completely cracked out.
I don't know if I've played this game an awful lot.
I think I've played it like once.
Oh, I see.
There's the little part where she turned into Jill Valentine, and then, of course, the video buffered, but oh well.
Yeah, so that's the game.
Nice.
So there it is, your classic game of the week, Pocket Fighter, or...
which I've got two copies of.
On different systems, on different systems.
As part of your collection that you counted up this week.
But my favorite to play is on Saturn.
Alright.
Because it's awesome with the Saturn controller.
That's it.
Not that, sorry.
I was trying to load something else that's coming up later in the show.
Live radio, isn't it a blast?
All right.
We are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
We've got plenty more show to come.
The Fugle Question of the Week coming up when we get back, as well as some rapid-fire news and movie and gaming news.
And this one sounds like it could be pretty cool.
We'll see you when we get back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Don't go anywhere.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 492nd episode in progress here as we go into the second half of the show.
February the 10th of 2013 and boy the internet's having some lulls tonight.
I don't know if it's the snowstorms back east or what but yeah we were having some problems playing off YouTube earlier and Twitter's all clogged up with crap on the Grammys.
Should I blame the Grammys for this?
I blame the Grammys for everything.
I see all these people posting status updates about the Grammys and I'm just like
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
They just released the whole show at once, so go watch all 10 episodes or whatever.
It kind of breaks the conventional weekly show, so how do you not spoil something that you could have just blown through in a weekend?
I don't know how you do it with movies.
I guess that's true.
It's like a really long movie.
It's a miniseries.
It's like a Lord of the Rings extended cut.
Exactly right.
All right.
Anyhow, let us move on with some rapid-fire news.
All right.
Let's see.
Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge.
Remember that Wii exclusive game?
Yeah, it's not a Wii exclusive anymore.
This is actually kind of interesting because you remember the Wii version was actually published by Nintendo.
However, they will be coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 April 2nd.
And it's being published, of course, by Tecmo Koei.
And yeah.
So they're going to have all the additional stuff in there.
I guess you can kind of think of it as like a Game of the Year edition, except your game didn't win Game of the Year.
Re-release of the cheaper version edition with extra stuff in it.
So, yeah, not so much of that exclusiveness anymore.
We may have a glimpse of one of the first next-gen games, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, which, I gotta be honest, looks a lot like Monster Hunter, but
What was it?
What was it?
Cyberpunk or whatever.
But apparently the game is supposed to be open world.
It's going to be, I guess, they say the world's going to be larger than Skyrim and larger than any of the environments featured in the first two Witcher games.
And it looks pretty.
I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the subtitle Wild Hunt, but
It could be a cool game.
And it's due out in 2014.
They say for PC and high-end platforms or next-gen consoles, obviously.
So, it's always an option.
And last but not least, one of the news announcements while we're out was Grand Theft Auto V was delayed to September.
Kind of something I alluded to, I think, the last time we talked, maybe.
I've had some people ask me on Twitter, Loki, so how are you doing with all this news?
How are you coping?
I...
Are you okay?
One day at a time.
Do you need one day at a time?
We honestly didn't know what we're going to do as far as like... Because it was kind of like, oh, you know, we'll play Modern Warfare 3 for a while.
And then, you know, by the time we're getting bored of it, we'll have Grand Theft Auto V. And then now it's delayed another, you know, potentially four months from what we were expecting.
And we're like, I don't know what we're going to do now.
It's just...
Thanks for watching!
basically to those of you who were seeing various conspiracy theories about there being some other ulterior motive for this delay rest assured they're all nonsense literally the only reason we delayed the release is because we want the game to be as good as it needs to be
Just throwing it out there, could it be too late?
Because sometimes when games come out too close to another system being launched, they get cannibalized a little bit.
No.
Grand Theft Auto V is too big for that?
No, it's too big for that.
I always kind of say that's why people missed Final Fantasy XII, is it kind of landed in a scenario like that, but...
Grand Theft Auto 6 on the next-gen consoles.
I can't even fathom what that would be like, but yes.
If they sell.
But there's some other actual classic games that are part of this, including Time Pilot, Asteroids, Centipede, and yes, Loki, Frogger.
A couple Intellivision games in there, too.
Shark Shark and Astro Smash, which I thought was interesting.
Do you have to wait in line to play those games?
Not on your vehicle.
Can I play on roller skates?
That's for sure.
If you want, in the privacy of your own home.
For the record, playing Frogger on roller skates is difficult.
Yeah.
You will not think it is.
Playing Spy Hunter on roller skates was awesome.
And yes, they did have a Spy Hunter machine at the roller rink when I was growing up.
Why?
I don't know.
The roller rink that I used to go to still had their Frogger when I went back like 10 years ago.
What if PlayStation Home is the next-gen console?
It's like, this is PlayStation Home.
It's in your home.
Okay, now you're trolling.
All right, next up.
Another rumor, folks.
We love our rumors, don't we?
This one's about Sonic.
And apparently the next Sonic game to be announced is supposed to be Sonic Adventure 3.
Sonic Adventure 3 sounds probable, doesn't it?
Who remembers a classic arcade game by Capcom called Gunsmoke?
Didn't I do it in a classic game?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
Hopefully.
Or as one of my favorite video review shows calls it, Gun.Smoke.
Yeah, Gun.Smoke.
Yeah, because not to be confused with the TV show Gun.Smoke.
It had nothing to do with that.
But Gun.Smoke had a freeware remake done of it, which I'm sure was not legal at all.
But, well, somebody did their own little remake.
They wanted to keep the NES port of the version intact.
They didn't want to rip the assets from the arcade game or whatever.
They played the original a whole bunch of times trying to make it just perfect.
And there's a whole little, again, here I go playing a YouTube, but hopefully this one will actually work.
Not bad.
Looks pretty spot on to me.
That's all I remember from the NES one.
Oh man, I love the boss that throws all the bombs and then he loses his pants.
So, was that your series, Rob?
Okay.
Well, Bethesda put out an announcement that the Rage, the official toolkit for Rage is out on Steam, and it's going to be 35 plus gigabytes.
Well, actually, no, it's out, but to quote John Carmack, he's saying, the toolkit release is not something that we consider consumer friendly, but it does let you get a good look inside the construction process.
So, pretty cool, huh?
Also, EA has zero intention of patching a loot exploit in Dead Space 3 Basically, it lets you pretty much farm for resources that would cost you currency and microtransactions And EA is saying, okay, go for it, we don't care The microtransactions are just convenience
and when I saw this, thank you Catastrophic Moggy for giving me this link when we had our lovely, for me, 3am chat but Farmville is going to have an animated series out done by Brett Ratner you know what else he's given us?
X-Men Last Stand, That Turd Rush Hour movies, I think were him Red Dragon
This sounds like terrible fan rumor stuff, so I hope that's what it is.
According to the Wall Street Journal, it will be produced by Ratner in association with 611 Media, a Canadian television company.
and producers.
Other producers are Kirk Shank, Charles Bishop and Nina Gelb.
Did you say the Canadian television company?
Yeah.
Well, when somebody asked me what about all the bad things Canada did, I will remember this one.
But I can always forgive Canada.
I know.
They did give us You Can't Do That on television.
For two reasons.
What?
Rush.
That's true.
Because Neil Peart is the best drummer in the universe.
And I do love me some Alanis.
Haters gonna hate.
And Canada's worst driver.
Seriously, watch it on YouTube.
The show is awesome.
And I'm gonna give a preemptive F you to the people who won season 8 just saying you guys don't need to be driving.
That's it.
Alright, let's move on to the Fugle Question of the Week.
We got a ton of responses this week on the Fugle Question of the Week, which is great.
We love hearing from all of our listeners.
But yes, the Fugle Question of the Week.
Take Facebook and Google and smash those words together.
You get Fugle.
and we ask a question of our fan communities each week.
You guys give us answers and we read some of them on the show.
I am not going to be able to read them all tonight.
You guys were too good this week.
So please visit our fan communities at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see the answers in their entirety.
We'll start with Google Plus once I, of course, tell you the question.
It's a short one tonight.
I think we've all heard the rumor about the next Xbox blocking used games.
Do you believe this rumor could be true?
For that matter, how much do you tend to believe industry rumors?
Over on Google+, Techie Q says My stance on game industry rumors has to be to take them with a grain of salt This leads to less heartache if a particular rumor doesn't come true or vice versa Isn't that the truth?
There's already people saying I'm not going to buy the next console Based on rumors alone
Uh...
and E3VL or Evil says on Google Plus, sources are barely creditable these days.
Seeing the internet being first on a news site is better than having long wait times to confirm information when it comes to rumors and speculation.
If anyone tries to discredit the website later down the line, they can label the article as it was just a rumor, as if it was some magical phrase to get them out of the situation.
So, you know, one of those whole, it's become about hits, hits, hits.
and certainly the ESA only fosters that attitude when it's all about the hits to get your site validated by them so you may be blessed by the ESA Pope to go to E3.
The ESA Pope.
That's what it is.
You have to email the ESA Pope and say, please, I would like to be blessed to go to your E3 event.
Now I'm imagining... You stand in front of the gates and your website is judged.
How many hits did ye accumulate in December of last year?
And ye are worthy or no reply?
Now I'm picturing what his Popemobile looks like.
You know, with the glass probably pulled by light cycles.
Yes.
I actually envision that the ESA Pope is basically Dame Edna.
Yes, it's Dame Edna.
My hello, my puppets.
Oh, it's Orange Lounge Radio is applying to go to E3.
Who are they?
What does Orange Lounge have to do with a video game?
By the way, you mentioned Dame Edna.
You know what I found the other day?
The picture I did for Extifer of Dame Edna saying Pandarens.
Random.
Why, there's no game or, you know, video in their title.
Game Attack Radio?
I've never heard of you!
Anyhow, moving on.
XBOX USE GAME THING
What do you think about the whole unlock fee?
It's money-grubbing because all the excuses that they were saying before that, oh, it's going to be all the developers lose out on money.
Developers aren't getting paid for that anyways.
I mean, you pay the developer and they may have commissions or whatever based on it, but
When they're being sold to distributors or retailers or whatever, it doesn't matter if they sell through.
You're going to put them out of business if you get rid of used games because that's how they make their money because your margins in your games are terrible.
Unless all of a sudden they start giving retailers way better costs on goods, then that's the only thing that's going to really drive new games because if it becomes more profitable to sell a new title than it does used games,
then they're going to go that route Brandon C on Facebook five hours ago saying something we brought up here on the show the only way to enforce it would be some sort of always online requirement and Sony and Microsoft coming together to make it happen there's no way Microsoft would block used games without Sony agreeing to do the same so funny enough that point I brought up earlier with the new access of evil huh
RedTheHaze replies in part I think people are overreacting to the news because everyone's excited for the new generation and any information even rumors are given a lot of attention gamers should just shut up and finish their backlogs already yeah shut up and go eat your backlog no dessert for you that's actually really good advice kids in China have no backlog
I made Bob turn red.
That was awesome.
Well, that was a witty retort.
It's very true.
Let's see.
Gary Baxter on Facebook replies, I take everything I hear with a grain of salt until someone with real pull in the company confirms it.
However, this does sound like Microsoft would do to get more sales on titles that most people would wait and pick up used from the evil G or a pawn shop.
But until an official spokesperson says yay or nay, all we can do is wait.
Let's see, VXChaseNXV says, it already happened.
Hello, non-code based digital downloads.
Industry rumors are silly.
Peers spin in exactly the same way as positive announcements, but are often able to be traced back to something specific.
One more here from DarkCharger.
While these are still unsubstantiated rumors, I could totally see a future where all game purchases are tied to a user account or gamertag via a key that ships with the disc or linked via digital download.
Good thought.
We didn't even name before, which I'm sure we've all got to be thinking about, but what if your Xbox has to be always online?
Xbox Live goes down sometimes.
Look at tonight.
We've got those snowstorms going on that are knocking things out.
It's like...
What if the internet was too choppy and you couldn't maintain your connection?
Are you just hosed?
Screw you and your $60 game?
Shouldn't they learn from Ubisoft that tried to do this shit with their DRM and how well that worked?
Honestly, I don't think it's going to work because we don't have the infrastructure in place to where that's a guarantee that you're going to have an internet connection.
I just don't see that that would be a viable option.
Now, granted, they could try crazy things if they want, but it doesn't mean it's going to work.
All right, I'm going to read one more answer.
I was going to end it there, but I got to do this one last answer because I think this is pretty good.
I think they're all good, but this one kind of brings up a different point here I want to read.
It's SSJ100Matt on Facebook.
I'm going to put the tinfoil hat on and say I believe it, only because I think that Microsoft purposely leaked this rumor to gauge the community's reaction and plan their approach from there.
I got to stop there.
What did they think was going to happen?
Oh, yes, the community is going to love this.
I mean, really?
The problem with if you're going to gauge interest is there's no upside to that.
Oh, we're going to get rid of your ability to play used games.
Hooray!
If it was like, we're going to get rid of the ability for you to play used games, but all the games that are in retail for $20 cheaper than they were now, then that would be okay.
I'm okay with not being able to play used games but I can get my games cheaper at launch.
I'm fine with that instead of... Yes, yes.
Actually, yes.
That would be... I would be totally okay with all of this if all games were $19.99.
Think about it.
Would suddenly this not be such bad news if games weren't $60 anymore?
What if Halo 5 was $20?
Yeah, that's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal, is it?
Okay, yeah, you're right.
Take away my ability to play used games.
If you're willing to put that commitment in, so am I. I usually don't buy games until they drop down that low now.
Anyhow, continuing on with the comment here.
I think Microsoft has seen enough from companies like EA where they seem to have gotten away with charging for passes for online play in their games.
I think it's only a matter of time before we see console makers doing this.
But I anticipate Microsoft coming up with a creative way to charge for it.
Perhaps they can bundle it with your yearly Xbox Live fee, like a Diamond Club that pays for unlimited use of used or borrowed games in exchange for discounts or specials on the Xbox Live Marketplace, much like PlayStation Plus.
That way they'll still get money, encourage gamers to spend more money in the marketplace, and make people like they're not getting charged a second or third time for the same game.
Just a thought, but at Microsoft, if you're listening and like that idea, call me.
Oh, that's an ugly idea.
To the guy sitting in the boardroom, that's a beautiful idea, but SSJ100, Matt, that is an ugly idea, and I'm almost a little ashamed that I read it.
Think about what he's saying.
Yes, it blocks out used games, but if you're an Xbox Live Diamond member, that restriction is lifted.
That is ugly.
That would come back to bite him in the ass so fast, it's not even funny.
Oh, God.
Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if they've already thought of it.
Can't you kind of see it?
Can't you kind of see it?
It's almost worse than just blocking.
It is almost.
Talk about like...
I feel dirty.
I need to bathe after reading that.
I don't think this is one of the stories we're covering, but the other day, Sony's stock price went down 10%.
They can't make these really crazy decisions to pull this kind of crap on their consumer.
They have to play it safe.
I think the same with Microsoft.
They have to play it safe, too.
I don't think that they can get rid of used game sales that way, because that's...
it's seriously it's a gamble because unless you know both of them are doing it then and and I still think even if Nintendo would have to do it too and also the fact that you have to completely forget the fact that there's all these older consoles out there GameGuru in chat sums it up perfectly live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says so I have to pay $60 a year to not only play games online but to play used games fuck that shit fuck that shit
My SNES is looking better and better.
Well, you said $60 a year, because $60 a year is for gold.
Why stop at $60?
This is the diamond plan.
Maybe they'll throw in a free movie.
Free rental on Xbox movies.
Yes, a free rental on an Xbox movie.
I feel dirty.
Thank you, Fugle Question of the Week.
You get your honorary member card along with a bottle of lube to commemorate the Xbox.
And, you know, if you get the diamond plan, then they'll throw in a wedge for you to bend over.
Suddenly that name of Xbox Lube sounds more and more appropriate.
Because if y'all are buying it, you better lube yourself up.
It's going the route of Sony.
It's Latin.
It's Lube.
I like that name even better.
The Xbox Lube.
Lube.
Alright, let's get into some real news.
Let's stop all this wank and get into, oh, other wank about movies and stuff, right, Loki?
Yeah, so let's talk about shit that's never going to happen while I'm still alive.
So Valve's looking to make a Portal or Half-Life movie with J.J.
Abrams.
Yeah, that's right.
So J.J.
Abrams says, we're going to try to figure out if we can make a Half-Life or a Portal movie together, basically said Gabe Newell.
And I guess they've...
I don't know.
No timetable's been talked about or anything.
And let's put it this way, we're not going to see this anytime soon.
I mean, I think we'll see Half-Life 3 before we'll see a Portal movie and Half-Life movie.
It would be awesome, but also consider the fact that, you know...
JJ Abrams is a little busy right now.
He's got a Star Trek movie coming out and a Star Wars movie he's working on.
How much lens flare will this one have?
An amazing amount of lens flare.
It'll be crazy.
Especially with those portals being all shiny and everything.
There's a lot of lens flare that we had there.
The potential is staggering.
yes um so of course you know brief announcement enough to tease people no and they're not going to give anybody any sort of release dates because they would only have to delay them indefinitely like they do with Half-Life 3 you guys what if Half-Life 3 is a movie that's it that's the catch what if they're already like movies anyway with just some gameplay thrown in here and there
New ARG, New ARG
Isn't J.J.
Abrams kind of busy though?
Like, you know, Star Wars?
It's kind of a big deal.
I know he signed on for the next movie, but isn't that going to be like the next trilogy?
I mean, because that could take a long time.
Are they just going to say fuck you to all the books?
Yes, they are saying fuck you to all the books, which I'm totally okay with.
JJ Abrams is only on board to direct episode 7.
Which is okay because 4, 5, and 6 had different directors too.
Because Lucas did the first one but he didn't do 5 and 6.
I will never, ever recognize the quote, first three quote as being canon.
No one will, honey.
Nobody will.
That's alright.
For number 8 and 9 they've got Brett Ratner and Joel Schumacher.
Go to hell.
There'll be nipples on everybody.
No, it's, um, fuck what's his name, Uwe Boll.
Oh god.
I'm gonna make it a zombie movie that's gonna be steampunk and... And Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it.
Everybody freeze.
Everybody chill.
I am your grandfather.
Can you feel the ice?
You know...
I still have a lot of Arnold movies to catch up on.
I'm sorry.
I don't care how terrible the movie is.
That new one flopped.
That's fine.
Because people are setting their expectations too high.
It's a popcorn movie, okay?
Was really like Commando that deep of a movie?
I mean, come on.
Being the governor of California wasn't the best career choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger, let's be real.
It seemed like a noble thing to do.
Dude, he gives tank rides to the press.
I watched a video on that.
That's awesome.
And he has his own tank that he drives around.
Because, you know what?
When he was in the military, he was a tank driver.
So, that's pretty awesome.
BlackWolf in chat says, Star Wars Episode VIII Explosions directed by Michael Bay.
Is Michael Bay the director of Independence Day or is that Roland Emmerich?
That's Roland Emmerich.
That's who needs to direct.
Bad Boys would be... You know what?
I'm sorry.
Independence Day is one of those movies that only gets better with time.
Did you watch 2012?
No, I've only seen clips of it.
It's a long-ass movie.
You know a movie I did see was The Day After Tomorrow where they're literally running after ice.
It's almost like The Happening.
They're running after wind.
You know what?
I flipped a table when they were running toward the little fire in the building, the fireplace.
I just flipped my table.
You have to seriously watch 2012 because they escape from an earthquake via plane two or three times.
It's like the same scene.
It's like, did we just do this?
I mean, what's going on?
BlackWolfInChat says, fun fact, Independence Day's original script was Stargate 2.
I have heard that before, too, that Independence Day started as Stargate 2.
I can see that.
It makes sense.
It does.
I mean, obviously, it changed a lot, but...
There was also, I think, something in the original script that explained why the Apple thing worked, why they were able to hack it with a Mac, is that they had already been working on breaking down the code on the one ship that they had.
They had all this stuff written out.
Why are people trying to explain the logic in the movie?
I mean, that's...
Well, the thing is, they had it explained.
I just remember sitting there in the theater when they first showed the preview and the aliens, like, you know, how old were we all when that movie came out?
You would have been a little younger.
I was in college the first time.
I was a freshman in college.
I saw that every day.
The second, the third, and the fourth.
It's like, every day of the movie, it was just like, okay, we're on the second.
Okay, we're on the third.
We're on the fourth.
I'm seeing it every single day.
Remember, though, when that trailer first came out with the alien ship came out and it blew up the White House and everybody's like,
I think it's a little long from that right now
Do you remember what else?
What if they have What's-His-Face?
I know this is not a tangent you all asked for, but it's Orange Lounge Radio, people.
Do you know what made the movie Independence Day?
Do you know what made that fucking movie?
The dog surviving?
Harvey Firestein is in Independence Day.
Oh, God.
I've got to call my mother.
I know.
I loved him.
Best choice of casting ever.
I just like how they were advertising, you don't know who's going to die.
And I pretty much pegged everyone who was going to die in that movie.
Oh, you're looking.
Oh, crap.
Let's see.
I'm trying to find a clip.
I can't find one.
Is it when he's in the car?
My bed's actually going to load.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Here we go.
Here we go.
There's at least this one little clip.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, crap.
I love him.
I don't think I remember from that, you know, was it residents of L.A.
are being warned not to fire, or was it like, or use their firearms at the alien spacecraft, or discharge their firearms at the alien spacecraft?
Yes, yes.
A warning.
WhatupG said, he said forget his lawyer.
That's right.
I gotta call my mother, and I gotta call my lawyer.
Ah, forget my lawyer.
Alright, we gotta move on.
So they can have like RuPaul in the next one?
And to answer Dungeon Buster, no, I do not have the Independence Day game.
It is not anywhere at all in the collection.
Aliens are coming to us from Mars.
Well, they need to sashay away.
Is that a dragon?
Because RuPaul being in... Oh, forget it.
DarkSakura.
You need to sissy that walk.
All right.
Moving on.
You know what?
Is it finally my turn?
Because fuck.
No, I have to talk about Skylanders real quick.
What are we even talking about?
Movies.
Oh, that's right.
J.J.
Abrams.
Somehow.
Thank you, J.J.
Abrams, for derailing the show in an epic manner.
Now here's a lens flare for you.
Ah, blind.
Okay.
Skylanders.
Hey, what a great way to follow up a Harvey Fierstein story than talking about Skylanders.
Skylanders swap force is coming out.
You thwop them.
16 special figures with torsos and bottom halves.
You have to do the accent for the whole thing.
No.
You link the two pieces together.
You can combine the pieces in different ways.
So it's like, oh god, a whole new collection crap Now you gotta collect heads and feet Instead of just, you know, the figures themselves You can mix and match Although, in theory, it's a neat way to evolve the concept, I guess For what it's worth It's also gonna make you buy a brand new portal Because the old portal is not compatible with the new characters Oh, bastards Bastards That's an $80 purchase right there, buddy
It's also being done by Vicarious Visions.
It is not being done by Toys for Bob, who did the original.
Toys for Bob coming up with a new money-making scheme right now.
All they're doing is putting out new characters because there is a thing... They made tons of money, so yeah.
Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, Wii, and 3DS.
Interesting that it's on Wii U and Wii.
The Wii version being done by Beenox, 3DS by nSpace.
Because they've been contracted out because they don't care.
They know that people buy the characters.
They don't care about the game.
They just want people to buy characters.
If you think Skylanders isn't a thing, like that people are making too big of a deal out of Skylanders, you're probably right.
But the reality is, walk into Target or Best Buy.
I was at Best Buy last night because, I don't know, we were like, oh yeah, you can actually get those K-Cup coffee things pretty cheap at Best Buy.
That's what we were there for.
Go to Marshall's.
There was an aisle in the video game section, an entire aisle dedicated to Skylanders.
It'll blow your mind.
Soon, of course, Disney Infinity and all this other stuff will be competing with it.
Disney Infinity, can you imagine compared to the Skylanders stuff?
They're going to have so much.
Entire stores.
Anyway, Activision on their earnings call announced 100 million Skylanders toys have been sold.
Wow.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was actually from their press conference at Toy Fair 2013.
Excuse me, not from the earnings call.
But yeah, $500 million in sales in the U.S.
alone.
$195 million of that from Skylanders Giants.
It's a thing.
Like it or not, it's a thing.
yeah it's because people blindly collect those toys and now that they have to buy new characters and version 3's of their characters honestly if I were 8 I'd want it too I mean I'm trying to put it in that perspective is that it's easy for me to sit here and laugh at it but whoever fucking thought of this is a genius and if I was a kid I would fucking want it but I gotta wonder what's gonna happen when Infinity comes out cause that's gonna cut them off at the knees I think I did see the trailer for that and I liked it
Well, they're all going to... I mean, it's not going to end there.
No.
Wait, you don't think Nintendo wants that near-field communication shit to work so they can bring on the fucking Pokemon?
They've talked about that before.
That's all Nintendo has to fucking do is announce Pokemon for Wii U with actual Pokemon.
Collect them all.
You will collect them all.
Each character is going to be $10.
Nintendo's got a lot of stuff they could whip out and put on the table if they wanted to.
Believe me.
Talk about needing lube When they whip that out Is your body ready for this, bitch?
Alright, moving on, DarkSakura By the way, Rob, did you see my suggestion in chat?
No Mr. Spanky needs a New York Jewish cousin named Harvey Spanklestein Nobody understands the Mr. Spanky joke anymore There's people who get it Like four or five I miss Mr. Spanky, Rob
DDR is not on PC anymore.
I know.
How old is DDR PC these days?
Good lord.
I could probably find it on abandonware sites.
That's how old DDR PC is.
You could probably find it unwrapped and boxed in my house.
I mean, no, wrapped and boxed in my house, which is true.
So, speaking of Konami, how's that?
Anyway, the UK studio dude, David Cox, said that they want to consider putting out Castlevania Mirror of Fate on HD platforms.
The game is coming out on the 5th in the US for the 3DS.
But he said that the whole game is actually already done in high def, that they actually shrunk it and removed bones and changed animations to make it DS-sized, or 3DS-sized.
So, yeah, in fact, the quote right here is...
at Mercury S team we have an HD version of the game sitting there in a computer somewhere so I mean I guess all the other Castlevania games have sold very well but the cover art is really pretty but I'm really not sure how well it's going to sell I mean maybe it will, it's a Castlevania game hard to go wrong there sorry Castlevania 64
I could see them doing something like this for maybe a Nintendo console because it's a 3DS game.
Maybe, hey, there's a perfect Wii U tie-in right there.
There you go.
I'd actually like to... You can have that little Metroidvania map on your little Wii U... Did they say this is another Metroidvania-style one?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just making that up.
It's sort of like a port of Lords of Shadows, so it's a hack-and-slash.
God of Belmont.
God of Belmont.
Pretty much, yeah.
Whip of War.
Can't even follow those anymore.
Moving on.
I wouldn't buy it, by the way.
All right.
So Atari, of course, not doing that great.
And we've heard that they were talking about declaring bankruptcy and stuff.
So they did that.
And the U.S.
branch of Atari, they closed, I guess, $2 million in debtor in possession financing.
and also I guess they're supposed to be expecting some other money coming in.
But right now they're looking at restructuring and with that probably going to be selling off assets and properties including all your favorite Atari franchises.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and do something with that.
Remember Sword Quest?
Nope.
Oh, it was an Atari 2600 series and it never finished but they were like doing like a real, the games were so hard, they were doing like a real contest to give away like these real swords and crowns and shit that were valued at all this money back in the 80s and I think Earth World, Fire World and Water World all came out but the last one, Air World, never did.
I remember this.
And I think Water World was like right at the death stroke of Atari so I think it's like one of those like hard to find cartridges.
Yeah, anyway, sorry, I'm just thinking of all these obscure Atari franchises people ought to gobble up.
Anyhow.
New Marvel Madness, please.
Right?
Like 720?
Alright, moving on.
One place that would not be selling these Atari remake games if things keep going the way they're going is HMV.
Not a chain I've heard of, but I think these are big over in the UK, or at least bigger than they are here.
I think they're only in the UK.
Are they?
I want to say I've heard the name before.
But maybe because they partner with somebody over here, I don't know.
But anyway, HMV, this does affect the UK mostly, which has had a lot of bad news when it comes to game retailers lately.
Closing 66 of their 220 stores, which means 930 people out of a job as a result.
Really a bummer.
These stores closing in the next one or two months.
A quote from Joint Administrator Nick Edwards.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow.
Down to 500 and down to 500 in the UK too.
Can you imagine when we get to the point where GameStop will do that?
Because there's a lot of GameStops out there.
They're already closing stores.
Yeah, some of them are already starting to close.
Getting pretty crazy.
So anyway, our thoughts to those that were impacted by jobs.
Hopefully something, a similar retail operation will come to take their place, we will hope.
Anyhow, let's move on and get into some listener feedback in the form of emails.
Every week you guys email us.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we sort through the spam and find the emails that were actually from legit listeners and we read some of our favorites here on the program.
DarkSakura, pick some out and read them for us.
Okay, well I will go with the oldest to newest because we got two weeks worth of emails.
This one, well I didn't put a nickname on it so I'm just, oh no, it's HoneyBadger.
Hi guys, this is HoneyBadger don't take shit from no one.
This is Sam, aka Honey Badger on Steam.
I am ecstatic to hear the positive views on PC gaming.
The largest complaint and truth I hear from console gamers is instability with games on PC because it's up to the end user to set the graphics options.
Of course, if you go over the top with graphics levels your video card can't handle, you get instability.
NVIDIA has looked into this and will be releasing a tool that analyzes your specs and has them set per game configuration that will give you the best performance and visual appeal.
thanks for this show I hope to see you on Steam PS I want to add Rob and Loki on Steam if that's possible
We have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Steam.
You can add lots of people that listen to the show.
And yes, we're in there too.
Just look on me and link from there.
Yes.
OL Army, I think it's called.
There are Orange Lounge Radio fans.
And there's a VOG Network one.
I really should be pimping that one because we want to, you know, all the VOGgy people.
But join them both.
Our VOGgies.
Yes.
Do we have a name for the VOG listeners?
VOGLets.
VOGLets?
VOGLets.
Our little VOGLets.
We can have a VOG house.
but anyhow join those communities and yes Loki and I are in there and of course you know PC gaming it's a part of gaming and sometimes we I mean honestly I play games on my PC more than anything else because World of Warcraft is on PC and there's a lot of stuff you can't deny and especially is great on PC like Path of Exile I talked about earlier you're just not going to see that on consoles
Dragon Age 2
I can't believe something like that doesn't already exist
He explains it and I think, God, why isn't that already out there?
It's a great idea.
Do you know what we used to do to test our graphics capabilities?
We used to use the Final Fantasy XI graphics test.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, and that was pretty cute and it was a neat way of Yeah, the benchmark thing The benchmark thing I like that thing a lot too We used to use that to test if we could handle certain games because basically if we could handle Final Fantasy XI we could handle anything else that came out around the same time Yeah, it would show you the frame rate once it ran the whole thing like how many frames were processed But now my graphics card will seriously handle anything Yeah, yeah So I haven't had a reason to check
I should run the Final Fantasy XI benchmark just for lols.
I bet it would be gorgeous with my current graphics card.
There's only so much you can do with that thing, trust me.
I kind of am nostalgic now.
14 beta starting.
I don't need another game.
I'm actually kind of considering dropping WoW.
I'll just wait for it to go free to play.
I'm talking about XIII, of course.
You mean XI?
Or XI.
Moving on.
Hey, hey, OLR.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Good lord.
First off, allow me to elaborate on my Twitter post from last week.
I think it's fantastic.
This is Rostel UT, by the way.
I think it's fantastic to see people giving deep silver shit over the Dead Island Riptide statue fiasco.
Oh, that thing.
Yeah, I have no idea what he's talking about, but okay.
Remember the horrible bust that was the woman all chopped up that they were selling?
Oh yeah, that.
However, it's disheartening to see that in every comment section and seemingly every YouTube video gamers are giving shit to people who speak out against the promotion either brushing it aside as no big deal or making sexist remarks themselves.
You know the ESA loves to talk a great game about how many women play video games but given how uniform the audience reaction tends to be when things like this come up
No.
No.
YouTube commenting is not like a like Google is not trying to change the whole YouTube commenting thing to clear out the cesspool a little bit every time you log into YouTube don't you want to use your real name don't you want to change everything to your real name why aren't you using your real name like literally Google asked me today why aren't you using your real name it's like fuck off I don't want to use my real name and I'm not the problem because I don't comment on YouTubes but Yahoo Yahoo needs to do that too Yahoo comments
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Well, go back to the comment.
I don't think it really would matter how much of the market is female gaming because you still have most of the decisions being made by men.
I hate to say it.
It goes into more of a sociopolitical realm than just...
Who's playing the games?
I mean, and yeah, I think it is actually still predominantly guys.
But you have a much larger female gaming base now.
But it's... And it's really hard to say because, again, like you were talking about, there's that anonymity, you know, that you can say it and get away with it.
But, you know...
What if that was your mom you were gaming against and you, you know, were saying something?
What if it was another fucking human being with feelings and, you know, thoughts and so forth?
Like, and the vile things people say on YouTube about, like, these teenage girls that do their vlogs.
And they're just being dumb teenage girls.
We were all a dumb teenage girl at one point.
Yes, we were.
Let's be real, right?
Yes.
And, you know, people are going like, you should just kill yourself.
And there's several people who have.
Like...
Really?
Really?
Also on a psychological point of view, when you deal with people that young, well, basically you're dealing with people whose brains aren't going to be fully developed until they're 25.
And that's not a slight.
That is just a reality.
That's fact.
If you don't believe me, look at National Geographic.
They wrote a whole article on it.
But anyway, you're dealing with people who are not fully developed.
It's basically that level of suggestibility.
They don't have a way of filtering anything out.
It's all what's in front of you with no long-term consequence that's really pressing.
But if you also think of it that way, your gamer base, if you're thinking as mostly teenage and that male demographic between teenage to 27, you're also dealing with a huge number of people whose brains are not fully developed.
End of story.
Brains are not fully developed.
Those neural pathways are not all there.
And so as an adult, yeah, I can sit and tell myself, okay, well, they're not using all of their potential.
They have no faculties yet.
You can stop and tell yourself, yeah, these people are just trolls.
They don't know any better.
Maybe they don't care.
But they need to get the shit scared out of them.
But they do.
See, that's the thing.
This is what I would like to see is that if you have a warning button that instantly turns on whatever camera is connected so you can see their face.
That's it.
You know, or... Cameras turning on randomly.
That's big brother talk.
That's not realistic.
I know, but I mean, there should be... When you're dealing with the type of brain activity that deals only with immediacy and not long-term consequence, you need to make an immediate consequence.
Not to go on a tangent, but you got those people that were on Twitter and these stupid kids that when Obama got re-elected, there were all these people making tweets that were like, I can't believe that N-word got re-elected and saying just idiotic shit on their Twitter, right?
And so what happens, these websites go out and just basically dox them.
Like, you know, it's this guy that goes to this high school and he's on this scholarship for the college and these kids are like...
These kids are losing their scholarships over it and I'm not saying like maybe they shouldn't but it's kind of like they're dumbass kids and the dumbass kids don't need to have their lives ruined necessarily but they need that reality check and the parents could really use the smack on the head too because they didn't just learn it watching the TV's.
well honestly though that's a reflection of the caliber of person that these schools are getting and a school has a reputation to maintain too if it's going to come out you know that they're admitting somebody with that particular view set to their school and their school does not share that view set they have the right to deny them
RDG Singe in the chat saying, I know a few adults whose lobes never fully developed.
RossDLUT pointing out it's not all kids either.
Ain't that the truth?
That's true.
You know, we're talking a lot about teenagers and so forth.
But yeah, if a 30-year-old guy is sitting there trolling Twitter with all this stuff, then you know what?
It's a little harder to feel sorry for somebody.
whose brain is fully developed and should know better.
Yeah, well, I mean, you're also dealing with the fact that we are a society of instant gratification.
We're, especially now with the anonymity, the nastiest side of people are becoming public.
And you know what?
If they're going to be, you know, think that their anonymity can hide them, let them be exposed.
I have zero problem with that.
Let their boss find out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
everybody has that but I mean in the end you want to think about how you're reflecting on yourself you know I try yeah I get a little bit bitchier than normal on the show because it's sometimes funny but at the same time this is me this is who I am I try not to portray myself in any other way than the person that I am and so on the same token that's all we can ever consider these people that we're interacting with through a video game this is who this person is oh my god who talks like this I don't want to be around this person anymore and
How do they have friends?
Technist in our chat room, and I think we'll move on after this comment.
I think people forget that there is no such thing as true anonymity on the internet.
No, it's not.
Let's move on.
There's the rest of the email.
I know logically that I shouldn't be basing an entire group of people on the internet, but that's just exhausting when it's all you see from gamers 90% of the time.
Regards, Ross Steele, UT.
GamersHateEverything.com
DarkSakura, do you have problems with your balls?
Let me finish.
Just to clarify, of course the ball doesn't ricochet directly from the slot machine into the bumper.
It is hit by the right flipper first, then hits the bumper and drains.
Timing on the flipper is a major factor as well.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't actually touched my Twilight Zone machine except to take a picture of my cat on it in probably six months, so I probably can't answer that question.
Although I can say that there are lots of cheap maneuvers, but keep in mind these were meant to make money.
Thanks for watching!
That's it for Mailbags?
That's it.
Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to email us in the future.
Again, one more time, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Please do email us.
We get a lot of lovely emails and we would love a few more.

So I have to actually read something from Becky.
Sure.
That Julian said.
Go for it.
Okay, so she's playing the first Mass Effect again.
And Julian is her six-year-old?
Her five-year-old.
Five-year-old.
He's going to be six, though, in a couple months.
Close enough.
Right after my birthday.
I was close.
I rounded.
Yeah.
The line from Joker, I want to be there when you make that son of a bitch pay.
And Julian says, you're not going to make him pay.
You're going to make him die.
So I felt that needed to be shared.
Alright, let's move on with a few more news stories before we get to... Oh, I'm sorry, we've got FUs of the Week to do.
I almost overlooked the FUs of the Week.
FU to myself for damn near overlooking the FUs of the Week.
It's the part of the show every week where we get angsty.
Why?
I don't know, cuz.
Um, first off, um, F you to people who don't understand what following distance is, and try to get all up in yours and then change lanes into your following space.
In California, we have what's called the three-second rule, where we pick a landmark when the car in front of you, when the tail of your car passes it, you count three seconds until you hit that same part with the front of your car, and that's following distance.
Well, in Alabama, it's two seconds, but whatever.
Um, just because Alabama's fucking...
I can say it.
I can say Alabama's backwards.
I'm from there.
I escaped.
Also, F you to there being ads now on the AIM app on my iPad.
And F you to the winners slash losers of Canada's Worst Driver.
Because they were both really awful.
And I mean, these people are hazards on the road.
They're going to kill people.
I mean, literally, they are that stupid.
If you are a bad driver, if everyone around you tells you you're a bad driver, and no amount of practice is helping you, stop fucking driving!
End of story.
That goes to everybody in the world who's a bad driver.
Me, I'm a great driver.
And I have a thank you to my husband, who greeted me the other night with a three terabyte hard drive.
Yeah!
You're spoiled.
No, I love him.
Loki?
F you to the lingering part of the stomach bug here that I have, which is making me feel extremely bloated, like I'm full of just like... Pizza?
No, I didn't even have that much pizza.
I only had like two slices of pizza.
You're full of bloat?
Yeah, so basically, I mean, it's gonna obviously cause me to lose weight, I guess, which is good, but it's still very uncomfortable.
You know it's all water while you're sick.
Once you start eating, you'll retain again.
Is that it?
I want to make sure I'm super vague in how I put this.
In response to some things I've seen on Twitter, I just want to say an F you to somebody who tries to call out someone else's faults on things that happened in the past when that person themselves have lots of faults in their past that they have not apologized for and maybe ought to.
Just saying.
That's all I got to say about that.
See, we don't need those Wii U's, you know, because we've got other things to keep us occupied.
I know you think you guys are all fancy with your Miiverse channels and stuff like that, but hey, there's Xbox Verse in Japan, and Xbox Verse, I guess it's Hakuverse, and...
Apparently, like all things on the internet that are somewhat unregulated, it is full of penises.
Penis art, penis art, penis art.
TTP.
That's a lot of cock on your desktop there.
Yeah.
Oh, look, Chris Cock.
That's... Yes.
So, interesting.
But hey, it's out there, so that's kind of neat, I guess.
I don't know if they've got exactly the website here.
Let's see.
It's at xbox.verse.jp is where you can check it out, and I'm not sure how you can actually go about posting on there and stuff, but...
Xbox.verse.jp
There was that whole little story about the particular game too that was causing excessive TP.
I'm just surprised there's that big of a community around an Xbox in Japan.
The way you hear things online, you would think that there was no fans of Xbox in Japan whatsoever, but I guess it's not doing as terrible as you might think.
Well, speaking of penis, I mean, you know, why not another story that has to do with this?
And Custom Made 3D is an upcoming erotic game that's coming out with a very special attachment.
And it's called... Sorry.
Sorry.
It's called the Juicy Air.
Like, is this trolling?
Like, is this story for real?
Like, is this for real or am I being trolled?
I think it's for real.
They have an actual website.
Oh, my God.
All right.
Is it like a cup?
Let's go to the website.
Here's the thing.
It's a cup.
It is a wireless masturbation toy that reacts in real time to your stroke speed and depth, making this motion control, you know what?
So just pull a sausage out of the fridge and go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
In-game characters react accordingly too with different characters reacting differently.
This peripheral has an analog stick and an action button as well as a right and left click.
Suddenly the term clicking your mouse has a whole new meaning.
You don't even have to take your hands off your wiener while you're playing.
There you go.
This story has been met with the response of dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot in chat room.
Rdgsinge in our chat room says, are there any special plans for episode 500?
Own a cup.
Well, after this story, there are now.
I'll be staying home.
That's our full video review of Custom Aid 3D.
I wonder if there's going to be one of those on... Oh, God.
Alright.
What?
Game Guru, talk about playing with your Wii.
Yes, there's pictures of it.
Look it up yourself.
We Jokes are seven years old.
What the hell?
All right.
That's it.
Just look up what an Ona Cup is and you'll see what it looks like.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Surely you want to follow that story on our Skype line.
Penis!
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
All one word.
RawSteel UT in chat says, as long as we don't have to see the cup being used.
It could just be above the waist shots, that's all.
1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And while we wait for some calls, there's always last minute stories and Twitter topics.
Any last minute stories, Loki?
No.
No.
I don't really have anything.
I was looking at... So much for that.
I was just trying to look and see.
I had something, but it wasn't very important.
Oh, yeah.
This is kind of just a random tangent here.
The phone's blowing up, so write down your thought and we'll come back to it later because I want to get to the phone calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Oh my god.
It is a blast from the past.
Raven's Dolphin.
Holy fucking shit.
It's Raven's Dolphin.
Oh my god.
I love...
You live, beware.
I live.
What a blast from the past.
Why is from your grave?
I have risen from my grave.
I escaped from the mental institution to call you guys.
Where the hell have you been?
I've been around.
Are you still doing your tech and games thing?
I am.
And guess what?
We're celebrating six years this month.
It actually became very successful and I want to thank you guys for giving me inspiration.
No, I know, it cracked me up, because I would see that all around the internet, the Tekken games thing, and I'm like, wow, that shit really blew up, didn't it?
I'm like, good for him, good for you, good for you.
Yeah, it worked out very well.
We went to Comic-Con, we went to Otakon, we did some things.
Did you get blessed by the E3 Pope yet?
No, we did not, but I'm not worried.
Soon, you'll get there, buddy, you'll get there.
It's happening.
It's happening.
But I came to call you not to talk about me.
God, it's you guys.
And you guys were talking about the Pokemon thing about gotta catch them all.
Yeah.
And, you know, the Wii U has built-in RFID chips.
It sure does.
So they could really easily do it.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, they could.
Weren't they at one point you were supposed to be able to tap your credit card on that?
Yeah.
See, that's the thing.
That was one of the stories that we didn't talk about.
They're working on that still.
It's not even coming out until, like, fall.
It's like, yeah, way to implement all your technology.
Yeah, but remember way back when I first talked about the Wii U and how it's like the Winchester Mystery House where you'll find all these doors that go nowhere and shit that's not finished built yet?
That's the Wii U. So that part is currently still under construction.
We're sort of stuck in the seance room.
Sort of.
And Ubisoft just locked another door.
But anyways.
Sure did.
Sure did.
Oh.
Yeah, go ahead.
I just have one more thing.
I'm going to keep this short.
It's about the Rayman Legend thing.
Mm-hmm.
You know, for me, it was bad PR from Ubisoft.
They should have just said it was coming out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox.
They should have just said, oh, it's an exclusive and then yanked the thing out.
But I want to say I understand why they did it.
But I felt like they should have played that way better than they did.
Are you a Wii U owner by chance?
I am a Wii U owner.
I own a PlayStation.
I own everything.
You know, I'm on Steam now.
I bought Mass Effect, so I will be playing it.
If I want to be listening to this show, I better be playing it.
I feel like we've raised you well.
Because I know you were a lot younger when you first started listening to OLR.
I'm so proud.
You are making us proud.
You have to play multiplayer.
Wait, are you playing Mass Effect on PC?
I only got one and two.
I bought it during the Steam sale, so I didn't play a lot of it yet.
I will play it, DarkSakura.
Don't kill me.
I have it.
I own it.
I'll buy it.
Let me know when you get to three so we can play multiplayer together.
You're doing better than Bobby Blackwolf in that regard.
That's good to know.
What was I going to say?
I don't know.
I don't know what else to say.
Oh, yes, you're a Wii U owner.
What do you think of the Wii U?
How are you feeling about your purchase?
No.
I have to say, my mom bought it, and I like the thing itself.
You know, me, I think my favorite feature is, it's remote.
You know what, that TV thing, did you check it out during the Super Bowl?
I did.
I checked it out when the Broncos were playing, and when they scored that touchdown, and then they lost, and I'm like, I'm done with this.
I was waiting for the Beyonce concert last weekend while I was sick, and I had the TV thing going on, and I was like, oh, these guys are throwing a football around before the Beyonce concert.
I'll check this out.
And it was actually kind of fun to look at the feedback people were giving on me.
A lot of it was just dumb internet shit, but it was kind of neat to have that right in front of me as I'm watching this game on the TV, which, believe it or not, there were some pretty lousy things that happened in the game that even I was like, wow, the 49ers are getting their ass kicked.
in the first half of this game
but my favorite meme that's come out of the whole thing is Tard, Tartar Sauce the grumpy cat saying blackout and then Tartar Sauce holding the plug or the Bane references were all over Twitter of course and that happened but my favorite gif I saw was the one where all the lights go out to bring this call full circle Raven's Dolphin when all the lights go out and then you see the stadium above and it goes out and then Team Rocket shows up that cracked me up that was great that was the winner
I'm sorry, that was my favorite part of the whole Super Bowl.
It's like people staring at the screen, what are we doing?
And then the beats after it were like, thank you, internet.
This is why you're awesome.
Was this Beyonce's fault?
Was Beyonce's performance so fierce that she blew the fucking power?
Like, that was my favorite.
That's my favorite.
That was good, too.
And I saw her at the inauguration.
She didn't blow out anyone.
Alright.
Well, Raven's Dolphin, please, pimp your shit.
It's six years, you've earned it.
Six years, thanks to you guys.
The website's called
techandgames.com it lives quite well with 833 fans on Facebook doesn't matter that's someone else's stuff I'm not like I didn't create that but you voted each and every one of them so you go boy
Yeah, thank you, Rob, for the time, and I know you have other calls.
Anytime.
Take care, buddy.
Good to hear from you.
Dude, bye.
Don't be a stranger.
Bye.
Uh, 1877 GameOLR, or username on Skype is OrangeLaundry.
Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to cut you off earlier, but when I saw that one popping up, I was like, blast from the past, holla.
I don't even remember what I was talking about now.
Isn't that how it goes?
Let's see, Tiger Claw giving us a gif here in the chat room and I just want to make sure that... Oh, god damn it.
This is great live radio.
I just want to make sure this is the right one because if it is, I insist that Ranma, our Tumblr administrator... What is the Tumblr?
Is it Orange Lounge Radio?
OrangeLoungeRadio.Tumblr.com I insist that this go on the Orange Lounge Radio Tumblr.
Yes, this is it.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Please repost that.
Perfect.
Yes, I insist that that be reposted.
1877 GameOLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
Let's go to the phones and take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Ragenator.
Hey, Ragenator in video.
I see you.
Peekaroo.
What's up?
Well, I would have talked about this last week if there was a show last week.
Yeah, rub it in.
I was sick.
Rub it in.
I wasn't trying to rub anything in, but
With all the, since you kind of briefly talked about the topic in today's show, I have a somewhat related question.
Now, with all this talk about the Xbox 720, assuming that's what the final name is going to be called.
The Lube is the name of the week.
The Xbox Lube.
Or the PlayStation 4.
That kind of begs the question, at this point, do we really need
a new system from either Microsoft or the PlayStation 3 or from Sony.
I mean, think about it.
PlayStation 3 is, at this point, is really hitting stride.
And from my viewpoint, Microsoft still has a lot of life left with the 360.
I mean, I can't see them really improving graphics all that much with the next systems.
and there's a lot of great games coming out.
The only thing I can possibly see is doing like a 4K resolution or 8K, but
But nobody's, you can't, look at how well that went for 3D on the PlayStation 3.
Even that really hasn't cracked yet.
I think we can all assume PlayStation 4 is going to do this 4K, super high HD thing because Sony makes TVs and they want to sell a few of those too.
But I think, I want to go back to the question you were really asking and ask the panel here.
I think that's a great question because we've kind of answered this before a little bit but not since some of this news came up.
PlayStation 4 and Xbox Lube.
Do we really need it?
They're coming this year.
Is it necessary?
Does the industry need it?
Loki, you sell games for a living.
What do you think?
Are these systems needed right now?
No, because I don't think Nintendo... See, I'm surprised that they're not waiting to put these systems out because the Wii U...
Vita
Well, I don't know what they were trying to beat.
The price point's too high, and it's just, there's not any games coming out.
I'm kind of, like, you know, part of the reason I said, and I said this at the end of last year, we're making predictions for this year, and I originally predicted we wouldn't have the PlayStation 4, and my reason essentially was, we don't need one, and Sony has the Vita to work on still and so forth.
So actually, my opinion really hasn't changed, Ragenator.
I don't think we
I don't think that it's necessary at all, not yet anyway I think that they should be pushing any type of release until far later
You know, we don't need it.
We've got a system that... I understand the investor pressure, though.
Yeah.
But still, you know, I think that they need to keep working on strengthening what they have using the existing technology and then bringing out something really mind-blowing.
Ragenator, go ahead and get your thought out now that the call's back and then we can move on.
Sure.
Yeah, I was going to say, you know, at least with the higher resolution TVs out there and possible...
You know, using PS4 and Xbox 360 and 720 to work with those.
The trouble is, the adoption rate with the higher resolution TVs is pretty low, and from my perspective, the one problem with the adoption of those high resolution TVs is that
There's not really a whole lot of content, if any, for those higher resolution TVs.
Now, if broadcast TV and cable companies were to really go balls to the wall and support that stuff, plus now you have higher resolution videos, like, you know, whatever next-gen Blu-ray comes out or whatever, if that supports the high resolution, plus the games, then I can see...
Something new coming out or something that we can't even think of right off the bat that next system could potentially do that current systems can't do.
You know what, that's a good point because high definition in itself took a long time for us to really adopt.
It's still not a big adoption rate because look at Blu-ray.
Blu-ray, people aren't replacing their DVD collections with Blu-ray.
Even at least high-def TVs right now are pretty much all you can buy.
You can't even really buy standard def.
Well, you can secondhand, of course, but you can't even really walk into a Best Buy and find a standard def TV maybe way in the back or something.
I mean, it's all about HDTV.
At least now that's finally catching on where it's really the mainstream, but that took like 10 years to get there, a very long time.
But in the middle of that,
was the 360 and the PlayStation 3, which was like our first HD gaming.
So maybe the 4K thing is a preemptive strike.
But I don't know.
It could be way too early.
Anyway, Ragenator, gotta let you go to get more calls.
But thank you so much for the call, buddy.
Sure, no problem.
Take care.
And thanks for the video.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
RossDLUT saying VHS was around nearly 10 years after DVD.
That's true, you have the overlap that happens too.
Yeah, but A-Tracks didn't totally last that many years.
Also consider that these older generation systems could probably push better graphics because the original Xbox and even the PlayStation 2, some games did output to HD, like 720p and 1080i.
Assuming the games support it.
Not all of them, but some of them did.
All right.
While we wait for another call, maybe possibly, let's go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.
Actually, I'm going to bring it up on the desktop here.
I usually use my iPad for it, but I left that in the other room like a genius.
So I'll pull that up here.
I know at least there was a couple things from Tigerclaw in there.
of course it would help if I sign in as the right account help, someone buy me time
I'm broke, so we'll have... Words.
And Rob is actually signing into Twitter right now, everybody.
I am filling time so that we do not have... Except I can't remember the password to the stinking Twitter account because when you manage... Burrito!
When you manage four... The password is not burrito.
When you manage four Twitter accounts... Don't tell them that.
I'd love to see how many people try to log in with the wrong word.
That's true.
Log them out of his account because, you know, Twitter hacks and...
Yes, it is.
We're in the opening.
There's a little screen that talks about the Namco Museum and the network features.
And look very closely at the high scoreboard, and you'll see some familiar names.
And a big thank you to the OLR fans, or fan, who put us in a game.
Much thanks.
It doesn't get any better than that, right?
Like, I can quit now.
I made it in a video game.
I could die.
I can die now.
It's like butter.
And if you haven't checked it out yet, Bungie Fair Tossing.
Yes, especially with this unfortunate news about XNA this week where even though Microsoft hasn't updated it in three years, they basically said they're not going to.
Really unfortunate that indie games probably not going to be a thing on the Xbox Lube.
I don't know.
We're just left to hypothesize.
Maybe they've got something newer, bigger, better coming out, I hope.
But yes, support XNA.
Support the indie games.
It's not like indie games are cooked up overnight.
A lot of these guys started it a long time ago before they made these announcements about XNA.
Support indie games and start with Bungie Ferritossing.
That's a good one to pick.
A bunch of tweets from Tigerclaw.
I'll read a couple of them here.
Oh, this one's a My Little Pony story, but it's one... But no one cares, Skip.
No, no, no, it's worth reading, because they were actually making a fighting game, My Little Pony MLP Fighting is Magic.
Well, surprise, surprise, a cease and desist from Hasbro's legal representatives, and this was posted to their site at main6.com, asking them to stop the distribution of any materials that My Little Pony characters, names, locations, or elements from the show, including YouTube, Twitch, and so forth.
They attempted to negotiate Hasbro for the continued use of the property for their voluntary project, but they didn't get an answer.
Does this really surprise anybody?
If you're going to make a fan game like that or something, just do it on the download, release it, then do a cease and desist.
It's on the internet.
What are you going to do?
Don't hype it up.
If you're trying to recruit people, I guess that's one thing, but try to do it on the download because the more you hype it up...
The more visibility it's going to get, and then the company has an obligation to protect their trademarks and so forth to put the C&D out there.
And I don't think fighting ponies was what they wanted to have happen.
Obi-Wan Jabroni on OLR says, Hey, OLR, give me a shout-out.
It's fucking 5 a.m.
here.
Where are you?
It's 5 a.m.
Is that the UK?
Are you maybe in the military?
That could be the Mideast.
I don't know.
But shout out to you for it being pretty late.
I could do a shout, but then Rob's landlord would get complaints from the neighbors.
You can go listen to this week's Horde House and get a scream and shout.
That's all I'm going to say.
Let's go to one more call here on Skype.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Actdeft.
It's like I say My Little Pony and then all of a sudden, look who's on the line.
What's up, Actdeft?
Well, BlackBull's gonna hate me for this, but yeah, I wanna talk about the Fighting This Magic game.
I'm only letting you do it because it's relevant to gaming talk right now.
This thing getting pulled was good news for you guys because it gives you an excuse to talk about it and be relevant, so go for it while you can.
Yeah, well, oh, Black Wolf.
Anyways, yeah, I'm pretty, well, sad that it got the cease and desist letter.
Though, yeah, it was eventually going to happen because it got a lot of media attention.
An article went up on GameSpot, and it also was competing to be the eighth game featured on the EVO tournament this year.
And like I said, it caught a lot of attention And it was almost finished They were pretty much on the final stage of development Well that means it's going to leak to the internet anyway And they'll just say, oh our computer was hacked And the finished version leaked to the internet Like that'll happen Didn't that happen to the Chrono Trigger thing that Square Enix shut down?
I'm almost positive it did
The music from that came out.
Once it hits the internet, it's never coming off.
If they were that close to finishing it, it'll leak in its beta form.
They'll find a way to do it where they will be able to wash their hands of any legal ramifications.
Surely you can see with all this attention, wasn't it getting to be a little too big for something that they really... If they didn't have Hasbro's sign-off on it, is this really that surprising?
No, it isn't.
Like I said, it was eventually going to happen, though most of us were expecting the game to be released.
We're actually looking forward to playing it because it was already leaked before.
So it's already out on the internet.
You can get it on the Pirate Bay and other sites.
Oh, well then shit.
You can't shut that down.
Yeah, but it's a pretty early build of it.
So it's somewhat buggy and it isn't complete.
but yeah even then it looked like a pretty good game it was like a regular game even a good fighting game and it was featured on EVO on their indie showcase last year so yeah it was like I said many people even in the fighting community were expecting a lot of it so yeah I just want to make sure it was still a good fighting game without the marijuana right?
I don't do drugs, so yeah.
Okay, alright.
Good answer.
Very good answer.
Winners don't do drugs.
Alright, yes, that's right.
Winners don't do drugs, and that is the real message here.
Alright, I gotta let you go before Black Wolf pulls the plug on the show, so take care, buddy.
You too, thanks.
Bye.
Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
I think My Little Pony Call will do that.
Just fucking with you guys.
Let's do one more tweet because TigerCloud said a bunch of stories.
I want to do at least one more of these here.
We'll do this one.
It's a pinball story.
Pinball is always relevant.
Very cool pinball actually.
Star Wars pinball announced by Zen Studios.
Hell yes to this.
Zen Studios is partnering with LucasArts for a Star Wars pinball.
This is awesome.
Did you see this little table shot here?
That's neat.
Yeah, a little Boba Fett and C-3PO.
It's awesome.
What is this coming to?
This is going to be Pinball FX 2 and it'll be available on Live Arcade, Windows 8, PlayStation Network, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Crossbuy.
Is this supposed to be on Wii U at some point too?
I think so.
That's awesome.
Congrats to Zen Studios.
That's a hell of a partnership to land there.
Good job, you guys.
All right.
That's going to do it for our Twitter topics tonight.
Again, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us tweets in the future.
And that does it for the Skype line tonight.
If you didn't get through and you have something you want to say, please email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or tweet us for next week.
Since there was no last minute stories, I believe that brings us to another close of an episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us and supporting us through another week.
We are an independently produced show, literally done out of somebody's dining room.
Where we don't dine.
We have radio stuff set up anywhere.
I dine sometimes.
I snack.
My head still hurts.
I feel way too full.
Still feeling bloaty?
Sorry to hear it.
Uncomfortably so.
All right.
Better than how you were feeling yesterday, though.
Better than Friday, yes.
Yes.
All right.
That does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
