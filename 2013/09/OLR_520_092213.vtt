00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Mighty No. 9 surpasses its stretch goals and we'll try heading to consoles.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Diablo 3 will lose its auction house next year, more of your money heads to iOS, and the tributes and memorials to Hiroshi Yamauchi begin.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 22nd of 2013 with the 520th episode of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games with you guys out there in internet land and my co-hosts here in studio.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Wark.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Wark.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Wark.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Que.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Que.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Tonight's presentation of OLR will be presented in the language of Chocobo.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Wark, wark, wark.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
That was the sound of like 500 people unsubscribing from the show all at once.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You mean we have that many?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Alright.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The facts are completely made up on tonight's OLR as well.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
How you doing DarkSakura? Seriously.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Caffeinated, thank you.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
No seriously. How are you?

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
It's a bummer it's a radio show because if you all could see the look she was giving me right now.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I think I was giving him the girl face.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Or how dare you cut me off.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
But you're caffeinated, do you have your coffee?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm caffeinated. I have had healthy food today.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
And I still have chocolate covered mints for later.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Ooh.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Ooh, yummy.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
And I've brought delicious snacks.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Which I keep eating.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
In the form of my special trail mix.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Made of raw almonds.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And raw cashews.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And a roasted coconut.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
But the coconut's the best part.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
It totally is.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Alright.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Say hello to our coconut here on the show.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Or just nut.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hi.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
How are you Loki?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm fine.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
My, well, throat's a little sore but I'm fine.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Sorry to hear it.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm having colas.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I caught it from my son, so.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Don't get me sick.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, don't get us sick.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm being rude, don't get me sick.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It's just, it's just the throat thing.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
It could very well be also allergies because I always get, like, scratchy throat whenever

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
the weather goes wet and then dry again.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, the season's changed yesterday.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't know if you noticed, but it rained.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So that means summer's over and here's winter.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Because we don't have a fall here.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
There's no transition.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
It's just like, boom, done.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's right.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Boom goes the dynamite.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
That's it.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So, yeah, it rained here yesterday.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
So, thank gosh it rained yesterday and not two days ago because I went to an outdoor

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
concert two days ago and that would have been really terrible if it was raining.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
So, yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Anyway, you guys are there in our chat room.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
We always like to say hello to the fourth guest on the show, our chatters.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's set in October where we record dead.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
And, again, that's Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Show.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And those of you that were listening live, I'm sure were aware of this.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
But if you're listening on the podcast, you may not be aware, our pal Bobby hit 400 episodes

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
tonight.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So, claps and congratulations for Bobby.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
That's a great milestone.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And in true Bobby form, he had walked through the door 20 minutes before to set up in a

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
frenzy because he was working on something else for the show.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
He was 15 minutes late with Starbucks.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
No, that's our excuse, Dark Sakura.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Bobby's always hard at work.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So, all right.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We're going to get into gaming news and all that.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
But tonight I want to start off a little bit with, you know, some sad news.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm sure this is on many people's minds this week, as you probably were following the gaming,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
you know, the gaming press and pretty much every blog read a story on this.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
But Hiroshi Yamauchi died this week at age 85.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
If you don't know that name, he was basically the head of Nintendo, the Nintendo president

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
for many years.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
That's the position that Satoru Iwata holds now.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And, you know, many of you know him for sure.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
But Yamauchi ran Nintendo for 53 years.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
So the NES, the Super NES, you know, all the stuff that led into NES because, you know,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
they didn't start with that.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
They were doing the watch games.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And even before that, it was cards and the more mechanical stuff.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
That's how he met Gunpei Okoye, if I'm not mistaken.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It wasn't about games at all.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I think you have a mechanical.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
But Hiroshi Yamauchi, he was a very interesting guy because he was a businessman in every sense of the word.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
The man hardly played video games at all.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
In fact, I believe rumor has it the first video game he ever played was when Tetris went to the Game Boy,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
which to be fair was a lot of people.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I was about to say.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah. I mean, he just knew how to make business decisions.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
And a lot of people, of course, also know him because he owned the Seattle Mariners for quite some time.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And it was very controversial at the time because, you know, he was in Japan.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
The team was here.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
He didn't really have plans to come see the team.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
He never came to see a game.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Now, he watched them on TV and things like that, but he never came over to actually see a game.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So it was kind of controversial in that sense.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
But again, businessman.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But you also think about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Baseball is super, super huge in Japan.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
A lot of makes sense.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
And if I do remember correctly, thanks to one of our mutual friends and some of the players from the Mariners came over to play in Japan.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Oh, that's right.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So, you know, do you know who owns the Mariners now?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
If I'm not mistaken, I have no idea.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Howard Phillips.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Remember him from the Nintendo days?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
He was Nintendo.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
He was he used to be the Reggie Fils-Aime back in the day, the ginger ginger president of Nintendo.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
And most people, honestly, most people our age know him from the Howard and Nestor comics from the days of the Nintendo Power.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yes.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So it's kind of funny how that all kind of goes together.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Some kind words and some reminiscing about Hiroshi Yamauchi in chat.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Dungeon Buster says he was an uncanny judge of character and trends.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
What Up G says hiring Miyamoto, one of his best moves ever.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
True says TMZ even showed a bit of love to Hiroshi Yamauchi, lol.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, you know, the news even kind of, you know, cut through to the mainstream because, you know, not only was he the Nintendo guy,

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
which, you know, obviously he made a boatload of money from his share of Nintendo stock when it surged thanks to the Wii and all that.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I mean, the man had a boatload of money.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Many people knew that he did not accept his pension when he retired from Nintendo.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
He said, no, Nintendo needs the money.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
And so I believe he donated a huge amount to cancer charities as well.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
So the man did a lot of good, which should be recognized.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Yes, I think you think he probably had well enough in savings to live off of.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I wish that, you know, CEOs over here would do that.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, it was a very, very humble sort of sort of thing to do.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
And it made a lot of mainstream coverage.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I heard not all of it was necessarily tasteful.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
I want to say I heard that Arsenio Hall, who I didn't even realize was back on TV with a late night show.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I was like, how 1992 is that?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But he's back on TV with a late night show.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
And there was some type of joke in the monologue or something where, you know, Hiroshi Yamauchi died today.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And it sounded something like this.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And they played the Pac-Man.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Really?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't know. I'm paraphrasing the joke.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I don't remember the exact words, but I know it was the Pac-Man noise because it made me think,

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, if you want to get technical, sir, even though your joke is in incredibly poor taste, Pac-Man was a Namco character.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And I think a lot of people would recognize the Mario death noise.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So if you had to go there, but you know what?

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Then I'm writing people's disgusting jokes for them.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So whatever.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You know how I found out about it, actually?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Oddly enough, I saw his picture on the Nikkei site.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
And then later on, I saw someone had translated from the business news that he died.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And that's how I found out.

08:16.000 --> 08:25.000
So, you know, obviously a lot of gaming in general is to thank to this man and his guidance.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Even if he wasn't necessarily a gamer himself, his business guidance led Nintendo to greatness.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I thought maybe we could just take a minute.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
I mean, obviously I think it goes without saying, we want to dedicate our show tonight to his memory and everything he's done for us.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
But I thought it might be a good time to just share some Nintendo memories and maybe some early Nintendo memories.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So I want to go around the room.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm not playing my 3DS right now, am I?

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Not current Nintendo memories because your 3DS is so close to the mic, they can actually hear your Animal Crossing.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Hey, that's actually good background music to have the island music.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I suppose it is somewhat appropriate.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
But in all seriousness, Dark Sakura, what's your first memory of the Nintendo Entertainment System?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
When did you become an NES fangirl?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Now, I know you were more, you know, you were Sega.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
No, I wasn't. Dan was Sega.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh, okay. Excuse me. Okay.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Then when did you, I was going to say, even if you were Team Sega, you still had love for Nintendo.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You know, where did...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I was pretty damn loyal to Nintendo when I was a kid.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So where did it all come from? Where did it start?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I went over to my friend's house and played Metroid.

09:25.000 --> 09:37.000
I would go hang out over at my friend's house and she had, you know, she had Super Mario Brothers and Metroid and Legend of Zelda and for that god awful game Clu Clu Fucking Land.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh my god.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I kind of like that game.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I kind of too, but I hate it too.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
It's one of those like, it's so niche and it's so stupid, like it's kind of cool.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Like if you know how to play Clu Clu Land, that kind of makes you a gaming hipster.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah.

09:53.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, I would also go over to, now at the time, and I have to give a little background, my friend Catherine, who would just go by Catherine, her mother was a Cathy.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
My mother was a Cathy. They were both Cathleens.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And I have an Aunt Cathy and a bunch of people, so we would always joke which Cathy am I hanging with.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
But anyway, her brother was like super into Metroid.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So we would, you know, Metroid and Metal Gear.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
So it was a lot of playing that around over at her house.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
And then my dad finally got me mine and he got me his favorite game, which was Sky Shark.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
So I was playing like shooting games in, you know, 1941 and 1942.

10:33.000 --> 10:43.000
And my papa, when he was alive, my dad's dad, we would play Jackal on his big screen TV where you could see every damn pixel.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
And he'd say, now Maury, because he called me Maury. My middle name is Marie. He didn't like my first name for some reason.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
I'd say Maury, I want you to throw that grenade over the wall and then I'm going to come around and shoot him.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
I'd be like, okay, Papa. And then playing Abadox, because for some reason he liked Abadox.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Your papa likes some really strange NES games.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
I know. But he was totally into the war games and Tecmo Bowl.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And my little sister, for some reason, liked that stupid game Mag Max.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Because you could just play it in loops over and over and over again. That game was awful.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
And then my mom's friend was getting rid of her games.

11:29.000 --> 11:39.000
And she gave me the golden game that kept my love of Nintendo living longer than the Super Nintendo had been in my life.

11:39.000 --> 11:49.000
And that was Guardian Legend. And I beat the shit out of that game. I couldn't do it now, but I was pretty good at it then.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
I can't really pin it on one thing. It's just lots of good things.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
And then having a friend set his on fire. I don't know if you thought I was joking about it before, but I really was serious.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
He threw it down a flight of stairs and set it on fire. And it still worked.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
That's back when they built consoles.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
They were built tough!

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
That's right. There was none of this red ring or yellow light shit.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You throw them down a flight of stairs and set them on fire and they still worked.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
It still worked. Although I don't think it would have worked had he flushed it down the toilet like he wanted to.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
That disgusting brown color that most Super Nintendos are these days is a badge of honor.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
And it meant your mom was a chain smoker. That's what it meant in my house.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Loki, what were some early NES memories for you?

12:38.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, I got my first NES. My parents surprised me with it with Breakthrough, Zelda, and Bubble Bobble.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
So, I played the crap out of that. That and my friend's house.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Because everyone had an NES, so I played different games.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That's about it.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
What was it about the NES that made you love it so much?

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't know. I just liked video games anyways. I had a ColecoVision before that, so...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I did too!

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So, it was just slightly better, you know?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Better graphics?

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah, better graphics, better controller. Because, you know, the ColecoVision was like a numpad with a little joystick on top.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
At least it wasn't as bad as the Atari 5200 controller, though. That was pretty bad.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
What would you say is your favorite NES game ever?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Um...

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Probably, like, um...

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Let's see, Legend of Zelda or...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Blaster Master?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Metroid's good, too.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It's one of my favorites, too.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
I don't know. I mean, I know there were some NES games that I had that I played the crap out of, but...

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I can't really remember which ones they were.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Um...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Mega Man 2, maybe? Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
My earliest NES memory was that, um...

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
I wanted a Nintendo real bad for kind of the same reason Loki did, is that I liked video games anyway.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
We had an Atari 2600.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
So, of course, when I saw that there was a Nintendo out there and I got to play it at the store, I really wanted them.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And I think I played it at a friend's house, too.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
And I finally was rewarded with one for getting straight A's in the fourth grade.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I got my Nintendo Entertainment System.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
We went to Sears and bought the NES that came with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
And I just played the crap out of that. I played so much Mario Brothers. It was insane.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Gray Gun era.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and the Zapper and all that stuff.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
One of the other early games I got was also The Legend of Zelda, because I didn't get the NES when it first came out.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
But by the time I bought it, The Legend of Zelda was out and I had a ton of friends in school that were playing it.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
And I remember before I had an NES, I overheard friends talking about it and I was super jealous.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Like, I want to play The Legend of Zelda. I want a Nintendo.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You know, kind of that whole jealousy.

14:54.000 --> 15:02.000
So, it was really great when I did get Zelda with the NES, because I played the crap out of that game.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
And it got to the point where people were asking me for advice.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
I think I've told this story on the show before, but I'll kind of quickly recap.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
You know, for somebody that was picked on a lot as a kid, which, you know, I'm sure a lot of us were,

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
but I just remember that was a really awesome turnaround where I went from the guy that's being picked on all the time

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
to the guy that will tell you how to get to whatever dungeon in the second quest,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
so you better be nice to him type of thing.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So, that was always kind of nice.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
So, my favorite NES game. See, I would have to kind of jack some of the early answers,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
and I would say probably The Guardian Legend is honestly my favorite NES game of all time as well,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
just because of the hybrid of it.

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
Outside of that, honestly, I know it's really cliche, but I kind of think Super Mario Bros. 2 is one of my favorite NES games,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
just because I just have so many memories of that.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I remember renting that game on New Year's Eve or something,

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
and I played the crap out of that game one New Year's, and played it from start to finish.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
And, God, I love that game so much.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't see how you could play the crap out of a crap-free game.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Fair enough.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
But, I'm going to throw, you want an obscure title?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
This is one of my other favorite NES games.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Make me proud.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Because it was such a hybrid game.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Did you ever play Magic of Scheherazade?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I did.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yes.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Not very much of it. I rented it, but it was like during exams or something.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
It was like a hybrid of Zelda and Final Fantasy, and it was kind of rad.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Now, because it kind of tried to do too much, it kind of had some flaws,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
but when you're like ten years old, you overlook those flaws,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
and you're like, this game's awesome. It has everything.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So, there you go.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Some folks in chat, GameGuru in chat says,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
as for favorites, Super Mario Bros. 3, bar none.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
That was one of my all-time favorites too, and I think for a lot of us.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I remember going to one of my best friends back in the day.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
His name was Devin.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
I went to his house, and we stayed up until like four in the morning

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
playing Super Mario Bros. 3,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and we were doing the whole two-player.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Who doesn't remember playing that with another person,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and you would always fight the other person?

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
My sister and I were just complete bitches to each other over that game.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So, there you go.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Some NES memories from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Again, rest in peace,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
and thank you for all you've done for this industry, Hiroshi Yamauchi.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Thank you.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Let's move on and get into some of our recent gaming memories,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
such as the games that you've been playing this week.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I have to freaking replant one of my stupid perfect pears

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
because the fucking trees die.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You've got real problems, young lady.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I do have real problems. I have mental problems,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
like Reginald and Nedroid, which is still my favorite webcomic.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Anyway, I've been playing Animal Crossing.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I might open my village during the show.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm still thinking about it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
If enough people show interest, I will open my village.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Damn, that got bit by a mosquito.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
So, I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV,

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
and I have finally joined the Twin Adders

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
because, first of all, the flaming people suck.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I hate their stupid privilege 1% country,

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
and I refuse to be a part of their whole...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
In the beta, I was with that nation,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
but I changed it when the 14 came out.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
You screw the Sultana, okay?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
That little bitch does not get any of my money.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm gonna give it to the hippies because...

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Occupy. Occupy Ol' Da.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Just so people kind of understand for Final Fantasy XIV,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
a lot of MMOs historically have had factions,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
and a lot of people break it down to good and evil,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
but it's not always that way.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
For instance, World of Warcraft has the Alliance and the Horde,

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
although the Horde is not necessarily evil or whatever.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Those are the two factions.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
They're just assholes.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Final Fantasy XIV is a faction-free game.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Everybody can talk to each other,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
because usually in WoW, if you play Horde,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
but your friend plays Alliance, you can't talk to each other.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Unless you're through real ID or whatever.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But in Final Fantasy, that doesn't stop you.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
But you will join one of three nations throughout the story.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And you don't even have to.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, technically you don't have to.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And you can switch whenever you want.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
I think those allegiances will come into PvP later on,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
but for right now it only has minor impacts on the story.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
But I hate PvP, so that will never happen.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Right. Well, there's not even PvP in the game yet.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, I still hate it.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
So, I've been playing that.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I've been playing more fractal,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
and I have actually picked up an older game on my phone,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and I've been playing it stupidly obsessively,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
for some stupid reason, because you know me in puzzle games.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I've been playing Bejeweled.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Not even Bejeweled Blitz, I haven't played that yet.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I am playing old-school Bejeweled.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I've been in Diamond Mine mode for like...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It helps me get sleepy at night,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
as I have a lot of trouble sleeping,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
so I play Bejeweled at night.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And, um...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I know I played something else,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
but for the life of me, I can't remember.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You'll think of it later and then shout it out randomly

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
in the middle of his ass.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Yes, I will.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
All right.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Loki, do I even have to ask how many hours

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
you sunk into Grand Theft Auto 5 this week?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I don't remember how many hours I sunk in,

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
but I think it's at least 16, at least.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm almost at the end of the campaign,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and it's great.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I love every second of it, so...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I even got my son to play a little bit of it.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
He's been driving...

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Wait! Wait a minute!

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Wait a minute!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
He likes driving the car.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
You're letting your three-year-old son

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
play Grand Theft Auto 5?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
He's not killing people.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
He's driving back and forth on a beach.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Three-year-olds have no moral compass.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It does not matter.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
No, I just...

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Loki can do what he wants,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
and I know he's not showing the bad parts of the game.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
He's just driving a car.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
You have to admit,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
the initial sentence of you saying,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
yeah, I'm letting my son play Grand Theft Auto 5

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
is kind of funny.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, he doesn't really know how to play.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
All he can really do is just press the gas,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and I have to kind of steer for him,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and he just presses the gas,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and laughs when he hits stuff, like...

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Like people?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
No, like fences.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
You know, not people.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And the people are all fine.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
They just go to the hospital,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
and they come out just fine.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It's like when he asks, like he's all...

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And he even asks,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
he's all, stop hitting that man.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Why'd we take that guy's car?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
So he understands that it's wrong.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm like, it's okay.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
They're just letting us borrow the car.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
It's okay.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I just want to point out, Loki,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
these episodes are recorded.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
They're put on the internet,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and somebody will save them for a very long time.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Exactly, and I took video.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
So it's all good.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm going to upload video.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
So someday, Loki,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
when your son gets busted for street racing,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
all Fast and Furious style in daddy's car,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm going to say,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
do you know why this happened?

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, so I drove my uncle's Trans Am when I was six.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I do have video.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Do I street race?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I have lots of video, actually.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
My brother tried to make me drive his car when I was like 10,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
and I cried.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
When I was six...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
No, he had a Thunderbird.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
It was great, though.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Okay, so I was trying to get some video of him yesterday,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
because he did it yesterday, too.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
He was driving over these hills in the middle of the desert,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and I was like, I'm going camping,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
or we're going to Trader Joe's,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
or I'm driving to Safeway.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Why does the middle of the desert

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
make your son think about Trader Joe's?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
No, that was camping.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
He's just pretending.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
He's driving like a truck.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
He's all, I'm driving the truck to Safeway,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
and stuff like that,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
because that's where we went today.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah, it's completely harmless.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
It's not like we're running through an elderly,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
old folks home or something like that.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
He's not murdering people with a gun.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
He's just driving a car or a bus.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
He thinks it's funny when you can push the Y button

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
to get the guy in and out of the car.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
He thought that was hilarious.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
And then he's like, look, it's turning the wheels.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
WhatupG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
has Loki let him fly a plane yet?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh, God, no, because the reason why is

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
he doesn't know how to even drive the car,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
so flying a plane, it would just be over really fast,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
and he gets frustrated.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
If he hits the wall and he can't figure out how to get around it,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
he just gets frustrated almost immediately.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
He has no patience.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
So yeah, a plane, I thought that'd be fun.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I wanted to give him a boat because it's the ocean.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
He's not going to run into anything out there.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
But he just wanted to drive a car, so let him drive a car.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, away from the stories about your son

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
playing the game for a minute and back to you playing the game,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
what is it about the game that makes it so great

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
that you come through the door of the OLR Studios and go,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Rob, when are you getting Grand Theft Auto V?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Well, first off, you like the sandbox games

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
where you can pretty much do whatever you want,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
and that's this game, and there's a lot of realism to it,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
or I should say immersion to it.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
For example, if I run over some dude or something in the mountains,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
like some hiker, if I just plow over my car,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
later on I may be driving, and I'll hear a news report on the radio

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
saying that a hiker has gone missing.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And then they try to get you back because they know what you did that summer.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And there's all sorts of crazy stuff.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
There's a whole thing that has to do with some hidden letters

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
that you have to collect, and there's actually a ghost

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
up in the mountains and stuff.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
There's all sorts of crazy acid trips that these guys can go on.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Is it really funny, though?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because I will say, I do like sandbox games,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
but part of the reason why I love Saints Row

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
is that it's so over-the-top.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't think I've laughed harder at a video game

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
than I did the opening to Saints Row 3.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, Saints Row is just kind of like,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and even playing both,

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
I think the best analogy I've seen was someone said,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Grand Theft Auto is a parody of reality,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
and Saints Row is a parody of Grand Theft Auto,

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
where you can tell that they went into incredible detail

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
with every single thing in this game

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
as far as the immersion with the internet in the game,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
all the different brands that are parodies of things,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
whereas Saints Row 4 is making a parody of The Matrix.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I mean, come on, dude. The Matrix.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
A 90s movie?

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
They're really cutting edge with their stuff. I don't know.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, Saints Row is a fun game,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
but it's just so...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
When you play both, you're just like,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
man, that's really just basic,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
as far as what they put in there,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and even, like, it feels like the effort

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
was really kind of not there.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I mean, but then again, this game took five years to develop,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
and Saints Row III, probably a lot less than that,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
and Saints Row 4, even less than that, so...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I don't know.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I just like all the detail in the game,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
and the writing's really good.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
The story's really interesting.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
The characters are very interesting,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
especially Trevor's just nuts,

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
and just seeing all the things that go kind of awkward

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and stuff in the game,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
and all the different conflicts that are there,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
it's a really interesting storyline,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
so that's kind of what the draw is, I think.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
What's next for Grand Theft Auto with the online component?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We were talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
but just to kind of retouch on it a little bit,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
what do people have to look forward to in a couple weeks

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
when the online part opens up?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Well, first off, they said, I think there's supposed to be

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
about 700 missions in the game,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
so you're gonna be able to pull heists

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and do robberies and all sorts of stuff

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
on top of normal death matches and races

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
and that kind of thing.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Plus, there's gonna be editors in the game

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
to make your own custom content,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
so you can make custom death match maps,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
you can make custom races,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
and that's just the beginning.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
They're eventually gonna get it to where you can do

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
custom missions and all other game types.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And then, on top of that, they've built the game

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
in a way that it's just gonna keep expanding

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
beyond Grand Theft Auto 5.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
You're not just gonna be stuck in San Andreas,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
they're gonna have it where you can,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
they can basically increase the size of the map

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
and add new cities and areas as time goes on.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
So, it's just gonna keep building from there,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
and it sounds exciting.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Plus, getting to play with people again,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
because, you know, it's hard to find people

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
for Grand Theft Auto 4 nowadays.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And you're on both 360 and PlayStation 3?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, and I'm kind of hoping that they both tie together.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Do you have one of those little squads

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I see people advertising on Twitter?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I do have a crew available.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I will link it in the chatroom.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
It's the VOG Network crew,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and I'm trying to remember,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
the first thing you probably want to do

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
is get a membership, if you don't have it already,

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
to the Rockstar Social Club,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
which you can go to.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
It's socialclub.rockstargames.com.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And so, if you have a membership there,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
you know, cool.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
If not, create one.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And then you can look for, I think,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
well, my name on there is Loki O-L-R,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
or I want to say you can search

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
by the name of the crew as well,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
which would be VOG Network,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
and then our little tag,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
since you have it had the four letters,

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
is VOG N, so.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Okay, awesome.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah, so I'm actually trying to see real quick here,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
if I can probably link it.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I'll link it on,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
I had it linked on Twitter at one time,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
but I'll link it again,

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
so we can add everybody before it launches.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
And I'm sure if it's anything like it has been

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
with the Social Club stuff so far,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
it may be a little downsy by the time it launches,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
because they've been having little server issues,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
as with anything.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Uh-oh, all right.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Any other games besides Grand Theft Auto

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
you want to talk about?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Nope.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
All right, then my gaming week,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
pretty similar to Loki,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I've been focused on mainly one game,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
and that game is Final Fantasy XIV,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
which I've talked about ad nauseam in previous weeks,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
so I won't really get into too much detail.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
I will just say I'm a level 45 white mage,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
so I'm getting a little closer to end game

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
and all the AK runs and Efreet hard mode and all that.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I do love how they wound the story into this game, though,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I will say that much.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
You know, the story really kind of keeps you going,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
and it's really interesting the way they did that,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
where not a lot of MMOs have been able to kind of

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
make those big grandiose cut scenes

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
the way Final Fantasy does

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
that makes you really want to watch, you know,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
when I was playing World of Warcraft,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I skipped most things,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
unless it was a big cinematic,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I'd watch those or something else, you know,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
but the Final Fantasy cut scenes are so engaging,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
it really kind of keeps me like, oh.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
For the record, the same thing works again.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Oh, with the screenshots?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah, so you can do screenshots during cinematics.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Oh, cool.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
And is it just me or is Thancred like sort of like

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
make you think of Tidus?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
A little bit.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Don't they have similar voice actors?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
No, he has the voice actor of both here, doesn't he?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I think.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
But it was sort of interesting hearing Fenris' voice

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
coming out of the Elvin guy.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
So I haven't heard a lot of the voice acting

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
because I'm on Skype a lot when I play the game with friends.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So we're just chatting through it.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
So, yeah, I'll have to do some more live stream of it later.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
It's just my frame rate really suffers

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
unless I can like get on the PlayStation 3

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
and get one of those boxes that streams or something.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Anyhow, I will say outside of Final Fantasy XIV,

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
I sort of discovered a renaissance this week for pinball games.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
And I think a lot of that is because PlayStation Plus right now

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
is giving away Star Wars pinball with the Plus.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So I downloaded that and I was checking out those tables.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
And I really like the Episode 5 table in particular.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Don't really care for the Boba Fett table.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
The clones table is pretty good too.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So I was enjoying playing those tables.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
And then it made me realize like why did I never get Zen Pinball 2 on PlayStation?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
And then I realized that was free too.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
And I had tables from one that imported.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So it's like I already had like all these tables to play in Zen Pinball 2.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
So I checked that out and it came with the Vita version.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
All of it did because, you know, they have that whole cross thing.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So I actually had a reason to play my Vita.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And I was playing Zen Pinball on the Vita.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
And I got to say love, love, love that you can rotate the Vita

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
so that it's a vertical screen.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
And so you have the vertical play field like you expect a pinball game to be, right?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
That's nothing new.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And you use the touch screen. I know it's not new.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
The WonderSwan did that.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
I know it's not new, but okay, how long ago was the WonderSwan

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
and do we ever have it in America?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
The PSP did that.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
You know I'm giving you crap.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But the PSP wasn't giving me these games free either.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
And the PSP did not have the touch screen on the front.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So the cool thing about the Vita is you just tap the touch screen.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Left side is left flipper, right side is right flipper.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
And then you kind of drag down to do the bumper.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
It makes a lot of sense.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
So it's a nice little time waster in that regard.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
So yeah, if you have PlayStation Plus and you have a Vita

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
and you like pinball, I don't know why you're not getting this game.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
You should really think about doing that

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
because it's a great little time waster on the Vita.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
And I did find the link for the crew thing.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It is just VOG Network.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
So socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And that's how you get to it.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
We already have nine people.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And once we get more people,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
I'll start divvying up where people are

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
because you can actually have a hierarchy of players and stuff.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Well, I will briefly mention

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
where a lot of the VOG people are playing Final Fantasy XIV

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
since I know you've got your game and I've got mine.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
We are on the Midgarcimer server,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
and our free company is called End of Line.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
We have 45 characters in our thing right now.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
To be fair, a lot of it is like friends of friends.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
It's not just exclusively people that listen to VOG stuff.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
But it's a good group of people.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And yeah, you can check that out.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
All the information is at vognetwork.com

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
in the Hoard House forums

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
because technically Hoard House is my show about online games.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
So everything you need to know is in the Hoard House forums

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
at vognetwork.com.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And you should probably post the Grand Theft Auto stuff

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
to the OLR forum.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah, I was going to at some point. I need to create a logo.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Oh, okay.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Well, you know you have a graphic designer right here.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Well, no, they have a little app thing in there.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So I have to create a logo.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I just haven't done it yet.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Well, I think that's enough of our gaming week.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Housekeeping, I'll just quickly say, don't forget,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
we're on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And we are on Facebook.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Alright, enough talk. We've done a lot of reminiscing about old gaming

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and new gaming. Let's get into gaming news

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and what is going on in the industry this week.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Loki.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Val's going to announce something tomorrow.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It's probably going to have something to do with the Steam Box

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
since they were talking or

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Gabe was teasing something about

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
a Linux. Well,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
the Steam Box actually last week, so

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I think that's what it is.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And it's going to

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
be announced 10 a.m.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Pacific time tomorrow.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Which is sad because

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
by the time most people hear this

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
because obviously we have our live audience

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
but the podcast people will already

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
know what this news is.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
At least the first of the three announcements.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
There's three announcements.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
There's Circle. Circle in brackets.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And Circle plus Circle.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Obviously, we are having

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
a lot of fun with this on Bobby's show tonight.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
A lot of folks going

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
three things. Half-Life

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
3. Have you ever noticed

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
like, I don't know, I'm sure someone's noticed this before

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
but like the Half-Life logo and stuff

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
looks like a stick figure arm holding a crowbar.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I never

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
really thought of that.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It's kind of funny. It actually does look like

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
a stick figure holding up a crowbar. So speculation

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
just rampant wank speculation on what these

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
announcements could be. I think

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
more information on the Steam Box is a given.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And I'm going to repeat

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
some of the things I said on the call on Bobby's show

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
because it's my guess and that hasn't changed

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
in 15 minutes or however long it's been.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I think Half-Life

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
3 is not the announcement. I think

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Left 4 Dead 3 is going to be the announcement.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I think that's, you know, they will be

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
hyping up towards a third game in

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
a series but it's going to be Left 4 Dead 3. Which is not

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
bad news. You know, it's been

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
a few years since Left 4 Dead 2. I can see them doing

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
you know, Steam Box

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Left 4 Dead 3 troll

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
announcement and then, you know,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Half-Life 3. No, I kind of think

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the other announcement, you know, Dota 2

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
is so huge for Valve right

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
now, especially internationally.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I kind of think one of the big 3 announcements

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
has to be about Dota and

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I would think maybe if they

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
announce the Steam Box, maybe there's some way that

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Dota interface, like I think they're going to try

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
to get Dota 2 in your living room.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
So maybe like, controller

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
support for Dota or something along those lines.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
That's cool but at the same

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
time, the announcement

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
of Half-Life 3 could really throw a

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
monkey wrench into like next gen, you

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
know, consoles and stuff like that

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and the people's needs for that

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
stuff. I'm interested in Steam Box, I mean

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
depending on what the specs are and what

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
it's able to run, I mean, because I do have my

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
laptop so I don't

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
necessarily need another gaming PC

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
although my first gaming

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
PC has kind of fallen

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
apart, so maybe I do need

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
a new gaming PC.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Rob Roberts, what if

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Portal 3 is the announcement? You know,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I just,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
because Valve is so allergic to the

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
number 3, I don't want to say I'd be

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
disappointed if Portal 3 is the announcement, quite

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
no, but I would be kind of

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
surprised that that's the game they're

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
so quick to go back and visit again.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I just would be a little bit surprised. What if it's Left

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
for Dead 3, Portal 3, and

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Half-Life 3? I think

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
a lot of the internet would probably poop their

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
pants, and rightfully so. I think

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
that would be a lot of great news. Three things about

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
three,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
you know, there's also the possibility, though,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
that Valve is doing something we haven't

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
heard of yet, a completely new IP

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
and I think that would be okay too.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
So, yeah, Circle, or

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Bracket Circle, and Bracket

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Circle, and Bracket plus Bracket, or

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Circle plus Circle.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Well, Circle plus Circle, that

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
sounds like Portal to me. Gosh, you're talking

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
about Hollywood squares all of a sudden, Circle

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
gets the square. Alright,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
um, alright.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Portal 3, I

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
just, it would have to be a different

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
test subject.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
So now my brain is thinking around all of that.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Well, you know, I will say this,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
speaking of Dota, which I brought up

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
a minute ago, there's a video circulating

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
where they're gonna have a, or it might be out now,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
the GLaDOS Announcer Pack for Dota 2,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
and it's hilarious.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I know I linked it on my Twitter earlier this week.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
It's Oda, the DS Silent.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
They had

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
some hilarious, well god, what

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
was one of the lines, I should try to find it on my

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Twitter real quick, because one of the whole, like,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
welcome to Dota things was so

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
funny. Um,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
oh gosh, I'm gonna try and find this real quick.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Anything else you wanted to say about Portal 3,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Dark Soccer, while I try to dig this up?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Um, no, other than, it was pretty

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
cool hearing her in Pacific Rim.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Oh yeah?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, they actually did the

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
modulation effect without the flanging,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
so it was sort of interesting.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Okay, I found it, I found what I was looking for.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Zanes, welcome to Dota.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Don't forget your little plastic

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
sword, and all your chins.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Little bit of shade from GLaDOS there.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I love that, play it again.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Play it again? Alright.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I love her, she's such a sassy bitch.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Don't forget your plastic sword and all your chins.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Here we go, one more time.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Zanes, welcome to Dota.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Don't forget your little plastic sword,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and all your chins.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
This video is like 21 minutes of GLaDOS now,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
so there's more.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And your giant flagon of gravy, welcome to

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Medieval Times.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
How many in your party tonight?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I love it.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
That would make me play the game.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Doesn't that make you want to play Dota 2?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Just for that sassy bitch.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
By the way, I have to sort of

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
derail a little bit. Did you see the person

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
cosplaying GLaDOS?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
There was

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
video and pictures up of this girl.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
A lot of people cosplay GLaDOS, but yes.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
No, no, not doing the

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
whole anthropomorphic version.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Hanging from a harness.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
With a mask

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
and everything.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
And moving around and everything

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
and doing the voice and all that.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
That was cool.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Some folks in chat

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
are, as far as the 3s go,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I see GameGuru says

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Team Fortress 3

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
could be a possibility.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
But Act F follows that up saying,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't see Valve making a Team Fortress 3 anytime soon.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It does seem like they are still adding

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
every day to Team Fortress 2.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
It would seem a little

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
soon for a 3.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
More hats. More tie-ins to other

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
products, more like.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Alright, well moving on to another company.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I want to talk a little bit about what Microsoft

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
talked about this week. They were

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
at Tokyo Game Show, believe it or not, showing off

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
some things going on there. One of the

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
things that was talked about though, that unfortunately

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
yet another perceived negative

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
for Microsoft's system

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
was in a quote from Albert

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Pinello, who's the Senior Director of Product

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Management. Quote, We don't support

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
vertical orientation. Do it

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
at your own risk. It wouldn't be

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
a cooling problem. We just didn't design the

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
drive for vertical. Because it's a slot

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
loading drive, we just didn't design it

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
for both. I don't think this is a big

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
deal whatsoever. I only

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
bring it up because I saw it all over

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Twitter and Facebook and

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
so people are talking about this, but I

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I'm going to be honest,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I kind of think if you're out there

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
going, oh my god, Microsoft

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
fucks up again, you can't have your thing vertical,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
I kind of think you're looking for

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
a reason to dump on Microsoft at this point.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't think it's that big a deal.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's not going to throw off the feng shui

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
of your living room cabinet or something.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Well, it's the size of a cable box anyways.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Stack your cable box. But I'm just saying

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
and who cares, so it doesn't

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
doesn't

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
stand up or whatever.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
The whole thing is because idiots before

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
kept knocking it over and they had a whole issue

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
with that. Blaming it on the slot

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
loading disk drive is kind of dumb.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I would just say it's because you guys are fucking idiots

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and you keep knocking that shit over. I mean, look at

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the 360. You guys

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
doesn't the Wii have a slot drive

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
and most people put that vertically? The Wii has a slot

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
drive. The PlayStation 4 has a slot drive.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But the Wii also has that little

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
cradle so it's a little harder to knock it over.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Yeah, but you know,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
plastic is expensive. I know. And I think

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
that thing probably weighs a metric ton

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
so, you know. But I just, I don't

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I don't know. I mean, there are some people that are

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
legitimately like, I like to have my consoles

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
vertical, blah blah blah. The Xbox One is

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
about the size of an original Xbox

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Duke controller so

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
it's, I can see why.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
But yeah, I mean, come on. It looks

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
like it'd be very unstable standing up

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
sideways. If you want to stand

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
it up sideways, um, you know

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
assuming that it still would work

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
that way, um, I'm

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
sure that there would be a third party solution to

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
like, brace that thing up so that it

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
doesn't fall over. But, I mean, come

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
on. It's just, they just don't want you to

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
knock it off your shelf. Remember

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
cats are evil. They will knock that shit over.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Especially if you're not- No, they'll throw up on your rug.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Well, both. They will do both.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
They will knock it over, then they'll throw up on it and on

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
your rug. Well, another interesting

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
quote from Mr. Pinello, uh, quote,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
we found, interestingly enough, that 80%

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
of people, believe it or not, have their

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Xbox 360 horizontally.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I will have you know that I'm not part of

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
the 80%. I have vertical

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
all the way. Unless it's near my cat, in which

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
case it's horizontal.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I have my 360 horizontal.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Most of my consoles go horizontal.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
The only one that didn't was the Wii.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And that's because I sort of got

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
the perception that that was designed to go vertical.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
But Wii U doesn't go vertical, if I

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
remember right. Right? It's like rounded

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
on the edges. You can't stand that thing.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Yes you can. Well,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
with putty. You really shouldn't stand

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
it up. You can make a stand.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Alright, now you're making a good challenge.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Well, I'm sure it's like they're saying here

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
about the Xbox One. Do it at your own

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
risk. Throw your

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Wii U down a flight of stairs and set it on

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
fire for all we care. You know what, mine's actually

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
horizontal.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Just because of how our- you've seen the shelves in

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
my house. That's how they're- and then the

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
cat sits on it.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Alright.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Ziba in chat says

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
mine is vertical too, so

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
let's see. Tigerclaw says

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I remember when the PlayStation 1 had

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
trouble reading discs and the only fix

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
putting it upside down.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
That's right, I remember that too. Oh yes. And then

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
no, no, no, no. There was the other fix.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Sideways. Mhm. When you

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
did have to hold that thing

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
vertically.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I remember people would use

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
paper clips or something to hold the

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
door open, basically.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
That was for the swap trick. Oh, my bad.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Yeah. Back

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
in the day. Spring.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Spring.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Oh, no, no, no. We did it old school.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
We had the paperclip. We figured

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
out the right way to bend the paperclip so that

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
we could just go fump. I remember when you

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
got me that little cartridge that plugged into

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
the back of the PlayStation 1. Yes, we ordered like, what, 50 of them?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Not 50, but we ordered a bunch of them.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Those things were awesome, and I never had

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
a problem playing import games after that. Yeah.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Those things were awesome. Anyhow, moving on.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Oh, yeah. It's my turn, isn't it?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Mhm. You know what? Put down the

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Animal Crossing and get to the story. I'm busy

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
chatting with people. You're busy trying to

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
navigate the new iOS 7 over there, I see.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
God, actually, yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
So, um,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
this is slightly old news. It came out

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
toward the beginning of the week, but

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Blizzard is going to be closing down

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Diablo 3's Auction House, and that's going to

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
happen on March 18th next year.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Um, their

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
actual statement saying

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
that, and I'm quoting, it became increasingly

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
clear that despite the benefits of the

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Auction House system, and the fact that

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
many players around the world use it, it

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
kill monsters and get cool loot.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
decided to remove the gold and real money

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Auction House system from Diablo 3.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Bravo.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So that means

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
it's, does that still need to be connected

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
online? Because, you know, people are

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
jumping to that conclusion that that

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
will be the next thing that happens, but we

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
don't know for sure, but that was the

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
crutch that they were, that was

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
why it had to be online, was to preserve

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
the integrity of the Auction House. So

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
now we just don't know.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
But it would be logical

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that in a later patch, they're going

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
to say, you know, we're going to patch

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
out the always online requirement.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
That would be great. Then I'd play it again.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I wonder if that wouldn't be a quiet thing, or maybe

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
they'll do it under LAN play. I think

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
that would be huge if they were to do a patch

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
that not only removes the Auction House, but

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
then does LAN play without battle net.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I mean, that would be huge. But,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I don't know. Could they, like, add

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
because remember, you know, before, like, with

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Starcraft 2 and stuff, well, Starcraft

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
2 I don't think had LAN play anyways, but

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
couldn't they do, like, some sort of

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
competitive thing then with

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Diablo 3? Well, they were talking

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
about doing PvP, and there technically

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
is, like, an arena, but it's really

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
bare bones. It's not a

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
fancy PvP system like what you'd see in Warcraft

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
or anything. Well, they're also saying something

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
else, too. I'm going to read this quote.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
We feel that this move, along with the Loot 2.0

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
system being developed concurrently with

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Reaper of Souls, will result

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
in much more rewarding game experience

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
for our players. So,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I think that

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
they're looking to change quite a few things

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
about the way it plays. There's definitely kind of

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
a soft reboot of the game happening here.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
It might be enough to make me play it again.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Well, a lot of folks were really

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
excited about the console versions because

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
well, in fact, some of the reviews of the

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
console versions, the PS3 and 360, say

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
it is the definitive version of Diablo 3.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Weren't you saying you wanted to get it? Well, yeah.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week because

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
it was only a demo, but I did play the Diablo 3

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
demo on PlayStation, which is out there

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
you can download. It's

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
weird for me because I

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
did play Diablo 3 the whole way

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
through. I beat it. I played enough of it.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's really weird to go from

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Clicky Fest to

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
aiming because you don't

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
have a mouse. So, you aim

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
and it locks on to monsters.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
It's just a different way of playing the

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
same game. It's really weird.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
But I liked it, but it is just really

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
different. And the inventory system is completely different

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
too. I mean, they really had to change

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
everything to support the controller. Now,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
what if they had a controller

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
version for the PC?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Like, would

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
you still keep playing on PC if you could

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
do it with a controller?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
No, at this point I prefer

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
the mouse because that's just the way I played

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
the game and I think it is a different balance

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
between controller and mouse. I don't

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
see them mixing those. I don't think

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
they're going to mix the console version

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
with the PC version. But

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I am interested enough in the console

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
version. My problem is that $60 price

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
tag when I already have the game

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
on PC no matter if I got it for

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
free or what have you.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You're not quite the target

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
audience.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Audience. I'm not. Since you already

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
own the PC version. You're right. I'm not the target

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
audience. But I will say this. I'm

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
very interested in PlayStation 4

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
version. Hopefully the

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
inevitable price cut

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
three months after it's out version. So, how does it look

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
visually compared to the PC version considering

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
that they're going to have a PlayStation 4 version? I

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
can't imagine that you'd be able to improve

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
The resolution is not quite as

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
crisp to me as it is on

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
PC. I even see that

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
And I think a lot of that just depends on what video

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
card you're packing. I saw it a lot in Final Fantasy

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
14 looking at the videos.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Because I found

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
some high res play through

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
videos from the PS3.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
And compared with my

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
but I have my maxed all the way.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And it looks amazing.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
So, I mean it doesn't look bad by any means.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
You have to get really nitpicky. But I would

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
see where they could probably make some graphical

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
improvements on PlayStation 4.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
So I'll be checking that out

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
later. But I'm happy to hear about the removal

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
of the auction house. Just that you know I don't

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I don't think that many people were using it

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
to be honest. No. I'm totally

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
with that. Yeah.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Alright. Let's move on. Loki.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Alright. So let's talk

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
a little bit about

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Blizzard again. And this

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
kind of ties in with

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I think we were talking about it a few weeks ago.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Where they were

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Vampity was trying to kind of

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
separate themselves from

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Activision Blizzard and kind of

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
drum up some money I guess

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
by selling their shares and that kind of stuff.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
However

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
that's been kind of halted because

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
there's a lawsuit

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
taking place in Delaware.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Apparently I guess

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
one of the

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
some of the shareholders didn't like the idea.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I think they said basically the shareholder

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
has sued the company to prevent

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
this from happening claiming that

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
it's a huge waste and meant to

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
cover a power grab.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And so because of that

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
the court actually

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
halted it right now and

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
basically in order for it to continue they have to

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
appeal and get a majority

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
vote from the non-Vivendi

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
stockholders.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
So

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
interesting that that kind of happened.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Now I'm not really sure as far as

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
like a power

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
power grab

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
thing is supposed to be. I don't understand their

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
angle there with that.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I'm not sure I see it either and I kind of don't think this is going to go much

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
of anywhere.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It is interesting to bring this up immediately

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
after that previous story because some are

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
speculating tinfoil hat

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
that the removal of the

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Diablo 3 auction house is directly tied to the fact

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
they're not with Vivendi anymore.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
That now that they're a little more

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
independent per se that they dropped

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
it even though they are still part of Activision

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
but maybe Vivendi was the real

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
problem. Yeah see that's what

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I thought with like the kind of go

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
completely different game different company

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
with Deep Silver

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
or I should say THQ and Saints Row

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
that's why I thought with all the DLC

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
hoaring that oh it was THQ making

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
the Volition do that kind of shit.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And then Saints Row 4 came

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
out and they hoard the DLC just as much

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
so I

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
was proven wrong there so who knows.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Although you have to admit

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
that free

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
GAT 5 DLC

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
on Tuesday was brilliant.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
It's not brilliant. It seriously

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
is not. No

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I understand the joke. I understand the joke.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah haha it's funny you know

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Gap 5

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and we're going to confuse people with the hashtag

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and oh it's going to be hilarious and stuff

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and then the game sells 800 million

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
dollars worth and then they

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
kind of quiet and go into a corner

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
because you know

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
it's just

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
cool. Yeah it's

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
fun to poke fun at Grand Theft Auto

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
because your game

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
started off as kind of a clone of it and

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
the problem is

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
they have these little DLC packs and yeah I

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
understand it's free for a day and I did download it because

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
it's free. I'm not going to pass up some of them for free.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
It's just

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
$2.99 here

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
$2.99 there $2.99 there for all

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
stuff that's already in the game

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and just being unlocked.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Come on I mean and

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I'm really waiting to see what the first DLC pack

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
was because if it's anything as far as

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
like sparse in content

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
like it was with the third

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I'm just I may be done with the series

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
just because I don't like that

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
kind of practice where it's just

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
we're just not we're going to totally

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
just drop the ball and not give a shit and

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
push stuff out really fast and try to make a quick buck

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
because it shows.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Alright well

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
moving on let's go to another story

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
you know Grand Theft Auto 5

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and Saints Row 4 will not be

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
on this console but maybe later we'll

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
see and the PlayStation 4

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
of course is out in a couple weeks

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
and some live streamers you know

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
the people that do Twitch TV as we've

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
all done in the past and what have you

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
were a little bit

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
concerned that the PlayStation 4

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
may not really allow you to live

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
stream the way you want to

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
now I'm not talking about the built in

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
live streaming but remember we heard that

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
prior that some

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
companies may actually be able to

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
not have you live stream certain parts

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
of the game or whatever we don't know

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
how that functionality is going to be limited

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
so some people want to handle it their way

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
and actually have the PlayStation

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
4 through HDMI their capture box

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
but there was a concern that would not

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
work because on the PlayStation

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
3 you can't do that right

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
now you can't capture through HDMI

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
unless you you know do some nefarious

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
you know it's component

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
to HDMI yeah a lot of folks do

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
component cables instead and capture that way

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
and stream that way yeah because that's what I have

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
to do with my Elgato you have to

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
they have a special adapter

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
that you plug in well live streamers

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
around the world I'm sure happy to hear this week

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Brad Douglas who's the head of third party

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
relations at Sony said

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
the PlayStation 4 will support

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
video capture via HDMI

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
now my

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
question is I

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
always thought it was the Blu-rays

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
fault that a lot of this was blocked

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
on the PlayStation 3 so

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
have they figured out a way on the PlayStation 4

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
to enable the encoding when

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
it's in Blu-ray mode because I would think

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
that's a given I would think that even though this news

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
is out there they've got to

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
not allow you to put the Blu-rays up it's too easy

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
they probably found a way to

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
turn on and off the HD

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
encryption thing

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
so my real question building on that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
and yes I'm being tinfoil hat again

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
but if they can turn it on and off

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
it will what's to say this is going to be

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
any different from the built in twitch streaming

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
at the end of the day

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
what do you mean

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
you know if they can turn it off and on won't they

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
be able to turn it off you know when they

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
want like let's say a developer doesn't want the ending of

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
the game broadcast can't they shut it off

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
maybe

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I guess it's possible

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
so also important

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
to put out there one of the big reasons why

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
people want to do their own HDMI grabs

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
it's for I guess I shouldn't really say

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
it's more the twitch TV people but a lot

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
of the YouTube people who want to record

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
a gigantic amount of footage

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
and then edit through it later on

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
that's the real asset

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
there to being able to do the HDMI

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
just to be clear it's both

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
a win for live streamers and

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
live to tape

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
streamers

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
did you see the stupid announcement

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
that they did earlier this week it was

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
about like

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
yeah you'll be able to hook up your PlayStation 4

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
to your Xbox One's

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
HDMI in I'm like dude you can hook anything

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
up to it cause it has HDMI in

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
if it has HDMI out you're gonna hook it up

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
it's not gonna go oh no no no

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
sorry that's a PlayStation 4 we gonna play nice

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
with them I mean they're not gonna

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
do that it's a fucking HDMI in

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
that's like saying hey I just learned that

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I can plug my PlayStation 4 into the wall

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
yes actually if you

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
put a PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Nedry will come up on the screen and go

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
ah ah ah you didn't say

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
the magic word ah ah ah

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
that reference straight out

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
of 1994 y'all look it

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
up hey to be fair they did a

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
3D re-release not too long ago so

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
it is somewhat rare okay okay fair

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
enough and there's gonna be a fourth movie

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
as long as we don't have any fucking

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
gymnastic people in that I mean

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
it's gonna be all good

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I wanna see them go a little ridiculous with that

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I want like you know raptors in trench coats

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
and stuff and they're like oh clever girl

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
obviously we're talking about Jurassic Park

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
so obviously we blew the cover on that I gotta say

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
though Jurassic Park 4

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I wanted to either be like really good like the first

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
one was which is I enjoyed the first movie say what

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you will but at the time you know when I was in high

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
school and that came out that movie was awesome right

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
or I wanted to be like over the top

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
show girls bad

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
but you know what

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
3 was pretty bad you know what though

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm thinking with the technology today

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
we can have it both and you know why

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
that's because you have Jurassic Park 4

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
and say that'll be a great movie or something

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
let's just hope that is a great movie and then you have

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Asylum putting out like

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Cretaceous

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Part 5 or something like that

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
that'll be fucking terrible

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
okay good point good point

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
or the sci-fi movie you know

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Dinosaur Hurricane you know

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I don't know

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
actdeft in chat piggybacking on this

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
whole not the Jurassic Park part but the whole like

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Sony Playstation 4 on an Xbox

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
one actdeft in chat says what's

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
next Sony making computers with

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Windows in them oh my

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
gosh oh my

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
gosh or Sony developing

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
apps for Microsoft Windows

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
no shame

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
alright let's move

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
on Dark Soccer you got a story and then release

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
states I might

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
so um

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I hate mobile sites so much

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I'm telling you Chrome

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
you can do the desktop sites on Chrome

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
yeah but I'm opening the links out of email

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
well

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
that's your problem

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
well it's going to be everyone's problem because the stupid thing doesn't want to load

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
can't you change your default browser

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
oh wait I'm sorry it's iOS

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
actually I think

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
you can in the new one can't you

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I could be wrong I don't know

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
there we go

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
have you played with iOS 7 Loki?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
fuck no I haven't updated my

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
iPod is seriously like I don't even

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
know if iOS 7 supports my iPod

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I have an iPod touch 4 and I think

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
they said ah fuck you

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
ah fuck you

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
sorry Jimmy I was trying to buy you time

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
thank you well we did tease

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
this at the start of the show

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
and um we've talked about

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
before about the state of Atlas that they

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
filed for bankruptcy

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
their debt was

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
2.45 billion yen

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
which is quite a bit of money

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and so um

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
the company that's come out

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
on top for the purchase

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
is Sega Sammy

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
or I just like to say

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Sega because we all know who's

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
wearing the pants in that relationship

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
or as we all like to say growing up Sega

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Sega pretty good

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
that they bought somebody because they don't have

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
anything fucking coming out

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
nothing Sega needs to buy their building

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
back in San Francisco like

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
they're the one company that sends me updates

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
to their release calendar like

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
every week on the ball you know

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
on Friday every week

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
and there's always no changes have

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
been made no changes have been made

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
nothing is coming out

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
well at any rate it came

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
out on Nikkei that

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
they are going to be acquiring

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
the whole thing for a 14

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
for 14 billion

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
yen which is

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
roughly 141 million dollars

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
to purchase the

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
company

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
so this

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
probably means that

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
we might see

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
them continuing with the

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Shin Megami Tensei games

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
that's a given

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
but I can't wait for the crossovers

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
with other Sega games

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
you know when there's the inevitable Sega

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
racing

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
with Danica Patrick and the cast of Persona 5

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
that would be so weird

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
so

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Technus in chat says

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Sega Atlas

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and 5th Dream says Atlas Sega

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
but anyway the company itself hasn't made

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
the announcement on it yet

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
but it is public on Nikkei

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
so take it for what you will

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
some folks

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
disappointed

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I don't know how to really use that word

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
in this context but some folks

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
were disappointed slash surprised

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
slash I don't know that it wasn't Nintendo

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
who bought Atlas

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
thinking that Nintendo might want to grab

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Persona as an exclusive for the Wii U

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and DS and so forth

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
would have been a pretty big

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
thing so any thoughts on

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
that why maybe Nintendo didn't decide

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
to do it? I think Nintendo's got

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
their own thing going on

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
you know I think they're looking

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
if they're going to purchase a company

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
my thought is that they would purchase one that has

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
a little bit more that would

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
work with them and given

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
that Nintendo's already been working with Sega

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
it doesn't

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
mean that we're going to see any fewer

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Atlas games come out on

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
on

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Brain Fart

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
on Nintendo systems

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I think also it's just that they don't

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
sell a lot of copies

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
people recognize it and

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
it's definitely a series that a lot of

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
hardcore gamers are into and I

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
mean they have a lot of series that hardcore gamers

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
are into but their best selling game

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
is just kind of moderate selling

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
for any other company that's the thing

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and I think to

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
buy the company for a lot

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
of money doesn't make any sense because you're

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
not going to make your money back very fast

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
so that's probably

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
why and I mean if you think

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
about it it's not going to make anything

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
really exclusive because

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
most of the games come out in 3DS and stuff

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
anyways PlayStation 3

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
occasionally but I don't think

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I don't know maybe it would

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you know

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
coax them into making more

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
games for the Wii U or a game

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
for the Wii U because they don't have any

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
so I don't know

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Alright well let's travel around the world and check out some

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
release dates

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Okay so in the

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
US there's a few games coming out

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
they have this Batman Arkham

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
bundle which is you know the last two Batman

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Arkham games, Arkham City and

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Arkham Asylum

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 on

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
DS and 3DS

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Did that movie necessitate a sequel?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Apparently from a small company

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
called Game Mill, yes it did

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
so you know movie tying games

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
do well in 3DS

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Provolution Soccer 2014

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and of course not to be left out

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
FIFA 14 on PlayStation 3

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and Xbox 360 and Vita

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
well technically it's FIFA 12

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
but you know they've reskinned it

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
a few times so FIFA 14

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
totally brand new addition

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000

Wii U and 3DS

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
and last but not least

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
if you are looking

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
or I should say two

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
together and look at some release dates there?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
ni Kawaii Wakazanai

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I can't believe my sister is that cute

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
that was a funny anime

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
so that well if you want

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
there's the HD complete box version of that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
which I imagine the anime included

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The anime is basically this guy

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
who's little sister likes to play dating sims

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
but the ones in particular that she likes

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
are big brother little sister dating sims

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
That sounds awkward

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It is but it is hilarious

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I'm also quite like I'm just blown away

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
for a minute by the fact that you understood me

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
speaking Japanese

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I'm getting a little like wow

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I always thought it was the big joke that I can't

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
pronounce any of these names but

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Well it was certain things

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
certain parts of the

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Well the moment you said Ore no Imouto

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I was like oh god is he gonna say

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and then the moment you said Kawaii

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I was like oh yeah that's it

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Fair enough

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Painkiller Hell and Damnation

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That sounds like a Loki kind of game there

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
These are all still Playstation 3

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and all on September 26

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Ruha Tomo Wo Yobo

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
in regular and limited

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Shutsugeki Otometashi no Senjou 2

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's a price reduction however

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
so don't get too excited about that

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
On the Xbox 360 far less to look forward to

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Armored Core Verdict Day

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and Painkiller Hell and Damnation

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
come out there

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm trying to see if Painkiller is a

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
riff on a franchise we have here

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I don't recognize this

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's a game that came out a while ago on PC

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Painkiller Hell and Damnation

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
also came out as well

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It's a really hard game

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
like first person shooter in hell

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
and you have all sorts of crazy weapons and stuff

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
but yeah

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It's also out here

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
on Playstation 3

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
at some point as well

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Alright we're going to the Playstation Vita

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
DJ Max Technocatoon gets a price reduction

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
in Japan that's the Japanese version

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
those of you interested in importing it though

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000

things like

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
stickers for the Vita and those types of things

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
to celebrate the release of that game

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
On the Wii U this week

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000

like a new price version out this week

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000

there's no game just stickers

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
how about the UK Loki

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Loki?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I don't look like her I'm sorry

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
geez Rob

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
that's it

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
alright just a couple more stories for you guys

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and then the classic game of the week

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Loki? alright so let's

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
talk about some Nintendo announcements

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
here they're bringing

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Wii Sports back

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
as part of Wii Sports Club

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
it's Wii Sports

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
in HD

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
let me pause

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
for a second and let that sink

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
in because I don't really see how HD's

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
going to improve this but sure why not

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
anyways so they're going to have Wii Sports

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
which is not a bad thing because people play

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Nintendo for Wii Sports nowadays

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and it's coming to the

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
eShop on November 7th

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and they're going to start

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
with a few games so they're

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
going to start with boxing

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
was it actually I'm sorry

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
bowling, tennis, and baseball and boxing

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
golf starting off with tennis and bowling

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and then boxing

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
baseball and golf are going to be coming later on

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
they're going to feature enhanced controls

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
with Wii Motion Plus

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
so probably just the versions that are from Wii

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Sports Resort and

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
online multiplayer

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
versus mode

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
that's pretty cool

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Nintendo's going online

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
with something that's always exciting because it never

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
fucking happens

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
it says it'll allow players to register and create

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
state or regional clubs

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
so people will be able to play casually

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
against members of

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
their own club or take on rival clubs

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and then Wii Sports

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Club I guess they have

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
this weird thing that you can do as well

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
if you don't want to buy the games outright

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
they can 24 hour period

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
to try the games

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
that are available after the trial

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
there's a day pass available for

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
$1.99 or permanent purchase

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
for $10

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
per individual sport

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
it's a little high

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
if you ask me

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
it's what, five games?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
yeah I mean when you consider that no one plays

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
baseball and no one really plays

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
well but I kind of like that

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
that let's be real I only want

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
the tennis and the bowling as I'm sure a lot

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
there's a few people who want the others but I only want the

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
tennis and the bowling and those are the ones I want to

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
play online so that's kind of nice that I

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
can only buy those

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and it's really

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
fascinating to me that they are

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
basically opening up the idea of

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
you know people

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
only really play these games when other people

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
are over and they're having a party

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
so they're basically building in a rental system

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
on demand where it's like

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
you can rent the game for $2 for a day

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
and instant Wii tennis party

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
it's

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
interesting Nintendo is clearly

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
testing something here

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
they're testing a lot of things

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
testing people's patience

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
here's something else they're testing

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
so Wii Fit U is going to be available

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
November 1st as a download

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and then later

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
on December 13th they'll be coming out

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
as like a bundle and so

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
November 1st

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
you will have one month to demo

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
the game and

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
that's if you have a Wii Balance board

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and then if you decide and you

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
like the game then you need to

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
purchase a fit meter which is their

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
little pedometer thing that's going to tie into it

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and then I guess

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
the fit meter is priced at $20

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and that's also coming out on November 1st

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
and then once you

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
have that if you want to buy

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
the package that's going to be coming

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I guess December 13th

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and then the full game download is coming

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
February 1st

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
it's a little different I guess

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
so how's your Wii Fit

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Wii Fit board holding up?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
my Wii Fit Balance board right now true story

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
is propping up

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
the television you see over there

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
because you'll notice it has to be propped up a bit

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
to get over the sound board and we didn't have

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
anything that was just the right height except the

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Wii Balance board mine was

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
under my TV like just under

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I just have it stashed away down there and I put

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
it away I don't even know what again now I need

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
to see if the damn thing still works because I

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
have to admit I'm curious about Wii U

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Plus or Wii U Fit Plus

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
whatever the fuck it's called

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
that game the fitness game

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
you want the thing I want the

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
hot new thingy that everybody's got

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
well and and it's it's

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
kind of fascinating to me that it's like alright

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
so here's the deal yo

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
if you had Wii Fit before

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
you get it on this day and it's like

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
free for a month but then if you want to keep it

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
you gotta buy this thing but if you don't have any

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
of it we'll have it all out on this day

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and then you can download it on this like I'm like

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm like

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I've gone cross eyed from how

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
they're trying to get return customers well

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
yeah and I don't like I'm not saying it's necessarily

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
a bad idea but it's the whole

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
thing is just very like it's not what

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I expect out of Nintendo

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
at all I guess that's

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
a good thing though because if you think about it

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
that means if I was a supporter of Wii Fit

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I can get this upgrade

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
for 20 bucks and let's be real

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
it's probably not gonna be

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
much different than the Wii versions

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
it will be an upgrade that incorporates

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
the pedometer or what have you so

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
it's kinda refreshing that

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I can get that for 20 bucks

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
assuming my stinkin' balance board will

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
still work after having a TV sitting on it for

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
two years um

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Didn't I try to borrow it once and it didn't work?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Hey here's a fantastic idea

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I mean it's just so out there and crazy

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
why don't they fuckin' have it tie in with

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
the 3DS that has a goddamn pedometer built

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
into it oh but that would be too

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
fuckin' difficult for them now would it?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I would imagine what they're really

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
going after are those like the what are

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
they called the Fitbits? The things

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
that people can wear on their hands like the bracelets

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
that's what they're going after right? That makes me think of

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
what was the thing they used to have

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
the monitor

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
oh hell I don't remember the Genki monitor or something

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
yeah something like that Genki monitor

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
well then there was I don't know there was that

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
um ridiculous game on the

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
that was on the DS I think that everybody

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
walks or whatever that was that

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
you put the little thing in your pocket and it would just

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
that was on the Wii was that on the Wii?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
yeah thanks Konami

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
no that was on the DS

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
no it was on the Wii

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
it was a part it was a music game

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
that was walking

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
no no we're thinking of two different games

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I know what you're talking about but there was another

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
game that like it came with two

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
little pedometers and you plugged it into your

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
DS or something and it said you walked

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
500 steps today let's

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
upload it to the internet and see how far the world

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
has walked to the moon would you walk

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
500 miles? it was like a non-game game you know what that

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
makes me think of oh my god it makes me think

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
of Noby Noby Boy on my phone

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
kind of because like you have to make him

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
grow and then he has to reach girl

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
or it's how long it takes girl to reach earth

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
or some shit

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Dark Tetsuya says walk it out

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
that was the one that was the Konami game I believe

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
and then

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
VX Chase and XV

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
says I want Pokemon Pikachu

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
pedometer integration

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
that was a thing too I forgot about that

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
one of the Pokemon games had that thing too

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I miss my Pikachu

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
so

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
alright anyhow

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
let's talk about this as long as we're on Nintendo

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
because this news gets me very excited

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I want this

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
version of the game to happen and it's Soul Calibur

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
2 HD on

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
the Wii U sit down

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
it's not confirmed yet but

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
what is being talked about is that

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
GamesRadar talked to Namco Bandai

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
at a pre-Tokyo game

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
show event I believe to see

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
if the development team would consider

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
bringing Soul Calibur 2 HD to

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the Wii U because as you know right now

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
the game is only coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and PlayStation Network but I think

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
many of us remember the GameCube

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
version as being the definitive version because it had

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Link remember

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
so even though it's cool that you know

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Spawn and Heihachi are going to be

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
in the other ones we want Link

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and we want it on Nintendo so

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
GamesRadar was told that if the game

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
does well it's a possibility

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
they even encouraged

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
people to spam the producer's Twitter

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
if they're interested

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
it's not, it doesn't have anything

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
to do with the fucking popularity of the game

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
it has to fucking do with the fact that

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
no there's not a lot of

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
console sales and I'm betting that

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Tekken or Tekken Tag

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Tournament 2 probably fucking bombed

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
on the Wii U that's why

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
it's not coming to the goddamn Wii U

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
it's not because they just

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
yeah but if they're writing it for 360

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I thought the Wii U was supposed to be built

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
so that it could like take 360

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
ports really easy I understand

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
it could take ports really easy but the thing is

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
why spend the money to port a game

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
if you're only going to make X amount of sales

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
it costs money to do a port regardless of how easy

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
it is it's still

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
and my thought is you're saying that it has

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
to sell well in order to do the port

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
and I'm like well I

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I don't want to buy the game twice

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
so if I buy it on

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
PlayStation that's it I'm not going to buy it again

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
it's free to play no you're thinking of

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
a different Soul Calibur game Soul Calibur HD is not

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
you're thinking of the new, the one we talked about

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
last week I thought that was the free to play one

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
not Soul Calibur HD

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Soul Calibur HD is

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
that was some new game in the series

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
it's on PlayStation 3 it's not

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
no you're mixing, you're crossing your Soul Calibur

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
wires you're forging a new

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Destiny for the game I was thinking about

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
the Soul Calibur 2 HD

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
that was, that's one of

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
the three import GameCube games I have

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
was Soul Calibur

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
2 just so we could have Link

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
so we could have it early

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
SSJ100Matt says

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
ugh I hate it when they pull that shit

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
quote if it makes enough money, such a cock tease

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
do it or don't do it, stop stringing people

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
along, amen

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
just do it

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
talking about fitness

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and all this stuff

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
it's just probably people asking them about it that's all

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
it's not that they came out and said we have an

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
idea for a game we're going to make

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
but only if it sells well

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
yeah only if it sells well so everybody go buy it

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I mean they're not Konami or something

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
we have no intention of ever making it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
unless you pre-order X amount of copies

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
ha ha ha

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
alright

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
that definitely does it for that story

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
let's go back to a time

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
when you know it was

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
a whole lot easier than this

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and there was really

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
only two consoles

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
either you Ninten did

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
or you Sega didn't

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
it is the classic

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
game of the week Dark Soccer is going to take

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
a trip down memory lane and find a game that she

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
thinks hey, you should be playing this game

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
forget these HD

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
remasters and all this shit

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
go back and play a classic

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
in 4x3, love it

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I also have an announcement after this too

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
about the segment

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
okay, hmm, nevermind

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I would have told you ahead of time

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I was like you're going to fucking surprise me with some shit here girl

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
alright here it is

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
the game of the week is Mischief Makers

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
the game is known in Japan

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yuke Yuke Troublemakers

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
or as it's known on OLR, Dark Sakura

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
what?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Mischief Makers, get it?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
okay

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
anyway, it is a game

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
developed by Treasure

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and published by Amix

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
in Japan and published by Nintendo

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
in the US

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
it was on the Nintendo 64

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
it came out in 1997

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
as one of the first

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Nintendo 64

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and so your main character is the

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
ultra intergalactic side-bot

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
G-Marina Lightyears

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
or as she's also known, Marina

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
who is a robotic maid

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
so you go through the game

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and it's

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
pretty average side-scrolling

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
thing except it's a treasure game

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
so you know weirdness is going to

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
ensue

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
so she can pick up her enemies, objects, weapons

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and even some energy

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
or projectiles

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and they can be thrown or shaken depending on whatever the object is

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and crystals can come out

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
and whenever some

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
other objects are shaken

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
there may be another effect that happens

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
and then

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
you have another character named Teron

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
who's able to play in other levels

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
and has punches

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and kicks and blocks

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
and he can hang from the ceiling

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
and he can jump

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
three times consecutively

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
there's a golden gem in every level

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
and what it does

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I don't know what is up with

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
OS

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
anyway

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
so if you have

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
the gems, they're used in the final cutscene

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
of the game

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
by adding

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
one to three seconds to the ending

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
so the extended ending

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
has extra

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
character development for the

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
villains and other

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
secrets that happen

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
so the way that you get the gold gem

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
it differs

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
from stage to stage

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
so I suggest finding a walkthrough

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
if you're going to play it

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
so you have other gems in the game

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
they're red, blue, green, and like I said

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
the gold one

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and some of them give health for Marina

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
red giving the lowest, gold being the highest

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
and then each stage

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
is numbered like a Super Mario Brothers level

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
like a 1, 1, 2, you know

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
etc. and the worlds

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
have different elements like world 1

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
is grasslands, world 3 is snow

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
and you have different cutscenes

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
you also get a thing

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
called a clancer ball

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
where Marina can throw

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
herself out of it and aim

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
toward another ball and

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
these pots store

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
different items in it so if you get the right

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
items you can make very interesting things happen

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
so like I said it was done

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
by Anix and Treasure

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Treasure is like

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Treasure did Gunstar Heroes

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
they did

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Silhouette Mirage

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
if you want your

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
bizarre games

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and I think

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
that it was

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
also one of the last

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
titles they did in a cartridge

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
format

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
because

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
it was one of their early ones

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
that did not come out

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
on a Sega system as well

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
they thought that Nintendo 64

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
was going to be the best choice for their projects

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
of course we know how well that happened

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
you know

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
it's like I said

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Treasure has a track record

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
for doing quality games

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
with very interesting

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
elements of gameplay in it so

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
the game got kind of

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
extra views I mean

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
it's definitely

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
geared toward the Treasure fans

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
but not many people were

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
too into it because of the limitations

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
of the Nintendo 64 in terms of

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
graphics and the way that the game

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
it was just like a very glorified

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
SNES game with 3D in it

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
however

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I know I keep saying it

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
but it is a Treasure game

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
so if you like Treasure games

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
this will definitely be up your alley

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
and it's got really

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
fun animation and really

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
adorable

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
artwork

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
it's one of my favorites it's one of the

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Nintendo 64 games that I still own

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
so that is my game

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
of the week is Mischief Makers

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
or UK UK Troublemakers

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
UK UK means go go

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
now you just love

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
to do these Treasure games

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
is there any Treasure games you haven't done yet?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I'm not saying it's a bad thing

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm sure there's Treasure games I haven't done

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I mean

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I've only done

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
did I do Bongio?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Treasure did Bongio didn't they?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I'm trying to think if you did that

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I think you did at some point

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
well there it is

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
there it is your classic game of the week

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Mischief Makers by Treasure for the Nintendo 64

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
so now Dark Sakura

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
would like to make an announcement

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I feel like saying

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
parquet

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
is a little crown like the 80s commercials

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
so many of our listeners will not understand

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
that is so lost

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
on so many

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
that's always what pops into my head every time

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
you play the stupid little fanfare

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
is some kid with the crown

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
parquet was the little thing that would talk

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
parquet

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
oh my god this show has dissolved into butter

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
commercials Dark Sakura what's your damn

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
announcement?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
my announcement is that

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I have

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
on the way here

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
that I am reevaluating what I do in terms

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
of systems for the games and I am now

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
going to be doing it with a year cut off

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
so starting

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
with

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
October I'm going to be doing

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
games that came up through 2003

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
so that

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I'm keeping a consistent 10 year

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
gap so that's going to start bringing

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
in I think

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
later PS1 games

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
GameCube games

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
the end of the Dreamcast cycle

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
and I believe PS2

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
we're going to start seeing PS2 games

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
come in for classic games I seem to remember

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
about a year ago you did an early

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
PlayStation 2 game and a lot of people

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
were like that's not classic

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
no y'all we're getting older

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
because these games are 10 years old

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I think that's fair so I'm

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
on top of that I have to say

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
that no I'm not doing Halo

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
chatters

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
chatters are trolling

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
what started

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
the thought in my head

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
it took a while to develop you know the entire

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
drive here I was looking back

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
at my shelves going

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
oh my god some of this is

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
crap

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
we do have a lot of shit games

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I mean for all of the

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
you know 300 plus worth

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
dollar games that we own we have

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
some shit and I have some games

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
that are kind of shit that I have just because I

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
fucking wanted them like Gatchamon

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and the shooting I got it because

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
it was Gatchamon game shut up I have

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Kitty the Cool which I got so

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I could burn you a copy

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
if you will remember that

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
somebody bought me the Hello Kitty GameCube

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
game and it's not that great

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
so you know what's funny

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
with you setting your

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
10 year limit I want to really

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
explain to you what this means

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
because you are doing games

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
that are 10 years or older

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
you could feasibly be

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
doing games that we

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
talked about their launch on this

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
program I was

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
thinking about that and maybe I should

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
you know put it at our launch date

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
and earlier but I think 10 years

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
is a good limit and it opens up

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I'm just thinking like oh my god she could

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
now granted I love you SSJ 100

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Matt for linking the Parquet commercial

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
granted we didn't

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
expand from the music games only

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
to all games until about what

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
2004, 2005

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
so we still have a few years

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
to go before you really hit that mark

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
where yes we talked about these games when they first came out

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
but the whole thing

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I'm thinking of is that now we talk about some of

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
these games and

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
they are classic we're seeing

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
HD remakes because

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
they are classic oh god Rob

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
sorry this is linked by SSJ

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
100 Matt in chat finish your thought and then I'll play this

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
ok but

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
by now they are classic

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and you know we have to stay

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
only games from 10 years ago

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I still have a shit ton

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
of Cliccovision games and

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Intellivision to be fair you've

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
been doing this segment since episode I mean

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
this segment has evolved since the early days

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
of the show because it used to be what it used to be your advice

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
column you had your link and then the website of the

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
yeah so now you have your classic so you've only been doing

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
classic games since what episode 250 yeah

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
but that's still 270

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
games but that's that you've covered

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
exactly it's not even at a

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
halfway point anymore that I

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
started doing this and for the record

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I do kind of miss the website of the week just because

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
the guy from

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Weebil and

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Bob messaged us

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
that was pretty cool

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
that was like a nerdgasm

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
in my book ok now if I

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
get you know a shout out from

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
you know

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
from Homestuck people or from

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
the guy the person that does Nedroid

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Diary I would be even happier

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
because those are

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
my favorites but

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
yeah I figured by now it's time

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it's time to grow up

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
it's time to acknowledge that I don't want

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
to grow up I'm an O.L.R.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
kid there's a million games O.L.R.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
that I can play with

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Lord but

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I'm thinking at this

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
point enough of our listeners

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
who might have been

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
a little too young for us back in the

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
day yes might

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
appreciate something that's a little bit more

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
in their realm of experience from

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
time to time fair enough fair enough

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
black wolf is trying he says

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
in our chat room halo classic game

you know Bobby it will happen

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
if you send me a $25 gift card

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
to California Pizza Kitchen

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
you too can bribe dark soccer

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
for the classic game of the week

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
ok so for you youngins

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
earlier here you go courtesy

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000

so sorry to the live Atari commercials

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I will have to bump that in post production

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
to make it actual volume for the podcast

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
listeners yeah that did not come through very well for

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
live sorry about that very very quiet

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
the imperial commercials where the kids would

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
take a bite of their toast with their

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
imperial butter on it and then

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
get a little crown and go do do do

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000

CPK I'll fucking do it two weeks

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
in a row

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
using this show

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
for your own nefarious purposes

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
boy oh boy alright

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
you know what

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I've been doing this free for a long time

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
at least

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
you can get a pizza you know what

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I think that's fair you know we've done this show

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
what five hundred and twenty weeks out of our lives

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
at least let's get a pizza out of it

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
do you remember when I was

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
trying to get Pinkberry to sponsor us for how long

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I know right Pinkberry listen

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
but you remember when I was doing

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
pump up the volume yeah and yes

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
it was totally named after the movie

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
and Loki did my intro for that

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
to everybody knows because it was used

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
in the movie and he said

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
tune in and give her a dollar

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
someone sent me a dollar

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I did the intro

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
you did my intro yeah you did

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
you did my intro I remember it

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I'll dig it up Loki I don't remember

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I think you probably need the copy of it again

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
we should play it during part B Rob

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
that's a tough task for me to find it

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I can't guarantee I have it

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
but um

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
oh dude are you guys serious fuck

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I love you guys OTB that must be

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
outside the box I have the intro for that

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I don't know if I have I probably have

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
it somewhere but you

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
you know Leonard Cohen

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
singing everybody knows and then

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000

excuse to talk more Grand Theft Auto 5

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000

another game we've been talking about for a few weeks also

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
a good reason to talk about Mighty Number 9 and what's

going on with that so plenty more to come when we

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000

welcome back

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
live here at voggenetwork.com

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
with the 520th

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
episode of our show

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
September 22nd

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
2013 and uh

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
a big thanks of course to everybody who turns up

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
to listen to the show live

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and in podcast form

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
uh I know for live tonight

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
we're going up against what the Emmys are tonight

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
although I mean I don't know why these award

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
shows are such a big deal but maybe I'm just

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
jaded from doing this on Sunday night for so long

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
but I know the Breaking Bad finale

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
is tonight too and I'm sure a lot of people

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
are excited about that

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
but that's why they have DVR

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
that's why you tape it and watch it later

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
but speaking of recording

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
speaking of recording and watching it

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
later I know a lot of people listen to us on the podcast

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
feed uh be it through Stitcher

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
or iTunes or whatever

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I mean there's a lot of ways to know

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
some people might still be rocking this on the PSP

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
which does remind me to also

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
say um olrpsp.com

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
has closed

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
uh I think well I think it was

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
this week that it finally was turned back over

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
to GoDaddy who I'm sure has a spam site up

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
in its place um so

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
that is no longer accessible

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
at that website but if you do have a PSP

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and you have badly

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
you're like oh what was I missing at olrpsp.com

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
even though it's so out of date

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I don't even think it ever it still tries to access

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
the stream at our old network

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
but not even their current stream

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
like an old stream at the old network

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
uh you can still visit the graphics

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Loki did do a bang up job on the site

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
orangeloungeradio.com

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
slash psp you just have to do it the long way

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
and I'm pretty sure the old games radio

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
streamer does not work anymore

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'm pretty sure it goes to their old feed

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
because I think it had broke it had been broke

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
at one point when they switched servers and

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
everybody was like Loki update it Loki update it

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
and you were like no

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I have an updated site here

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I'm not gonna start now

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
the studio points out there's also a bitly

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
so bit.ly slash

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
olrpsp will also get you there

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
so there you go

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
um anyhow uh

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
thanks again to all you guys who listen and participate with the show

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
speaking of live participators

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
uh it was brought to our attention

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
during the release date segment that we go over

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
that we missed one big release

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
that's coming out this week probably because

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
it's in the download space but

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
some of our chatters namely Alan Alchemy

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
and ActDeft very excited about

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Deluxe Plus which is

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
on PC I know they've been hoarding it

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
on Steam uh Wednesday September

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
25th uh and then

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
also the DLC pack for

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
consoles will be the same day because I believe

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
it's new to PC I don't think it's been out on PC

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
yet so it'll be on Steam 9.25

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and then the DLC upgrade

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
uh will hit consoles on September 25th

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
so that's it sounds like they're adding a lot

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
to it like they probably could have done a third

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
game out of it but they're not so

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
just wanted to throw that out there because after

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
all they could have done a third game

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
but they didn't they could have

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
not unlike

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
another company we know right

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Half Life 2 DLC

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
episode confirmed they need to talk to Capcom

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
and learn about counting to three

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
pretty much the third game for Pac-Man

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
3 on Steam

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Half Life 3 confirmed

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
maybe that's one of the big announcements who knows

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
alright uh let us get into

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
some rapid fire news some quick

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
news it's funny when you

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
some of you guys in chat are like I'm surprised they haven't

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
mentioned this yet well that's

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
stay tuned in this rapid fire news

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
give us a chance geez people

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
hurry up and wait Loki

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
so Disney Infinity is getting

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
some free toy boxes

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
um as part of DLC

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
and um

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
the first one or I should say

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
one of them is gonna be the Tron Highway

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
so yes you're gonna

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
finally be able to get your Tron stuff in the

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
toy box mode which is pretty fantastic

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
um

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
and I guess it's gonna offer

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
some uh cool stuff racing

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I guess along tracks and stuff

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
um some of the other ones are coming out too

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Sugar Mania so there you go

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
there's your uh your Sugar Rush

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
stuff right there Monster Rally

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
and Cosmic Platformer

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
oh and

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I like this one um

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
it's a trap is one that's

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
also being released

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
cause you know Disney

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
owns Lucas now so

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
wow funny

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I don't think that's necessarily gonna be a

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Star Wars theme but it would be hilarious

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
they're teasing you into thinking it is

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
yes they know what they're doing

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
they know what they're doing um

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
so yeah so that's gonna be available

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I guess um

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
sometime soon doesn't

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
really say oh October 3rd

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
is when those are gonna be available so

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
it's kinda cool

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
hey you know what you may be able to just pick up

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Disney Infinity cause I may be selling them on eBay

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
soon yeah

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
cause I don't have time to play with Grand Theft Auto

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
taking up my entire life

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Gravity Rush

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
is getting a sequel and

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
um I believe that's still coming to the Vita

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
and they were kinda they teased it

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
with a trailer that came out

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
of um

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
uh what was it uh

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
what the fuck was this weekend

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
or this week Tokyo Game Show

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
hello thank you um

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
um so yeah so far confirmed

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
for the Vita but um no word yet on

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
when um if that's gonna be other

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
systems PlayStation 4 that kind of stuff

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I would think keep it on the Vita it was a pretty good

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Vita exclusive game although

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I mean they practically well they still give it away

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
if you well if you have PlayStation Plus you know

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
you have to be on board with that but yeah so

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
that's pretty cool um it's worth your time

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
though yeah and uh

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
no word on when that's

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
coming out and then last but not least one of the

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
cool pieces of integration

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
for Grand Theft Auto

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
5 is this iFruit companion

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
app that you can get on iOS

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
um very disappointing that it's not an

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Android yet but with it you can do a bunch

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
of cool stuff including customizing your car

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
you can customize the license plates that are on your

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
car and they actually appear in game

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
as well oh that's kinda cool um

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
you can even raise Chop which

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
is the dog that Franklin

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
um ends up getting and

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
uh you can train him and stuff

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
and walk him just like you can with

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
intent dogs except you know with a little bit

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
of a twist including um

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
you know he'll fetch

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
grenades and severed hands and stuff

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
like that um and they're gonna be adding apps

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
to it as well so um

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
it's pretty cool and it's free

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
so if you have you know an iOS device

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
then pick it up

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
if you have an Android device don't

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
download any ones that are out there because they're all scam

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
apps they're all scam right now

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I love that they have that tie in

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
though that's awesome they have a lot of ties that it actually

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
goes in your game yeah they have that and social

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
club stuff you know there's actual real

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
websites you can visit you get in game

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
discounts and stuff with and

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
just all sorts of crazy stuff Final Fantasy

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
14 has an app but it doesn't like it's

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
it's like the Warcraft armory you can like

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
look up characters and stuff in game but you can't really

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
do anything with it otherwise but

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
kinda neat I like seeing the

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
whole tie in there now that's second screen right

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
alright sort of yeah

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
alright speaking of second screen

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
something on the Wii U popped up

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
a message mentioning

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
that Mario and Sonic at the Sochi

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
2014 Winter Games will be available

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
on the eShop on November 8th

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
all controversy

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
about the Winter Games and where it's being held

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
aside these Mario

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
and Sonic games have done very

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
very well a lot of you guys

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
probably really

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I mean cause they're not really for hardcore gamers

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
they're really geared for casual gamers and

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
kids but these games do insanely

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
well like it's one of the biggest properties

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
on the Wii so this is

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
a pretty big deal this is happening on the Wii U

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
there was a reveal

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
trailer if you think back to the Nintendo Direct

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
then there was another trailer

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
that said there will be 16 events in the game

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Wii Motion Plus Wii U gamepad

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
both being used some will use both

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
the biathlon uses the Wii

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
remote for skiing and then the gamepad for the sniping

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
so there you go that will

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
all be out November 8th

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
so uh

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Wii balance board support I see

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
no probably not probably a little soon

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
for that I don't know so

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
there you go

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I'm

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
as much as I don't want to get too political on this show

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
obviously you all know I have some strong opinions

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
on certain subjects and so

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
you know obviously I can't

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
condone some of these laws

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
that we've heard about in Russia

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
that are just back in the stone age

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
so is Birdo not gonna be

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
allowed to play in these games?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I was gonna

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
say something serious but we'll just leave it at that

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
fair enough

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
you play PC 4.0

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I didn't even realize Uplay was a thing on PC

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I knew it was on the consoles

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I guess Ubisoft wants their buy to

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
the PC gaming market as well

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
there will be a new version of it in October

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
and it will have new features including

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Twitch TV integration

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
well it's something that's bundled with

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
all the Ubisoft games so if you have it on Steam

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
you still have to log into your fucking Uplay

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
bullshit yeah

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I must not own any Ubisoft games on PC

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I have on consoles

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I have a couple Just Dance games

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
and Zombie You

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
and Blood Dragon

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I don't remember if Far Cry 2 did

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
but yeah

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
well there you go

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Uplay will also be available on the Xbox One and the

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
PlayStation 4 when those consoles make their retail

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
debuts but I don't know

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
like I imagine

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
those consoles are already streaming anyway

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
so whatever

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
and then last but not least

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
for all two of you

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
at Orange Lawns Radio that will care about this news

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
La Mulana 2

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
it is out there

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
folks no all kidding aside

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
this is an indie game that gets a lot of attention

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
partially for

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
its throwback to the retro days partially because

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
of how difficult it is but

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
La Mulana 2 apparently

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
not available on PC until next year

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
but it was

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
spotted at Tokyo Game Show 2013

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
and there's even like a little

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
logo out there La Mulana 2

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
the zeroth body the night spirit

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I don't know how else to read that the zeroth body

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
sounds right there it is

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
and you will probably die

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
many more times than

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
zero playing La Mulana 2

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I think Dark Tetsuya

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
needs new underwear now he might

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
so in other news

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
speaking of people who need new underwear

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I'm thinking of my husband now

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Strider HD

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
this is

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
did you watch the trailer Rob?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
yes I did

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
it is hot

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
it's supposed to be a Metroidvania

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
type game

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
which people are a little bit sort of

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
back and forth on but for the most part

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
it's gotten some really positive reviews

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and so I'm looking forward to it coming out

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
but I just wanted to mention

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
that it is getting really good reviews

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
previews I guess would be really

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
yeah but

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I think that everyone owes it to themselves

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
to dedicate themselves to the religion

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
of Hiryu

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
and definitely check out the

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
you know think about it

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
think about it this way Loki hasn't

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
shut up about Grand Theft Auto 5

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I haven't shut up about Final Fantasy 14

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Dark Sakura will have her day when this

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
game comes out

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I need a moment

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I need a moment

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I'm a little warm

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I'm a little warm

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
do I need to get some paper towels

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
this is getting gross

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
someone fetch a towel

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Austin now this is a cool game

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and I was watching a little bit of the play on this

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
it was one of the fastest

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
greenlit games ever

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and it went in five

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
days

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
a game by Polish developer Blue Brick

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
called Superhot

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
and basically what it is

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
it's

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
basically your characters are like

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
black outlines against

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
all white but normally

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
shaded environment

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
with lots and lots of red blood

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
the thing about this is that time

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
only moves when you move

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
so if someone shoots at you

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
you can stop walking

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
and the bullets stop

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
and you can dodge them

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
dodge them

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
so it just seemed like a really neat concept

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
and we've seen something like this done with

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
you know bullet time and max pain

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
but nothing to the extent of

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
actually having it stop

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
so the only way to win is not to play the game

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
yes

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
you have to

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
you definitely have a goal within the game

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
but

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
you can move around the things that are in your way

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Loki you just lost the game

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and last but never least

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
and I'm looking forward to this as well

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Bayonetta actually is

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
having a theatrical release

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
an animated theatrical release

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
that will be out in November in Japan

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
and I will have to talk to people who live there

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
to tell me

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
how it is

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Krista go watch the movie for me

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
so

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
it's named Bayonetta

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Bloody Fate and it will be out on November 23rd

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
you know it's gonna be out

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
and people will fan sub it

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
of course

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
fan subbers gonna sub

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
alright

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
are we ready to get to the foogle

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
question of the week? I sure hope so

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
because if not

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
you're gonna check out for a minute

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I guess

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
we love to hear from listeners

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
so every week we ask a

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
question at facebook.com

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
slash orange lounge radio and our google plus

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
page available for a search

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
available when you search for orange

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
lounge radio a lot of comments

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
this week I'm not gonna be able to read them all

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I'm so sorry but

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
a lot of great feedback on the question this week

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
let me tell you what the question is

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
it was announced this week that Wii Sports would become the

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
latest game to get an HD version or

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
remaster if you will

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
this is in addition to other HD remakes

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
we've seen this year Kingdom Hearts for example

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
and even previously with God of War

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
and so forth so what's your opinion

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
on HD remakes? Do you enjoy

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
them or do you think it's not a good use of

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
developer resources?

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Redertainment on google plus says

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
HD remaster or remake might be good if

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
the game is a revered classic but Wii Sports

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
come on what's next

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Golf for the NES? Wait

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I've played Golf for the NES it's the

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 mini game

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
E3

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
VL or Evel says

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I think it gives the new generation of gamers

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
a chance to experience past games who are

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
put off by older graphics

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
gamers who missed old gems in the past

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
like Shadow of the Colossus are

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
able to experience the game now due

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
to wider availability without paying the high

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
eBay cost. Personally

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I'll pay for the game again if they add

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
new content along with the updated

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
visuals like the Wind Waker HD with its

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
gameplay tweaks and the gamepad support

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
or have additional bonus content

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
all DLC in the Resident Evil HD

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
games which could cost

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
which would cost more if obtained

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
separately. Good thoughts

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
you know though if somebody is really

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
going to ignore a classic game because of

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
graphics though I really think

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
they're missing out I mean there's just some

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
classic games you can't really HD

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
like Kaboom on the Atari

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
2600 that is a classic

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
game but you can't like yeah

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I mean there's some they tried Tetris

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
right? The only thing that did

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
kicks right was Miss New World

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
and

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
to be fair the Tetris on the Game Boy

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
or I think the DS Tetris was

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
amazing that was a great version

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
of Tetris. And let's not forget Gals Panic

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
is awesome. Of course of course

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
so those are some of the answers from Google Plus

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
let's get to some of the answers from

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Facebook

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Andrew S says I wouldn't mind a Tony Hawk

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Underground or as my friend and I

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
refer to it as Thug Remaster

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
it would bring

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
it would bring it out of PS2 graphics

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Renee our buddy

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
from Koopa Club says

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
to HD or not to HD

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
that is the question

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
whether it is nobler the developer

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
reviewers for not offering new

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
and instead recycling the same game format

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
and content or to take arms against

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
a sea of troubles from development, programming

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
and marketing and by providing new content

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
either limited or a completely

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
new game altogether and by

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
opposing end them to try to

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
release an HD version in timely fashion

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I see what you did there

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
and you get a slow clap

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
it is a tough

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
question that they have to ask

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Red the Haze says I like

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
HD remakes as it lets people try

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
out older games they may have missed

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
with updated graphics and performance

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
as much as I think Wii Sports HD

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
is a good idea for new Wii U owners to

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
try out Wii Sports it just feels

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
icky for them to try something like this for what

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
was a free pack-in title

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
especially with the lack of unified account system

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
on with Nintendo consoles

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
other than that HD remakes are great

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Degenerate Johnny

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
says the fact of the matter is that

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
many of us gamers cling to the memories

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
and experiences of the games we have played earlier

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
in our lives an HD remake

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
offers the chance for us to relive those

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
memories with a fresher feel to it

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
that is part of the answer I am going to

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
cut the rest of it for time

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
For the Fallen Dreams 13 says

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I enjoy HD remakes of games because

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
it's just about making a game I was already in love

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
with bigger, brighter, and more

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
aesthetically pleasing given the

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
developer does it justice

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
also not everyone's older consoles

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
still work dot dot dot

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
that's an answer I personally agree with

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
unless you're me

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Dart Charger says

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
as someone who has invested in a lot of HD

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
remakes I feel they sound cooler

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
than they actually end up being

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
the nostalgia is often

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
fleeting with few exceptions

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Scott W says

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I enjoy HD remakes as long as they bring something

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
extra like Final Fantasy 10 HD

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
with the international content included

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Kingdom Hearts looks great too

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Ziba says I enjoy the HD remakes

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
definitely the nostalgia feeling that's best

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
it's even better when they add some special things

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
to keep interest going

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Eddie K says it's a lazy but effective

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
way to make money

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
nostalgia sells huge in the

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
video game industry

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Virtual Phil also

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
from Koopa Club says I guess if you have the money

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
to burn then it's cool but like

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
DuckTales HD was fun for 10 seconds

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
and now everyone is all over the next

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
HD remake they tend to be

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
a bit gimmicky

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
and that was followed by the colon x face

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
you know what

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Dan is still playing that game

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
because he's achievement hunting on it

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Tiger Claw

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
says an HD remake of a game would be worth

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
it if they add some new content to it

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
the problem is they tend to be a shot for shot

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
remake of the original game where you

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
know where all the items are located

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and how to beat the levels

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I'm down for an HD version of Wii Sports as long as

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
they add online multiplayer to it

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
and lastly

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Gamer Girl says don't know if this counts

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
but I am really loving DuckTales

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Remastered I think they should come out with

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
more because a lot of the younger generation

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
doesn't even know the mind blown

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
that they're missing out on

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
again some of the answers I'm so sorry I had to cut some of those for time

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Facebook.com slash orange launch radio

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
if you want to read all of the answers in their entirety

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
a big thank you to all of you that

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
took the time to answer that I did read them all

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
so what are your guys thoughts

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
quickly on HD remasters

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I think they're great I agree with the guy

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
that said you know what the old consoles don't

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
always work I like the stuff like

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
trophy support and so on and

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
it's just icing on the cake when they go back and make

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
it a little bit better

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I'm kind of

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I don't know how

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I feel about it to be honest because

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I hardly ever go back and buy them

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
except for the ones that are like super

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
nostalgic that really

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
are a true update like you know like

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
DuckTales was you know that was a big

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
nostalgic kick I have it Dan

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
has it I'm not

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
getting the Final Fantasy

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
X set because

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I already have X, X-2

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and I have X

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
International so

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
no I have X-2 International

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
so sort of like what's the point

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I actually have the Japanese version of X

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I'm a sheep I'm totally getting X

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I want it really bad

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
that being said

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I kind of want the HD

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Kingdom Hearts but I'm probably just going to wait and play yours

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
an effective

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
solution because I'm

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
unemployed so I have

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
to measure frugality

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
and realism versus

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
you know

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
needs

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
versus wants

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Final Fantasy 14 I bought the collector's edition

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
that was my anniversary

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
present Grand Theft Auto 5

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
is my anniversary present to my husband

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
because I am an awesome wife

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
so

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
we make it for occasion so if

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
it came out if a really awesome

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
HD remake came out and it's a round

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
like Strider well Strider's not really

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
a remake though we're fucking getting that you know that

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
but it falls in the

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
same category as DuckTales but also Strider

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
is Dan's favorite

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
game in the fucking universe

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
for Strider you'll eat ramen for a week

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
he made me play through the

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Genesis version when I moved out here to see

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
if he wanted to bury me

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
well he didn't say that aloud

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
but I have a feeling that my ability to beat

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Strider was one of the requirements

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
of marriage and what did he have to do for you

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
fair is fair right?

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
what did he have to do for me?

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
not irritate me?

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I don't know

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
he kept me supplied in video games

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
for the last 15 years so I feel good about that

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
fair enough he hasn't kicked me

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
out for being a shiftless layabout for the

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
last two years it's not my fault

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I'm not employed but still fair

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
enough alright let's talk about some other

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
gaming news and what else is going on in the industry

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Loki why don't you start us off

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
okay so let's talk some more Grand Theft

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Auto it sold

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
one billion dollars

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
worth of copies in the first

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
three days and

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
that's a

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
record in fact it broke

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
a record for day one sales too

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
800 million dollars

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
the previous

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
landmark I think was

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 which only

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
did I want to say 450

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
million

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
and also

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
it hit a billion dollars faster in Call of Duty

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Black Ops 2 as well they hit a billion dollars

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
in 15 days instead of

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
three

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
so yes it's the largest entertainment

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
launch in history

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
not bad

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
fun fact

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
in the history of films

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
only

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
17 movies

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
have grossed a billion dollars

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
worldwide and that's total

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
17 movies total now

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
the oldest one of the 17

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
is

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
1993

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
this is like the Jurassic Park episode because

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
the movie is the oldest

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
one on the list there because you know it costs more to see

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
a movie these days than it used to if you were to change

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
for inflation

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
like Gone with the Wind or something would probably be up there but

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
yeah only 17 movies have ever done a billion

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
dollars worth of business and that was over

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
the course of being in the theater

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
for what we Titanic the number

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
two grossing movie of all time two billion

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
dollars done but that was

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
what that was in theaters for like six months

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and then re-released in the

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
whole IMAX thing right

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
so I mean this is huge that a video game did that

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
practically overnight no movies done it

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
overnight or three days

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
still

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
even can some

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
folks guess some of the other movies the top 17

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
on the list just for fun

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
well I know the top grossing movie

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
for 24 hours was Harry Potter

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
and the

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
it was Harry Potter and the

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Deathly Hallows part 2 is number

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
four on the all time list it was 91 million

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
dollars in 24 hours that

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
was the the video

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
or DVD I'm sorry the

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
movie record for top grossing

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
24 hours I can tell you what the top two were no fair

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
peaking but okay well I haven't because my

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
glasses because

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I remember the news past when avatars are past

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Titanic avatar is the number one movie of all time

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and Titanic would be number two Titanic would be

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
number two correct just quickly

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Marvel's the Avengers number three

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
because of Jaws Iron Man

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
three number five Transformers

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Dark of the Moon number six that surprised

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
me Lord of the Rings The Return

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
of the King number seven Skyfall

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
number eight The Dark Knight

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Rises number nine that

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
surprised me too because I always thought The Dark Knight

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
did better but I guess with the year difference

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
and then lastly number ten I

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
won't read the whole list but Pirates of the Caribbean Dead

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Man's Chest is number ten so just

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
kind of a fun little comparison those are the movies

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
that have raked a billion dollars

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
so

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
neat and they're just getting started

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
mm-hmm

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
alright

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
well moving on to a game

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
that will sadly probably not to break a billion

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
dollars because we're just not sure if the game is ever

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
going to come out here or not it was

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
spotted on Steam Greenlight this week

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Ghosts and Goblins Online

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
you know how they can get that to break a billion dollars

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
charge one dollar for every life

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
hahaha

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
good work

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
dead

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Ghosts and Goblins Online this has a long history

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
you want to talk about an old game it was originally

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
supposed to be a multi-platform release in 2003

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
but then development

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
stopped before it was completed

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
then there was a second attempt that was also

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
canned C9

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
did the whole Steam Greenlight

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
campaign and they were bringing back

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Ghosts and Goblins Online with co-op platforming

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
PVP combat and frequent

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
updates that do new items and upgrades

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
but

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I say was because then

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
it got pulled

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Capcom actually had this pulled

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
and we're not totally sure on what it was

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
but their statement was quote

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
the Steam Greenlight page for Ghosts and Goblins Online

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
that went live yesterday was wrongly

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
posted by the game's Korean

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
developer C9 and the page has

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
now been removed. Ghosts and Goblins

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
was released last year in

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Korea, China and Taiwan and I seem to

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
remember that now that there was the

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Ghosts and Goblins because I remember we talked about it on the show

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
we were like oh of course we don't get it

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
here but they get it over there and there are

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
no plans for the title to be

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
released in Europe or North America

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
hmm but

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
very strange that that

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
showed up on Steam Greenlight I mean

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
that's more than just one person pushing a button

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
accidentally you know what I mean? That's very

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
strange to me

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
but honestly the game

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
itself looks very different

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
than what you guys remember from

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
you know the classic

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
days of gaming when that was on the early

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
consoles and the arcades and so forth

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
so I kind of think

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
as much as this sounds great on paper

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
it's probably not

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
a game to really

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
look forward to big time

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
so alright

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
let's move on. DarkSaga

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Do I gotta? Of course I do

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
well

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
this is something that

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
you know we've seen

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
the Kickstarter on it

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
was Mighty No. 9 well guess what

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
it is heading to the Wii U

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
it reached its

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
goal of 2.2 million on Kickstarter

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
which also means that it's going to be on

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
PS3, Xbox 360

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
as well as Wii U

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
there's still 14 days left on it

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
and if they hit 2.4 million by

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
October 1st it's going to have a challenge

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
mode I want to see it on PC

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
that'd be nice

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
but you know what

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
fuck it I want this game

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I might who doesn't?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
well I guess we found

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
out in the Fookle question the other week not everybody

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
does I suppose if it wasn't that

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
$20 could buy

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
me probably a week of food

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I'd probably put the money on the game just saying

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I thought they were releasing it on PC

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I mean I don't know why

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
they are now

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
and they're doing that oh no yeah I'm sorry PC was

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
the original sorry PC was the original

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
and then the console was added which was

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
the 360 the Wii U they were doing it through Steam

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
that was it but now right

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
yeah but now the Playstation 4 is

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
the stretch goal or did they hit that too

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
see that it just says PS3

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I don't know why I said PC

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
they just said

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
the next

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
goal is challenge mode

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
they are up to 2.4 million

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
so they just hit challenge mode they just hit that today

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
oh they did? they just hit it today

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
end stage boss

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
end stage boss is the next one they have to hit

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
if they can get all the way to 3.3 million

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
they'll be a Playstation 4 and Xbox One

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
version it could happen

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
they've got 8 days to go

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
so it's got to happen

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
pretty quick I kind of don't think it's going to make

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
the Playstation 4 and Xbox One

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I think we'll be lucky if we get to this beck and call

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
online however

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
if it still sells enough copies

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
of it outside of their

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Kickstarter true it could happen anyway

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
that's very true I mean it's coming out next year

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
it just might happen it might

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
we'll see

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
alright well let's

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
move on Loki a few more stories

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
here and then the mailbag

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
so with all this talk about next

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
gen stuff we've talked a little bit about

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
this whole upgrade program that they're supposed

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
to have for Xbox

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
One and Playstation 4 well here's

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
how it's going to work a little bit on the Playstation 4

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
to play a

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
digital Playstation 4 version

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
of an eligible retail

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Playstation 3 game you have to redeem a

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
code that comes with the game

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
if you buy it on the Playstation store

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
so if you buy like say a digital copy

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
of you know battlefield

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
or something like that it

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
will automatically unlock

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
the game on Playstation 4

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
when you play it if

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
you happen to use that code to download

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I think the digital version it will require you to still

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
have the disc and the drive and they're

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
saying that the next gen versions

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
of the games

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
will appear for like 10 bucks

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I guess if you have that code as well

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
and then

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
one game though that isn't

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
going to require an additional fee to upgrade

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
it is Final Fantasy 14

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
you will get a free transfer

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
from Playstation 3 to Playstation 4

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
however it is a one time transfer

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
so once you've done it you lose rights to

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
your Playstation 3 game unless of course

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
you buy another copy that part was weird

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
to me because I don't understand you know in Final Fantasy 11

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
you had all of it

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
if you had like a 360 disc you could

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
sign on with your PC account

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I mean granted you had to

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
people still got a code because they bought the game on

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
360 or whatever but it was just I don't know

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
it's kind of like you could do all of it

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
but yeah

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
well I'm

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
still excited at least that you know I'll have the

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Playstation 4 version because I plan on getting a

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Playstation 4 and it will be nice to have Final Fantasy 14

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
on it so why play it on

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Playstation 3 when I have the Playstation 4

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
and that will be I don't understand why they I mean

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
it's not like you can

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
play the game

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
you know for free or something

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
like you can play on two systems

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
at the same time or something

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
we're running out of space on this TV to hook

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
in a new console so if we plug in a new console

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
something's getting moved to the bedroom

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and so the thought is that obviously

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
like oh we're getting the Playstation 4 let's put the

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Playstation 3 well technically

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Alan has both consoles there on the

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
bedroom TV but we'll move the PS3

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
with all our save files on it to the bedroom

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
but I'm actually kind of thinking

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
the 360 might be the one to get

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
exiled to the bedroom

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
so we'll see I don't know

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
what the Wii U

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I mean the Wii U you don't need that screen you can play

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
second screen you technically don't even need

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
it hooked up to anything honestly though I'm

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
playing more Wii U than I'm playing Xbox 360

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
these days truth

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
system selector

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
is that true facts? true facts

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
that reminds me I need to get on virtual

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
console and get Super Mario Brothers for a dollar

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
or whatever they're charging for it you know

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
what I probably have like five copies

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
of Super Mario Brothers but not on

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
two screens at the same time you know

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
what Rob you're spoiled

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
and she does if she has a

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
DS copy of the game or a 3DS

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
copy of a game true that's true which

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I think I do true I don't

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
know what I have you know since we were talking

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
about NES memories and I

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
know I've told this story on the show many

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
times but I don't care I'm telling it again

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
one of my earliest memories

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
of Dark Sakura was when I

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
was when I went to her house that she

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
had with Dan out in a

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
city or part of town oh

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
the hood house I walked

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
in the house and Dan had

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
all these guys over all his guy friends

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
were over and there were TVs all

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
over the house every

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
single person was playing I

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
believe it was The Legend of Zelda

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
it was everybody was playing Zelda

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
with Nintendo so I took it to

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
TVs and I was like Jamie you've got

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
like 10 copies of

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
The Legend of Zelda all going at the same time

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
what the hell's going on here and she said

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
it's our land party it's our local area

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Nintendo party they all started

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Zelda at the same time and they're trying to see

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
who's gonna beat it first and Dan's currently in

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
the lead that's why I married him

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
you know they still do that right

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
or no you hadn't married him yet but he was you know

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
that's why it took us a while to get married but

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
you know he still does stuff like that

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
or he'll have Jeff over

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
and they'll take turns

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
playing through a game just to see how

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
they can speed run it together now that

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
is Nintendo gaming on

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
two screens at once or in that case

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
god there was literally there's like a TV

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
on the dining room table a TV in the living

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
room a TV in the back room

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
like any place they could put a fucking

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
TV with Nintendo it was

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
in that house I'm like your electric

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
bill must be scary that was back when we

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
were happy to have our 60 megahertz processor

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
computer well yeah it was

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
over 10 years it was before OLR started

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
it was a while ago and there was his

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
friend that had the PC

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
built into a old metal

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
toolbox nice that was pretty cool

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
yeah that was that was pretty

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
fun all right anyhow

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
sorry to digress there a little bit

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
but let's talk about let's talk about a

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
classic game of sorts from

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
another day here at Orange Laundry

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
we used to talk about a lot pop

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
in music remember pop in music

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
if you haven't seen this game

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
you know you know the board game

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble right

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
imagine a music

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
game controlled with nine of those

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
pop-o-matic bubbles that is what pop in music

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
basically is and

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
you might have seen this like it sometimes shows up in

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
like if see Japanese arcades like there's a very

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
famous scene in Lost in Translation that movie

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
with Bill Murray that had pop

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
in music in it I did that a couple weeks ago

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
so yeah pop in music

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
out there and it is coming to iOS

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
that is the news

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Konami has announced an iOS version

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
of pop in music we don't know much more than that

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
we're all just kind of crossing our

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
fingers and our toes that it's not based

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
off the Nintendo Wii U version

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
and that it is far better

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
than beat and groovy on the 360

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
which was I want pop in music

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I want pop in music

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I hope it's good I hope it has the Goonies

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
theme in it that's one game I will not get rid of

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I had so much fun because you know what I played

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
it was pop in music what's the last one

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Party I got to play

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
the gachamon theme and I was

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
singing along with it and the lady

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
running the place was like we're giving

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
me a look because I knew the lyrics

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
hey shut up I like gachamon

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I remember there was

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
a pop in music machine that was all anime

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
music and they used to have it on arcade infinity

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
yeah arcade infinity had that and then

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I was playing cat's eye

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
yeah nice

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
that's right I forgot that there were

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
licensed songs in pop in music at one point

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
yeah it was really fun

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
and oh the Yamato theme

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
song

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
well it came out over here

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
wasn't the star trek theme in there

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
randomly too? I think it was

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
everything's been in that game

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
everything's been in that game but I freaking love pop

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
in music

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
just traveling back

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
through the past and so forth

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I could do pop in music as a classic

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
you could yeah I could

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
but will I? I don't know I did DDR

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
wait till we get to episode 573

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
you need to hold off a little bit

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
maybe alright

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
let's see if our

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000

well this person is not a bitch

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
so it's uh

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
it's not exactly about games

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
but it's up our alley Rob definitely up our

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
alley hey OLR crew

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
AZHP here I have a question that's not

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
quite gaming related but that I

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
know is not allowed

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
hey hush you

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
but I know is a topic near and dear

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
to many of the OLR hosts heart

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
many as in two of us

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
you're not so into the Disney

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
land no

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
okay

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
but it's not like you hate Disneyland no I don't hate

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Disneyland I'm talking of course about

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Disneyland I am thinking

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
of taking my girlfriend to Disneyland for

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
anniversary in late November do it

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I was wondering if you guys had

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
any recommendation for how many days we should spend

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
one or two two and whether or not

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
we should get a park cop or pass or just go

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
in one of the parks get to

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
get your park

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
offer trust me because yeah

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
get it and which

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
park is better in your opinion is

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
quote better

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
the main park if you have

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
to pick one but California

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
adventure has tons of fun stuff and the good thing

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
is that when one side is

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
busier usually the other side is a

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
lot less busy and you can drink in California

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
adventure which sometimes you need

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
to get through the other park

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
my honest my honest advice

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
if your girlfriend's never been to Disneyland is that

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
did I catch that in the email that the girlfriend had never

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
been or hadn't been in a long time it doesn't say

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
if either of you have not been to Disneyland

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
in a very long time or

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
you know you've never been

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
take the two days to go so

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
that way you can spend one day in each

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
park type of thing Disney does have a deal

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
it's not a park hopper per se but it's one

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
day one park for like two days

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
you know but again just kind of

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I think the park hoppers are a little better for what

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Jamie said you can hop literally hop from one

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
park to the other but don't forget the California

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
adventure ever since they finished their

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
remodel with Cars Land

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
and you know redoing some of the rides

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
it is a premium it's not a joke

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
anymore it's a premier park it's a

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
fun place to go you can spend an entire

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
day there easy the next thing in the email takes

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
me to that point we are from San Francisco

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
so the draw of an authentic northern California

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
experience from Disney's California adventure is not

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
a factor for us they're changing it well

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
that's gone yeah don't worry about it because

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
that I mean well like they have a

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Ghirardelli shop in the wharf area

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
but I mean they completely change like the thing to

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
represent the palace of fine arts is now

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Ariel's freaking grotto ride or whatever

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
it's not what it used to be no it's not

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
they even took down at the time it was the

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
world's largest ceramic mural

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
the Whoopi Goldberg movie is gone

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
and that's saying a lot but definitely

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
go see the Aladdin thing trust me

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
go see the Aladdin thing it's awesome

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
um I do

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
like the toy story roller coaster

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
shooter midway madness that's

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
super fun just make sure to bring Advil

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
because your arm will hurt when you're done

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
and I like not if you're a guy

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
no you should be used to that

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
back and forward motion just

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
maybe not no it is kind of low

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
isn't it let's keep going with the email

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
la la la la la

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
and I like the one roller coaster

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
that's in the dark and stuff oh there's a lot of

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
easy ways to practice I mean

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
you know what

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
anyway I'd like to hear the host's thoughts

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
and recommendation tell your girlfriend

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
she might need to practice

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
only if she's in to reach around

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
stand across the room this poor emailer

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
was not anyway I'd like

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
to hear the host's thoughts and recommendations so I can

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
start budgeting and planning this thanks and

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
keep up the great work yours truly

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
AZHP

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
yes we actually

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I took Dan to see Aladdin

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
and I saw Bobby saying that you

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
took him to see I did when we went

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
after E3 I took Dan

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
and I went to see Aladdin and we sat next to an

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Australian guy and his son and his son

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
was so adorable but we kept chatting with the guy and

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
told him places to eat and that type of thing

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
see Bobby and I did both

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
parks in one day but he's been before

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
and there's a lot of things that Bobby's

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
like I don't need to do that

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
I don't need to do that like Bobby didn't want to do

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
like the upside down roller coaster

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
you know there's certain things on his list

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
so there wasn't an upside down one

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
at California Adventure there is oh yeah

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
California but it's not even that bad

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
it's so smooth

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
my other suggestion would be if you and your girlfriend

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
can kind of put out a list and you kind of find that

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
you know there's

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
some rides we don't really want to do

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
maybe you can do them both in a day

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
but I would say take the time to take it slow

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
if you want to make it

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
really romantic dude

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
get some reservations at Carthay Circle

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
or Blue Bayou

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I think Carthay Circle is

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
really good

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
the food's really good

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Blue Bayou is a classic you have to kind of decide

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
if you really want to get laid do both

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
well you know

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I typically do Blue Bayou when I'm there for my birthday

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
and lunch is cheaper and still

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
romantic

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
yeah and you get free desserts if it's your birthday

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
at any rate

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
actually

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
this is what you should do

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
get dessert reservations

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
for Fantasmic

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
have you ever done that?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
not for Fantasmic I've done World of Color dinners

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
but for Fantasmic you basically have a big dessert bar

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
and you get to sit

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
and getting to sit during Fantasmic

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
is the best part

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
but you get like

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
really good ice cream desserts

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
and cake and stuff

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I went with Kristin and Megzy for that

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
and it was fun

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
alright we could have a Disneyland podcast but we better move on to the next email

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
just talk to us later trust me

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
OLR helping you get laid for

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
520 episodes and counting

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
last email

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
greetings OLR

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I decided to send you guys an email

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
since you have been getting very few recently

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I'm a long time listener and a second time emailer

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I wanted to share my thoughts

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
on Grand Theft Auto 5 and the PS3

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
with you the game looks great and I have enjoyed

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
the past games ever since GTA 1

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
on the PC however I don't own

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
a PS3 or Xbox 360

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
so I cannot currently play Grand Theft Auto 5

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
with the recent price drop of the PS3

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I am tempted to pick up one

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
and it's 199 euro

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
the one with the 12 gigabyte

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
and flash storage but I am not

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
sure if this is a wise purchase

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
with the new consoles coming out the system is

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
dying and money is tight as I'm

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
saving it for a new PC for work

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
do you think it is worth

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
waiting for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
is there any indication

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
that this time around there won't be a PC

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
version they've already seen coding for the PC

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I think there's going to be a PC version it's just

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
not going to be right now

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
on top of that you won't have to worry about graphics

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
since you're saving up for a new PC right

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
it would be

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
interesting to hear your thoughts on the purchase of a console

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
near the end of its life cycle but with new machines

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
on the horizon is it still worth

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
it because it is a blu ray player

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
and does Netflix and all that

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I mean yeah it's fairly cheap

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I mean it depends on what

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
your needs are you know you can build a PC

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
that has a blu ray player in it too and does Netflix

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
we have a PC hooked up to our

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
TV right now at my house

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
the only thing that we do not do

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
on that thing is watch blu rays

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
which we use our PS3 for

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
so it's just a matter

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
and you might even find system refurbs

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
that are even cheaper

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
so you'd have to check

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I'm not sure that you've got craigslist

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
but I'm sure that you've got

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
thrift stores and the equivalent

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
of flea markets

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
places like that

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
so you might even look into finding one

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
at any other place

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I would say too don't forget that this generation

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
of consoles will not be backwards compatible

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
with the upcoming

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
you know what I mean the PS4 will not play

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
PS3 games and the Xbox One will not play

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
360 games I know there's

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
the Gaikai rumblings out there and so forth

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
but we haven't really seen that gel together yet

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
we don't know what that's going to look like right now

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
so you know something to consider

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
if there are a lot of console games you do want to play

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
out of this generation then go ahead and take the plunge

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
and get one of the consoles because

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
this is your chance although PC

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
certainly there's a lot on

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
you know of the stuff on PC I think you really

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
have to evaluate where are the

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
games I want to play

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
and I think in that it's okay to assume

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
in that case I will be able to play Grand Theft Auto

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
5 on PC in a year

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
can you wait an entire year?

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I'm almost certain it's going to be less

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
than that but

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
we'll see

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I guess it does come down

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
to in the end how badly do you want it

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
and how quickly can you recover the

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
money that you spend on it

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
me personally

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
if something was coming out

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
well you know what I'm not actually going to

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
say that I've done it

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I got a 3DS

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
because I wanted to fucking play Animal Crossing

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
and what did I do?

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I asked around on the internet

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
if anyone was selling their 3DS

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
and lo and behold

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
uh, sidekick was

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
and so I

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
bought his for two

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
shout out for gamebooey.org

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
two network cards

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
and then we went right out and bought Animal Crossing

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
and then Dan picked up

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
the last

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
fire emblem for the Wii

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
so

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I'm not one to talk

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
freaking buy it

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
you really do

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
have to weigh out how badly

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
do you want it and I'll tell you this

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I've played Animal Crossing every day

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
since I bought it

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
which is saying something for me playing

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
a game every day

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
so if you're going to play Grand Theft Auto 5

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
every day then you know

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
it's probably a worthwhile purchase

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
um

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
and yeah you do get the benefit

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
of a blu-ray player it's probably still a cheaper

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
blu-ray player I think when Becky bought

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
hers, my best friend

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
when she bought her actual

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
dedicated blu-ray player

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
it cost her about maybe

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
150 something

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
dollars which would

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
probably be less in euros

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
but it only plays blu-rays and you're

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
getting a game system out of it that does Netflix

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
and does all this other stuff

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
and like Rob said there's no backwards compatibility

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
so

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
weigh that and decide what you will

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
so to continue with the

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
end of this email

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I love listening to this show on my commute to work keep it up

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
thank you

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
this email is brought to you by Belgium

the fairy tale land of waffles chocolate and beer

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
you know what else we could do

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
though if we were in Belgium Rob

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
broadcast live from that emailers house

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
besides that we could go

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
we could actually cheaply travel

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
and meet all of our friends that live in

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Europe we could go talk

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
to our official Swede

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
we could go hang out

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
with Sil we haven't heard from AK Ripper

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
in forever I would love to do an OLR

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
episode with Sil it would be amazing

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
and then we can go find

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Mr. Kidman didn't they used to have those

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
contests like for MTV or whatever back in the day

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
where like MTV would broadcast at your house

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
if you want a contest we need to have like an

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
OLR comes to your house contest

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
whoever pays the most

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
wins

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I'll be a fun

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
kickstarter thing I want to go to Europe

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
let's do a GoFundMe

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
OLR goes to Europe

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
alright

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
if that's it for emails

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
yes all two

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
of them I will tell you

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
mailbag at

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
orangeloungeradio.com

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
if we don't get enough emails this next segment

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
will only get angstier

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
FUs of the week

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I'm fairly pissy Rob

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
why? cause of stuff

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
ok so I have a list

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
fuck you to my air conditioner

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
because when I turn on the air conditioner

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I don't want a face full of the inferno

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
I want a face full of cold

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
thankfully it's cool enough outside

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
FU I'm not gonna say FU

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
because the rain made today a lot nicer

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
but it rained for Sacramento

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
for this time of year

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
and we're going into our rainy season

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
but it freaking rained and I was at Apple Hill

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
I was trying to enjoy myself

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
instead I'm having to slog up

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
a red muddy hill

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
and then

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I thought I was taking a picture

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
of a pig's cute little tail

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
no I took a picture of a pig taking a piss

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
it's on my tumbler for any reason

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
also FU to

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
guys who want their woman to take care of them

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
and not do anything to contribute

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
of course FU to the other way around

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
it takes an equal fucking partnership

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
it takes two to make a thing

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
go right

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
well true

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
if you are in a relationship

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
don't expect a free ride

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
do your fucking part

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I'm not gonna say FU

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I'm gonna say FU

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I'm gonna say FU

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
if you are in a relationship

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
don't expect a free ride

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
do your fucking part

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
okay

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
it takes two to make it out of sight

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
just

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
FU to my throat hurting

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I hate that

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
that's annoying

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
my FU of the week

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
goes to

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Thunder Valley Casino

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
in Lincoln California

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
fuck them

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
and one of their machines ate it whole

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
but here was the best part

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I took my mother to go see Kathy Griffin

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
at Thunder Valley Casino because my mom

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
loves Kathy Griffin

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
by the way FU to Kathy Griffin sorry honey

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
you just weren't that funny

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
like you're funnier in your bravo specials

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I could tell we were being workshopped

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
sorry hun just wasn't working for me

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
you know the one time I saw George Carlin

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
was on one of his workshops too

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I've seen Margaret Cho on a workshop tour

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
and it was like half and half you know

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
so where was I

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
oh yes my mom loves Kathy Griffin right

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
so I want to take my mom out to something she enjoys

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
and she gave me $20

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
because she's like I want to help pay for the ticket

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
even though the ticket was like $70

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
so I want to help pay for the ticket I'm like okay

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
so I took her $20 put it in a slot machine

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
right in front of her

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
and I was like your $20 is gone

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
mom she's like Rob

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000
that's why you don't gamble Rob

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
you should know better than to gamble

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
you know what though I'm very sad

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
that the buffet wasn't open for you guys

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
it was open it was just very crowded

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
the buffet there

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
and for me who's not a huge buffet fan

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
their buffet is fucking good

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
but the coffee shop was good too

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Alan took a picture of that burger

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
and you know they do have fatburger there

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
but my mom didn't want to go to fatburger

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
my mom wanted to go

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
and you know Rob

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I don't want to eat at the buffet Rob

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
people just cough and sneeze on everything

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
that's how you get sick

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
buffets give you diarrhea Rob

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
I adore your mom you know

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
and your impersonation is hilarious

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.000
did you see the vine I posted of my mom

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I had to delete the tweet

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Rob I didn't say you could put that on the internet Rob

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
put it on tumblr

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.000
she didn't say I couldn't play it on my show though

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I'll have to bring that up

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I'll bring that up later

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
let's do a news story

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
and then I'll come back to this topic

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
let's talk about the ever

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
continuing saga

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
and the Ouya Frida Games program

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
well Ouya has removed one of the games

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
from the Frida Games program

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
and that would have been the one that was

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Dungeons the Eye of Drakonas

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
you know the one that they

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
blatantly admitted that their family paid for

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
you know the back

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
or the backing of that kickstarter

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
so they have been removed

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and you know they of course

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.000
saying oh appears we were thrown under the Frida Games bus

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Ouya gets their fall guy and Gridiron keeps their money

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
but the thing was though

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Gridiron I don't believe

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I believe they dropped out of the whole Frida Games thing

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
they said they cancelled the kickstarter project

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000
or yeah they have no plans to develop

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I guess on the Ouya or something like that

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:00.000
because I remember they said they made a ton of

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
they got a ton of backers as it was

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
so they didn't need to develop exclusively on the Ouya anymore

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
and also on top of this

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000
the whole Frida Games fund has been tweaked

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
now no longer will

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
the games have to be

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Ouya exclusive

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
instead

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000
they are saying for every $10,000 in rewards issued by Ouya

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000
in matching crowd funding efforts

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
developers will need to agree

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
in one month of exclusivity

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000
but they could still publish on PC at the same time

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000
so they don't have to just launch on the Ouya

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and then also they are saying that instead of $50,000 as a minimum

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
the requirement is now $10,000

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
so $10,000 and then for every $10,000 raised after that

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
they will be backed

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
another $10,000 I guess

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000
and they also have to have a minimum of 100 backers to be eligible

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
is this going to fix the problem

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
that this thing has been having or is this too little too late

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I think it's too little too late

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
and at the same time I still think people will try to game it

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I mean because

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
you know the gridiron thunder thing

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I don't think the whole reason that they are saying

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
oh we need funding to finish this game

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
but the game is literally coming out in like two weeks after it's done

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I'm sorry I just don't buy for

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
oh we need that $100,000 to finish the game in two weeks

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000
I could see like a game that's coming out like

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
a year from now or something

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
ok then you need the funding

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
but if a game that's already pretty much done

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
and they are just putting it out two weeks later

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I think it was just to make up some money

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.000
ok we have this really shitty game we made

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
it's going to be an exclusive the Ouya

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
but who gives a shit because we made our money back anyways

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
from them matching our funding

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
so I think that's what the scam was there

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
and I still think that you can see that

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
someone has a game that's ready to go

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
and why not let's put it on Kickstarter

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
put the goal at $10,000

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
and if they can hit it

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
they make another $10,000 on top of it

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
and it could be a good game

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
at the same time I think it could help indie guys

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
but it's been exploited three times already

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
so you know

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I don't know

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I noticed that you are selling your Ouya on eBay

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
at this point and do you want to give a quick plug

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
how somebody can get a hold of that

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
you can follow me on Twitter

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000
it's just on eBay

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
$32 right now

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
yeah BlackWolf points that out in our chatroom

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
at live.vognetwork.com

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Loki's Ouya is only $32 on eBay right now

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
and $32 with a

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
there's still the unused code

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
remember they did that stupid thing

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
you're our elite

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
you Kickstarter backers and we're going to give you

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
$13.37

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
store credit on the Ouya shop

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
but they didn't use that store credit

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
so that code is in there

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
so really it can track about $13 off that

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
so it's still a pretty good deal

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
and it works

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
once again

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I don't have time for all this stuff

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
and I need to slim down

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
you know

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
money is tight of course

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
it happens

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
especially this time of year

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
alright can we go back to stories about my mom

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
alright so we're at the Kathy Griffin concert

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
and they're playing pop music

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
and my mom doesn't listen to pop music right

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
so she hears this song

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
by Will.I.Am and Britney Spears

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
have you heard this song?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
this is what's playing

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
my mom hears this

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
so my mom can hear this

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
in the lyrics and she's looking at me

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
because Alan's sitting in between us

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
she leans over and she looks at me

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
and she gives me that look

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Rob, what is this song Rob?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
like you wrote the song?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
like I wrote the song

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
and then there's a later part in the song

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
where it goes

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
you are now now

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
it's this part

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
oh shit

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
live radio

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
just play the part

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
and when that came up

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
my mom looked at me and goes

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Rob did Britney Spears just call herself

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
a bitch?

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I think that was Britney comma bitch

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
if it works like a duck

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
right? so I decided

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
so what do you do? you have to capture the moment live

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
so I whip out my cell phone

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
and I make a vine

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
what do you think of this song?

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
I think Britney Spears is a skank

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
what's vine?

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
oh you don't know vine?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
it's like twitter but with videos

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
you can only do 6 second videos

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
and they loop

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
so that's the vine I made

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
is my mom's opinion

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
on will.i.am and Britney bitch

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
what do you think of this song?

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I think Britney Spears is a skank

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
if she knew I was playing that on the internet

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
right now she would kill me

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
she was so pissed that I uploaded that to twitter

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
she was so mad

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
she was so mad

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
that I uploaded that to twitter

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
no this was literally her concern

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Rob

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I don't want Britney Spears to see that

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
like Britney follows

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
like Britney follows my mom

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
I'm like Britney doesn't follow you

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
well one of her friends

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
might tell her

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I think that she's been called worse

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
right?

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
and let's be real

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
she is kind of a skank

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
but she is entitled to be a skank

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
if she chooses that

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
it is her choice as a woman to be a skank

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
to be free with her love

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
she's also a mother

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
and that's what feminism is all about

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
the right to make choices

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
and not be judged by the man

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
or whatever

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I wish I could show my mom

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
all the love she's getting in chat right now

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Act F says love Rob's mom

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
gamer girl says hahaha

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Rob's mom rocks

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
she does rock

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I hope we can get her on the show in the future

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
I adore your mom

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
but I don't think your mom and my mom should ever be in the same room

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
no they should not

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
especially when my mom's on one of her pissy rants

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
alright

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
one more story tonight

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
and then we're going to open up the skype line

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
at 1877 game OLR

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
or our username on skype orange lounge radio

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
and this last story has to do about a game

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I don't think we've talked about this a lot on OLR

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
but I know a lot of you guys have played this

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
here too

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
it's called slender the arrival

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
have you played slender man at all?

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
you may have seen my livestream

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I did on twitch right

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
I remember them in super mario galaxy

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
no no no no no

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
this game is scary as hell

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
and I literally screamed

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
while playing this game

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
actually I think slender the arrival is the sequel

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
that has whatever

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
well here's the thing guys

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
it's about to get support officially

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
for the oculus rift

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
as if the game wasn't

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
scary enough

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
now you can immerse yourself in the world

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
and become best friends with the fence like I did

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
in slender the arrival

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
yep it is

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
officially getting oculus rift support

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
apparently this was actually teased at pax 2013

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
but this is something that is actually happening

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
in a patch

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
that just came out for the game

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
it's like a beta mode there

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
good luck with that

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
so all I'm hoping is that maybe bobby

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
maybe in a years time bobby

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
will be a little more willing to

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
subject his oculus rift to

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
some other things

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
so before I have the gummy bears

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
maybe I can play a little slender man in oculus rift

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I'm still waiting he got a youtube of me playing

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
the oculus rift

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
and I'm sure it's funny

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
fifth dream

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
to my bff friends

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
it wasn't me it was my mom

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
alright yeah but you made it where britney

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
can see it rob not anymore

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I had to delete the tweet

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
we need to get my mom on the show

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
it's still out there if you know where to look

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
alright

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
so there it is slender man on oculus rift

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I know a lot

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
of folks here on olr don't know my friend

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
gemit which if you listen to horde house

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I'm sure you've heard him he's contributed to the show

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
a number of times he hosts his own show

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
except it is also live on sunday night

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
so unfortunately we're up against each other but

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
gemit does some amazing live streams

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
of oculus rift

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
if you think I scream like crazy

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
you should see gemit

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I'm just going to give him some props and a shout out

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
alright

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
that's it that's it for stories

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
it's time to go to twitter

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
twitter.com slash olr

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I love twitter too but

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I like the live calls a lot

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
orange lounge radio on skype

researching vacuum forming

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
doing some vacuum forming stuff

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
is actually the guy that is doing the cross plane

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
I didn't realize because

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
I immediately clicked his

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
his other links

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
jmo1986

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
sent a tweet that said currently at tokyo

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
game show 2013

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
telling people I meet in line about

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
olr and vog network and

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
spreading the word

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
you sir get a fast clap

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
we ask at the end of every show

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
if you like what you hear tell a friend

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
or two about the show you are doing that

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
you are a good man

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
yes you do you get the official

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
olr gold star tweet of the week

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
we just made that up

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
but you get it

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
let's see

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
act deft sends us a tweet

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
developer way forward

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
wants to make a my little pony game

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
and rallies bronies

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
to tell hasbro to make it a reality

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
way forward

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
of course made duck tails

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
what they made contra 4

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
some of their games have been a little hit and miss

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
but more so probably hits than misses

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
talk to act division because I think they're the one that has a hasbro license

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
do they?

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
least they do for transformers

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
and they

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
no wasn't skull girls able to get some my little pony

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
stuff or was that no no it was like characters

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
made by the same person

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
it wasn't skull girls it was that

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
the fighting is magic thing

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
where they now it's something different

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
yeah

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I don't remember who has like the family party

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
games now because it used to be

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
I thought it was act division

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
then it was or EA

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
and now it's Ubisoft

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
maybe I don't know that keeps getting tossed around

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
wow I've never seen quite a

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
more polarizing tweet in our chat room

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
blackwool says don't do it way forward

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
spend your time on better projects

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
and rama says fuck yes way forward

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
it will happen mark my words

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
and act dev says game loft

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
has the mlp game

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
you know what

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
if they can make

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
mick kids they can make

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
a fucking my little pony game I don't even care

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I don't care there's been a my little

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
pony game and I think it was on the Nintendo

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
back in the day and it was the good

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
my little pony the kind I

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
I grew up with so fuck it

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
if they can make sneak king

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
you go ahead with your bad self and make my pony

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
where the fuck are my goddamn new 360

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
connect games for burger king

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
seriously that was promised to me like

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
five years no not five years ago but like

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
a few years ago

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I'm very disappointed that there's not a follow up

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
to sneak king because that was a fucking

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
brilliant shit right there

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
all right uh tiger claw says it's an

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
interesting tweet uh Lucasfilm

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
will combine video games and movies

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
to act the post production

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
process kind of

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
interesting there I'm kind of reading

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
into this too it's uh coming from

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
a website he links us to the enquirer

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
not to be confused with the trash you see at the

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
checkout counter uh but this

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
says video game engines will be

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
used in filmmaking with the two disciplines

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
combining to eliminate the

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
movie post production process

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
well this actually kind of makes sense you

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
know video games are getting so realistic

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
these days that I'm sure

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
they can probably mix in

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
you know some of the stuff

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
they do with movies like in the engines

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
really kind of ramp up the process

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
with uh making some of this that'd be fun

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
like you can move characters around

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
in the movie and stuff interactive

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
movies it's like using

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
the force for real uh tiger claw

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
also sends his tweet the playstation 4

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
exclusive deep down

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
set to be free to play

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
or wouldn't it be even funnier if you could

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
reskin the characters that are in the movie

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
or something like that anything's possible

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
I want Jar Jar to look stupider

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
uh more stupid

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
quickly before I go to the phones capcom

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
announced to Tokyo game show 2013 that the

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
playstation 4 exclusive deep down will be

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
free to play uh you might remember

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
this had come out at uh what was it E3

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
or something they were showing that off so that's kind of

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
surprising yeah so very cool

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
uh more on that in a minute but first we're gonna go to

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000

people hating on the MLP game

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
but okay I know it's

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
it's tough to be a brony

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
yeah yeah well I'm not gonna

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
talk about that I wanna talk about another thing

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
alright something a little less controversial

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
that's fine what's up Agdeft?

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
kinda controversial uh

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
but still

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
oh man when it was all charity

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
like that EA bundle was all charity

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
those people that were buying the codes and

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
selling them on eBay scum

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
and then what when they got confronted it was just like

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
well you know the demands out there so

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
you know we're just you know people don't have to buy em

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
bleh

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
yeah I really hate those people

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I even uh

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
there's a Facebook group I follow

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
uh it's a local group

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
that sells or resells games

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
and anime stuff and all that

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
and there was

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
one people there was a person that sold

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
the origin bundle

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
and like

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
maybe four times

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
the price he paid uh

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
for all the games and I was

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
like dude seriously

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
those games were sold like

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
for a fraction of the price

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
you paid and they were

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
especially they were all

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
for charity so it's like

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
what the fuck

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
and now the same thing happened

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
with another person

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
in the same group

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
she's selling the humble bundle

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
the nine games

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
and other

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
bundles for like

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
the original price and I'm like

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
seriously what the fuck

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
yeah I'm gonna admit Agdeft and I know

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
some people do this but I'm just

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
gonna say it even makes me uncomfortable

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
when people just give away one or

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
two codes you know I don't

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
and I've called out other

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
podcasts not by name but I've called out

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
shows, podcasts,

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
websites, blogs that

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
give away bundle codes

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
that are piecemealed from

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
somebody else's bundle the games they didn't

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
want and like it's

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
one thing when it's between friends

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
and so forth but you know

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
let's not forget

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
a lot of this money goes to charity

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
and it goes to the developers

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
when you piecemeal it like that you're

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
kind of taking it away from them

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
and it's like these bundles are such a great

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
deal like it's just I don't know like I

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I get really bothered by it

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I play devil's advocate though I mean sometimes like

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
especially with humble bundle nine I know I have some extra

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
games I need to give away I already

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
have those games and like

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I'm buying the bundle and I'm getting it anyways

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
like and I can't I can't

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
redeem it twice you know what I mean

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
again it's one thing if you're giving it to a

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
friend or you know somebody like

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
even somebody like a Twitter follower that you know for

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
a long time I mean that's kind of one thing

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
but it's just like another to like use

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
it to profit yourself

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
and your own brand

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
if that makes sense what I'm saying because I'm still like

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
like follow this website and

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
get a chance to blah blah blah

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
you might you know you might

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
still be like oh okay I'm unloading my free

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
codes but if you think about it

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
that why doesn't your friend that wants to

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
take the code just pay five dollars

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
to the site and have the

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
four bucks go to charity or whatever you know

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I don't see a problem if it's already over like

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
that bundle is already done

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
yeah yeah I'm I'm it's it's not

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
as bad let me just let me just put this away

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
I don't mean to be all like if you do this I hate

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
you I'm not saying that at all

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I'm just saying you know think about it

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
shouldn't we be encouraging

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
people to go buy the bundle themselves

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
because eventually the money

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
does go to charity right

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
and especially in the case of the EA bundle

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I mean one can argue like

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
you know and I think Act Deft you had a funny story

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
about this like you know I bought a bundle

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
but I don't fucking want Fez

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I am staying a hundred miles away from Fez

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
it's that's

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
kind of a different set than what I'm

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
I'm talking about you know what I mean

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
that the irony part of that is

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
that I that I that I gave money to

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
the developers and forgot to take

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
out the uh the part of Fez

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
so oh well no well

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
yeah I don't think you can piecemeal it that way

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I do get uh what you're

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
saying because I I did it

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
uh with my

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
uh separate codes but I

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
gave it to people that maybe wanted the game

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
and I didn't uh like profit

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
from it I didn't

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
want more followers I didn't want

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
more people to follow me on

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Twitter or Facebook I guess

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
hey who wants a code for

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
this game and this game oh yeah

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
I want one and and

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
some were uh close friends so

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
I don't mind that

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
but yeah like you said like

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
oh follow me and

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
get a code or something like that yeah that's

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
that's pretty shit I don't mean to be

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
like calling people out or whatever maybe

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
maybe a little bit but because Bobby's in chat going

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
I shouldn't give away my bastion code on the show

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Rob hates me and I'm like no that's not what

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
it is I don't hate you I'm just saying

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
think about it this way

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
think about it this way shouldn't we

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
really be encouraging people to go buy the bundles

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
and give the money to charity and so forth

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
and then maybe after the fact you know a long

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
time when when that's no longer an option

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
maybe give away the the

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
bastion code or whatever it is that I think

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
is acceptable yeah you know if you're

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I've got probably got duplicate codes for some

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
games because I bought multiple bundles

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
and I don't mind if it's a friend of mine

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
giving away a code yeah and me neither

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I usually just give them to Dan

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
there you go so anyway

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
sorry active I just want to clarify

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
before the hate mail started rolling in

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
oh well that that's pretty much

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
it like I said

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
even then I don't

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
mind people giving away the codes

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
it's selling them yeah for a profit

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
that's yeah that's

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
the really bad stuff if you're selling these on

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
eBay if you're flipping this on eBay then

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I hate you then it's okay to say that

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Rob hates you I would I would absolutely

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
hate you if you flip these on eBay for a profit

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
so

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
about I would say six seven years

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
now wow I think the reason why

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
I remember is cause um just

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
one podcast I listened to and I don't know why

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
I remember this but it was like

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
y'all's fourth birthday

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
and uh

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
I think at a certain point um

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Dark Soccer had said like

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
we're this many and they like

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
held up a certain amount of fingers and you were just like

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
yeah that's great radio

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
very yeah that

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
sounds like our show yep that's been us

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
forever that's that's it she does that every year

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
too except now she couldn't do it

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
this year cause she'd have to put up a toe

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
as well

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
I stick my nose in the air

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
right so that's just how I keep tabs on

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
how long I've been listening so it's uh

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
it's great to finally call in this time

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
uh I've gone under different

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
cedar names or whatever you want

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
you want to call them so

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000

of people that listen on the podcast that just

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000

they just can't be here no matter where they are

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
some people are watching the Emmys

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
or Game of Thrones

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000

uh as of recently

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
obviously Grand Theft Auto 5 is occupying

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
a lot of my time uh

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
got it on PS3 since I've uh

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
kind of chosen to boycott any

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
type of Xbox related

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
not Microsoft but uh

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Xbox related um products but uh

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
um yeah other than that

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
um Grand Theft Auto 5

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Borderlands 2 I know is

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
not as of recent but

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
um a lot of PS3

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
so are you uh looking

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
forward to Playstation 4 are you gonna give it a little

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
little uh little while before you pick

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
one up I may give it

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
some time I am really stoked about

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
the Division Tom Clancy's The Division

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
that looks amazing um

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
but just the one game isn't enough for me

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
to you know drop coin on

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
a on a $400 system so

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I'm gonna wait till a couple other games I like come out

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
and then I'll uh I'll merge

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
fair enough fair enough

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000

see you Ty don't let the bed bugs bite

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I'm fantasizing right now Rob

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
CPK I haven't had

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
California Pizza Kitchen in like forever

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
do you wanna go to CPK sometime this weekend

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
or something I do I just have to have

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
a good week and then I can go alright we'll

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
figure something out because honestly I'm in love with

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
a pair of Gorgonzola pizza I

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
like um

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
I like the barbecue chicken pizza

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
but you can kinda get that at the grocery store I know it's not

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
the same thing the Jamaican Jerk is pretty good yeah

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
but but I'd say when I'm feeling extra

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
trafe it's the shrimp scampi

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
pizza with extra garlic

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
alright now you're making me hungry

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
damn you alright 1877

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
game OLR our username on skype is

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
orange lounge radio we can probably squeeze in one more call

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
and you know I love the long time listener

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
first time caller calls like yes

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
sort of I think he said he called in once before but

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
I still love it's been a little while

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
by the way but I love the regular

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
if I said how many we were now I'd have to drop

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
the mic there I'll do this

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
we're this many

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
I put it on the table they can't see you

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
so unless I take a picture

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
and then you'll get mad at me for taking a picture

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
no then I'll channel your mom

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
ah but I want that on the internet Britney Spears

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
might see it

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I don't want Britney's friends to post it

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
as if Britney Spears gives two shits

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
about orange lounge radio you know I had a friend

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
that went to high school with Britney Spears really

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
he said she was a total bitch

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
alright I got a few more tweets

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
here uh SSG100 Matt

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
sent us a tweet about this I want to get your

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
thoughts on these all in one

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
classic gaming machines like the

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Retro N5

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
gaming purist friendly?

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I've seen reviews

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
of some of those the key word is

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
purist and I'm going to say if the word is purist

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
then no they're not gaming

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
purist friendly because pretty much these

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
things are emulators in a box

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
and so they are going to have the slightest

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
things wrong with them but if you

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
just want shit tons of games

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
in a box to play on the TV

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
99.9% of people don't really care

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
and so whatever go for it

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
with the big problem with some of those

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
by the way in reviews that I've watched cause Dan and I

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
watch reviews for a number of those things

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
typically it's sound cause keep in mind

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
especially with the Super Nintendo it had that

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Sony sound processor you're

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
not going to get the same quality

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
it'll come out sounding it'll

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
miss sounds or something you'll be wrong with it

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
just so you guys know on the

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Retro N5 if you hadn't heard of this

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
it has five cartridge slots

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
look at that the NES

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
the Genesis and Mega Drive

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
the Famicom so you can play

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
not only NES games but Famicom games and then

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
they have a GBA, GBC,

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
GB slot that plays all those

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
games so Game Boy games on that

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
as well and you can hook that up to the tele

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
and play those games

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
HDMI output that's pretty cool

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
that makes me think of is there's

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
this person Dan watches a lot

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
of this one

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Engineer

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
who basically just like tries to build

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
smaller portable versions of systems

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
I forgot what his name is but there was another

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
link from that channel of a person who

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
built a

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
like a 30 game system

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
just by using the parts

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
out of their old systems

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
you know use the CDX bit to build

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
all the Genesis bits and

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
and had like this series

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
to have it run off of one power

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
supply and one hookup cable

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
so they got

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
I think one successfully working version

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
of it but it ended up being some

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
prohibitively expensive thing but it legit runs

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
on the actual hardware

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
at live.vognetwork.com says if you're really

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
a purist you'll play your original game

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
carts on a 300 pound 22 inch

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
CRT TV from 1993

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
you know what though

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Alan brings up a good point with that and that

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
is the one plus side about these

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
systems is that it plays

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
through HDMI port

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
let's be real a lot of modern TVs

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
you can't hook up classic game

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
consoles to them you cannot hook up

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
an Atari 2600 to an HDTV

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
without some mega converters

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
that will cause loss of quality

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
that's why things like game room were so awesome

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
I thought they had RF adapters for that stuff

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
yeah but you're having to you have to change

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
RF adapter into RCA

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
you have to run it through a converter which in those

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
things can sometimes be expensive

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I don't have systems I can't play anymore

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
but the Nintendo you can still use like even the

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
original NES had RCA plugs

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
but it was only yellow

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
that's why you buy an old ass VCR

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
and you hook it up through that

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
well they actually

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
do have a number of adapters now

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Dan gets them at Radio Shack

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
that are RF converters

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
because that's how he

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
gets his

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
Intellivision, not Intellivision I'm saying

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
the Atari 5200 to play on

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
flat screen monitors

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
by using the HDMI hook up with an RF converter

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
but we have one system that

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
will not play on anything new

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
and that's our Odyssey 2

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
it is so old

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
For the Fallen Dreams is in our chat room as well

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
it says remember when channel 3 and 4 was the game input channel

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Pepperidge Farm remembers

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
I remember well because

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
in Sacramento you had to use channel 4

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
because channel 3 is a legit

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
channel here, it's NBC here

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
so you have to use channel 4 because

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
you could never get a signal on channel 3

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
it's noisy because of the

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
KCRA

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
3 was a used channel in Mobile

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
but I would still use it because it would actually be clearer

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
for my screen signal

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
yes it's true

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
there's a channel 4 in the Bay Area but the signal is very weak

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
here in Sacramento

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
but I would always get pissed off because

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
my brothers would try to steal the remote

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
and they were little brats

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
well they're still brats

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
but they're older brats

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I will never

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
forget being young

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.000
and trying to get the channels

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
from San Francisco

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
I don't remember why I was doing this

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
but one time there was something

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I really wanted to watch that the CBS channel

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
here wasn't airing

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
so I had to try and get the

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
antenna just right

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
I could get channel 12 out of Chico

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
just right

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
and it's like don't let go of it

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
you won't be able to see the Charlie Brown special

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
or whatever stupid thing channel 12 was airing

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I had a fun day when I was sick

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
and staying home

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
now keep in mind the town I was born in

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
is Dothan Alabama

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
which is a good 4 hours away if you drive through Alabama

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
it's like 3 and a half if you go through Florida

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
so I was sitting

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
going through the static channels

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
because I would do that for fun

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
don't ask I was weird

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
porn

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
no I was 8

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
it doesn't matter

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
and so one day

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
I managed the Dothan channel

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
came through

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
and I was sitting watching WGN

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
that was the Chicago station that would get through

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
cable but it was like

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
whatever the Dothan station

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
that I used to watch soaps with my granny

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I was watching TV

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
all day on the static ass Dothan channel

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
and then figured out

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
that if you put tin foil on your rabbit ears

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
you can get a really

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
good signal

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
because at night they're allowed to increase the power

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
so you can get stations from

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
all the way to the midwest

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I think we can get stations

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
I know we can get them from Colorado, Seattle

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
we can get them on AM

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
and I know where I get that from is my dad

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
because I remember growing up my dad had one of those

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
it was a radio that did the shortwave

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
and he used to listen to stations

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
out of the Netherlands

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
and things like that

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
not that he could understand it

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
now we have internet radio for that

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
well remember when OLR started

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
on Live 365

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
and we went to that award ceremony

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
when they were kind enough to nominate us that one year

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
and then forget to read our name

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
a lot of the people we met

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
in that community were all guys

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
and girls that used to do like ham radio

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
and that type of

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
I never realized until that day

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
how many people

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
from the ham radio, shortwave radio

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
kind of just naturally fell into

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
internet broadcasting

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
as a natural place

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
well you know some of those stations

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
that do the weird signals

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking about

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
there's one that's out of Russia

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
that every so often

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
dialogue would come across

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
and it sounded like someone was just holding up

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
a microphone to a machine that was going beep

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
all day at a certain signal

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
I listen to that because sometimes

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
it's pretty fun and you can hear

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
odd things going on in the background

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
or the ones that give the weird frequencies

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
or the ones that I'm interested in

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
and every so often you can pick those up on shortwave

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
as well

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
alright, well that's going to do it

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
nobody else is giving us a call

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
and we are through all of our tweets tonight

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
so I want to thank both our callers tonight

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
and if somebody else had something to say

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
be it live or podcast

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
don't forget you can always email us

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
mailbag at orangelandradio.com

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
or you can tweet us like some of our listeners did tonight

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
at twitter.com

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
twitter.com

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
it is definitely time to wrap up

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
the show here

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
I don't listen to the radio anymore

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
in my car

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I miss DJs

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I think AM is still a good way to get traffic

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I know we have it on iPhones

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
and all that, but I still

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
on the phones, all you can see is it's red

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
and it's not always accurate

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
because I think a lot of them are running off Caltrans

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
reports, but when you listen to traffic

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
on AM radio, they'll tell you

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
we're flying over the bridge and it is backed

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
up all the way to this point

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
I like being able to hear that

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
so when we drive to the Bay Area

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
you better break out the Travel Connect 4

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
you're going to be here a while

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
Alan and I listen to 740 a lot when driving to the Bay Area

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
to get their traffic updates

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
and I use my cell phone to listen to

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
music for the most part because I have an iPhone

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
yeah, I love Stitcher

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
and all that stuff and podcasts

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
I just play my own stuff

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
I actually have a playlist called Random Mix

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
that's video game music

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:19.000
anime, J-pop, and all the other weird crazy stuff I listen to

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
well you know they are saying, it's funny we bring up AM radio

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
they're saying that AM radio

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
I saw a story on this this week or last

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
on one of the big websites like Google or Yahoo

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
that AM radio is kind of dying

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
it's a dying art form

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
because so many people have switched to internet

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
and iPod and running that in their cars

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
and so forth, which is great news for us

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
and what we do

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
but kind of a sad day

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
it's the same thing that I run into

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
being that when I

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
picked my major

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
my focus was print media

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
as far as design for print

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
when it's all

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
really now print design is

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
more of a

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
special field now

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
it's dying too, it's just sad

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
because nothing smells as good as a print shop

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
alright, we need to wrap up

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
we can reminisce all freaking night

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
and some of you might like that

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
but I think it is time to wrap up the show

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
thank you guys again for downloading Orange Launch Radio

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
and checking out our show, we really appreciate it

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
and you know what we say, if you like the show

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
please tell a friend or two

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
or five about the show

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
talk about us in a convention line

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
like somebody on Twitter did there this week

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
help spread the word because that's all we've got

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
we don't have an AM radio station

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
backing us and putting ads out there

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
or anything like that, so word of mouth

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
is all we got, thank you guys as always

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
for your support of the show, let's go around

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
and get everybody's final thoughts tonight

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
we'll start with you, your final thought tonight

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
my final thought

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
is I'm going to play more

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
Grand Theft Auto

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
that's a good final thought

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
I hate Dreamweaver

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
and my final thought tonight is that

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
if you are in the Sacramento area

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
you need to make plans on October 12th

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
to come see the Rocky Horror Picture Show

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
at the Colonial, starring yours truly

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
well, co-starring me, but I will be in it

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
so, there you go

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
that's it

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
we're done, we're out of here

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
we'll see you next week, right?

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
I sure hope so, have a great week everybody

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
happy gaming, and we'll be back in 7 days to do it all again

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
good night

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
see you next week

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
thanks for watching!
