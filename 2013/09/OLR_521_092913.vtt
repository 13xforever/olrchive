00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, Valve's 3 announcements have come and gone. What did they reveal that didn't have 3 in its name?

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Wii Lamento were LucasArts games lost at the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros. Roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Oops

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Oops

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
Hi there everybody, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc, etc, with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Empress Sakura of Normandy

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
So just a 3 hour DarkSakura lovefest

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are, but here you ain't shit

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, I'd like to make an announcement

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Assholes

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
You got stung by one, didn't you?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes I did, in my car

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, why did you invite the wasp in your car?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I didn't invite it in my car, the little asshole, he just barged on in, I'm gonna hang out in your car

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Asshole

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And I'm super allergic, not like EpiPen allergic, but pretty allergic

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And so, thankfully I was at my friend's house and I was like, Benadryl

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
So you're here and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Alright

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Fucking assholes

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Hello

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm fine

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
No

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Glad to hear it

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
We are live, of course, Wednesday, or excuse me, not Wednesday, Sunday

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
It is Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
We do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
At the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And of course, if you are listening live, you can join our chat room

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Live.vognetwork.com

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And you can participate along with our show

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
And whatever games we might be talking about tonight

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Although, oddly, we were kind of looking things before the show

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
It was a slower of news weeks. I know we have some big announcements

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Especially in the PC universe and so on

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
We'll get to those here before too long

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
But otherwise, it's kind of a relatively quiet week

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 5 still?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
What is it? A billion?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Eleventy billion dollars that game's made? Loki?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It's over a billion, so

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't know what the exact numbers are right now

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
It's crazy

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
A lot

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I got to tell you, I almost caved and bought it

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
That's not good enough

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
It was all the chatter about the online stuff

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And joining the VOD crew

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Why are you going to miss out? It's starting in a couple days

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I know, I kind of want to do it

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
But then I'm like, Rob, it's $60

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
You're going to be pissed when it comes out for PlayStation 4

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I resisted

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And I continued playing the games that I already have that I need to finish

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, according to the VG charts

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
The top global seller is obviously being Grand Theft Auto 5

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
It sold a total of about 17 million copies already

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Wow

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And that's as of the 21st

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And that's worldwide, right?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Worldwide

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Has there been a release besides America? Is it out in Europe or Japan yet?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, it's out everywhere

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Here's the thing, though

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That's the 21st

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
That's over a week ago

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
It's only been selling a ton since then

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Gosh, alright

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Let's see

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Where was it?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, Dungeon Buster in chat says Grand Theft Billions

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
That's pretty much what it is right now

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Grand Theft Billions

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
There was one kid that stole a car or something

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And shot some people and they said

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Right, right

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I mean, they'll try to tie it with him

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No, that's because he's stupid

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
They'll blame it on anything

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I mean, it's just like there was another one

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Another one of those

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Kid brings a gun to school or something like that

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
And they blamed it on Minecraft

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So, seriously, it'll be anything

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Wasn't there that horrible tragedy happened in DC

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
There was a gunman that did a shooting

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And I want to say it was either this week or last week

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
And didn't they peg that on?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
He played video games, sure enough

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, well that explains everything

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
He played Call of Duty, so therefore, you know

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
That's right

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
It's just dumb because they're willing to like, you know

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Think that's okay to say that

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yet, at the same time, they could say

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
You could just easily draw the conclusion

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, he ate food

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Food made him kill people

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean, because all of these murders

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I tell you what

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
All of the murders that have ever happened

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Tied the food

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Because people eat

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Food causes murder

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You know what

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
If video games really, you know

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Caused a particular action

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And wearing cat ears all the time

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And throwing books at people

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
If video games caused

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, we're in for the apocalypse

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Because there's 17 million people out there now

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That are murderers

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
If any food drives people to murder

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
It's probably mayonnaise

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
And that's why I avoid it

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Mayonnaise is awesome

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
You shut your whore mouth

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
You murderous woman

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Barf

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Barf

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Somebody call the cops

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Because somebody's got to get killed over mayonnaise

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Mayonnaise is really good for your hair

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Why would you

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Something that's good for your hair

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Why would you eat it

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Do you eat shampoo?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
No

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Beer is good for your hair

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I drink lots of beer

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, well I take a bath in beer

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Would you take a bath in beer?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
As long as I could, no

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
No, because then that would be alcohol abuse

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
And I just want to put my head in and drink it

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I saw that on Family Guy today actually

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Did you now?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
You know what, actually last night while I was playing Final Fantasy

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I was, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Which is like some of the best apple cider ever

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And I was like, well I'm getting dizzy

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then I kept trying to go to bed

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
And then I kept doing more quests

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I was having a very classy weekend

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Friday night, Alan and I

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We wanted to go to this new restaurant in town

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
But it was way too crowded

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Which, you know, you know that place

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
We love that place

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Pita Kitchen

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And then we went by Safeway

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
It's like right by there, right?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
So we went by Safeway

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And we got a bottle of barefoot wine

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And some Ben and Jerry's

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And I brought it home

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
With my bottle of wine and Ben and Jerry's

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
By the way

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You know what's sitting in my fridge at home?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I have a bottle of apple wine

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
From the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Delicious

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I need people to help me drink it

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Help you drink liquor, I can do that

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Alright, look

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Moving from our classy weekends

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
To a little bit of a kickoff topic

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And then we'll get into our gaming weeks

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
To talk about this latest hacking project of yours

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Because you've talked about it on the show

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
A little bit in passing

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
But it's one thing to kind of talk about it

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
But it's another to see it

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So here in studio tonight you brought it

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And I apologize to listeners because they can't see it

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It's not anything yet

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
But it's just the monitor that I'm using

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, you have like a flat screen monitor

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
But not like

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Like it is literally just the screen part

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
There's no base

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
There's nothing

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, there's no like

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
What brand is this?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
This is an on lap

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It's an on lap

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I forget what they call it

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
But here I'll show you how nice it looks

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
It's pretty sexy looking actually

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
That's a pretty big big looking monitor

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
It's a 13 inch monitor

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Normally if I didn't get such a great deal on it

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I wouldn't probably be using that

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
So what exactly are you doing with this?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm basically building almost like a

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Wii U tablet

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But for

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Like PlayStation 3 and

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Xbox 360

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You're not talking about like an emulator type of thing

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Or anything like that are you?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
No, it's basically gonna be a wireless HDMI

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And it will sync up with

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You know

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Whatever

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I hook up HDMI

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Or whatever I hook up the transmitter

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I'm still a little lost

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Tell me like an application

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
How this would work with a game

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Like as you say

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Like okay

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So basically I would hook up

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I would use this

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And whatever console I wanna play on

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Say like an Xbox 360

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You know

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm gonna have controls

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Like you know

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Like you would see on the Wii U

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Gamepad

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Or like the 360 and stuff

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
And

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
So that's still something you're gonna attach to

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah it's something I'm gonna attach to

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm gonna build a whole new case for it

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Okay that's interesting

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
And then

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
What was I gonna say

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So there's that

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
And then on top of that

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
There's gonna be

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
This like switch

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I can switch between PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And so it's gonna have a wireless transmitter

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That's HDMI

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
That you plug into whatever console you wanna do

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And then it wirelessly transmits to the receiver

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Which is gonna be built into the unit

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
So you have wireless video and audio

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Up to like 30 feet away

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And then the controllers are obviously wireless

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Although I'm still running into a slight problem

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
With the PlayStation 3 one

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
It's gonna be a little bit more challenging

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Because when you plug that in

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
To charge it off

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Or run it off USB power

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
It shuts off the wireless radio I believe

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
As it does like you're building like a portable

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
360 that works in your house somewhere

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Well it's a second screen

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because it's basically just pulling

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Whatever signal

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I can hook it up to

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Well I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Because that's sold

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But if I had another OUYA

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I could hook it up to that

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So basically anything that has an HDMI out

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
That's compatible with a PlayStation 3

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Or Xbox 360 controller

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
What's the why on this

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Like I know for one

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You just like to have these projects

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
And do it because you can

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's because my wife watches the TV a lot

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And right now I'm sitting there

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
On my computer monitor

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And playing games

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Which is fine

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
But it would be more comfortable

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
If I could sit on the couch

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
And just kind of kick back

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yes so this is something like

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You could play Grand Theft Auto 5

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
In private with that thing in your lap

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And not have your kid be able to see you

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Shooting hookers on the television

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah he'd be asleep

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
But yeah basically

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay but it's still like a way

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Or okay so the wife can watch

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You know Scandal

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
And you can

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Whatever it is she watches

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
And you can do that

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Okay

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
There you go

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I was gonna show you real quick

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Let's see

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
This is not a great example

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
But here's my computer monitor

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I mean so the

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You know it'll do

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay so since this is radio

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Basically Loki is holding up this

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
This flat

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Like basically because it's a flat

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Picture time

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah you can do a picture

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I'll put it on my tumblers

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I know not all

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah it doesn't weigh

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Like hardly anything

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
It's just like maybe a pound

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah not all our listeners

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Are gonna

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Are gonna go look it up

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
So let me describe it

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
It's

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
It kind of like because it's just

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That very flat part of a computer monitor

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
It's almost like a tablet

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
And function

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And you're literally looking at

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
A Windows 7 screen

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
With Firefox open

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
On this like little tablet

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
So is that a touch screen too?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
No

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
No

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
So it's literally just the monitor

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Because it's just

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
It's a USB powered monitor

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
That's important

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Because the whole thing is gonna

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Run off a battery

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Because it's gonna be wireless

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Otherwise I'd have to plug it in

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
So yeah

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
It's USB powered

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Which is pretty awesome

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
And I've actually tried it out

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
With an Xbox 360

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I have another cable that's not

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Hooked up to this that

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It converts it to

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It splits out the audio

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
From the HDMI

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Because

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
You know

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't have any speakers on this thing

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So I have to build that

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Let's see

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Says

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I have another TV

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
But I just

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
The problem is

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
You know setting up systems

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
And moving them around and stuff

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
It's just a lot easier for

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I don't know

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I just want to build this

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
You have to understand Brad

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
This is the very manly man side of Loki

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
That now it's a thing

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And once it's become a thing

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
He will stop at nothing to achieve

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Said thing

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Unless

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
There might be like that one little thing

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
That just derails the whole thing

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
And they'll be like

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Ah forget it

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Like what happened to the building

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
An arcade machine for $100

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Or whatever that was

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Um

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I just lost interest

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
See

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
See

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
It

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I didn't need another arcade machine

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I had two I wasn't using

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So why build a third

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And also it didn't help that the PC

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
That I got for that

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Was defective

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
So

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
You can't really

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So you get what you pay for

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Pretty much

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
It just wouldn't power up

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
You know go fake

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Um

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
So yeah

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I just

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I ended up

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Well I didn't even really part of the PC

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I just threw it away

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Because it was just not working

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
So

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Um

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I just

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I lost interest in that

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Um

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
But

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Now that I'm gonna be playing Grand Theft Auto 5

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You know

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So I'm

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Definitely interested in having a screen

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I can play that on

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Alright

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Fair enough

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Especially with the online component

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Of Grand Theft Auto 5

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Starting soon

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Ah it's next week

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
And I'm sure it's gonna be absolutely

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
You know

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Disastrous as far as

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You know

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Being able to connect to it

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Uh

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Quick plug for the VOG Network crew

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
How many people are in that now

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Like 20 at least

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Um

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
There's quite a few

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Um

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
So yeah

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
So

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Um

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Uh

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
You can go to our forums

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
And check out

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
We have a thread on it

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Otherwise you can go to

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Socialclub.rockstargames.com

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Slash

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Crew

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Slash

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
VOG Network

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
And check it out

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
And

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
We're seeing right now

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
How many people we have in there

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
20 members

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
There you go

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
So

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And I even promoted Bobby

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
So

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Well there you go

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Bobby is now promoted to

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Commissioner

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Commissioner Bobby

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Commissioner Bobby

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Nice

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I appreciate that

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
If I know how it's gonna work

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I wonder like

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I'm gonna be playing both

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Like all my co-workers

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Have the PS3 version

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
And they want me to play on that

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I just hope that my progress

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
moves with both

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Like it's in the cloud

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well they say it's in the cloud

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
And stuff

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
And they say that like you can

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
When the Playstation 4 version

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Comes along that your

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
You know

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Multiplayer information

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Goes along with that

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
But

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I just don't know how exactly

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
That works

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Like you know

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Cause they have special editions

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Of stuff you could've gotten

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
For one or

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
The other system

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
They add different perks

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
For your characters

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
But I don't think I can like

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Save my character on

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Playstation 3

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
And then transfer it over

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
It may just do my stats

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And that's about it

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
But

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't know

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
We'll check it out I guess

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Alright well

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Good luck with this

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
New project of yours

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
How long do you think it's

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Gonna take you to finish?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Well I'm just testing everything

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
As I go along

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
So I'm getting the

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Wireless HDMI stuff

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
On Wednesday

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And then

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
The hardest part

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Is gonna be

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Making the case for it

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Cause

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah how do you do that

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
And then also

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I have to get a battery

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
To run everything

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Which I figured out

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I need a 12 volt battery

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Then I'm gonna use a

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Step down to

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Drop it to 5

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Volts so that I can get

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
More amps out of it

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Cause

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
It's basically gonna be powering

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
About

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
4 or 5 USB powered

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Things you know

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
The two controllers

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Cause there's gonna be

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
The internals for

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
You know

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
DualShock 3

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
And then also

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
You know

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
The monitor

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
And then

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
The wireless HDMI

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
So

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
It's four things

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
And

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I think there's something else

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm forgetting

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Speakers

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
We believe in you

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
We believe in you

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You'll get it

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Well I'll see

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
At the very least

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
This monitor's pretty cool

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
So

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It is a nice little thing

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
It looks like a tablet

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Looks expensive

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Alright

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
$35

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Wow

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
That's how much of a steal

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I got that for

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Normally they go for about

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
$250

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Where at?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
eBay

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Nice

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I bid snipe

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
How much

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Speaking of eBay

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Before we get into

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
How was your gaming week

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
How much did your

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Ouya go for on eBay?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
$80

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Well that's good

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That's really good

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
That's not bad

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Considering you paid what

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
$90 for it?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
$99

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
And $80

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
That's not bad

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
And also

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Funny enough

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Actually Saints Row 4

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I sold my

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Xbox 360 copy of that

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Cause I have it on PC

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
And I don't really play

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
The 360 version

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
That went for $14

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
So I was

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I would have bought that

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
For more

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah exactly

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
There's so much

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Counterfeit shit on eBay

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Of new games

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
You gotta be really careful

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Remember a couple years ago

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
When Alan got me that

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Child of Eden

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
That came from China

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
And it wasn't even

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Like we opened it

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
And the box was

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Like Assassin's Creed

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
And it was very clearly

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
A burned disc

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
And it was

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
A piece of garbage

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
And he had to go

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
The whole thing

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Where you file the complaint

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
With eBay

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
And wait

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh god

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
What a mess

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Well you just gotta

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Go watch

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I've got

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
The

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
It's some big box set

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
For

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
The Guild

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
On DVD

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
So

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
But it hasn't

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Streeted yet

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
So I can't put it up there

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Lowkey's eBay shop

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Alright

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I love the Guild

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Alright

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Let's talk about

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Our gaming weeks

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
The types of video games

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
That we have been playing

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
This week

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
So Dark Soccer

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Wanna start us off

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
What have you been playing?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Salad

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Salad the game

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Princess Tomato in the

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Salad kingdom

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
No

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm actually legit

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Eating a salad

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I've been playing

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I've been playing

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Final Fantasy 14

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
And

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Um

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I got really irritated

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Because I couldn't do

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
The next

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
A story quest

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Until I

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
And I thought that I was

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Ahead levels

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
And then

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
No you have to be 27

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
So I'm running around

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Doing just shit

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
And I'm in this one place

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
As a

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm a quarry mill

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
For anyone who's playing

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
And everybody there

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Like you can just follow

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Hoards of people

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
From blue dot

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
To blue dot

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
It's hilarious

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah it's uh

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Fate parties

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
If you actually shout out

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
And say

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
You guys all like

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Any contributions

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Are pooled

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
So you get more

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Golds that way

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
It's a trick people use

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
In leveling

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I just ignore everybody

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
That works too

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
They don't exist

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
In my mental universe

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You can do enough

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Side quests

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
And other things

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
To you know

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Level

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Um

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
So I mean I hit it

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Obviously

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
While I'm drinking

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
So I was like

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Okay

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
And um

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I uh

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
What else did I play

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Animal Crossing

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Of course

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I haven't really been

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Um

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
So I asked

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Bejeweled

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I don't know why

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
It's just fun

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
It's a nice little

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Time waster

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
And I've actually

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Gotten pretty good

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
At the diamond mine

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It's a good potty game

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It actually is

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
A really good potty game

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
My iPhone has changed

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
The way I use the bathroom

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Rob

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
There's a shirt

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
That says that

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
And I want it

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Um

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
And uh

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Dan had

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Beat GTA 5

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Mm-hmm

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I've now been

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You know

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Randomly going in there

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
And hearing you know

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
It's been pretty funny

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
But you're not really

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Interested in playing yourself

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
No

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I don't

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
You know what

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't care how good

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
A game is

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I have no tolerance

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
For misogyny

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
You have to have also like

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Just some interest in it

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
You know

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I have zero interest in it

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Now if it was you know

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I want to do like

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
A lady Grand Theft Auto

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Where it's just this

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Hardcore

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
You know

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Woman

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Tearing down the patriarchy

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Play Saints Row

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Because you can kind of do it

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Saints Row 2

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Saints Row 2

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Not the other ones

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
But you

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
But it's

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I really have no interest in

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I hate to say

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I have no interest in the culture

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Because clearly I have an interest

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
In various aspects of culture

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
But it's not something

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That appeals to me

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
So

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't really care about it

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Fair enough

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Alright

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I'll go in and watch Dan play

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
For a little bit

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
And I'm like

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
I'll just roll my eyes

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
And go

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Really?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Because

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh my god

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I have to tell you

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
What happened the other day

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I was pumping gas

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
And this guy comes up

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
And says

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
You know

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
One of the

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Can we do your windshield thing

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Fluid you know

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
So that they're trying

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
To sell you something

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
And I said

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
That's okay

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm not interested

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He's like

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Oh well I hope you have

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
A better rest of your day

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I got so mad

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I said

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Would you have asked me that

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
If I was a man?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
And he's like

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I thought not

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
But you know

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It was like

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
God I hate people

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
But yeah

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't know

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I've been a little bit

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Hypersensitive

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
What in the hell

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Does that have to do with games?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Because

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I'm just saying

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That I've been so hypersensitive

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Lately

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And just really pissed off

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
At everything

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Especially after talking

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
With my mother

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
That I think

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I would vomit all over

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
GTA V

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
At this point

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
In a feminist rage

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
You're missing the point

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I mean honestly

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
If you're gonna vomit

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
All over GTA V

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It's a story

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
It has guys in it

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I mean

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
So what

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
There's not a fucking female lead

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Boo

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Hoo

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Get over it

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Seriously

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Everybody needs to get over it

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I can see where

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Well here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I don't care that it has it

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I just don't have to play it

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It pushes the envelope

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
As art does

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Right

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Video games are art right

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
And Grand Theft Auto

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Definitely pushes the envelope

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
In a lot of ways

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
But for me

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Grand Theft Auto

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And everything that's in it

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Again

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I don't put

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
A game like Grand Theft Auto

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
On any different platform

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Than I put movies

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
And Grand Theft Auto to me

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Is just one of those like

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Brosy action movies

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Exactly

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
That are out there and exist

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
You know

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And there's definitely

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
An audience for it

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
A lot of those movies

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Really do well

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
But there's some people

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
That just aren't really

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Interested in it

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Just like

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I bet Loki

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Wouldn't be caught dead

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Watching The Notebook

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
You know

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I've already seen it

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I haven't seen it

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
And I don't care to see it

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Well I mean

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
It's just

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
It's a genre that

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I am not into

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I mean

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
If it had more things

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That I think

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Would appeal to me

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
As a player

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
You know

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Then I might give it a chance

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Like I tried Saints Row

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Saints Row 3

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Or the third

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Or whatever the fuck it was

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
It wasn't very fun

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
So what exactly

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
About Mass Effect 3

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Made for a good game

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Versus Grand Theft Auto 5

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Well first of all

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
It actually told

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
A very solid story

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
There was very little

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Misogyny in it

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Which

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
But you haven't played

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
So you have no fucking clue

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
What the story is like

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Um

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I've actually sat

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
There's a great story

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
In fact

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Three stories

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Throughout the entire

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Campaign of it

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
There's

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
I just don't understand

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
How people can get off

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Saying that there's

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Not a good story in that

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I mean

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
The whole game is compelling

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm not saying the story

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Isn't good

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I'm just saying

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
It doesn't appeal to me

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah but you're

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Blaming it saying

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
You're saying that

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
It doesn't have a good story

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
And Mass Effect 3

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Has a great story

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I didn't say

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It didn't have a good story

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I said

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
It doesn't appeal to me

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
There is a difference

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Between something

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
And not being

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Something that I'm into

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You know

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
For example

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Okay

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Misogyn

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
The play

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Great story

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I don't really care

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
For the play

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Um

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Chicago

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Great movie

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Great story

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I hate everybody in it

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I don't

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I've seen it once

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't care

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
To see it again

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Breaking Bad

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Just won an Emmy

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
And I think

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
We're going up

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Against the finale tonight

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
And I'm sure

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's a great show

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
And I hate that show

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Okay

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
And I'm sure it's a good show

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
But I just

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I'd rather

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Do other stuff right now

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
But I mean

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Anything

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
That's kind of where I see it

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Is that it's like

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Alright

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
So Breaking Bad's

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Winning all these awards

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
And I'm sure it's a great show

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm not gonna

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Sit here

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm not gonna sit here

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Not the show

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
But it's just like

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Ain't nobody got time

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
For that right now

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
For me

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Here's another

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Here's another example

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Okay

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I have a bajillion friends

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
That are into Buffy

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
And I love Joss

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Because he can tell

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
I have a few episodes

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That I like to watch

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
I really don't care

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
For the series as a whole

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
The end

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You know

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
It's the same thing

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Something can be good

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
On its own merits

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
But if it's not your thing

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
You don't have to watch it

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Or like mayonnaise

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Again

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I really hate mayonnaise

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
What?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Actually it is like mayonnaise

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Mayonnaise has

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Very good culinary applications

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
But if you're not into it

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You're not into it

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
You know

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Alright

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I like boobs

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Some girls don't like boobs

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Another thing

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Self hating women

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I guess we'll leave it at that

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
If that's it for your gaming week

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto 5

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
And I played a ton of it

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And even had the time to

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Shoot some video for a funny little

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Montage thing

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
That's set to

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
The music from the movie Rad

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Because it's

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I haven't seen your video yet

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
It's just weird

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
For me

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
The movie Rad

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Because I was looking

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I don't remember what I was doing

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I was browsing

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
YouTube

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
And you know how I make recommendations

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
For you and stuff

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And I think I watched

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
What was it

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I played the navigator on there one time

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And so I recommended Rad and stuff

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
So

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
That movie is really fucking cheesy

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
If you've ever seen it

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
It is super cheeseball

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
They have like

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
A scene at a dance

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Where they're riding BMX bikes

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
To like

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Send me an angel

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It's just like

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
What the hell is going on

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
So I was like ok that's really funny

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And so I had Trevor in the game

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Doing all those bikes

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Running from the police

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Hitting people with his bike

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Firing a shotgun and stuff

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And I thought the juxtaposition of that

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
With the music from the movie

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Was fantastic and hilarious

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So I decided to

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Make a short YouTube video

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Called Breaking Rad

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Cause you know

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
He's a meth dealer

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Fixed

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
And uh

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Are you gonna try and go viral

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Like Bobby's article did this week

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Oh no

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
It's not gonna go viral

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It's just

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
It's just a funny video

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
So that's all

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
But yeah

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
So I played through that

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
And I'm actually

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
At the very end of the game

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
So

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm trying to finish

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
The single player campaign

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Before

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Online starts

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Cause I do wanna do online

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I think I am gonna have a few days

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Though because I know

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
You know online launches

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
On Tuesday

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
But

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Come on

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
They even admitted to it

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
They're like

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
So listen

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
We know how online

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
You know

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Multiplayer launches have been

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
And

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Trust us

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
You know

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
We're gonna try to make sure

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That that's not gonna be the same way

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
But

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
It's probably gonna

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It'll break

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
It's gonna

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You know

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
It's gonna be broken

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
It's gonna be

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
You know

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Bumpy

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
But

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
You know

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Just give us some time

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
You know

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Cause that's

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Seriously with the

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Rockstar Social Club stuff

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
This week

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
So they

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
It's been tough

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
And they've been trying to

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
You know

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Deal with 17 million people

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Wanting to try this stuff out

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
So

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
You know

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
17 million people

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You know

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Or even like

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Half that

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Hitting up a server

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Trying to play online

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
What was the strategy

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I apologize if you've covered this

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
On the show before

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
But you know

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Now that it's coming up this week

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm thinking about it now

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
What was the strategy

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Behind delaying it

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
And not having it

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
When the game launches

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Did they just

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
They purposely wanted people

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
To spend some time

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
With single player mode

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
They wanted people

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
To rush to get into

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
The multiplayer portion

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
And they wanted you to enjoy

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
The single player portion

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Of the game first

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And they wanted to make sure

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That everything worked properly

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
So

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Um

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I mean

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
There's a lot of stuff

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
In the world

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
So I can understand how

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
You need to make sure

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Everything's

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
You know

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Tested

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
And you know

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Catch any flaws

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
You may have

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
With your servers

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
And that kind of stuff

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Especially since they've had

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Trouble with the Social Club stuff

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Going to our chatroom

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
At live.vognetwork.com

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Dungeon Buster said

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Social Club was pretty rough

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
The game had issues

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Connecting to it

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Uh

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
SEG is in our chatroom

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
And says I'm glad they

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Separated out the release

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Yeah

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
So I could play the single player

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
And get a little bit of

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
A handle of like

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
You know

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
The map

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
And also kind of like

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
How you do heists

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
And just all that stuff

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I'm gonna totally 180

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
The topic on you here

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
But this conversation's

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Making me think about this

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
And it's not in our show

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Roll tonight

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
And it is pretty big news

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
The uh

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
New Batman game

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
That's coming out

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Uh

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
This uh

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Fall in

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
A month or two

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
And this

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
The Wii U version

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Will not have multiplayer

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh shocking

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
They've said that before

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
The Nintendo

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
You know

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Online component

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Just isn't

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
They don't think

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
There's enough people there

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
And it's honestly

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Probably not an untrue thing

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
But

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Because of it

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
This is the news that came out

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
This week

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
The Wii U version's

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Going to be ten dollars cheaper

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Uh

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Whereas the other versions

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Will be sixty dollars

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Because the

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Wii U's missing the multiplayer

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
They're gonna knock ten dollars

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Off the price

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Some people are saying

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
God

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I wish they would do that

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
For 360 as well

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Or I wish

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
This is an offering

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
We could have for games

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Where

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Knock ten dollars

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Off the price

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
For multiplayer

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Which is kind of funny

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
To me

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Cause isn't this like

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
The inverse

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
But in a more consumer

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Friendly way

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Of the online pass

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Cause

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
The online pass

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Was ten dollars right

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Cause I'm thinking like

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
If

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
What I'm reading is correct

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
If games were ten dollars

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Cheaper to begin with

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
We wouldn't have a problem

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
With online passes

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Here's what it really

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
That's the way I read it

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I think they're just

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
It's marketing spin

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Is gonna be ten dollars

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Cheaper

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Wasn't a decision

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
That they made

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
When they

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Put it out

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I think what it is

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Is that

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
The Wii U's stuff

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Doesn't sell as well

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
And so they have to

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Lower the price

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
To make it more attractive

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
To people

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Buying games

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
That's really the true

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Story of it

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
And the fact that it

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Just doesn't have multiplayer

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
I don't think it

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Would have mattered

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
They would have

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Still put it out

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
At sixty bucks

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Anyways

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
If they thought

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
They could get away with it

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
But that's really

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
What it comes down to

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You know

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Market down ten bucks

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
To try to see

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
If we can move

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
A few more copies

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
It's not

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
But see

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Now they've gotten

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
A lot of PR spin

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Out of it

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
You know

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
So it's very positive

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
And you know

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
That helps them out

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
As well

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
But it's not

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
It's not specifically

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Because multiplayer is missing

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Trust me

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Because

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Shit

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
They omit stuff

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
From all different

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
You know games

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Across platforms

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
And there's never

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
A price break

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Because of that

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
It's always because

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
It's a pretty sweet

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Deal

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Seeing

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
It also has

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Gamepad support

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I gotta be honest

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
I'm interested

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
In the new Batman game

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
I don't know how

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I feel about multiplayer

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Part of me says

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Eh get it on

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
PlayStation 3

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
But even

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Arkham City

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Armored Edition

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Was kind of lame

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
As far as the

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Gamepad support

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
It was pretty much

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
What you had

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
With the PS3

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
I don't

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Let that

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Effect my opinion

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Of the new Batman game

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Because

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Well A

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000

And

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Are they starting to do away with the

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I don't think so, because

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We're gonna have a w-

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Mario Kart 8, etc. etc.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
But

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Could this idiot be on to something?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Weeee

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Without the gamepad

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
You think

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Then why not just get a Wii

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Cause it's not HD

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Well why not get a

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Why not get a 3DS then

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I'm happier with my 3DS

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Alright, anyhow, I'm just

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Anyway, alright

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
For the love of God, just do what you're gonna

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You know that's gonna happen eventually

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
It's gonna happen

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Or even regular DS games, like Clubhouse games

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Anything, it's gonna happen

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
But, I just wish

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If they were to do that

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Why can't I play a

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
DS game across the internet now

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
That should be something

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I should be able to do, feasibly

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Why can't I fucking do that

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Like, the technology is there

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
If you're gonna sell DS games on

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
The Wii U, let me play Clubhouse

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
games with friends on the other coast

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Instead of having to be in the same room

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Because, I mean, I'm just going back to the

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
One 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Go to the International Island and chat

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
With people in Japan

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And do the stupid

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Club Tortimer games with them

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And, you know, and usually

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I don't have too much of a problem communicating

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Because either there's a chance that

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Between the Japanese I know and the English they know

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We can get a point across

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But, I mean, if they're letting you play with people

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
You know, across the ocean in a game

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Like Animal Crossing, why can't you play other games

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And actually

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Now that I think about it, that may have actually been

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
The game I called out, Clubhouse games, you may have actually

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Been able to play that across the internet on the DS

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Did have some internet enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You could do online, right?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But, you know, there were

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
A lot of games you could only do in the same room

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And it would be really cool if you could open that up

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Camera in it, why can't we

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Be able to see friends while we're playing?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Or see dick while we're playing

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Or boobies

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
This is a huge kind of topic change here

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
This is going back to a story

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
From a long time ago

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But we talked about this extensively

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
On OLR when it first happened

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Because it had a local connection

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And this goes all the way back to the year

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I think it was 2007

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
When this all happened

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
No, or would it have been 2006?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I think it, no, it was 2007

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
When did the Wii come out? Nintendo Wii

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Was it 2006?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Well, here's the thing

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Here locally, in California

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
There was a radio station

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
In Sacramento, specifically, where our show is based

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Which is The End

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And they had a contest called

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Hold Your Wii for a Wii

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
You guys remember this now?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
The unfortunate situation is

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
That the prize being given away

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Was the video game

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And the fact that it had the silly name

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Kind of lent itself to this contest

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And unfortunately

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Jennifer Strange

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Who is a resident of Rancho Cordova

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Passed away after she held her Wii

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
She didn't even win the competition

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Unfortunately

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
But she went home and she died

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Because these radio hosts

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And the radio station didn't realize

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That yes, a person can die from drinking

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Too much water and then not allowing themselves

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
To go to the bathroom

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And people warned them during and before the contest

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And it was really

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Just a hugely ignorant thing

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Unfortunately, they were ignorant of the fact

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
That a fraternity guy in Chico

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Had passed away from the same thing

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Not that long before

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Somebody called into the radio station

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And they kind of laughed it off

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And that was the really damning thing

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
In this whole thing

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Because they laughed that person off

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And that clip really came back to haunt

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
All those people that got fired

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So The Morning Rave

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Was the name of this show at the time

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
$2.5 million in damages

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Awarded against the station

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
In a lawsuit

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But there were no further ramifications in place

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Because

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Media watchdog group, the Sacramento Media Group

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And Media Action Center

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Bringing legal action to the Federal

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Communications Commission, the FCC

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
To block the renewal

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Of the license for K-DND

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
So because of this

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Incident that happened over a Wii

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Six or seven years ago

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It's going to court

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Where 1079 The End

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
May not get its license

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And just to

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Kind of give you the local connection, living here

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I can tell you that radio station's huge

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
In this area, I think it's one of the top

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Stations in the area, it's the top 40

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Music station

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I personally don't listen to it

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Because it's like the Justin Bieber

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
One Direction

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It's more like a teeny kid's station

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So no great loss

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But that shit's really popular

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
There's still people that work at those stations

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Well, right

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Right

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And so it's very interesting that all this time later

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But they kind of bring up a good point

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I guess there was even a documentary

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Sue Wilson in 2009

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Who was the founder of the Media Action Center

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And who was a vocal critic of K-DND

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
In a documentary called Broadcast Blues

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And says quote

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
In that contest, a woman died

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But the Federal Communications Commission

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Has not acted in any way

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And you kind of look at that and go

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Well, she has a point

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But then there's another part of me that goes

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
It's been six years

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And all those ignorant people

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
That were involved with this

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Have nothing to do with the station anymore

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I mean

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Yes, it was horrific at the time

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
If it were me

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I would make it more difficult

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I mean, for example

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
To do maybe a complete

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Investigation into their current practices

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
To see that they have indeed

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Learned from their mistake

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And are staying within proper

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Health and safety compliance

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Before approving it

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Maybe give them extra requirements

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Since they had this

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
History of events

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Keep in mind for this

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
It takes seven years to come off of your

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Your report, right?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
We're looking kind of around the same

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Time frame, you know

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
If your financial

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
You know

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
What's the word I'm trying to think of

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
If your financial ability

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Is judged in terms of seven years

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Then that should be

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Clearly enough time to give a company

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Seven years to clean up its act

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Especially with hordes of lawyers

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And officials

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I think it's plenty of time

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I just think that they need to prove that yes

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
We have learned the errors

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Of our ways

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
So there you have it

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
All these years later

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
The silly name of the Nintendo Wii

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Still

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Still kind of causing these legal

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Fallouts all these years later

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Very interesting

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Well maybe it stuck with the revolution

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
They'd be spinning in office chairs

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And I do

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Funny

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Well I do have to say

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I hate you and I really appreciate you all

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
At the same time

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I do have to say that had the FCC

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Stepped in when the event happened

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That would have been appropriate

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
But it has been a little late

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And yeah I do

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I would more say that I'd want the FCC

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Held accountable for their lack of action

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Right now it would be too late

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It would just be almost spiteful

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And it's like you see all these years

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
All these years later do you know what I still

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Hear about in regards to the FCC

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Is when Janet Jackson

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
You still hear about that today

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Because like just recently

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
There was like an appeal of an appeal

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Where the CBS stations themselves

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Would not be fine because

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Oh my god people

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Oh my god it was a titty

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It was a titty

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
When you've got people stringing

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Most people

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Already seen her titties

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
With hands on them too

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Right?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It was her album cover

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Oh no it was Rolling Stone

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Oh yeah okay it was Rolling Stone

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Yes

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Well I mean speaking of her

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
She made a point not too long ago

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
That I had to roll my eyes at my mom and her husband

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
For being stupid over

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But I mean she was saying

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You've got shows where you see all of this gratuitous

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Violence but someone says fuck

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Or someone shows a boob

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And people lose their shit

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I agree we need more nudity in shows

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Seriously

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Like it is such a double standard

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You know it's like oh my god

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Oh there's a nipple

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And like they even have it where they're pretty much

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Topless but they've got pasties

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But for some reason that nipple man

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
You've crossed the line

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Why is the chat room going off about titty

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Sprinkles

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Stop giggling

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
SG100 Matt says

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
FCC is still going after

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
MIA for last year's

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Was that even last year or was that two years ago?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I don't know

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Fucking sports ball

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yes but it was Madonna

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Madonna

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But Beyonce was this year

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
What's Madonna going to do to one up Miley

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
She made out with Britney Spears or whatever

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Or there was a kiss or some garbage

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Now she needs to one up

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Madonna will have to literally

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Pull something out of her

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
She will need to have sex with somebody on stage

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
In the middle of her song

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Something is going to have to happen

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
You know what?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I have to say that Adam

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
What's-his-face that was on American Idol

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Lambert

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
My mom's a big fan

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Rob I love Adam

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Lambert

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
As my friend Susan calls

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
He should have won Rob

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Why do they let 12 year old girls vote on Idol Rob

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
They should ban little girls from voting on Idol

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Because Adam Lambert was Rob

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Because the other guy was cuter

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But the 30 year olds won with David Cook

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Just saying

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And you know Susan

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
She calls him Madame Lambert

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
But he went out

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
On some of his performances

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Being basically

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
As

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I'd probably say overtly sexual

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
As some women feel

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
That they need to do

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And he illustrated a very good point

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Why should women be expected to do this

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
But men be lambasted for it

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And at the same time if a woman goes out

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
And is classy

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
She still has a particular standard

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
That men aren't particularly held to

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And you know

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I think that the big fault

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Just has to do with

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Basically the

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
The expectations that society

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Itself is forced

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
To have

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
By what's presented to us in the media

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I think that

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
People losing their shit

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Over a boob is how they are

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Conditioned to react

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
You know

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
To this but here you go

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Alright

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Well you know

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Actually the same will go for violent video games

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Alright

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Let's, sorry I gotta wrap up

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
The hot coffee thing

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
We gotta move on cause we're an hour and a half into the show

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And not even halfway through our show roll for party

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You know what I will flip off everybody for fucking free

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
If you wanna you know

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Pay me at one point

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I'll do it too

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I can talk to you about bedazzling boobs now

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Just

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I hate to say this but Jamie

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Let's go to the next story

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Actually I do have to point out to Raginator

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That they have such a thing as bedazzling

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Think it over

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Is exactly what you think it is

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
No thanks

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
So um

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
A lot of us love our LucasArts

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And a lot of people love Maniac Mansion

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Like the

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
One of the best LucasArts games

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Well another reason to be

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Pissed off at Disney

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
They got rid of LucasArts

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
They also got rid of the game that was 80% complete

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Hadn't yet been greenlit but it was sort of a dream project

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
For a lot of people

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And it was a Day of the Tentacle

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
HD remake

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And we've had a lot of HD remakes come in

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And you know especially DuckTales

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
This one I think would have made a lot of people

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Piss themselves

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But um

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
With the fall of LucasArts

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
This was one of the games to suffer

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
You know and on top of that too

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Was they had a Star Wars

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Smuggler game

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
They had a Death Star Ios game

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
A lot of stuff that was in

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
In process including

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
A Star Wars First Assault

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Sad face

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be most

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Now if I found out there was a Loom game

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I would have gone out

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
On a rampage

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I really wish they could have

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Just like transitioned this or sold it

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
To somebody to finish or something

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
This is really heartbreaking

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And it's 80% done

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So just really really sad

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
There was a big

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Just bringing Gearbox to finish the other 20%

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What could possibly go wrong

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
There was a big expose on Kotaku about it

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And so that's where they got the information from

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Shame on you

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Sorry but the article actually was legit

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Fair enough

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But I mean that being said

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You know

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It makes me think

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
About

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
When we have stuff like this

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Oh god I hate this stupid program

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
When we have

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
You know developers working

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
On games and then just to have

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
It stop oh you're defunded

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Oh we're closing down your division

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Imagine the people that are working on this one

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
And they are totally into what they're making

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Their heart goes into it

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Imagine just that level of disappointment

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm surprised it didn't leak to the internet

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Even if it was only 80% done

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I'm kind of surprised

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Well keep in mind remember

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
What was it

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Robotech Crystal Dreams

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Well

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
One of the developers

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Levels

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And released it

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
A lot of Atari 5200 prototypes

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Dan and I have gone out and bought

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
They all have fished out the prototypes

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Made them playable and put them on

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
A repurposed cartridge and sold them

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I have a ton of

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
There's a

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
NES games, SNES games

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Basically all these prototypes out

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Oh here's an example

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Space Fantasy Zone

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Complete game

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Didn't release because of the Sega license

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
But

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I've got a copy

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
People will find a way to get out what they love

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So I would actually

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Be completely

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Completely happy if someone

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Decided to be sneaky

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
With code and get that out

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000

October 10th is more of a busy week

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000

And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It's labeled as an adventure game and it kinda looks like

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I like the graphics cause it's like an old school

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
PC game in parts kinda mixed

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
With like a newer thing that's mixed with photography

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
But uh maybe like a

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000

For you guys and the classic game of the week

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
By the way uh chatters are telling me that my

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Mic is cutting in and out sorry I

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Can't see that live when I'm doing talking

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Uh so I'm gonna try and hold

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
This thing together which is really unfortunate

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Because this is a newer mic and was donated

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
So I don't know Well it's looking a little bit more stable

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
According to the recording

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Yeah I tried to uh

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Unhook and re-hook and I'm just gonna try to hold it

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Really nice and steady and hope it doesn't cut out again

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Alright

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Steady steady as she goes

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
If it flails too bad though

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I'll have to figure something out live

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Sorry that's the

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Downside of live radio is that I can't

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You know say oh hold on guys we're gonna stop

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
While I go fix this

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Alright uh let's move on Loki

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Uh Valve has started the

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Beta for the Steam Family

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Sharing program so the first

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Thousand people that

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I guess were uh invited

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Were sent invites this week

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Um through email or

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Hopefully through the actual

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Messaging through Steam because if

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It's through email I didn't fucking

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Get that because I get so much spam

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It's ridiculous

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Thousand messages today um

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So yes and then of course you know

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Uh the Steam Sharing

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Program allowed you to share your

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Library with up to ten people and of course

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Only one person can use it at a time

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And it's a fun way to try out

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Games so um

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Yeah so once I get

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Mine going because I am playing a lot of

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Uh a lot

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
A lot of uh

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I will probably have to

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Add people to my Steam sharing

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Things so that maybe Bobby can play

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
The legit copy of Saints Row 4 and get

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Those achievements

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Yeah I'm waiting for mine to come into

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Play Saints Row 4 I'm waiting for mine

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
To get enabled too so I can uh

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Do some of that sharing and test that out and be fun

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So alright well

To love the old school Pokemon anime

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Uh uh this is way

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Back when I was in college I mean this thing is like years

Old right? Do you remember when I brought my VCD

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Of the Japanese version of the movie over?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I do I do that was great I remember going

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
To see the first movie in the theater

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I went with you

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
You saw a later one with me because I

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Now I went and saw the very first movie with my friend

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Amanda little old Amanda

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
It's too bad Seg's not listening he knows her very well

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
But Amanda and I went to

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
This this movie the first

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Movie we were the only people in the largest

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Auditorium in the theater so what

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Did we do we were screaming our heads

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Off mimicking all the Pokemon we

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Had the we had the best time ever

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
It was so fun but anyway

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Um the important thing to talk about news

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Wise is that Pokemon

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Origins is coming to

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
The west uh this was an anime

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
That is a whopping four episodes long

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But it will launch on

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
November 15th in the Pokemon

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
TV mobile application

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
This tells the stories of the very

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
First Pokemon games Pokemon red

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And blue I thought that looked like red

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
From the original uh 96 game boy

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Or excuse yeah 96 game boy

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Um the protagonist

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Named red will travel

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Through the Kanto region and uh

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Get into trouble with team rocket

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Battle his rival and challenge

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The Pokemon league also Pokemon

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
The movie Genesect and the legend

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Awakened will air later this month my

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
God how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
They only ever did what like

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Four of them in theaters I only cared about the

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
First one I know right like well

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
The second movie was also

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Great because if for nothing else

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
For the line where Jesse and

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
James from team rocket Jesse goes

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
The opposite sex is nothing but trouble

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And then James goes that's why I stay out of

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
That kind of trouble and

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Laughed my head off and that happened

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
It's on YouTube somewhere go check it out

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
There you go Pokemon origins

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I'm kinda I'm kinda thinking

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I might have to try it we'll see

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
See how much it costs for the record I like

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Digimon better

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Okay alright

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I would say let's travel back to a time when

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Pokemon wasn't around but

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
There were plenty of Pokemans around for this

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Yeah thanks to the uh

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Rule change invoked by dark soccer

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Last week ten years ago

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
There was still plenty of Pokemans

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And plenty of classic

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Classic video games that are as

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Old as this show Old as balls

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Are you saying this show is old as balls?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Probably

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Well here it is the classic game of the week

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Dark Sakura

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Now that you can rip open the

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
The PlayStation 2 era

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter you already did

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
When you picked the mosquito game

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Yes I did I've done other

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
But whatever whatever

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I've done newer games than this too now that I think about it

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
But here it is the classic game of the week

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Dark Sakura what did you pick?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I'm going with Kingdom Hearts

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Well thank you I appreciate that

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
And everybody else who bought the HD version

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Even though I go wait a minute like when this game

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Came out

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I remember playing this when it was new

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And I think we were doing OLR

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Yes

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
This game came out eleven years ago

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Oh god

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I was still in my twenties

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Because

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Fuck a bunch of that

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I love this music by the way

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
It's the Trevor's Tale music

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I freaking love it

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
So anyway it was

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Kingdom Hearts

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And as we know it's an action role playing

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Game put out by Square at the time

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Now Squeenix

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It came out on PS2 in 2002

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And it was

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
A collaboration between Squeenix

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And Walt Disney

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
And lots of Disney characters around

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's like the two universes had

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
A very cute baby

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
A very cute kind of fucked up baby

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Um

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And so this one for Square

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
To have done so many

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Regular RPGs you know their standard

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
JRPG format

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
This was a little bit of a departure

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
To be a lot more

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Action oriented

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And in my case it was a lot more

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Oh my god Donald

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Knock the fuck off I don't need healing

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Just saying that was the common

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Thing you would hear at my house

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
The really great thing about it too

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Is that a lot of

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
The character designs were done

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm sorry the

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Who had done a lot of the character

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Design in Square games

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Had a fantastic

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Voice cast I mean

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Even though at the time I think it was

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Like right at the height of the Haley

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Joel love

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And what actually has impressed

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Me is that he's still voicing Sora

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
He can still make himself sound that young

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
He's you know

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Aged a bit still kind of a cute

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Cute dude but

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I like the fact that he is that

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Talented as a voice actor that he can

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Still sound so young

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Um it had lots of

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Fun cut scenes I mean you had

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Your Final Fantasy 8

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Characters hanging around you had

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
The Sephiroth

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Thing was pretty fun you had

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Your

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Squall hanging out or I'm sorry

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Lillian Hart

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And you would get little nods

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But you get little nods um

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
To other Square games and to

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Different Disney franchises

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And it was pretty fun

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
You know and I'm not even going to go much into

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Kingdom Hearts 2 because you know that of course

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Like is newer

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It had the Tron level which was amazing

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
This game was just awesome except for the

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Gummy ship which was like my least favorite part

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I hated navigating the gummy ship

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And I kept saying why is it a gummy ship

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
When there's no gummy bears

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I mean hello

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So as far as

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
You know your characters you've got

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The main character Sora you have his buddy

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Riku and uh Kairi

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
And for the record

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
At depth I knew how to set up Donald and he was

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Still a ship

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So basically you

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Team up with Donald and Goofy

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
To find King Mickey

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And uh your main character

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Is the main uh

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Antagonist as Ansem and the Heartless

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
So

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
This game has spawned so much wank

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So much wank

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
But other characters that show up in there I mean

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You've got um

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
You know 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
You have um

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
You know major Disney villains in the game

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You've got you can summon different

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Characters too like you have the genie

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You have Tinkerbell you have Simba from the Lion King

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Other characters that you ran into

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
From square games you have Tidus and Waka

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And Selphie and you have

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Like I said Squall you have Aerith

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
What the fuck was she doing in the game?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Cid and Yuffie um

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Not dying much to your dismay

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I know. Riku from Final Fantasy

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Uh 10 was supposed to show up

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
But was replaced by Yuffie

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Um you have the Cloud and Sephiroth

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Uh showdown in the Olympus Coliseum

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
So much really good stuff

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And the story itself is so rich

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That they seem to really

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Plan on there being more than one

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
You know they were really looking ahead

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
But um

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I just I can't say enough good about this game

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
It was really amazing

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And basically

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
The way that this came about

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Was that there was a discussion

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Between Shinji Hashimoto

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And um Sakaguchi

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
About Mario 64

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Where they wanted to do like a three

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Dimensional movement

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Um but they said they could only

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
The only way to rival a Mario game would be

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
To have Disney behind it

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And Nomura overheard the conversation

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And actually

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Uh led the way to start

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Building the game and then there was

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
A meeting between Hashimoto and a

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Disney executive

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
In an elevator

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Where they were in the same building in Japan

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And magic was made

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
So they brought it together

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
It's got fantastic

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Music, fantastic voice cast

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Both and I have to say

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Both the um the English voice cast

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And the Japanese voice cast

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Were top notch after

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Hearing them in both

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And then getting Utada Hikaru to do

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Um the uh main song

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Both in uh Japanese and English

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Although honestly I think the Japanese version is

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Better I think there was a lot more production value

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Um

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And like there's some of the voice cast that they

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Couldn't get for the American one like um

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
They couldn't get Robin Williams

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
They had um

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I can never pronounce this guys name properly

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Dan Castellaneta

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Uh he's Homer Simpson yeah

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Yeah I can never pronounce this

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Castaneda or something like that

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Billy Zane and David Bourne

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Well they got the guy who plays

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
A really down on himself

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Guy to play another really down on himself guy

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I think though that isn't he also the voice

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Though in like the second and third movies

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
He was in the TV show

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Because after Robin Williams had the falling out

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
With uh Disney over

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Aladdin uh he stepped

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
In and did the voice uh Robin Williams

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Came back and did the third movie though

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
When they all kissed and made up

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
At any rate you know

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
They got really

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Really top level voice talent

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I mean sometimes when you get an RPG

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
In Japan

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
They'll have top notch voice actors

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Behind it there but we won't

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Get as big names there this is

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Probably one of the first to have really

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Significant talent

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Put into a game you know

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
You'd expect them to put in that kind of

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Uh production value

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And I don't think anybody

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Was disappointed by this game if anybody

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Was then they're wrong

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I can see though when you put it next

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
To Kingdom Hearts 2

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Kingdom Hearts 2 was you know fixed a lot of

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Problems with the first one with the camera

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And so forth

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And this was um stated

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
As um the runner up

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
For the PS2 um

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Best game of 2002 reader's choice award

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Let's see what the first one was

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Um

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Gamepro said that the battle system

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Was like the N64 Zelda games which

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Honestly I thought was really good

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And then there were actually

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Plenty of comments um compliments

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
For the AI with Donald and

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Goofy and it really was very

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Customizable I would just always get irritated

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Because sometimes Donald would do shit

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
The wrong time it doesn't get any better in the HD

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Version just letting you know

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Donald's still his stupid head but there's um

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
The final mix that came out that had

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Um a little bit

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
More stuff thrown in and there was also another

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Side another story the deep dive

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
That had uh

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Bonus stuff that you would get um

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
There's a manga around it

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
There you know like you said there was the uh

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
The uh HD version

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And there's all kinds

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Of side games that have spawned

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
From this that are all a rich

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Part of this world that's been created

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Around the game so

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I really like

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
When you have something

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Big come out and then

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Have it be a success

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And then have such a really

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Beautiful story around the whole thing

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
And there's still a lot we don't know

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Like you remember how everyone went oh shit

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
When everyone saw you know

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Riku blindfolded in the

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Organization outfit and everyone was like ahh

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And then the little ending for

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Two where everyone was in the whole

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Keyblade graveyard

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I saw an amazing Google doc

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
That was like 50 pages long that was trying to

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
And I was like and it's for kids

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
But it spawned that much

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Fan involvement and when you've got

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
When you can build

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
A dedicated fan base like that

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
You know you've really got something important

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And special so

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Kingdom Hearts is really I think one of the

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
First games that

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Spot several different levels of fandom

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Together and I think

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
That's a pretty monumental event too because

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Usually fandoms are like bitch please

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Alright

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Well there it is guys your classic game of the week

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Kingdom Hearts

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
On the Playstation 2 but of course as we all

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Know now on the Playstation 3

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
With the whole HD version which

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
In our chat room ShadowNextGen points

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Out Rob I heard they fixed the

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Remix on Playstation 3

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It's better but I still get frustrated with it

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
To be honest but I gotta

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Admit Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy 14

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Now that I finally hit end game and maybe that'll

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Calm down a little bit I'm hoping to go

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Back and play more Kingdom Hearts

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And another good thing is that I have to

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Say that it gave Utada Hikaru

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Some really really good exposure

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Here in the US

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
She's had several albums now in the US

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Two

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Well I think she had two and then an EP

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I don't think so I think it was just the

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
One that Timbaland produced and then

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
The comeback to me

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Her best of from Japan is on the US store

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Ah that might be what it is

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
But at any rate I freaking love her voice

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Alright there you go the classic game of the week

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
We're running long tonight so we're gonna

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Go right into our break don't go anywhere guys

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Though we'll be back with plenty more of

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Orange Lounge Radio right after this

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Welcome back everybody to

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Live on this Sunday night

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
September the 29th of 2013

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The 521st

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Episode of our show already in

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Progress and unfortunately

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Hear the music that we play during the break while we

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Get up and stretch and refill our drinks

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
And so forth during the break but we had

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
A fun little background medley from

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Kid Icarus that played in the break there and it just

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Reminded me how much I love the music

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
In Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Even though that game is fucking hard

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
It is fucking hard but I still

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Like to go back and play it once now

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Sitting but I can at least get through the

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
First world terror danger horror

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
You picked up Uprising right?

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I did

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
You know and that game like hurt my hand

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
So much to play I never really made

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
A lot of progress in that I enjoyed it

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
But I kind of wish they would do it on Wii U

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Didn't they say they originally had

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
A console version

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Yeah they had a Wii U version

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Alright

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Well anyway let's get into some rapid

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Fire gaming news and talk about some

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Things that will be happening unlike

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Kid Icarus on Wii U

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So there was an ARG

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
That was tied with Surgeon Simulator

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
That has now finally been cracked

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
It was a secret code that you would put

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
In the zero gravity surgery

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Mission

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And you would get sucked outside of your

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Ship and now you have

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
A brand new set

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Of surgeries you could do on an alien

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
In zero gravity with alien

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Tools and they have you do all

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Sorts of like weird

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Sorts of like gobble shaft

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a gobble

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Shaft

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
It's pretty funny

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
So check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
There's actually videos out there that show you what the access code

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Is and you can do all that

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
So yeah and then of course

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
There's the second season

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Of Mortal Kombat Legacy

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Ten episodes

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I guess they were all released at one time

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
It's being hosted by Machinima

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
If you may remember it was that live action

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Series that came out around the time that

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
The last Mortal Kombat game came out

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And so yeah if you want to check it out

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It's on YouTube, Machinima

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And ten episodes for

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Your digestion

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And last but not least

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Rockstar put out some information about

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Tuesday on the first

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Well bumpy launching on the first

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
May or may not launch on the first

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Launching in an MMO sense

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Will be stable by mid-October

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Yeah um okay so

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Basically they were talking about some of the stuff

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
And answered some of the rumors that were going around

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Confirming that there will be

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Not really microtransactions but there will be

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Some sort of online transactions to purchase

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
In-game money so they have that

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
However they prefaced

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
That with you will be able to play

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
The game and it's been balanced for

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
People playing you know the game

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Regularly and you won't actually have to buy money

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
If you don't want to but if you want to just

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Get ahead you know buy your fast

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Cars and better weapons and

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Crib or whatever

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
By all means go ahead and do that

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Some of the stuff that they announced that

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
They're going to be doing with that

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
They're going to be

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Including some different

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I guess activities

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Jobs they have

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Sports you can do you know tennis

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And all that kind of stuff that's normally in the game

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Also

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
They're going to be putting out some free

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Content at launch

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
The content creators for deathmatches and races

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Also a beach bum pack

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Which is going to have 300 items

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Like you know

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Customization items for your

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Characters as well as

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I guess

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Weapons

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Capture the flag is going to be coming back

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And they're also going to have a content creator

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
For that and they'll be

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Introducing heists

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
So that's going to be pretty sweet

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
And 700 missions

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I think is what they teased before

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Are going to be available online

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Compare that to 69

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
That are in the single player game

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
That's pretty significant

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
People have actually dug through the files

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And a couple things that have been confirmed

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Of course they have

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
As betting on horses at the track

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
So

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Hurray do you get to whip the horses though

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Like you do in derby owners club

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I don't know about that

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
That's a game I haven't played in forever

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I miss that game

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Seriously I mentioned again

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
We do have the vog network crew

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
That you can join

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You can go check out the forums

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
We have the link to that

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Otherwise I believe it's

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
socialclub.rockstargames.com

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Slash

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Crews slash vog network

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Alright sounds like if you search for

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Vog network you'll find

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
You'll probably find yeah

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Vog network or the

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I don't know if you can search by the

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
The four letter initials we have

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Vog N

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Sounds good

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Traveling around to some other news

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
In kind of the WTF department

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
There's a really weird promotion

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Between the developers flying wild hog

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And volition

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Because of I guess the publishers devolver

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Digital and deep silver

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
But there's a cross promotion between

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Shadow warrior and saints row 4

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
What is said promotion

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Why I'm so glad you asked

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Because in shadow warrior

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You will be able to unlock

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
If you own saints row 4

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And you own shadow warrior on steam

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You'll unlock the penetrator weapon

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
In shadow warrior

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
That's right the purple dildo bat will be yours

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
To slaughter the enemies

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I love that it has balls

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
In the ancient japan setting

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
That is shadow warrior

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
You play a character named wang

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
So I mean it's fitting

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I know it's just silly

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But you know anything involving

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Saints row usually is

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I'm just completely

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Unused that it has balls

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Do you want me to bring up the balls again

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
So you can giggle some more

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I'll have you know though

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
It only had balls

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Over here in this region

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And in europe

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
It did not have balls in japan

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Where I believe it was censored

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And it didn't have the wiggle physics

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
In japan either

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
So silly what they have to change

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
From region to region

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Almost everyone try a game like

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Rocksmith 2014 which of course

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Is the newest rocksmith game

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
More of a cult level music game

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Because it's not pushing

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Plastic buttons to instruments

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Well I guess it is in a way

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But you're actually learning to play

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
The actual guitars

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
It's kind of what sets rocksmith apart

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
So it definitely has it's following

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
If you weren't already aware

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
There is a new version coming this year

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
It's rocksmith 2014

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
There is a guitarcade

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Which was also in the first rocksmith game

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
But you play games

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That are retro inspired

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
For example there is a game like ducks redo

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Which is basically galaga

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
But it can't actually be galaga

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Because Ubisoft didn't make galaga

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So you know there is all those issues there

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Some of the other guitarcade items

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Excuse me games that are available for playing

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Scale racers

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
And gone wailing

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
In scale racers you will master scales

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Avoiding traffic in a police car chase

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And gone wailing will

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Make you play louder or quieter

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
To elevate characters

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And collect coins

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And lastly there is return to castle

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Core dead

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Which is a first person shooter

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Where you strum chords to kill enemies

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Cute I like that

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
That's very similar to this

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Not very popular game that came out

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
For the guitar hero controller

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It was rock of the dead

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I saw that the last E3 I went to

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Anyway

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I like that they use cute little arcade

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Games as kind of like a way to

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Make the game a little more

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Gamey I guess as opposed to

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
A tutorial or what have you

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
That's pretty cool

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It almost does make me want to learn to play guitar

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Just a little bit

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I know I have room in my house

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
For this and I will probably pick this up

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
At some point

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
It's Ubisoft's Just Dance 2014

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
The song list is out for the game

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
For Just Dance 2014

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
You have a lot of newer favorites

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Like Applause by Lady Gaga

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Gentlemen by Psy

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
That's a good song

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Let's see even Ricky Martin's back

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
With Maria, Where Have You Been?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
By Rihanna

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Oh god that horrible

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Blurred line song by Robin Thicke

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
That song needs to be removed from everything ever

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
He needs to be removed from everything ever

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
It's just a bad song

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
In better news, Flash Dance

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
What a Feelin' by The Girly Team

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Sadly it's a cover

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
YMCA is there

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Attention Beliebers

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
The Will.I.Am song

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
That Power, which features Justin Bieber

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Is in there too

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Gamebooey.org will be happy to know

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Kesha is in the game with Come On

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I do love Kesha

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Kesha is so fun

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
In such a guilty pleasure way

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
For those of you that like more basic singers

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Katy Perry is in the game with

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I Kissed a Girl

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And if you like your musicals

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
What the fuck? That's random

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
How random is that?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Like a holdover from Just Dance Disney

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I have no idea

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
And one of the songs

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
of the summer, Get Lucky

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
by Daft Punk

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Everybody likes that song

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I like this song, David Guetta with

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Wolf falling to pieces

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
But you know what? All of these songs

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
All of them, shit

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
They are trumped

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
They are just nothing

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
With the inclusion of this song

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Gimme, gimme, gimme

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
A Man After Midnight by ABBA

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
It's all you need, fuck the rest of it

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Fuck the rest of it

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
End quote

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Nope

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I can't

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Unfortunately, Dark Sakura, ABBA

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Trumps that song

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I have to, sorry

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Think about it

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
If you think about it, Dark Sakura

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I don't think ABBA could even

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Now Rob, Rob

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
What?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Did you ever pick up ABBA, You Could Dance for the Wii?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I did

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
You should have seen Rob

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
do freaking ballerina spins

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I wish I had

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I wish I had been recording it

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Because Rob's like, I've got the ABBA game

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
You need to come over

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And I'm sitting back in this chair

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
That no one can see me point to

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Except for us in this room

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Like that was a couple years ago

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
And Rob's like, look what I got

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And I did the winner takes it all

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
For Jamie

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I don't want to talk

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Oh and remember you bringing

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Singstar ABBA over to my house when

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Tiara was over?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
There right next to Singstar Queen

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
That is like the best shelf in my entire house

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Rob you're so cute

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I'm just saying

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
But remember it was

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
You, me and Tiara playing

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Singstar ABBA

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
And you made me sing

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
I miss her

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
She's in Arlington now

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Well I still miss her

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Yeah it's really hard to hit that far away

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Alright also

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Just going to throw this out there

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Another quick little thing for Just Dance 2014

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Which apparently also includes One Direction

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
But anyway

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
That's not what I wanted to say

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
What I want to say is that the 2014 bundle for the Wii U

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Will come packaged with a Wii Remote Plus

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Which is interesting

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Because you know

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
It's the Wii U

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Yet it's a Wii peripheral

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
But if you think about the way Just Dance works

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It's not like you're going to be sitting there with a game pad

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Dancing to Gimme Gimme Gimme

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Also because if you buy a Wii U

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
System you technically

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Could get away with not having a Wii Remote

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Because you might be playing games with a game pad

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I don't have a Wii Remote Plus

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I never

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And the game does require it

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I'm going to get shit for this but I never played Skyward Sword

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
So I didn't have one

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Neither have I

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And the game does require it so yeah that's why

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Exactly

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
So you can get that for 70 bucks

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
The bundle that has all of that

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
You can get the game separately for $40

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
If you have

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Wow they significantly reduced the price

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Oh wait no they didn't

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
It's actually a full price controller so fuck them

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Just buy a used one seriously

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Oh you, alright

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Not Abba

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Well

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
For the Super Smash Brothers

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Roster we have a new addition

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
We have Wind Waker Link

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
And all of his adorable cuteness

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And I believe he's

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Going to be on both versions

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Also with his adult incarnation

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
As well

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
So fun

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Mighty No. 9 is also coming out

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
For the Vita and the 3DS

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
It basically reached the goals

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
For those so you know what

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
If I get it I'll get it on 3DS

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I don't think it's reached those goals yet

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Well no

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
When it reached 3.5 million

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
But it's pretty close I think

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I don't know they've only got two days left

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
They might not hit it

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I still haven't put in money yet though

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
And in other news

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
It's coming

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
There's a listing for

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
The

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Let's see, Rockman X

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Soundbox on Rakuten

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
So it looks like it's gonna

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Be out for wow it's expensive

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
12,600 yen so basically

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
27 bucks

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
A lot of money. Someone get that for me and rip it

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
No

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Yes

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Actually I have a game on my list Rob

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
That I need to have

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Shut up phone

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Rob is playing with his phone

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
During the show everybody

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
There's like a lot of people out there

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
That still don't realize I do a show

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
On Sunday nights

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
My mom knows I do a show on

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Sunday

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Anyway

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Moving on let's go to the FUGL question of the week

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Every week we go to our Facebook

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Community and our Google Plus community

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
And if you slam those words together you get

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
FUGL and it's the

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
FUGL question of the week

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Except I don't have my music

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Where's my music?

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Dark Soccer you took my music

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
No

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
That's not good

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I didn't take your, I did not, Rob

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Rob Rob Rob

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I'm so prepared. See getting these messages

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
On the phone and everything just like

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Threw me off

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I didn't do shit

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
You don't know shit

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
You know what we need to sit down and watch showgirls

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
With a bunch of crap food

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
We do. Good times

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Anyhow, here we go

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Did you find it yet? Yes I found my bumper. Here we go

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Here it is

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
The FUGL question of the week

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
We went with the obvious this week

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
With a lot of folks talking about the steam machine

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And all the related stuff

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Steam OS, Steam Machine and the Steam Controller

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Let's start with Andy R

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
But I do want to try it

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And I'm pretty happy with my current PC

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I'll wait until we have more concrete details

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Machine specs, prices and so on

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Until I pass further judgement

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Signed up for the beta thingy though

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
At least a passing interest

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Tigerclaw says I think Steam OS is perfect

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
For those that like to build a home theater

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
And PC in a small form factor

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
With a good graphics card

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And play their Steam games on the HDTV

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
That presents a lot of opportunities

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
And there are those that want to play those Steam games

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
The Steam Machine will be perfect for first time PC gamers

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
It'll be interesting to see what they can do

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
With the Steam Controller

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
The fact that it has no thumbsticks

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
But uses touchpad technology

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
That the controls are given the tech is the kind

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
You'd find in laptops

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Which is often not very responsive

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Excuse me, responsive to touch

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Katsuhiko J says

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
The controller is something different for a change

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
I need to try it before I pass judgement

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Who knows, it could be the next best thing

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Valve made a bold move this past week

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I'm interested in their OS

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Chris C says

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I think spec wise

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
The hardware of the Steam Console would have to be on par

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
If not more powerful

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Than current consoles to pique my interest

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I like consoles because

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Games are tailored to the specific console

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
And no major tweaks have to be made

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
To get a seamless experience

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
If the specs beat out the Playstation 4's

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I might be sold

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Red The Haze left us with this too long didn't read version

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
But you can read his full answer on Facebook

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
It says

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
It will unify hardware manufacturers and software devs

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
To make similar specs

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Which will mean better products for the consumers

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Hmm, I like that perspective

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Ciel says

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
The Steam OS has my interest

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I'm not much of a controller

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
I'm not much of a controller, I think I'm a controller person

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
But I'd like to give it a shot

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
The Steam Machines may have multiple price models

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
The OS is free

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
But surely they have an ideal on the controllers

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I can't shut up and give you my money Gabe

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
If you don't tell me how much you desire

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
It's like the third person I've seen say

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
We need a price

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Unfolded Raptor said

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I'm not being involved with the Steam Machine

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
So no sell for me

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Yet

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Ragenator says

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
It's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Given that I don't know too much on the stuff

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I did see a picture of the controller

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
My initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
But hey, if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
And give it a try

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I may end up liking it

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Andrew G says

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
That's actually 23rd Magus

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Working

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Well, he needs to work his way on over here

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
To a Sunday night show

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
The Gabe Cube

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
The Gabe Cube looks promising

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
For those who would rather not self build

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Time will tell

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Some of the answers here from PeegerJunior92 says

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I think it's a logical step forward for Valve

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
And they seem to have a number of the important points

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
That users were hoping for

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
The controller is definitely a new concept

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And something that people will have to get their hands on

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
To really understand how it will work

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
My biggest qualm is that there was no reason

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
For this to be a drawn out three stage announcement

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
It would have been a great all in one announcement

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And people would have been happy

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
CodeMan says

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Honestly, it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
And yes, it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
But I'm not sold yet

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
And Eddie K says

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000
If Half Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I'm not buying one

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And let's see

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Going to Google Plus

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
We usually don't have this many

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Let me start with Travis H who says

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Speechless with excitement

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Flaco Jones says

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I think SteamOS is cool but as for the Steam Machine itself

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
There was nothing to convince me I should buy that

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Instead of just running SteamOS on my PC

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
As a partition or however it would work

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
The controller looks like it would not work for me

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
ActDef says

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
And the family sharing option

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Well, need to use logic more

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Alright, hold on ActDef

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
That is so easy to say in retrospect

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000
But why didn't you call the 1, 2, 3 last week then, huh?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I could see at least the SteamBox

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And maybe the SteamOS

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Yeah, I kind of thought that the SteamBox announcement

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Would have been kind of combined with

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Actually, like they said before

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
It pretty much could have been all one announcement

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
You didn't really need to separate

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
It could have just been all one

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
But anyway, my opinion about the whole thing

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
They're making the Steam Machine pretty much an entertainment console

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Like the Xbox One and the Playstation 4

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
And since they're developing their own OS for it

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
And yeah, I know it's Linux based

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
But still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
And cost effective too

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Not to mention being able to stream all your library

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
In case your game doesn't support Linux

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Going over to Evel, E3VL says

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
From what I see, the SteamOS

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Is basically countering Windows

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
As in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Like Apple's App Store

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
SteamOS is essentially an open system

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Like Google Android

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Very interesting comparison

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
No one needs PC laptops in the future

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Aside for gaming

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
In the future

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Current PC gamers may adopt it

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
But Steam is lending out the OS for third party vendors

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
To create Steam Machines

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
It might be a problem and quite possibly a huge gamble

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Depending on how their hardware is marketed

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
And priced relative to consoles

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
It's a really interesting comparison

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
To third party developers

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Like you get those companies like Alienware

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000
And stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.000
You get the junk programs with a brand new PC that you buy

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
And stuff like that

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I used to have all that

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
But with Dell

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
You get that a lot

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Even with my ACES

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
There's a lot of ACES programs in there

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I'm just worried I'm going to get all of that bogged down

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
In the SteamOS

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
And it's just going to be like a Windows PC again

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And lastly, Retertainment says

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
The SteamOS seems to be tailored for people who have

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Problem is most people don't use their PC like that

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Most people have PCs

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
They use for work, music, movies, games

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
And general dicking around on the internet

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Also porn

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
If people want a device that is only for video games

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
They buy a console

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I didn't really look at this

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
No not really

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Hold on

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Porn

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Advanced Haptic Feedback

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
That they have with that

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Advanced Haptic Feedback

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
And lastly, Retertainment says

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
The rest of his answer here

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I didn't really look at the Steam Machine or the Steam Controller

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
As I do not plan to make any major purchases

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Until I accomplish Project Buy-A-House

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
And in fact

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
It has a little touch screen on there

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
You could probably stream porn to that

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
While you play Team Fortress 2 or something

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
You can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
First thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Porn

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Alright

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Moving on

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Let's get back into some longer news here

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
And we'll get to the Skype line here

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Hopefully before too long

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
1877 Game OLR

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
But first, Loki

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Alright, so there was an announcement this week

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
That first leaked out

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And then they kind of made their own announcement

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Something coming to Xbox One

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Is Xbox Fitness

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Which is an app that uses Kinect

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
And what's kind of cool about it though

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Including Insanity

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And I want to say P90X

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Is one of the other ones that's in there

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
But all sorts of different trainers

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
It is kind of interesting though

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Because I guess

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
The app will be free for Gold members

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Through December 2014

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Although it says there's some additional content

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
That you can purchase for it

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
And I guess in 2015

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Unlimited access will also require

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
A separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
As well as Xbox Gold

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
But

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
For those people that are really into fitness and stuff

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
And you know

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I want to say it because I had co-workers that

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Did the Insanity stuff

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
That DVD says fucking expensive

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
So if they've got that built in there

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
That's pretty cool

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Especially if you're kind of a fitness

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
You know, enthusiast I guess

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Health junkie

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Yes, and it's probably a little better

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Than was it that

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Xbox

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
The Nike one that they had last year

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
That was kind of lame

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
This looks a little bit along the lines of

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Kind of what they were trying to do with that

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And all those features that they were touting before

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
But

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Might be cool

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Some of the trainers to be noted

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Sean T

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Kind of cool I guess

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Not really my thing because

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
You know

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I eat hamburgers

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Yes

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
No no no not today, you had chicken nuggets

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
That's true

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Here's the thing though about

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Xbox Fitness, don't we already have

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
A million fucking fitness games on the Xbox

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I mean I know this is for the new one

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
But doesn't the Kinect

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Need to get out of this rut of dance

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
And fitness games, like show me something

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
New

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Technically yeah, I mean there's about one or two every year

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I mean there's Zumba, there's a new Zumba game this year

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
But there's only really about

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
One maybe

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Two fitness games a year for

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
The Xbox 360

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
And Kinect

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Actually I think it's been about one a year

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
So it's not a ton

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
But yeah I mean

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Those are really the only games

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
That kind of effectively use the Kinect

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Has been kind of crap

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
So I don't know

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
But yeah they're saying

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Different workouts I guess

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
I guess from ten minutes to

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
One hour

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
They're going to have little routines that you can do

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
And stuff, I'm assuming this is tracked across

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
All the different

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Ones you have, metamorphosis

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
They've got that in there as well

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Ripton 30 from Jillian Michaels

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
So I don't know if you've got a

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Fitness program that you're really into

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
But see once again though like Insanity

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Unless you're one of those people that just borrowed

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
That set or something

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Like if you already have it

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
You've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
For it

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
You're probably not going to need this

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I don't know

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
S2100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Has a good point

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
The fitness things sell really well

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
They won't stray too far from a cash cow

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
And if you think about it though

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
You're probably paying for gold to play

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Online multiplayer so

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Why not? Check it out

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Might be cool

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Alright well moving on to other

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Features on the Xbox One

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
The game DVR will work on Xbox Live

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
At launch but YouTube and Facebook

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Sharing won't be enabled until 2014

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
So here's what game DVR

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Does

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Game DVR will save the previous five minutes

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Of gameplay if you use a voice command

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Xbox record

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
You can edit the piece in the upload studio

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And then share it which would be

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
The YouTube Facebook thing later

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
These clips are saved in 720p

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
At 30 frames a second

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Game DVR will only work if you

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Have Xbox Live gold

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
So there you have it that's how it's going to work

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
That sounds dumb

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Because it's saying that you have to do

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Xbox record and then it records something

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Well no because it says previous five minutes of gameplay

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
If you say Xbox record so my thought is

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
If something funny happens and you say

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
That you can go back and edit it in the studio

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
That's my thought so like if something

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Really funny happens you have a chance to react and say

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Xbox record and that way it'll save it

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
So you know if you are

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Playing an online game and hilarity ensues

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Or whatever or I'm playing

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Slenderman and I have a really scary

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Ah moment although that's not on Xbox

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Five minutes is not fair I don't know whatever

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
For a first person shooter it's enough

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
But like if I'm recording an online match or something

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It might be ten minutes long I mean

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
And then this isn't the solution

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
That's why I have my

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
External one I guess

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Yeah there still will be a value in that

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
So there you go Dark Sakura

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Sorry I'm critiquing that

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Image

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Okay first of all they have it like it's levitating

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
But it's at the wrong angle for the

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Level of shadow that they have

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
The Xbox one picture that was on the article

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
You were just reading

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Whoever does their press materials needs to like

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Go back and relearn Photoshop or something

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Levitating consoles are so

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Like Playstation 3 I mean

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
It was the evil baby that made the console

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Levitate or the levitating

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Console that made the evil baby I don't know

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
So EA Sports

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Has put out a statement saying

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
That they are no longer making college

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Games

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Basically the general manager Cam Weber

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Um and

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I'm sorry of American uh

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Who

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Basically the one in charge of all the American football games

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Basically is saying that

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
The college sports games are going away

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
That's meaning the NCAA games

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Um they're also

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Which they themselves put out an announcement

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
That they're letting their license expire

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
In 2014

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
And EA is not pursuing it

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
So they are not going to be doing

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Any more college football

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
As in American football and not the real football

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
That you actually play with your feet

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Um and they

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Are not doing any other

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
College games that basically

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
They're letting it go

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Bye

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And the rest of us are like

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Whoopty shit

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
You know I'm surprised though because that does kind of suck

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Because it was a pretty big

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Revenue stream for them even though

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
There was a lot of

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
You know you have to remember

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Like for me I'm always like

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Okay but college football is

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Like a way bigger deal in other places than it is here

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Exactly and in July

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
It really is pretty much the biggest game

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Only big game coming out

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Now it's going to be this big dead area

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Which hopefully will be filled with something else

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I'm from Alabama

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And the biggest thing in the universe there

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Is the rivalry between the University of Alabama

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
And Auburn University

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
And I know people who will probably be

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Well I want my game this year

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
You know

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And um

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
There's all there is to do

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
In Alabama is college football

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And eat crawdads

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Just saying

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
So maybe they could

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I don't know

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Go to church

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
It's kind of disappointing but at first I remember

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
I thought they were just going to put out a college football game

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
And be like EA Sports college football drop the NCAA

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Thing and just do whatever

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
You would think that they would do something like that

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Where they just make a game anyway but

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I think they have to go through the NCAA

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Yeah

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Well I don't know they

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
For example they didn't ever

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
You know

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
License the

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
You know look and

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
You know names of the players and now they're in this big lawsuit

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Which for example

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
They just settle for 40 million dollars

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
So

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I'll settle for 40 million

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
That's probably why you know they're not doing a college game

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Because you know they got into trouble

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
And there was a whole lawsuit against them for

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Using the likenesses of these different players

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Without actually giving them any sort of compensation

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
For it

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
So now of course you know

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
40 million dollars how exactly it's going to be

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Split up who knows but

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Uh yeah

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
I mean it sucks for the fans you know even though I

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Say like well that isn't really a big deal around these

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Parts I understand there are some and I don't even

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Really play these football games to begin with if it's not

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Like tech mobile but I understand

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Where people would be upset

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
About this and it sucks for you know

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
That group that looks forward to these games

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Every year I wasn't happy

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
When DDR died

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Well all they would have to do is just

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Give up some of their profits I would think

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Couldn't they have just licensed the actual player

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Licenses and

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
You know paid the extra money

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Or you know that would be too

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Uh honest and so they can't do that

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
How much would they have to have paid

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
For all of those individual players

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Versus what they paid out in

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Uh fees for

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
The settlement they do it for Madden

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
So I don't understand why they can't do it for NCAA

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Or even NBA Live

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
They do it for all their other sports games

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
SSG100Matt in our chat room says they could do

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Something like what 2K did to get football back

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I'm sure they'll have something after all remember

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
They did they tried to do NFL Blitz

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
So they could have another type of football

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Game hell they even

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
They even experimented a little with rugby

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
A while back but

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Arena football even so I don't know

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
They could do some more

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
A Puppy Bowl game

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Huh? There was already

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Jerry Rice and Nitus

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Dog football so that's right

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
On the Wii I forgot about that well

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Because it was on the Wii

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
With all the other late Wii games

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Puppy Bowl party I can see Puppy Bowl

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Nintendo get on that

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Mhmm

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
These are uh yeah now that they have this team

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Freed up they could make a Wii U game

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Huh?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Haha

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Yeah alright

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Uh moving on uh here's a game

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
That uh I'm actually legit

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Like really excited to play this game

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
South Park the Stick of Truth

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Oh it looks awesome

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000

And uh the pre-order bonuses

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000

With special abilities Necromancer Sorcerer

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Rogue Assassin Ranger Elf and Holy Defender

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Will also see the release of

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
The Grand Wizard Edition

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Which will be 80 dollars

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
That comes with the game

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
A figurine of Cartman as the Grand Wizard

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
A map of the Kingdom of South Park

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
And the Ultimate Fellowship Pack

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
So there you go the uh South Park

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Stick of Truth game

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Dark Soccer do you have any interest in this?

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Huh?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
It's gonna be awesome

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Definitely gonna pick it up

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I haven't thought South Park was remotely hilarious

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Since ages ago

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
They I don't know they have their moments

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Here sometimes yeah I have to admit though I haven't

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Watched this trailer so can we take a moment

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
To look at this trailer? I guess

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Is the audio gonna come through here at all?

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Apparently

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
When evil rises

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Don't let the brave prince's keys

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
There is only one

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
The new kid the new kid has a power

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
We have yet to understand

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Who can save us

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Step forward now

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
And fulfill your

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And fulfill your

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
The audio on this is low sorry

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
You have some incredible ability

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
To make friends quickly new kid

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Oh

02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:27.120
Oh yay Mr. Slaves in there

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:29.120
Mr. Slave has a finishing move

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.120
Where he jumps on one of the enemies

02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.120
And it sucks them into his ass

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Yeah it's a pain but

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
This is the kind of stuff you put up with

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Living in a remote little mountain town

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
At least we don't have to deal with traffic

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I don't know

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Here's why okay here's why I'm looking forward

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
To the Stick of Truth because like

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
There really should have been another South Park movie

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I don't think I have ever laughed harder

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
In the theater in my life

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Imaginary fun land or whatever

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
That was like a three episode arc

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Of the show

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
And it wasn't as nearly as fun

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
And it wasn't as nearly as good as the movie

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
So I kind of feel like this is like

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
The next closest thing we're getting

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
To like a new movie

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
And that was all in game

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And it looks just like the actual

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
The actual show so

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
It'll be pretty sweet

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Alright well

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
We would be usually moving on

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
To the mailbag at this point

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Except we got Jack and Shit

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
And Jack left town

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So let us use

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
This music as a little opportunity

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
To remind y'all that it is the show

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Where every gamer has a voice

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
As long as you use it

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Yes but if we can't hear you

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Then you don't get one

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I promise I will

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
At least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Okay? One

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Mailbag all one word

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
That's M-A-I-L

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
B-A-G

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
At

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
OrangeSongsRadio.com

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Word

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Well the dot separates the Orange Songs Radio

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
And the com

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Shut up

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Alright

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Bitch you didn't even

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Love you mean it

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Hearts

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Alright so that's it then

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
No emails this week for us to read

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Oh well

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
This next segment will just have to be doubled

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
To make up for the time

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
This is bad

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Here is justice

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Here is punishment

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Here

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
This is fucked up

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
FUs of the week time

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Okay I have a couple

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
FU to the asshole wasp

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Which all wasps are assholes

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
But this one was extra

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Asshole by inviting himself into my car

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
And poking his butt in my finger

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
That was really rude

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And I'm really allergic

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to them

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
So

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Fuck you wasp

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Fuck all wasps

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
The only good thing they do is eat plant destroying caterpillars

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
That's it

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And there's other bugs that will do that too and birds

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
So fuck them

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
They're

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Also

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
An FU to having certain illusions of

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Mind shattered because I like to think

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Better of my relatives

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And then every so often they'll just

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Say something that's completely dickish

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And rude and

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Racist and homophobic

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And I'm like how did I

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Turn out to be

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Miss liberal socialist

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Free thinker in California

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Coming from that environment

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Really how does that happen?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Or is it just that I was so overwhelmed with

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
The bullshit that I was like I need

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
To go and flew out of

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Alabama with fire

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Out of my ass or something I don't know

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I just am completely baffled

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
How did this happen?

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
And also FU to

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
The bitch that wouldn't let me over

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Even though I signaled for like

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Ages and then every time

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I'd speed up she'd speed up

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
The three people weaving in and out of

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Traffic and the cop that didn't pull any

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Of them over fuck all of them

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Fuck them all and even though it's not

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
A fuck you because I'm PMS

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Today so I'm just completely taking over this whole

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Segment I would like to say

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Eggs was not at

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
What are you doing?

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Just keep going

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Okay well there's a guy who sells duck

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
To buy duck eggs and

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
He wasn't there and I was disappointed

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
But Rachel bought a rabbit

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
A dead rabbit A wascley wabbit

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
A frozen dead rabbit Poor rabbit

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Mmm rabbit's delicious So it was

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Rabbit season and not duck season

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Yes

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Yes

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
It was rabbit season

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Okay sorry this is what I was trying to cue up

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Since you're having an extra angsty week Dark

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Sakura

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Yoo hoo

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It's the PMS

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
March

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Well I am legit

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
PMS-ing so F you

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Two cramps TMI

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
You know what I don't care

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Okay guys in the universe

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Women get cramps

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
We get bitchy

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Fucking deal with it

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Don't use it as an excuse for every time we get bitchy

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
My brain has a cramp now

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Good

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Good

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Now you know a degree of my suffering

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
My job has been done

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Alright Loki

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Uh F you too

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Thanks to YouTube's content ID service

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Which is so fantastic

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
That they- Hey did you know that you're using

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Licensed music in your stuff

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Accept this copyright claim

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Or deny it

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Or contest it I will choose option 3

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Do nothing is what I will do

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
But it's great though because on one of the

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Videos I did get that on

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Or that flag on

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Was one of the ones I used an audio swap

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Thanks to YouTube You know YouTube allows you to

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Yeah I know it's licensed music because

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
You told me to use that music

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Instead of the licensed music

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
They had in that before

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Our pal Travis from understation live

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Unfortunately deals with this a lot

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Like if he

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Even uses like a little bit of a song

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
In his like hour and a half long

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Understation live that goes up on YouTube

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
They flag it that's why he had to change the intro

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Of the show and I'm like come on

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
It's ridiculous

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
It's ridiculous and they scam that

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
So what would they do? They scan all these videos

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
And they just send it to these music people

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
So that they can just complain out

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
What they should do is just have a service that

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
You know if these lawyers

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Or whoever find these videos that infringe

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Upon it then yes they can do a copyright thing

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
The thing is I don't believe the copyright

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
That

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Content ID thing is actually

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
A copyright claim by them

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
But it does sometimes block it

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
From mobile apps and stuff like I tried watching

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
My video on a mobile app and

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
You can't see it

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Because YouTube pulled one of his videos

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Where he was using a copyrighted thing

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
But it was under fair use

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
And he's like I'm a copyright lawyer

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
This was fair for me to do

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
So he's suing YouTube

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
It's a real pain in the ass

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Seriously

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Why should we keep catering to these media companies

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
And stuff I mean the stuff that people are doing

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
On YouTube for the most part is pretty harmless

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And they're just making it fucking difficult

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
For everybody

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
That's it that's all I've got

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
So I don't know

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Also

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
I'm a pretty sure F you for

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Trying to figure out how to make this case for my

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
And I'm thinking I may need to do

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Vacuum forming plastic which is

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
To cook it basically

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I have to build an oven and then

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff so

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Alright that's all I got

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
My F you of the week just goes to the

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Fact that there's a show in two weeks

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Even though it'll be great I'm just like

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Stress

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Ah

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
But you know that'll pass like things

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Usually do

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Alright let's go back to

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
A few more news stories for you guys

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Before we open up the Skype line

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Loki

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Alright so

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
We know that Sony is preparing their Gaikai

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Service for the Playstation 4 to

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Stream older Playstation

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Games to the console since they don't

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Have any sort of backwards compatibility

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
That's hardware based

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
But they're saying that hey you know what

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
We can actually use this to stream these games

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
To other consoles or other

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Devices like PCs

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Tablets so

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
You know their ultimate goal

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Is to be able to stream those

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Things to other devices

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
It'd be kind of funny if you could play a

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Playstation 4 game with an Xbox One

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
If they had some sort of website or something

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
You can go to the stream this stuff

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
That would just be

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Ridiculous

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
The Xbox One's HDMI

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
In

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Create some sort of black hole of death

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
With that

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
I don't know

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
It'll be neat but once again we'll have to see

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
How this Gaikai service works once it

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Does launch next year for at least

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
America

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
We can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Indeed

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Indeed

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Alright one more story for you guys and we'll open up the

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Skyline and this is about actually I think

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show but that's alright

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I'll recap it for y'all

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Anyway this is of course

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Out of Orlando, Florida

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Only in Florida people

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Only in Florida

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
A nine year old boy made a court appearance

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
On school weapon charges

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
And was sentenced to home confinement

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Officials said that the boy

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Brought multiple weapons to the school

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
At Hunter's Creek Wednesday

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
And of course this is

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Going to tie into video games eventually folks

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Bear with me here

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Officer searched the bag and found the handgun

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Six bullets, a steak knife and a sledge hammer

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
The guns all came from the father's home

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
And the boy is ordered to

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Home confinement and said the parents

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Need to keep any and all weapons away from him

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
The boy's father

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Said he was playing a character

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
He learned from a video game

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Of course he was

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Let's see

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
The nine year old boy told three friends before school

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
That he had the weapons

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Those three reported the information to a school resource officer

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Who found the student and isolated him

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
School officials said

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Protocols were followed and authorities were called

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
In to investigate

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Now nowhere in this original story does it say what the game

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Actually was that he was trying to emulate

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
But it was Minecraft

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Yes

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Minecraft

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Not Grand Theft Auto people

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Minecraft

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
And there really is no story to Minecraft

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Aside from there's a guy named Steve

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
And there's zombies

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I mean so

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Yeah I don't know

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
It's

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
It's dumb

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And there's no guns even in that

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
And I like how the boy's father

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Oh he's just

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
He's just pretending

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
He's pretending to be in the game

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Not oh why do I have all these guns available

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
So my nine year old can pick up a gun

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
You know and bring it to school

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Yeah PacDeft in the chat room says

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Irresponsible parents

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
We're not to blame it's the video game that teaches them

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
All the bad stuff

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Yeah

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
And even so

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Even if

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
They've allowed their child exposure to the game

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
They've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I want to know why CPS isn't involved

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Okay

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Um let's see

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
SSJ100Matt says please please

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Someone hijack a horse and blame it on

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Barbie's horse adventure

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I'll do it

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Or imagine horses

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Amazing

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
And I'll name it Politary

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
And beat her

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
It's stupid though

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
It's like why do we even allow these excuses to

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
You know that's about as valid

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Excuses like the voices in my head

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Told me to do it

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I mean come on if someone said that you're gonna be like okay that's ridiculous

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
But if like you know

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Oh the video game told them to do it

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Oh well that makes sense

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Seriously what is wrong with people

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
He was a witch

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Okay must be

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Alright

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
That is it for our stories tonight

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Please go to the skype line and open it up

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
1877 game OLR or our username on skype

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Or maybe there's something we missed

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
That you would like to bring up

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
That is

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I think the most recent Milli Vanilli

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Reference I have seen

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
In the last

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I know the first reference to them I've seen

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
In maybe the last five years

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Ever since that guy passed away probably

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
So there you go

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Not even from this country

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
We do have a couple tweets

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Not a whole lot of them but we do have a few

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
From I thought we had some earlier in the week

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
I can't remember

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Alright sorry if I missed yours

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Cause it was too early in the week

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
But we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
One of them is that China will be ending

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
A decade long ban on game consoles

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I had no idea that they have this ban in place

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Cause I thought there were like knock off consoles

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
And stuff that they sold in Japan

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Wasn't the V

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Wasn't the V something they sold in China?

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
It was some sort of weird TV

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Console things

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
I don't know what the restrictions were exactly

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Well that in Hong Kong was

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Not under Chinese authority

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
For the longest time

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
And why was the ban in place in China?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Communism!

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Well there was concern for the effects that games

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Might have on young people

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
But the group was persuaded

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Because gaming on computers

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
And internet cafes has taken off across

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
China or whatever so

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
There will soon be consoles sold

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
As part of new rules in a free trade

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Zone in Shanghai

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Don't know when the consoles will go on sale

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
But there you go so

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I don't know if that means

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Xbox and Playstation 3

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Necessarily but probably some

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Like local gaming devices

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
There

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
They're talking about something called

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Something based on the Xbox

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
But not called the best pad

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
That again from a tweet that

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Tigerclaw sent us

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
And one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
At 1877 Game OLR

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
One other article here from Tigerclaw

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Says Nintendo teaming up with

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Tesco for a Wii U

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Fightback

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Ah so

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Let's see, Nintendo said

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
In an interview with MCV that too many people

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Are unaware that the Wii U is a new

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Console and they're going to do a

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Giant campaign to educate people

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Including Wii owners about this console

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
They've booked in-store space at

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Tesco which is in the UK

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Sending out a 5 page leaflet

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
To 300,000 Tesco customers

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
That have bought a Wii but haven't bought another

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Console and give vouchers away

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
That will allow money off of games

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
There will also be TV ads for Mario

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Donkey Kong and Zelda

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Which will run continuously from half term

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Until Christmas

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I think they know, I just think they don't care

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Yeah I don't think they really see

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
That must have game, but then there's

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Mario and... I'm still irritated at

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Tesco for selling fresh and easy

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Yeah isn't that crazy?

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
So mad

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Aren't they all closed now though?

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
No I think certain ones

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Alright well that's... The one here is gone

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
That's it for Twitter topics, again I'll put

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
One more call out there for calls

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
1877 Game OLR

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Loki do we have any last minute stories?

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
There's just a quick mod

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
That someone's working on

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Right now for Team Fortress 2

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
That you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
That sounds kind of fun

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Yeah it's called Star Fortress

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
And it's in pre-alpha

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
And if you want to check it out

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
It's...

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I think Greyman Gaming

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Is the Steam community

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Group that they have

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
With man of course two ends

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Like Team Fortress game

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
So

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
That's it

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
That's it huh? Slow news week

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Um

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
No calls coming in either

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I don't know

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
What do we do guys?

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Let's have a poker party

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
We're in the show

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Yay forgot... You know what? You know what?

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Pinkberry

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I gotta go get Alan after work

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Someone call

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
One more

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
One more holler out there

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
1877 Game OLR

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
You know if you're one of those people that doesn't listen to the show live

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
You listen to us on like Stitcher

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Or through iTunes podcast or something else

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Don't forget you still can't interact with the show

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
We do want to hear from you

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
So don't forget to send us emails

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Or Twitter tweets help as well

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Looks like someone's going to be trying

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I can't think of anything else video game related

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Except

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Blah

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Hey look

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Oh there it is it's lighting up

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
Let's go to the phones

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
It is Ron but the one who has come to save the day

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Apparently what's up with that?

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Well what's on your mind Rama?

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Oh you don't want to know

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
But um

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Here's a question I've been meaning to call about

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Let me get your opinions on this

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Now we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
And reboots and stuff like that

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
But this is something they haven't done

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Why is it they haven't taken

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Wario and Waluigi

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
And put them in a game and call it

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Super Wario Brothers

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I'm also surprised that hasn't happened

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
But wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Well they have that Wario Land shake it

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Which was a hand drawn game that looked fantastic

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
And it was pretty fun

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
But no one bought it and it was on the Wii

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends almost

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Who wants to play the bad guy?

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Exactly you know

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Me!

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I want to be the villain

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
And if you think about Wario and Waluigi

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Their abilities are different

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
So the game mechanics would be slightly different

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
But a little bit more fun to play

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
You know what actually on that token

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
If they really wanted to introduce

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
A Wario and Waluigi into a good platformer game

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Why don't they do another one like

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
What we got a Super Mario 2

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000
With Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
I like the sound of that

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Nintendo call me

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
We'll talk

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Your people can call me and pay me

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
What other dream Nintendo games do you have

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Rama?

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
That was the only one

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
I don't know it just popped in my head

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
They have

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Wario series of games

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
I guess at the time I was thinking about

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
One of my favorite Game Boy games

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Which was Super Mario Land 3

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
And I'm like

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Why haven't he done that?

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
You know what I think you just need your own

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Mario is missing game except

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
In the sequel Luigi is like I know

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Exactly

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
And also I really think they should

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Put the Wii U out without the gamepad

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Because honestly

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Maybe three out of the four games

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
That are out on the Wii U doesn't even use

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
The gamepad

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Some of them use it really well though

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Zombie U is a great example of a game

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
That's really enhanced for that gamepad

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
So

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
I like the gamepad but

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Honest to god

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
For me the gamepad

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
And all that thing that's less of a concern

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Than I still feel there's a lot of

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Clunky shit on Nintendo's online

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
And although I like

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Miiverse I don't think it's

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Particularly convenient it's kind of

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Slow and the internet on Nintendo's system

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Can still be clunky

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
I just still feel like where Nintendo

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Is going online isn't really

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Like where they need to be

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
And I just you know I still remain really

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Irritated that Virtual Console

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Isn't

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
What we ought to see on a modern gaming

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Console you know what I mean

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Exactly

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
So but those are just you know

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
What do I know I still have a Wii U

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
And you know there are the games I do have on it

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
I enjoy and I know I will like the

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
New Mario game and I know I'll love the new

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Mario Kart and you know what whatever they continue

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
To do in 2014 that will you know

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Justify owning the system but

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
It is a little frustrating to see all the third parties

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Abandoning ship I just I think a lot of them

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Are being dicks

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
You know you're

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Right cause even though the Wii U isn't

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
As powerful I mean

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
You can get somebody else to take like a top tier

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Title and shove it into that

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Little hardware and somehow make it work

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
They make shitty little

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Computers for kids that will play

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Games and I see ports of games

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
From big companies that end

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Up on these things so

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
LeapFrog is just a little device

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
That's powered by

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Flash that's a Shockwave

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Flash Console

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Alrighty well Rama if that's it

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
I'm gonna let you go and see if anybody else wants to call

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Awesome. Alright have a good one buddy

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
You too. Alright bye bye now

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Alright

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Wants to call in 1877 Game OLR

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Or username on Skype

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
I just I just considered something

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
During that phone call so I was asking

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Ikuma-san if he'd clear it up for me

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Yeah

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Waluigi I wonder if it would be

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
If it's supposed to be the name as a pun

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
For Warui which is bad

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Probably

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Probably

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I would think that the wa part and Wario

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
And Waluigi definitely would

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Have to do with things being bad

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
There's a lot of little puns that don't always

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Necessarily transfer over

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
But anyway let's go to the phones

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Cause we got another call coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Who's this?

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Obi Wan Jibroni calling from the

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
United Kingdom

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Oh my gosh

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
You are up late sir

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
I love your icon

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Thank you very much

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Also I want to say numero uno

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
On the leaderboard

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Look at you yeah

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
You and Tigerclaw fighting to the death

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
On the VOG network leaderboards

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Well you know what Sky I heard Tigerclaw

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Likes being on top and that's okay

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
I think that was a little bit

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
That was a little bit of shade throwing here live

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
At OrangeLoungeRadio

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
All I can say is that Bobby and I are also tossing around

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Some ideas to make the VOG game

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Just a little bit sweeter in the future

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
But that's all I'll say for now

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Awesome

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Yeah my max has told me it's five

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Hours

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
So what's on your mind buddy?

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Well you know

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
There's been a lot of free to play

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Games out there lately

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
There's been more free to play games than

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
They've fucked you know

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
So

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
I think this is a great thing because I'm 35 years old

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Old gamer

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Not that old

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
You're not that old

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
I'm older

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
You're a young lady

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Oh I love you

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
I love you too

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
So

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
As we get older

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
As older gamers

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
I think we become more cheap

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I mean

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
The 2DS

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
That's cool to me because

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
It's going to be cheap

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
It kind of looks kind of shitty

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
But I mean

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
The price

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
I think is going to appeal to a lot of older people

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
For cheap people

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Like myself

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I've got a 3DS at the minute

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
The original one

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
I've got a lot of friends

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Who would be into that

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
The 2DS

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Just because they don't want to spend the money

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
On the regular 3DS

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
But

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
I went off on a tangent

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
But yeah

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Free to play is what I was going to mention

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Sorry

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
This is my first time calling you guys

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
And as they say your first time is

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
That's alright

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
We'll go easy on you on your first time

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
The first time is a little rough

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
We're just all sitting here listening to your accent

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
So by all means talk away

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
And for the record I have several friends who've

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Especially one of them that has problems with 3D

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
So just saying

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Yeah exactly

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
And if anyone's out there

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
If I've been to my accent and whatever

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Feel free to let me know on Twitter

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Or the comments on VOG

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
So free to play games

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Do you play any of them?

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Oh yeah

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
I've been pimping the shit

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Out of Tekken Revolution

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
That's right

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
That was your comment that got me to play that game

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Yeah I've been pimping the crap out of it

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
And yeah I love it

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
And I don't know if you've played

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
The latest one

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Of course

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Is it Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Call of Fighters or some shit

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
I saw that but I haven't played it

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
But I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Yeah yeah

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Because I'm a huge fighting game fan

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
But the Dead or Alive one is kind of cool

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
It's free gigs I will say that

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
But it doesn't have

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
The token system

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
So you can play how much you want

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
It's one of those games where

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
If you want the story part of it

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
You've got to pay for it

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
So it's kind of like one of those games where

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
It unlocks

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Pay to unlock is what I mean

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Yeah but it's cool

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
I mean you can play online too

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
So that's kind of fun

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
You don't have to pay to unlock

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Booby mechanics though do you

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Because it is Dead or Alive

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I'm not sure

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Tekken Revolution's

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Kind of been taking over

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
I think

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Pay to unlock is better

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
When you have the expectation that it's going to be

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Pay to unlock

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Instead of just

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Oh well we have this DLC

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
No you just gave us a code

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Yeah at least it's not double dipping

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Yeah when you know that you've got to unlock it

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Pay a little bit more then I think it lessens the blow

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Yeah

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
And I think the story portion

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Of that Dead or Alive is kind of expensive

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
So you might as well just go out

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
And buy the full game

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Also I wanted to mention

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
That Ridge Racer game

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
That's kind of

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
It's okay but like

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
I said in one of the comments before

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
I said when you crash

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
On the game it's like it's not game over

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
But you can keep carrying on playing

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
It's okay

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
But you know with that game

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Every time I put it up now

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
It says server error

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
And I know you guys love this word

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
It's a beta

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Or a beta wherever you live

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
We say beta obviously

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
I've heard beta

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Yeah

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
This is okay it's not traditional Ridge Racer

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
In my opinion so I can't hear it

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
But it does have trophies

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
I keep forgetting there really are

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
A ton of free to play options on PlayStation

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Right now

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
You mentioned one last week Rob called

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
You played a pinball free to play

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
That was called pinball stick

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
I was shouting at my pinball stick

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
I mentioned it again earlier tonight

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Pinball is stick or something like that

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Yeah I mentioned it again tonight

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
It's free

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Hey

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Yeah free is good

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I mean you know

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
You gotta pay for handjobs or whatever these days

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
But I mean free

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Free is good love it

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
I wish tech and stuff

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
On the Dead or Alive game was on

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Xbox

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
But probably not gonna happen

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
But PS3 is okay I like the controller

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
I'm the minority who

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Likes the PS3 controller

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
I love the PS3 controller

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Need I remind everyone that Yaris

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
Was also free

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Brad from

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Is the best free to play on PS3

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
He's our DC fanboy

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
As far as MMOs go

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
It's way better than that free realms

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Marvel Heroes is pretty good for

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Steam

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
But it's Marvel and there's Jessica Jones in it

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
And I'm happy

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I did try DC Universe

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Took forever to download

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
My PS3 is on wireless

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
It took

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Just like three days

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
It was a terrible experience

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
It took up so much space

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I mean

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
The PS3 is a great system

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
But there's annoyances

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
It's really ridiculous

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Some of my files over to that

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I can copy save games

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
But I'm not getting any space by copying

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Save games to my drive

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Or send over

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Some of these really large games

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
To play off the drive

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Anyway Obi-Wan, Jabroni

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
It's so good to hear from you

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
That icon you have

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
That Dark Soccer loves

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I just want to make sure all the listeners hear this

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
It says keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
With a PlayStation 1 console

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Well thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Yes

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
It's a PlayStation 1 console

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Plugged into the port 2

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
If anyone gets that reference

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
Also can I say one quick thing

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Before I go

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Bye bye bye

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
For everyone

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Because I'm a huge MGS fan

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Everyone knows I follow me on Twitter

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Basically

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Please stay super exclusive

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
But holy shit, value for money

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
It's awesome

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
One more thing if that's ok before I go

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Queen Elizabeth

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Can suck my motherfucking nuts

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Because that's why

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Everything is so fucking expensive

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
That's why I'm paying $429

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
For an Xbox One

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
We need to all just move to our own island

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
And call it fuck everyone else

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
We are the island nation of awesome

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Fuck the rest of you

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
This is probably the only

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Internet video gaming show where people will call in

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
To tell off the Queen of England

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Alright

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Have a good one my friend

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Bye

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
That was a great call

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I love hearing from the overseas people

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
It's great

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
You are up way early or late

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
I have a feeling he's up early

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Because he missed me talking about the pinball game

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
He's 8 hours ahead of us

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I'm going to close up

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Skype

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I know Act F was trying to ring in

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
But I think he was just trying to be nice

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
I'm going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
I'm out of here for the night

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
I just want to say once again

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Thank you so much for tuning into

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
And supporting independent podcasting

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
We've been doing this a very long time

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
We don't ask for your money

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Once in a while a charity thing we might ask for your money

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
But I'll take it for free

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
But we do ask you to help spread the word

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Tell a friend or five about the show

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
And I do see some of you guys doing that

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
I hear some of our other indie podcast folks

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Saying nice words

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
And I just want to let you know we so appreciate you guys

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
For your support

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Which really keeps the fire

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
For us to do this show for 11

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Plus years going

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
You know what? I'm going to make my

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
Dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
I'm installing WoW

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Oh my gosh

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
You know what reminded me that I still had

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
WoW installed?

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
First

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
You're starting to sound like Gimmet

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Which we'll hear about on Wednesdays Hoard House

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Plug, plug, plug

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
It's already replaced WoW in my heart

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
And besides that I watched the fuckery that was

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
The end of the Orgrimmar thing

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
And fuck that I'm glad I quit

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Alright

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
That is it

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
We're done

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Hope to see you there

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Sounds good

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
My final thought is Final Fantasy XIV this week

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
End of line, free company

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
On the Midgarcimer server, hope to see you there

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Dark Sakura

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Fucking wasps

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Thank you guys once again

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
