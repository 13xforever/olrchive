14000	26000	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, one of Mega Man's creators successfully kickstarts a spiritual successor, a classic fighting game becomes a MOBA, now he announces a new rhythm game with Capcom, and could Sony release a VR headset for the PS4?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	53000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, here we are, episode number 518 for this September the 8th 2013, I hope you guys all had a good week off, Labor Day week, we weren't here last week, but we're back to do it all again tonight, talk about video games and gaming culture and have some laughs
54000	60000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts, first off the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
61000	62000	I'm in your town raiding your fruits
63000	74000	Yes you are, you are definitely helping out with Animal Crossing, are you impressed though that I actually, I went in when I was flying to Atlanta and cleaned up the whole town, I found that Animal Crossing is a great flight game
74000	84000	It is, it's also a great, I have nothing to do so I'm going to play Animal Crossing for 3 hours type of game and the cat won't get off of me, I'm going to play Animal Crossing
85000	98000	Yeah usually while I'm here at home I'll end up getting sucked into an MMO or kind of sitting on the chair, I mean my 3DS is really the on the go system, that's when I play it the most, but yeah having the flight this week there and back to Dragon Con got a lot of Animal Crossing in among other things
98000	105000	Well you also were my 10th Wii person, or me, that popped up on my thing so you got me an achievement
106000	109000	Woohoo, or what do they call them on Nintendo, accomplishments, trophies?
110000	111000	They're called what the hell ever I call them
112000	113000	Whatever they want to be
114000	115000	They're called stuff and things
116000	120000	Alright and also joining us tonight being whoever he wants to be, say hello to Techmaster Loki
121000	122000	I don't know I got nothing
123000	124000	That's so after school inspirational of you
125000	126000	It is a little bit isn't it, how are you Loki?
126000	127000	I'm fine
128000	130000	Counting down the days until Grand Theft Auto?
131000	135000	Sort of, yeah I guess, just waiting for the leak
136000	138000	Which I'm sure it will soon enough
139000	151000	Well Rockstar's not shipping anything out, well they're not shipping anything out to distribution until Friday so probably next weekend I'm sure
152000	160000	Don't know if I'll be getting mine early because the powers that be above me are kind of being anal
161000	166000	I'm still going to do it but we'll see, I may be slapped on the wrist for that
167000	171000	Is it like the guy who put up the YouTube today of the Xbox One
172000	173000	Well see I'm not that dumb
174000	176000	Are they worried about early leaks and things like that?
176000	186000	They're just worried about like because they're requiring manifests of like the orders that go out and stuff just to make sure that no one's getting their product on Friday or whatever
187000	191000	No stores, I mean I'm not a store, I'm not going to resell but I understand
192000	195000	I thought I already saw on Reddit or one of those sites that somebody's got the game and the disc
196000	199000	You saw Photoshop and it was from
200000	201000	Well that was a good Photoshop
202000	203000	Gamertag Radio posted that on Twitter
203000	206000	But yeah it was a Photoshop of somebody they did that
207000	210000	Yeah there's no actual copies of the game out there yet
211000	216000	I mean yeah no there are, there are shippers that are out there, like full pallet shippers
217000	220000	But those are like intended for like think Target, Walmart and stuff
221000	226000	So those are out there and someone did break in the one of those to take a picture on, I saw that on Reddit
227000	231000	But aside from that I don't think any copies have mysteriously vanished from those yet
231000	238000	So the retail release though is the Tuesday after this Tuesday right? Next Tuesday? 17th?
239000	240000	17th yeah
241000	244000	This week is Kingdom Hearts HD, I just got my pre-order in for that today so
245000	247000	Kingdom Hearts and Puppeteer and NHL
248000	253000	So we're getting into that time of year, it's going to start ramping up with Kingdom Hearts and Grand Theft Auto
254000	257000	Those are definitely two big things to kick off this season right?
257000	260000	Yeah and Kingdom Hearts is just an HD compilation
261000	267000	Well but Kingdom Hearts is like, I don't know like I'm really liking this whole square going back to some of the PS2 games
268000	271000	And kind of making bigger and better and all that, I like that idea
272000	278000	I mean it's kind of cool and all but I think it's going to be more interesting to see in Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15
279000	284000	So I want to talk, gosh there's a lot to catch up on since we were gone last week
284000	286000	I don't even know where to begin
287000	293000	I'm sick a little bit again which kind of sucks, I got Complague yet again from Dragon Con
294000	296000	I don't even know how that happens but there you go
297000	299000	We should probably talk about some of the things that happened last week in gaming news
300000	303000	Because it's only a three hour show so we don't have time to talk all about last week and this week
304000	307000	So we want to do a segment we call Last Week's News Set to Holic
308000	311000	Lots of Nintendo news in the week that we were gone
312000	315000	The Wii U Deluxe finally got that price drop a lot of people have been talking about
316000	320000	Down to $2.99 for the Wii U Deluxe which is what the Wii U Basic costs right now
321000	322000	Also out of Nintendo
323000	324000	Wii U Basic isn't being sold anymore by the way
325000	329000	Yeah so kind of interesting that they just basically are giving away Nintendo Land and some extra plastic for free
330000	338000	The Nintendo 2DS was announced which had a lot of people have some very strong opinions about the 2DS one way or another
339000	344000	Or the Nintendo Toast is kind of what it looks like but it is definitely targeted towards the younger set
345000	347000	Seriously missed opportunity with that I think
348000	355000	It does not fold and it only displays images in 2D apparently it uses one screen that's separated by the plastic in order to pull it off
356000	359000	But it is aimed at five and six year olds per Reggie
360000	364000	Zelda Link Between Worlds got a release date November 22nd is the big day
365000	372000	Wonderful 101 sales figures not as good as it had hoped but I think it might be a little early to tell with that
373000	374000	That's because it's on the Wii U
375000	377000	It also hasn't released over here yet
378000	379000	It comes out on the 15th one week from today
380000	381000	But that is the news out of Japan so there you go
382000	385000	Let's see I guess something else we could talk about there
386000	393000	How about WayForward's Kickstarter of Shantate Half Genie Hero for Wii U
394000	396000	That's the thing that's happening on Kickstarter from WayForward
397000	399000	That's last week's news set to Holic
400000	401000	Most of the big stuff obviously around Nintendo
402000	404000	Loki did you want to elaborate on the 2DS real quick?
404000	408000	Well the thing you know you mentioned that it's one screen with a piece of plastic in between
409000	414000	And I saw some people you know on Ars Technica and stuff they were showing like
415000	418000	Here's what we think that this should have looked like instead being like a whole tablet
419000	423000	Like basically just remove that plastic and leave just like kind of a barrier there
424000	427000	And have it where maybe you can have some new software that's supported by the 2DS
428000	433000	You know have 2DS software that supports the whole like almost like a whole tablet instead of two screens
434000	438000	Well I don't know I'm just trying not to overthink this because you'll notice it was very intentional
439000	442000	Nintendo did not roll this out at E3 they did not even do a direct for it
443000	444000	It's not a big deal
445000	448000	But here's the thing is the thought is that this is where it's going to go for the next handheld system
449000	453000	That it will be a tablet with one screen because this is what they did with the Game Boy Advance SP
454000	458000	Where you have that hinge in the foldable screen and then that later showed up in the Nintendo DS
459000	462000	That might be reading into it a lot I don't know about that
463000	466000	And this is also Nintendo like trying to I mean if you think about it
467000	471000	Nintendo the last time they did something really crazy with their hardware aside from the 3DS
472000	477000	Being in 3D was the Wii and since then they haven't really done too much
478000	482000	I think it's kind of once again the 2DS is confusing I think to consumers
483000	487000	It's just the name itself is going to confuse people because they're going to be like well
487000	494000	2DS so I don't see any 2DS games I can buy for this you know I only see 3DS games
495000	500000	I just don't think they're going to get it and also you're saying that there's a market out there
501000	505000	Of people that have 5 and 6 year olds that actually read the small little print that's on those boxes
506000	509000	Saying that they don't recommend 3D for
510000	514000	Because I don't think it necessarily is only 5 and 6 year olds I think it's other young children
514000	516000	Where the parents are like oh this is a little too close
517000	519000	You know like even though it's for 7 and up
520000	524000	But they'll read that small print but they won't read the ESRB ratings on the back of the boxes of these games
525000	528000	So I like that and the print that's larger fuck that can't read it
529000	534000	Oh small print that's you know something that doesn't really possibly affect my kids eyes
535000	537000	Well we'll read that and be scared of it
538000	541000	I just think the 2DS is kind of a non-factor as far as we're all concerned
541000	546000	You know it's like that Wii that they released in Canada that didn't even have any internet functionality or what have you
547000	549000	Like remember that? It was released with little fanfare
550000	553000	They did that with the PSP as well they had one with no Wi-Fi and stuff or something
554000	555000	Whatever
556000	560000	It's no big deal but I just think it's kind of weird you know why would you invest money into such a narrow demographic?
561000	563000	Well actually I'm glad you know if Nintendo is doing this new thing every year
564000	567000	I'm glad that this system is a step backwards in some ways and not a step forward
567000	570000	Because I'd be kind of irritated if I had a new 3DS I'd want to buy
571000	577000	You know so I'm kind of glad we have a year off from all this stuff and maybe there'll be a 3DS Uber or who knows what
578000	579000	2DS has Excel
580000	581000	I doubt it I doubt it
582000	585000	Alright well our chat room is lighting up and I do want to acknowledge our live chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night
586000	590000	6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network
590000	597000	vognetwork.com and if you, excuse me, I still have hiccups and other horrible radio things from being sick from the comm plague I got at Dragon Con
598000	605000	If you do join us live for a live show don't forget to join our chat room live.vognetwork.com
606000	607000	I hope I make it through the show
608000	612000	Where we have comments like Tiger Claw says that 2DS is going to screw up a lot of kids Christmas
613000	616000	I don't know if I see the logic in that why would that screw up a kids Christmas?
616000	620000	That's actually perfect because I was, Julian has started to read
621000	623000	He's six years old he's in first grade he's reading
624000	628000	He's been reading me play Animal Crossing which I've been trying not to get him to repeat Pork Sword
629000	631000	Thank you to Queen Semia in chat for that
632000	639000	Yeah his mom was slightly amused by that but anyway he actually is reading the game with me when I play it when I'm over there
640000	644000	And he was talking about wanting a 3DS so he could play Animal Crossing himself
644000	650000	And actually I think that the 2DS is actually a good idea for him because I've seen how he destroys his stuff
651000	657000	Yeah and there's no hinges to break on the 2DS but it's also too big to fit in the pockets but I think that actually might be a good thing
658000	661000	You don't want a six year old fitting that stuff in their pockets and taking it to school
662000	665000	You don't want those portable systems to be portable
665000	674000	I'm worried I'm going to get accused of being a Nintendo defendist or whatever but I just don't think this system is as big of a deal as Twitter made it seem to be this week
675000	685000	Well I'm glad that they decided that fuck it we can't create a hinge that actually won't break very easily so we're just going to make a system that's super weird looking
686000	692000	Let's see DC Nate in chat says iPads don't fit in pockets either and they sell just fine
693000	698000	So talking about that maybe that type of affordability isn't necessarily a deal breaker
699000	702000	I understand that but who's having their kids bring iPads to fucking school?
703000	705000	Well it's huge in college
706000	712000	Okay yeah that's college but five and six year olds where this is actually targeted are you really going to spend that kind of money on it?
712000	722000	Well Dan's 12 year old cousin not Dan's I think it was like one of Becky or Chris's relatives got a 12 year old iPhone 5
723000	725000	What 12 year old needs that?
726000	730000	But it's a 12 year old I'm talking about a little kid that has a goddamn iPad
731000	745000	I mean here's the thing is you're talking to kids again and once again the main thing was 3D they don't really like the 3D because parents are concerned that they don't understand how to use a switch which is ridiculous
746000	748000	Well and you can actually turn off 3D and parental settings on the 3DS today
749000	758000	Exactly parental settings well they'll read the small print there but they won't read the manual so whatever okay so they're confused by the switch and stuff and oh that hinge is gonna break
758000	765000	What do you think the 2DS is gonna what do you think is gonna happen the 2DS the kids gonna drop on the ground and oh look both of those fucking screens are scratched now
766000	767000	Congratulations
768000	774000	I just think this is if you don't like it don't buy it and this isn't gonna break Nintendo's bank if this thing flops because I really don't think they're making that many of them
775000	777000	Well I guess they don't care if another system flops now don't they?
777000	788000	Well it's again they did not have the fanfare with E3 or even a Nintendo Direct or anything this was on a press release under the radar I don't think they have an expectation
789000	796000	Here's what it is they're just trying to put out another system to drive some more sales because Pokemans is coming out right around the corner and they have to make up for the losses of the Wii U
796000	802000	Because the Wii U let's be honest Wind Waker HD I love Wind Waker it's not gonna fucking pull that system out
803000	816000	Mario Kart 8 is really I know there's the Mario game as well but I think the combo of that and Mario Kart 8 is gonna be that's gonna be and if another price drop can squeeze in when Mario Kart 8 comes out that will really seal the deal
816000	827000	And I'm talking even if they can drop it just like 20 bucks I think that would be huge we'll see I mean we got a ways so alright anyhow last weeks news done over with
828000	829000	Damn it Kabuki needs to move to my town
830000	831000	One of your villagers moved to my town
832000	835000	Yeah I went by and saw a butch that traitor I'm gonna steal Kabuki
836000	844000	I was really surprised because I was like oh he came from Normandy oh that's Jamie's town oh she's gonna be pissed because this isn't the one she was trying to lose
844000	849000	No I want to lose Ed and I'm glad I'm not the only one that has to share the pain that Ed is
850000	854000	There she is playing her Nintendo system compulsively during the show
855000	856000	Hey you're the one that said you'd open your village
857000	866000	Alright anyhow I want to talk quickly about Dragon Con because I had a great time at Dragon Con I want to say hi to anybody new listening to the show who I might have networked with at Dragon Con
867000	876000	I got pulled onto a panel Monday morning at the last minute about streaming media and I got to talk kind of about the live 365 days and everything from that to like the modern Twitch TV
877000	885000	And I had a lot of fun so I just want to say hey to anybody who I might have met doing that or the VOG Network Super Show panel which sadly didn't have the greatest turnout live
886000	894000	But what's interesting is that apparently it had a great turnout online and we're getting good download numbers for it so it's I guess just a lot of you couldn't make it to Dragon Con in person
894000	903000	But I hope you enjoyed that show we had a lot of fun doing it and it sounds like we're going to be doing it again next year so I'm making my plans to go to Dragon Con 2014
904000	914000	But I had a wonderful time at Dragon Con I'm going to be honest the first couple days I was a little bit overwhelmed lots of people tried to get used to it I was jet lagged so I was a little crabby
914000	927000	But by the time Saturday night Sunday Monday I was really into it and the amount of talent I saw with the cosplay just really blew my mind and there's something special about Dragon Con because it doesn't really take place in a convention center
928000	934000	Well I mean like the dealer hall is there but it's across like five downtown hotels so just these
935000	936000	Sounds very AX
937000	938000	Well I've never been AX
939000	940000	A lot of AX shows spread across a convention center and three hotels
941000	942000	At least it was last time I went
942000	957000	But like oh my gosh just like the main floor of the Marriott just wall to wall people and then you go downstairs there's like multi level and there's these different ballrooms where there's artist alley and a room where you can walk up and meet celebrities and a board game room in the basement
958000	965000	I think that was at the Hilton had a board game area in the basement that was huge and that's the one that had the mech systems that Bobby's talked about on his show before
965000	970000	And you could lose track of time in there easy no windows to the outside because it's in the basement
971000	976000	And I can see how people can get stuck in there playing the wolf game or werewolf or whatever you call it till eight in the morning
977000	979000	Which by the way was the first time I ever saw that being played live
980000	985000	I played it online on DDR Freak back in the day but getting to see that playing live was a lot of fun
985000	997000	So lots of panels I really like how Dragon Con separates things into tracks and it's like okay Hilton 203 is going to be nothing but podcasts unless we get a really really big thing that might be one of the other rooms
998000	1007000	And they had an MMO track and a video game track the one thing I was a little less impressed with was the digital gaming room sorry I know some people work hard to put that on
1007000	1019000	But just it's not I mean to be fair Dragon Con is not a video game expo it's not PAX it's not a video game show so that wasn't supposed to be their main draw
1020000	1026000	But barely any console stuff to be seen it was very PC and you know there was a Smash Brothers tournament going on but that was about it
1027000	1034000	Like if it wasn't a tournament or some PC play that's really about it but lots of 3DS street passing to be had that's for sure
1034000	1041000	So yeah I don't know what else to say about Dragon Con I had a great time it was great to just meet people that I've worked with for many years
1042000	1049000	Finally getting to meet Brad from Pod Culture and some of his cohorts and they were very generous in getting me very drunk very quickly so thank you for that
1050000	1058000	And meeting some of Bobby's friends these are people like I've heard about but haven't really met and one of his friends Sue and I hit it off really well I just love her to bits
1059000	1062000	And she was giving out vodka soaked gummy bears all weekend so love her
1062000	1064000	I want to go next year Rob
1065000	1072000	You really should and some folks in the chat room are talking about there should be a vod con seriously and SSG100Matt says Dragon Con might be the closest thing to vod con
1073000	1081000	I mean honestly in a way kinda because putting on a con is really hard piggy backing on someone else's con is much easier
1082000	1087000	Especially a huge con like Dragon Con just be prepared for tons and tons of people
1087000	1094000	Getting to see Travis you realize it's been like 10 years since I've seen Travis so getting to be there with him when he was doing his cosplay
1095000	1104000	He did an amazing job as Commander Shepard and if you guys haven't heard him and his wife Jenna Mark Meir the voice of Mael Shep renewed their vows one of the mornings
1105000	1109000	I'm very pressed because it was a surprise so I wasn't told it was going to happen so I didn't go
1110000	1111000	Were you all the clumps for not going?
1111000	1117000	I was a little bit like you did what? Why wasn't I told I would have got up I would have forced myself out of bed
1118000	1120000	Oh well I had a great time
1121000	1127000	Yeah so I'm already planning to go back next year and I feel bad for PAX Prime
1128000	1137000	Apparently there was plenty of fuckery that happened in one of the panels I don't really want to get into that controversial issue right now because I'm sure you've all read about it
1138000	1139000	I love fuckery panels those are the best to watch
1139000	1148000	Well all I'm saying is that you know Penny Arcade Expo I love the vibe of Penny Arcade Expo and I still do kind of want to go to Penny Arcade East but
1149000	1154000	Some people there really need some PR help big time and just
1155000	1157000	Some people there need to get their foot out of their mouth
1158000	1165000	And it seems to be perpetual is the problem I'm starting to have it's like every time you think they're doing they're on the right path it's just whoop foot goes right back and mouth
1165000	1177000	And it's like you guys are there's a lot of good things that those guys do but then it's like you know how long are we going to sit here and just like kind of turn the other way
1178000	1182000	When there's one of them won't stop with this running his mouth anyway
1183000	1187000	Rob next year if I can make it to DragonCon by the way we need to cosplay
1188000	1193000	I'm already talking about cosplay with Travis too but I would be down I mean there's like four days of cons that's four cosplays
1193000	1199000	I've actually already been working on my costume for one of the SAC anime next year so
1200000	1209000	I would like to consider going to PAX East just throwing that out there I still would like to try and make that happen we'll see I just it's money at this point you guys cons be expensive
1210000	1217000	And then they just announced gamer X2 is going to be earlier next year it's going to be Alan's birthday weekend in mid July so there's that con to look forward to as well
1217000	1226000	What else did I want to say about DragonCon? I don't know I think I said do you guys have questions or anybody in chat?
1227000	1234000	Who did you notice any of the sci-fi or fantasy writers who were guests that year? I didn't see
1235000	1240000	I didn't really do celebrity sightings I didn't even go to see Kathy Najimy which was the one celebrity I really wanted to see I kind of just skipped all that
1241000	1243000	I know Travis ran into George Takei the lucky fucker
1243000	1248000	I would have totally wanted to see was it the guys from Mythbusters are over there
1249000	1256000	They did a whole special show at the Fox Theater one night they did like a special live show and then they did like a panel yeah it was a good time
1257000	1266000	Oh Bobby's mentioning the Parsec Awards yes that was a lot of fun we got to present at this prestigious award they do for speculative fiction casts at DragonCon
1267000	1275000	And you can actually see the YouTube online and myself, Bobby and Travis presenting at the awards and Brad is in it too he did an award earlier in the presentation so lots of VOG
1276000	1284000	But what's funny is that because of a schedule shuffle where Sylvester McCoy the seventh doctor was supposed to present the last award well he had to do the first award instead
1285000	1293000	So guess who got to do the very last award of the evening? VOG got to present that award so we had a whole little spiel we made up like 30 minutes before the thing
1293000	1298000	And that went pretty well I had an Oprah moment up on stage and pretended to be drunk I was not really drunk
1299000	1307000	You gave everyone B's? Huh? You gave everyone B's? No I said something along the lines of I wish everybody could have an award because all the indie podcasters worked so hard
1308000	1314000	And if I were Oprah I'd say you get an award and you get an award and I think I actually danced so you can see me all jiggling up there on stage
1315000	1325000	I'm leaving your village now. Bye bye. I've already looted it. Get out. Alright I think that's all I want to say on DragonCon because I know we have a lot of gaming news and other stuff we want to get into
1326000	1341000	Good time, WoodCon again. A++. Let's get into our gaming weeks I suppose it's time for. I'm a little off after having a week off. Let's talk about our gaming weeks. What have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?
1341000	1353000	Animal Crossing. And I wanted to play Final Fantasy 14 but apparently my account was rendered inactive so when I went to go register my collector's edition code it created another account
1354000	1362000	So now I have two accounts. One of them with no characters and the other one with my characters on it that I can't access. So I've opened a ticket. I'm calling Square tomorrow. Hopefully get everything fixed
1362000	1371000	But man they don't have their phone number anywhere on their site and I had to go look at that locate customer service website so I've got that
1372000	1385000	I played some more Fractal. I'm super addicted to that game. I actually started DuckTales. And yeah that's about it. I mean I've really had a lot on my plate. I had a job interview.
1386000	1393000	Oh no I played something else. I don't remember what it is so it's not important. Your turn.
1394000	1406000	Alright well this week I didn't play a whole ton. I did a little bit of catching up. Well this is even kind of including last week a little bit. Saints Row IV so I finished playing that kind of
1406000	1417000	I mean I'm still, what was it? Last night I spent a good while modding the files in there to try to unlock DLC without paying for it. But that didn't work.
1418000	1430000	So I was trying to then unlock weapons that were not really weapons that you can use but they're weapons that are in the game kind of like some of the enemies have in some of the flashback missions and stuff
1430000	1446000	But I didn't get that to work. And then I was playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto IV just because I'd watch somebody do or attempt to do this like kind of six star run from one side of the map to the other.
1447000	1459000	And I probably could do it but I could probably only do it in multiplayer because in single player you have limited sprinting. You don't have unlimited sprint and your characters run about as good as I do.
1460000	1475000	And just they run out of steam just after a few feet of sprinting so that just didn't work. Plus the AI is really cheap. I mean you jump into the water there's no boats and then like two seconds later all of a sudden there's five boats and they've run over you.
1476000	1502000	Multiple times like where those boats just teleport from. They weren't here a second ago. So yeah I didn't really end up doing that. So I ended up instead filming some of my I don't know if I want to call parkour but like like free climbing I guess it's something I used to do in multiplayer because I got tired of beating everybody so badly in our multiplayer games at work.
1502000	1517000	And so I used to climb buildings and still kill them. So I filmed some of those buildings and things that you know I used to climb on and I thought it'd be fun to edit it together and do some more stuff.
1518000	1528000	So I did that and then a little bit of Call of Duty at work but I'm getting really bored with it because I've handicapped myself quite a bit and I still keep winning so I just I don't know what I can.
1528000	1544000	And we can't really play live anymore because our Internet connection is just shit. So yeah. And then also it's just my boss. I'm usually is playing my boss and pot sometimes our IT guy but it's just getting so boring.
1545000	1556000	It's what happens when they lay off all your friends you know. So bummer. Wow. All the people they used to play with. So what are you gonna do. That's it. Stock them.
1556000	1566000	All right. My gaming week. You know because I was at a con for several days I didn't get to play a lot of new stuff at the con but except for one thing I'll talk about at the end.
1567000	1576000	But I did come home I played quite an obscene amount of Final Fantasy 14. But I know we've talked about it to death on this show and there's really not a lot more I can say.
1576000	1592000	I got White Mage. I did play a couple new games on PlayStation 3. I played Castle of Illusion the HD remake or whatever that came out. Did they change a lot in that game or is it just me because there's like things in it.
1592000	1606000	I'm like wait a minute. This wasn't here before. They were saying and I was watching an interview with the creator and also the original designer and the new people and they're talking about how they actually did make some changes to make it more of a Disney film like.
1607000	1616000	OK. So well then there's like a very Mario 64 vibe in the beginning with the castle and everything I'm like I don't remember. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's just an illusion that it's different. Shut up.
1616000	1630000	But I haven't really played enough of it to give you a really firm opinion on it but definitely you know has that feel of the Genesis classic and you know I think if you enjoyed the Genesis version of you probably already bought this.
1631000	1640000	One game I spent a little more time playing was a music game on PlayStation 3 called Kickbeat. I don't know if you guys have heard of this. It's a music game which I haven't got to play a lot of those lately.
1640000	1654000	Although I also played the demo for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F and I won it. Like that was actually a lot of fun. It reminded me of a PlayStation 2 music game. The price is what's scaring me on that game. I'm like $50 for Hatsune Miku really.
1655000	1673000	That's too much money. But Kickbeat is more like $10 or $15. I think it was $15 as a download title. And essentially it's set up like it's a little karate thing but your buttons like X and square and circle are all laid out as up down left and right as they are on the pad.
1673000	1683000	And these little ninja dudes will come out onto the spot and that's when you kick them. And so like you'll be playing along to the music and you know you'll see a little ninja come out and you hit the button and it kills them.
1684000	1692000	But you have a little bit of warning. So it's just like a different way of reading instead of notes scrolling down the screen. It's little ninjas sending themselves into position.
1693000	1701000	And depending on the shirts they wear tell you kind of like when the beats are. So like if it's a yellow it's on the beat. If it's blue then you're going to have half beats or third beats.
1702000	1708000	But sometimes you have red ones which means it's two buttons at the same time. And sometimes you have like I think it's like orangey where it's like a hold.
1709000	1714000	It's a very different way of doing a music game and it's pretty cool to watch your guy like do all the karate moves as he's doing it.
1715000	1717000	Does he duck turn?
1717000	1729000	He's not as fabulous as Parappa was. I'm going to tell you what else is as fabulous as Parappa was. This is completely a matter of opinion and some of you are going to disagree with me strongly on this.
1730000	1739000	I don't like the song list in the game at all. It's a lot of hard rock music. Some of you would like Pendulum and you know those were the songs that bothered me the least probably in the game.
1739000	1746000	But like one of them is a remix. What were the huge Pendulum songs? Colors? Was that their song?
1747000	1748000	Colors yeah.
1749000	1751000	That's not in there. It's other stuff.
1752000	1755000	It's probably Slam or I'm trying to think of the other one.
1756000	1764000	But it's just stuff I don't really listen to in my normal life. I liked my techno DDR stuff and all that.
1764000	1771000	But there are people that like that music that will be very excited about this game that it incorporates that into it.
1772000	1780000	And apparently if you beat the game once you can import your own music into it. I'm not sure how well that's going to work because it doesn't always work very well those algorithms.
1781000	1785000	But I'd like to try it. I'm trying to play through the game one time so I can at least try it.
1785000	1794000	But you know for 15 bucks you could do a lot worse. If you like music games especially if you like hard rock, metal and things like that you'd probably get a kick out of it.
1795000	1797000	So check it out.
1798000	1805000	Akuma JP in chat says is sexy and I know it in there. Very much no. Unless you play it as your own mp3.
1806000	1809000	Marilyn Manson's The Beautiful People is in it. That was one song I recognized.
1809000	1819000	What's that? Boom. Don't ask me to sing these songs. It's terrible. What is that band P.O.D. Is that their name? That song's in there.
1820000	1825000	Well you know that actually that song a remix of that song was in Amplitude.
1826000	1830000	Oh that's true. That is true. Alright well anyway so that's kick beat.
1831000	1835000	And between that and Final Fantasy is pretty much all I did you know because I was gone for a week.
1835000	1844000	However at Dragon Con Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus Rift after all. He threatened not to bring it because we were all going to be too drunk to play it.
1845000	1846000	That's the perfect time to play it.
1847000	1851000	Well I can understand because it's a very expensive piece of hardware and you know he doesn't want us flinging around.
1852000	1854000	It's over your eyes not your mouth. If you vomit it's going to miss it.
1855000	1863000	Well he didn't bring Slender Man either so I didn't get to do the scary game. From what I understand Slender Man's on injection drivers. It's more of a hack anyway.
1863000	1873000	He did YouTube me playing it for the first time. Some type of roller coaster demo that we were doing where the roller coaster like the track just ends up missing at one part so your car goes flying.
1874000	1880000	I will say this. It's an impressive piece of technology. I was very impressed with it.
1881000	1889000	And it is exactly what you think it is. If you haven't heard of Oculus Rift it's a headset. You put it on your head. It ties to the PC right now.
1889000	1896000	And what you see is you see full 3D out the goggles but as you turn your head your field of vision moves.
1897000	1903000	So when you look up, you look up. When you look down, you look down. So as you imagine the games have to kind of support this technology.
1904000	1907000	So right now it's a lot of demos and concept things and that's really what I looked at.
1908000	1915000	And one of the things I looked at was a very Myst style type of game where you were walking around these different ramps.
1915000	1922000	And you can use an Xbox 360 controller to walk. That's how you move forward and things like that. The looking is different.
1923000	1930000	And you can go in these rooms and you can flip the stage upside down so you kind of have that sensation of flipping upside down while you're doing it.
1931000	1936000	And that was a really cool little demo to do. Now Bobby did do some injection drivers so we could do some fun stuff.
1937000	1943000	Like he had a Super Nintendo emulator thing so we could play Mario Kart with the Oculus Rift which basically looked like this big theater.
1943000	1950000	But as you looked, it was really detailed. Like if you look down, you see a little shadow holding a controller playing the game.
1951000	1956000	If you look up, you see a projector on the ceiling that actually is projecting the actual image you see in front of you.
1957000	1960000	So I thought that was a very immersive cool thing. But here was the really cool one.
1961000	1972000	He had a GameCube emulator with F-Zero GX. So I got to play F-Zero GX on the Rift and I'll tell you the first time I went around a loop, that was quite the sensation.
1973000	1979000	That was something else. Because you know, imagine you put this thing on, you have headphones on, it's a trip.
1980000	1987000	So yeah, it's something you have to experience. I can't explain it to you but I will tell you it's a pretty impressive piece of technology.
1988000	1994000	It works. The one thing I could say about it is that it's low resolution but it's supposed to be because it's a dev kit.
1994000	2004000	Right now it's a dev kit. And if I looked really closely, I could actually see the little pieces of glass or whatever that make up the RGB or whatever it is.
2005000	2011000	You know how if you sit up really close to an old television, you can see the little pieces of color that make up the big picture?
2012000	2013000	You can kind of see that in the Rift a little bit.
2014000	2016000	Like the RGB artificing, right?
2016000	2024000	Exactly, yeah. But again, I'm being super nitpicky. The sensation of being able to look around and having it move with you in real time is pretty cool.
2025000	2026000	And the 3D is done very well.
2027000	2040000	The last time I played a VR game, it was at Santa Cruz the Boardwalk and it was Quake 1 and I think Duke Nukem 3D.
2040000	2048000	But we played two deathmatches in that game. Yeah, that was kind of derpy because it's Quake.
2049000	2056000	You can imagine those screens were very low resolution. It's like having two TVs in front of your eyes. But it was fun.
2057000	2064000	Well, apparently on the PC while you have the headset on, Bobby could see what I was doing because it shows you on the PC it just splits the screen in left and right.
2064000	2070000	Like what's going on in the left eye and what's going on in the right eye. So he could see everything I was doing in the Rift, which is cool.
2071000	2077000	Let's see, Black Wolf is in chat right now. Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf who tapes before us at Voice of the Geeks Network says,
2078000	2081000	The Gallery Airworld demo was the name of the Myst thing I was playing. It was pretty cool.
2082000	2086000	So there was another demo that involved a house, but there was like all you did is you walked in.
2086000	2093000	You know what it really reminded me of? It was the modern version of, remember all those old virtual reality demos back in the mid 90s?
2094000	2096000	I remember there was this old one where you walked around the neighborhood with a car.
2097000	2099000	They should totally have that for the Oculus Rift. Like the old 90s virtual reality demos.
2100000	2103000	They probably do. Bobby didn't show me everything. He didn't have time.
2104000	2106000	You know what? It just keeps popping into my head over and over with Oculus Rift.
2107000	2108000	The Lawnmower Man? Yes! I was thinking of, yes.
2109000	2111000	Well the movie, the book had nothing to do with it.
2112000	2115000	Now is the time to bring back the Lawnmower Man game or something. It would be kind of fun.
2116000	2119000	So again, Oculus Rift is one of those things you just have to try it for yourself.
2120000	2125000	Not even a TV show could explain it to you because you have to have it on your head and try it yourself.
2126000	2127000	I will say this too. One other thing.
2128000	2129000	That means you have to give it head?
2130000	2138000	Well here's the thing DarkSakura. You'd hate it because your motion sickness, I couldn't play it for more than 20 minutes before I was like, okay I need to take this thing off.
2139000	2140000	I was getting motion sick playing Borderlands 2.
2140000	2151000	And that's this device's biggest weakness. I can't possibly see how somebody can have a two hour marathon gaming session with this thing.
2152000	2159000	You might get used to it or something, but I just, I really worry about the effect it may have on people.
2160000	2163000	I mean, here we are talking about earlier in the show Nintendo putting out a TV system.
2164000	2165000	He had porn. He did not share porn with you.
2166000	2167000	He didn't show me the porn!
2167000	2169000	That is not. That is not.
2170000	2173000	He's making me come back next year. That's what it is. It's a big ploy to get me to come back next year.
2174000	2175000	That is just downright.
2176000	2177000	I could have seen boobies on Oculus Rift.
2178000	2180000	That is very rude that you don't share porn with your guests.
2181000	2187000	Very rude. Bobby. Alright. Well anyway, I guess it gives me a reason to go back next year.
2188000	2190000	But anyway, the sickness thing though, that's a legit concern I would have.
2191000	2195000	I'm really curious to see like what are the long term effects this thing has?
2195000	2199000	Like what do the warnings on this thing look like? What do doctors think about it?
2200000	2201000	Because they are legitimate concerns.
2202000	2203000	There's bound to be epilepsy concerns.
2204000	2214000	Long term effects, you may be immersed into the 3D world and may become a cybernetic being that will then try to take over the whole electric infrastructure and internet.
2215000	2216000	This is the start of the Matrix.
2217000	2218000	This is the start of the Matrix.
2219000	2220000	A la Lawn Mower Man.
2220000	2226000	It is. Remember when you get killed in the Matrix, you get killed in real life just because of the sensations or whatever?
2227000	2235000	When you are going over this loop in F-Zero, I felt it a little bit. It wasn't the same as riding a roller coaster.
2236000	2241000	There was. I don't know if Bobby has seen it yet. I'm sure he has. I think you may have seen it from him.
2241000	2250000	But they have a, it was a game made in unity, a Tron light cycle demo with the Oculus Rift.
2251000	2259000	Bobby. Bobby Black Wolf is defending his choices in chat saying Rob wanted to go drink before I got to the porn.
2260000	2261000	Well that is probably accurate.
2262000	2263000	I think Booze Over Porn is.
2264000	2265000	To be fair that is probably accurate.
2266000	2267000	And besides that, porn is just really bad comedy.
2268000	2274000	Alright so yes, I tried the Oculus Rift people. Not that I'm going to say you have that kind of money to buy one.
2275000	2280000	But I'm sure these demos are going to start to get out there more and more, add other expos and so forth.
2281000	2284000	It was something you have to experience for yourself.
2285000	2290000	It very well could be the future of gaming as we'll get into in gaming news here in a minute.
2291000	2293000	But first, some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.
2293000	2299000	Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2300000	2302000	We do have a quick housekeeping note here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
2303000	2309000	Something that we did announce at our DragonCon panel on Saturday was that a new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network Radio.
2310000	2314000	Yay! And very happy to have this show on board with us.
2315000	2321000	The show is Electric Sistahood and it's going to be debuting Tuesdays at, I always get screwed up by time zones.
2321000	2323000	Tuesdays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
2324000	2329000	And this is really cool because it's going to lead right into Anime Jam Sessions pre-show and their live shows.
2330000	2333000	Now we have a Tuesday block. We have a Monday block, a Wednesday block, and a Tuesday block now.
2334000	2336000	Instead of just one show on Tuesdays. So it's pretty nice.
2337000	2338000	Have we gone up a level?
2339000	2344000	We have leveled up. And I really like that Electric Sistahood is very much a girl power show.
2344000	2347000	You know, it's fronted by two sisters who live out of Boston.
2348000	2352000	And I love, you know, obviously they have guys that they work with too.
2353000	2355000	There's the Boston Bastard Brigade, some of them that we met at E3 and so forth.
2356000	2358000	And they do a lot with EGM now and so forth.
2359000	2363000	But I just, I love that we are diversifying things more here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
2364000	2368000	I mean we already had a great female fronted show in Girls Gone Wow.
2368000	2375000	And lots of strong women voices on the network with you and Christina and Jessica and Patty and, you know, everybody.
2376000	2378000	So, sorry if I'm, I know I'm leaving people out.
2379000	2382000	But yeah, I am loving what we're doing here at VOG.
2383000	2384000	We embrace diversity.
2385000	2386000	That is right.
2387000	2389000	We play Genesis and Super Nintendo and Turbo Graphics.
2390000	2396000	And once in a while you may catch us off the air listening to Sonic US and Japanese soundtracks.
2396000	2398000	No. No. That doesn't happen.
2401000	2402000	Alright. Rama's in chat.
2403000	2404000	That only happens when I hook up the Sega CD.
2405000	2408000	Rama's in chat very excited saying East Coast run Tuesday nights on VOG Network.
2409000	2412000	Yes, I guess that is true. It is an East Coast night Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
2413000	2419000	If you have a geek-centered show or you know someone that produces a geek-centered show that you think would be a good fit for the Voice of Geeks Network,
2420000	2421000	we are looking to add to our family even more.
2422000	2424000	You can get in touch with me, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.
2424000	2431000	All we ask is that it be an established show because we want to make sure that the people are dedicated to their craft
2432000	2435000	because so many podcasts do fizzle in the first few weeks, unfortunately.
2436000	2438000	So we want to make sure that it's already established that the folks are dedicated.
2439000	2442000	And we are a little filled up on video game shows at this point.
2443000	2447000	Electric Sisterhood also focuses on video games, although they also do tech and anime, so they're a little bit that.
2448000	2452000	So if your show is primarily video games, that might be a bit too much for the network right now.
2452000	2456000	But we have big-time openings for board games as a show I want real bad.
2457000	2459000	We don't have anything on comics, and I'd love to get a comic-based show.
2460000	2462000	I've been trying to talk to a couple people.
2463000	2464000	Well, where is that pilot, madam?
2465000	2467000	Well, you know what? I need to hear from a certain somebody who lives in the Bay Area.
2468000	2469000	God, why'd you make my accent come back?
2470000	2474000	But you get the idea. So you can contact me again, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.
2476000	2480000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGNetwork.com,
2480000	2482000	use the passphrase, SPOON.
2483000	2487000	Alright, enough promotion. Let's get into video game news. It's what you guys are here for. Loki!
2488000	2490000	Alright, so let's talk about promotion.
2491000	2496000	The Xbox One, they finally announced that their launch date will be the 22nd.
2497000	2504000	Also Friday, also eight years after the Xbox 360 launch, and one week past the PlayStation 4 launch.
2505000	2509000	And also one week before Black Friday, which is when you expect consoles are going to come out.
2510000	2515000	Why were people so dead set on, oh, Xbox One's going to be the first to market, and it has to be the first?
2516000	2519000	Honestly, I still think it's coming out too early. I think that they're not going to have enough.
2520000	2523000	Well, they're releasing in a very few regions, and I think they're going to...
2524000	2535000	I remember Major Nelson, he's like, okay, look, here's the first case of boxes, or the systems, off the assembly line.
2535000	2541000	And he tweeted that, I'm like, I almost wanted to respond back, I'm like, it's not that impressive, that's only two systems, buddy.
2542000	2551000	You know, that would have been rude of me, and I did not do that. So, I thought that in my head, laughed to myself, and went back to working.
2552000	2561000	But, yeah, so that is coming out there. It's going to be launching 13 markets, and, you know, cool. 500 bucks, all that fun stuff.
2561000	2571000	On top of that, though, there's going to be some minor tweaks. One, they made the announcement that they're going to be upping the processor speed a little bit.
2572000	2582000	I guess that they tested the system runs cool enough, and so now they can kick up the processor speed to 1.75 gigahertz instead of 1.6 gigahertz.
2582000	2591000	And then, of course, the CPU got boosted early in August from, was it, from 800 to 853 megahertz.
2592000	2595000	What kind of difference that's going to make, I don't think it's going to be night and day, but whatever.
2596000	2608000	So, cool, better specs. Also, in Europe, you're going to be getting FIFA 14 with your Xbox One Day One Edition consoles.
2608000	2618000	Also, there were a few retailers in case you didn't want the FIFA. You can also get a Forza 5, so I believe that's separate.
2619000	2628000	Nothing like that announced yet for the US or North America. Not sure if they're going to do anything like that, but I don't know. It'd be interesting.
2629000	2637000	And then, also, there was, this is like a bunch of bullet points from different things. So, the Xbox One can support up to eight controllers at once.
2638000	2647000	Remember, the PlayStation 3 can support up to seven. I believe there was like NBA 2K used that, and I don't know, maybe FIFA, and that's about it.
2648000	2656000	And then, of course, PlayStation 4 only four. So, you know, right there, people are going, there you go, Xbox One's going to win this generation because they support eight controllers.
2656000	2668000	When have you ever had that many people over playing one video game? Well, I shouldn't say that. There are parties, and I've seen Rock Band Nights and so forth, but that's so few and far between.
2669000	2680000	Its implementation is going to be very limited. I mean, like I said, there is only a couple, like, I swear, less than five games that probably use that seven controller configuration because they're just not going to do that.
2680000	2693000	I mean, sure, Microsoft would like you to believe that there's going to be a lot of situations that require that, so you have to buy those extra controllers, but I don't think that there's actually going to be, you know, there's probably going to be four players, like, you know, like most games are going to be four players.
2694000	2698000	I don't think you're going to have eight people, and definitely not split screen because that'd be just fucking stupid.
2699000	2708000	Don't get me wrong. I think it's cool that, and like, I'm not knocking Xbox One for having that, but I'm just saying it's not the deal maker or breaker that some people on the internet are making out to be.
2708000	2715000	It's like, okay, neat. Let's see what games are going to do with that. What are games going to do with that? We'll see.
2716000	2718000	It'd be better if you could hook up eight Kinects.
2719000	2720000	No, it would not.
2720000	2721000	TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.
2724000	2743000	Alright, and then, also, external storage will not be supported at launch, so the 500 gigabyte hard drive that comes in there, well, that's going to have to be enough for a while because that's all you can do with it, because you're not going to be able to store stuff using the USB ports yet.
2745000	2747000	So, I hope those games aren't that big.
2748000	2751000	There's not that many games coming out. I mean, 500 gigabytes is quite a bit.
2752000	2755000	Why is there an expectation here that we're going to get a free game just because Europe is?
2756000	2763000	I think because people think that they want, it's not fair, Rob. It's not fair. Honestly, I think it's because the price point's too high.
2764000	2765000	But, Daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.
2766000	2774000	I think that they think that the price point's still too high and that they keep trying to lure more people into buying the system.
2775000	2779000	Europe pays more for their systems, though, in games in general, though, don't they, when you convert dollars to Euros and all that?
2780000	2785000	I understand that, but it would still be the same, you know, so you're going to have a more sensitive game.
2786000	2788000	And Sony's traditionally had the advantage in Europe, right?
2789000	2790000	I don't know.
2791000	2792000	I get it.
2792000	2801000	I don't think that they will, but, I mean, people would like to think that, I guess. I would be kind of annoyed if it was Madden, you know, like, I don't fucking care about Madden.
2802000	2803000	Yeah, but a lot of fucking people care about Madden.
2804000	2805000	I understand that.
2806000	2815000	That is a pretty big deal if they do get that. I mean, as much as I'm sitting here saying I don't think people should have an expectation about it, if they do come out and say Madden's coming out free with the Xbox One, there's going to be a lot of people that are like,
2815000	2821000	oh dude, but if you get Xbox One, you get Madden. But I still think that price difference is going to be a little like, but it's also $100 more, dude.
2822000	2840000	I think what they could do is like maybe some free live, maybe, or free something else, you know, that doesn't really cost them anything, like, you know, free, like digital stuff, you know, maybe like a free, you know, you get, well, Killer Instinct, I don't know, maybe that would be kind of, you get Killer Instinct.
2841000	2842000	You are getting that.
2842000	2865000	But then again, you know, it's free to play, you know, essentially for demos, free to play. Um, I don't know, I think it seems like you get more value with the PlayStation 4 as far as like PlayStation Plus, you know, because you're getting some free games with that, but you don't really get any, I mean, maybe they offer like some free games with gold, you know, because they're doing that games of gold thing right now with, you know, Xbox 360.
2865000	2883000	You know, maybe they offer something like that for the Xbox One, like one of the games, but I don't know, I don't think it's necessary, but I think that there might be something they need to do when, you know, and maybe that close to Black Friday's, you know, they're going to have some retailers doing that already.
2884000	2909000	Okay. All right. Well, let's move on, talking about, this isn't necessarily console-based, at least for now, but it looks like it might end up there, and this was some huge news that came out. It technically was the week we were off, but this is such huge news that we have to talk about it tonight, and it is about a Kickstarter, which usually, you know, whatever, these things are turning out to be a dime a dozen, but this one is, this one is shaping up to be a game changer.
2909000	2924000	It is Kiji Inafune's new Kickstarter. If you don't know that name, he is the creator of Mega Man, and he was formerly a Capcom producer. He has turned to Kickstarter to fund a game called Mighty No. 9, and it's Mega Man.
2924000	2932000	Like, it's not, I'm not, you're not supposed to say that because, you know, oh, well, there's, there, there are some differences in the way things are, it's fucking Mega Man.
2932000	2933000	It's fucking Mega Man.
2933000	2948000	It's fucking Mega Man. It's, it's the game people want that Capcom, for whatever reason, figured would fail, and now Capcom's having to eat a little crow with this because this Kickstarter currently, it was funded, I want to say, within the first day.
2948000	2949000	Of course, a couple hours.
2949000	2957000	It was a couple hours, and where's it at right now? 1.8 million, 1.8 million, 32,000 backers with 22 days to go.
2957000	2960000	Which means now we get a Linux version, a Mac version.
2960000	2964000	That's right, a Making of Documentary, New Game Plus, and Turbo Mode, two bonus stages.
2964000	2965000	And almost console versions.
2965000	2972000	Almost console versions. If they hit 2.2 million, which they will, they're gonna get PS3, 360, and Wii U versions of this game.
2972000	2976000	I'm just upset that it uses Amazon payments, which for some reason, for me, is not working.
2976000	2977000	Oh, for Kickstarter?
2977000	2979000	Because this was going to take my Kickstarter virginity.
2979000	2980000	Was it?
2980000	2981000	Just, just hold out.
2981000	2983000	Oh yes, I was going to, my body was ready.
2983000	2984000	Why?
2984000	2987000	Because freaking Mega Man. Fuck.
2987000	2989000	Fair enough.
2989000	2991000	Does that need an explanation?
2991000	2993000	But it's not Mega Man. This is Mighty No. 9.
2993000	2996000	Do not care. Do not care. It will be Mega Man in my heart.
2996000	2998000	The art is only similar because it's the same guy.
2998000	3000000	Do. Not. Care.
3001000	3006000	And it's not because I don't like it, but because, you know, I've kind of learned the Kickstarter stuff now.
3006000	3011000	It's like, I put money down now, and the game doesn't come out until, like, late next year or something.
3011000	3015000	It's like, no thanks, I'll just keep my money now and I'll buy it when it comes out.
3015000	3017000	Because it's gonna be probably about the same price anyways.
3017000	3022000	You know, 10, 15 dollars, and you put down 10 or 15 dollars for the game now.
3022000	3026000	It's like, whatever. That's it.
3026000	3029000	I've been very conservative with Kickstarter stuff.
3029000	3031000	Except for Video Game High School, of course.
3031000	3033000	I'll buy anything they put out.
3033000	3036000	I found it very interesting in that video.
3036000	3041000	Did you guys watch the Kickstarter video? The little 5 minute, well produced thing that had the pitch in it?
3041000	3046000	There was a very quick line, but something that really caught my attention was something about, he said,
3046000	3051000	when the game he wanted to make, or the game that he was making, was cancelled, he was devastated.
3051000	3054000	And I was kinda like, wow.
3054000	3061000	So this whole Mega Man universe thing really burned him to the point where he's gonna make it anyway.
3061000	3071000	Well, you know, it's not Mega Man, but this is just so crazy to me how Capcom really just said,
3071000	3075000	you know what, this franchise just isn't worth investing in anymore.
3075000	3079000	And now you've got 32,000 people climbing saying yes it is.
3080000	3085000	Well, you had 100,000 people that joined that Facebook group and then more.
3085000	3087000	Yeah, but it's important to put your money where your mouth is.
3087000	3091000	I think that a lot of those people are gonna put their money where their mouth is.
3091000	3092000	I think they will, too.
3092000	3096000	I think there are quite a few people like you that just don't want to participate in Kickstarter
3096000	3098000	that will wait for the game to come out.
3098000	3102000	There's a lot of reasons why, especially there's a lot of, we'll get into some of that stuff later on,
3102000	3107000	but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on with Kickstarter that some of these projects aren't worth backing.
3107000	3111000	Not to say that this one is one of those, but it's just kind of...
3111000	3112000	Is it the Ouya Burn?
3112000	3113000	No, it's not the Ouya.
3113000	3117000	It's just like there's other projects out there.
3117000	3121000	I've gotten into some of that stuff before, but not to get so far off topic.
3121000	3127000	It's just I don't really want to, I've been very much, I'm gonna put money down.
3127000	3132000	I did that for Shadowrun and Shadowrun Online and stuff, and Shadowrun's awesome,
3132000	3135000	and I haven't played that game since I got it.
3135000	3138000	I got the game, and I'm like, cool, I have the game.
3138000	3140000	Alright, I'm gonna go off and do something else now.
3140000	3145000	And Shadowrun Online, cool, I pledged for that, and I haven't played that yet.
3145000	3149000	And there's still a few more games that I have back that haven't even come out yet,
3149000	3153000	and I just don't play them once I've paid for them.
3153000	3161000	Here's how Beck, the hero of Mega Man, which isn't there supposed to be a female command called Call?
3161000	3164000	So instead of Rock and Roll, we get Beck and Call, right?
3164000	3166000	Okay, so here's how Beck is different.
3166000	3169000	Beck takes the abilities of the enemy robots he defeats,
3169000	3174000	but he uses those abilities further, transforming parts of his body,
3174000	3180000	like his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields.
3180000	3183000	That sounds really awesome, but it's fucking Mega Man.
3183000	3186000	Not that that's bad, that's not a bad thing, I'm just saying this is hilarious,
3186000	3189000	because it is fucking Mega Man that we are backing.
3189000	3193000	And the other games may just change the color palette a little bit and just give him a different weapon.
3193000	3199000	We're changing his design a little bit, and his color palette, and he's fucking Mega Man.
3199000	3204000	It's like another Mega Man series, Mega Man Y or something.
3204000	3207000	It's like if the creators of DDR came out and said,
3207000	3209000	hey, you know what, we're going to make In the Groove,
3209000	3212000	but we're just going to change things just enough so we don't get sued,
3212000	3216000	because we don't have the rights to DDR anymore.
3216000	3218000	And that's what we have.
3218000	3221000	Bochi Kawa in chat at live.vog.network.com says,
3221000	3224000	I was really concerned once they called the main character Beck,
3224000	3228000	but once Call came to my attention, I was totally okay with it.
3228000	3230000	I totally fucking hate that band, Beck.
3230000	3232000	It's not a band, it's a person.
3232000	3234000	Whatever.
3234000	3238000	If you have two turntables and a microphone, you're banned.
3238000	3240000	That's like Alan's favorite musician.
3240000	3242000	But the Ghetto Chip malfunction EP was really good.
3242000	3244000	It was really good. Beck should do music for them.
3244000	3248000	Actually, no, he shouldn't, because they actually have the original lady
3248000	3252000	that did the Mega Man 1 music is doing the music for this.
3252000	3254000	Besides that, Beck did a lot of the music for Scott Pilgrim.
3254000	3255000	Let me pull up the...
3255000	3256000	Remember?
3256000	3258000	Yes, I do, and that was great.
3258000	3262000	Let me pull up the Kickstarter real quick, because...
3262000	3264000	Sorry, live radio, what can you do?
3264000	3266000	I want to actually play a little bit of this,
3266000	3268000	because they actually have it on the Kickstarter page.
3268000	3271000	They have some of the, it's not Mega Man,
3271000	3275000	Mega Man number 9 theme song by...
3275000	3277000	Scrolling down here, where...
3277000	3280000	God, lord, there's so much content on this page already.
3283000	3285000	Oh, this is terrible radio, I'm very sorry, you guys.
3285000	3290000	And I like how he's the number 9, because there are eight other bosses
3290000	3292000	that he's gonna have to fight.
3292000	3296000	Manami Matsumae did the soundtrack of the original Mega Man
3296000	3299000	and the iconic soundtracks, and she is going to be doing this game,
3299000	3301000	and already has the theme song out there.
3308000	3312000	Like, you can just see the camera panning up the tall story building to this music.
3312000	3315000	Actually, I think they did that in the Kickstarter video, didn't they?
3315000	3316000	I think they did.
3316000	3319000	Let me fast forward a little bit, so you get more of that vibe.
3330000	3334000	Totally not Mega Man, totally a new thing, totally.
3334000	3337000	You gotta admit, though, the music, the vibe with the music
3337000	3339000	between the first Rock Man and the second one,
3339000	3342000	had a completely different play vibe.
3342000	3345000	It did, and I gotta be honest, my favorite music was the first Mega Man game.
3345000	3349000	Like, Elec Man's stage, and Guts Man, I mean, those are iconic to me.
3349000	3351000	I was actually a really big fan of Fire Man's music.
3351000	3353000	Not that two was bad, because you had things like Bubble Man,
3353000	3355000	but one was great.
3355000	3358000	I totally love those new characters that, instead of having Construction Homeless,
3358000	3360000	they have construction cones on their head.
3360000	3366000	And then, also, the robotic dog that looks nothing like Rush, but is Rush.
3367000	3370000	So, it does look like we're totally gonna see this...
3370000	3372000	It's not a bad thing, but, dude, it's Mega Man.
3372000	3374000	No, and I'm excited about this.
3374000	3376000	And I like the art style they're going with it,
3376000	3378000	because what I like about it is that,
3378000	3381000	you remember how Mega Man 9 and 10, like, purposefully went retro?
3381000	3383000	And, like, that was cool, don't get me wrong,
3383000	3387000	but I kind of like that this is 2D in the new generation.
3387000	3389000	Does that make sense?
3389000	3392000	Like, you know, kind of what a lot of us just want to see in a frickin' game.
3392000	3395000	So, I'm glad that he's getting to do the game the way he wants to do it,
3395000	3397000	and there it is.
3397000	3398000	I think Rama puts it best.
3398000	3402000	Mighty No. 9 is a Mega Man in another parallel universe.
3402000	3405000	S.S.G.A. 100 Matt in our chatroom brings up a good point.
3405000	3410000	Manami Matsumae also did some of the soundtrack for Shovel Knight,
3410000	3413000	which isn't Mega Man per se, but it was very, you know,
3413000	3415000	and that Kickstarter did crazy good, too.
3415000	3416000	I think I backed that one.
3416000	3417000	I did back that one.
3417000	3419000	Did I? No, I think I just missed it, unfortunately.
3419000	3420000	I backed it.
3420000	3426000	Yeah. I'll probably get it later, when the game comes out, but, yeah.
3426000	3428000	Anyhow, I could talk about this further,
3428000	3432000	but this game's happening, folks, and it'll at least be on Steam,
3432000	3435000	but I'm hard-pressed to imagine it's not going to make it to PlayStation 3.
3435000	3438000	Are we going to get a sidekick that's going to have a sword, too,
3438000	3439000	and his name will be Minus?
3439000	3441000	No, that'll be in Mighty No. 10.
3441000	3442000	Mighty No. 10.
3442000	3443000	Or whatever.
3443000	3445000	How will they call the sequels to this?
3445000	3451000	Because this isn't true, not Mega Man, unless you have Mighty No. 9, Part 2,
3451000	3453000	Mighty No. 9, Part 3.
3453000	3455000	Maybe they'll do letters instead.
3455000	3456000	That'll be how it differs.
3456000	3457000	MM9?
3457000	3461000	Yeah, no, Mighty No. 9B, Mighty No. 9C.
3461000	3464000	I don't know. Whatever.
3464000	3466000	All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3466000	3469000	I have some stuff and things, but mostly about VR stuff.
3469000	3476000	I mentioned Oculus Rift earlier because of experiences with Bobby's crazy headset.
3476000	3479000	Well, it looks like Sony's got a similar plan going on.
3479000	3485000	They have a VR set for the PS4 that should be announced at the Tokyo Game Show,
3485000	3491000	and they already reported to Eurogamer that the device would be coming out sometime in 2014.
3492000	3500000	So it's like they're trying to get past the move aspect and really lean toward the Rift.
3500000	3502000	That's what it seems like to me.
3502000	3507000	I wonder if the PS4 is going to have games that are compatible with either or both,
3507000	3511000	or if they're going to insist on using just their headset.
3511000	3516000	Well, even a rumor is still going around that Microsoft's going to go the same route.
3517000	3525000	Remember their whole leaked game plan or whatever you want to call it with Kinect and stuff
3525000	3528000	and this crazy VR shit with that?
3528000	3533000	Even with the Xbox One and the tagline for it and everything, it was all accurate.
3533000	3539000	So next year we're supposed to see some of this weird shit unless it gets pushed a little bit.
3539000	3544000	I'd say next year to early 2015 we'll be hearing something about this,
3544000	3546000	but I think it's the way it's going to go.
3546000	3551000	I'm telling you, if a Sony executive or a Microsoft executive played the Oculus Rift,
3551000	3554000	that's why they're trying to get a slice of it.
3554000	3560000	And it seems like it's really just gaining a lot more speed for people developing for that kind of technology.
3560000	3563000	I mean, look who they're supporting it.
3563000	3565000	Nintendo, this is your chance.
3565000	3569000	Nintendo on, remember? Remember that whole concept video?
3569000	3576000	There is no shame in going back and saying, hey, we saw that April Fool's joke or whatever you want,
3576000	3580000	pre-E3 joke, and we're going to make it happen anyways.
3580000	3584000	You know what? We could be seeing the return of the Virtual Boy.
3584000	3590000	But it's so different. The Virtual Boy was silly and the 3D didn't work very well and it was all one color.
3590000	3592000	The Oculus Rift is awesome.
3592000	3594000	But now the technology is there to make it work.
3594000	3603000	I mean, imagine if you had something like, say, for your DS that would play the upper screen stuff through a virtual environment,
3603000	3608000	or even hook up your Wii to do a virtual Wii.
3608000	3614000	Here's the thing about this, although I'm excited for it, I would like to see something like this happen,
3614000	3616000	especially if they can make it economical.
3616000	3618000	I don't want all of gaming to go down this route.
3618000	3622000	I just don't want to see the entire industry cop on this.
3622000	3626000	It's all about the VR headsets. That's just like motion gaming.
3626000	3627000	Just like 3D?
3627000	3631000	Yeah, it's kind of like I don't want everybody to go there.
3631000	3636000	And part of that has to do with the fact, again, I don't think you can play it for as long periods of time.
3636000	3639000	You have some serious accessibility issues with a VR headset.
3639000	3644000	I mean, you know, Jamie, can you imagine if all your games were on a VR headset?
3644000	3645000	You'd probably be pissed because it's like...
3645000	3650000	Well, I wouldn't buy them if they were all on a VR headset. That's the final thing.
3650000	3657000	I would have to have something that I can play that, number one, would make me want to barf all over the house,
3657000	3659000	and I could use a mouse.
3659000	3665000	And we'll always have indies. I mean, if nothing else, there'll always be people that don't want to develop for this kind of stuff.
3665000	3672000	But I'm just saying, I like this as an enhancement, not as a, this is the rest of the industry forever.
3672000	3678000	But, you know, I really do want to say that Nintendo really did give us the big idea.
3678000	3682000	I would have to say was one of the first inspirations for this type of thing.
3682000	3688000	I mean, yeah, we had those little virtual environment things before, like at Q's are, you know, where you could get in.
3688000	3689000	It gave me a rotten headache.
3689000	3695000	But the Virtual Boy was the first attempt, I think, of bringing a gaming experience in a virtual environment home.
3695000	3701000	Isn't it funny that Gunpei Okoye got so much shit over that system, but yet maybe he was just really ahead of his time?
3701000	3704000	I think that's the problem with any wise invention.
3704000	3716000	You know, how many great technologies come out that are basically shot down because of either the technology is not caught up to it, the concept is too advanced, or people are not used to...
3716000	3720000	Well, in the Virtual Boy's case, it was that the technology wasn't truly there.
3720000	3722000	Or the red was the problem.
3722000	3733000	Yeah, but the concept of that type of thing, I mean, we've seen different types of techs come out that are basically poo-pooed because they're not commercially viable.
3733000	3743000	You know, we could be running, just look at our energy issues right now, we could be running on very clean energy right now if it wasn't that petroleum was so, you know, marketable.
3743000	3750000	I mean, hell, Betamax was far superior to VHS, yet look what went out.
3750000	3755000	Oh, because porn went VHS for one. Wasn't VHS the cheaper option too?
3755000	3758000	It was a little cheaper, but the better quality was the Betamax.
3758000	3771000	I mean, people are avoiding the better items because of market scare, but I mean, the technology wasn't there for the Virtual Boy, but it was a very advanced concept for its time.
3771000	3777000	And I think if it had waited another two years, it could have been something really great.
3777000	3779000	Or until the point that they could get full color on it.
3779000	3781000	Or until they could have done Mode 7. Boy.
3781000	3786000	Alright, anyhow. Up next, Loki.
3786000	3794000	Alright, so there may be a slight delay in getting the Gaikai service for PlayStation 4 to roll out in Europe.
3794000	3800000	Apparently the problem is to issues with broadband internet availability in Europe.
3800000	3807000	And basically they're just saying they don't have a timeline for it right now because those services aren't available.
3807000	3814000	So the plan is to begin with North America next year, and the plan is to provide a streaming service that will allow PlayStation 3 content initially to be streamed.
3814000	3819000	Firstly, PlayStation 4, then the Vita, then PlayStation 3.
3819000	3824000	And so that will happen in 2004 in North America, initially.
3824000	3831000	And now, I guess they touched upon issues in broadband in Europe and during the presentation.
3831000	3838000	And they said that Europe is of course part of the roadmap, but the service will be deployed at some point in the future.
3838000	3843000	And for reasons outside of their control, it's been delayed.
3843000	3850000	And it kind of makes me wonder, at the same time, remember all those features they were trying to push originally with the Xbox One stuff?
3850000	3853000	And having to be always connected and having broadband internet?
3853000	3859000	Man, that would have been a real big clusterfuck in Europe because they're having issues with some decent broadband.
3859000	3866000	And the area, I mean, what would have made people think, you know, this other cloud stuff's gonna work?
3866000	3868000	I don't know.
3868000	3873000	Well, or as you brought up when all the fuckery with Final Fantasy XIV was happening a couple weeks ago, you know.
3873000	3874000	Oh God, yeah.
3874000	3875000	Who's-
3875000	3876000	Is that fixed now?
3876000	3877000	Yeah, it's a lot better now.
3877000	3883000	I mean, obviously there's still issues like what Dark Soccer was talking about earlier that she's having and all these other like weird isolated things.
3883000	3889000	But it's not on the large scale like we were having it, but there's still like pain points, if that makes sense.
3889000	3890000	Yeah.
3890000	3896000	But there is a good percentage of people who are playing like it is a normal video game at this point.
3896000	3902000	I'm still gonna document what my experience was with their customer service is like tomorrow.
3902000	3906000	Yeah, good luck getting through. I've heard some nightmare stories about customer service.
3906000	3912000	But it seems that that's the only way people are getting anything to happen because they have so many tickets open and people keep reopening their ticket.
3912000	3914000	Ugh, yuck.
3914000	3921000	Well, anyhow, let's move on. Something that is supposed to help you with your Xbox One experience is Smart Glass, that's right.
3921000	3930000	Smart Glass, which I kind of was thinking Microsoft might have abandoned at one point because it came out for the 360 and then, well, that's it.
3930000	3938000	But Smart Glass is happening on Xbox One and there was some more information this week in an interview with Xbox Wire from Microsoft General Manager Ron Pessner,
3939000	3946000	who talked about that the app will be more responsive for one. This app will connect to the Xbox One within four seconds.
3946000	3954000	That's much faster than the 360 connects today. Up to 16 Smart Glass devices are supposed to connect with a single Xbox One console.
3954000	3955000	Why?
3955000	3958000	Eight controllers and two phones a person. Sounds plausible.
3958000	3965000	Well, no. The Smart Glass devices would be like tablets. So why would you need 16 fucking tablets or phones?
3965000	3974000	Well, I will put it, I will give it this. If it's supposed to be interactive with movies and second screen with that, then people don't have to share one.
3974000	3976000	Like, each person could have one.
3976000	3981000	Or maybe it's like, you know, that somebody can be registered with a console and maybe you're talking family members too.
3981000	3983000	Maybe. No, no.
3983000	3990000	But Smart Glass is on phones. I think that having the 16 devices around, if you have the people, is not that hard to get.
3991000	3999000	Anyhow, there could be the use for game controllers with this, but I don't think that's where they're actually going.
3999000	4005000	It's just, I mean, you can kind of use game control. I mean, not game control, but you can console control with Smart Glass today.
4005000	4007000	But it's a little eh.
4007000	4014000	That would be fantastic. Hey, cool. I can use on screen digital, you know, game pads.
4014000	4016000	You know, I still have that Smart Glass app on my phone.
4016000	4019000	Oh, yeah. Well, I have it too, but I just don't use it.
4019000	4028000	When away from the console, Smart Glass will still allow you to communicate with friends, check achievements, watch game DVR videos, and, of course, go shopping in the store.
4028000	4033000	One thing, though, that Smart Glass on Xbox One will have is game help.
4033000	4041000	When publishing a game, you must submit a help manual that will aid players either in-game or through Smart Glass.
4041000	4046000	And you can actually say Xbox Help, and then the help thing will appear in the console.
4046000	4053000	But you can also do it in Smart Glass, where you click on the help icon, and it will show you exactly whatever it is that you want to see there.
4053000	4063000	It should be noted, though, when you do say Xbox Help, you'll see a poof of smoke, and then, out from a shadows, Clippy will arrive.
4063000	4066000	It looks like you're trying to...
4066000	4067000	You summon me?
4067000	4070000	It looks like you're trying to access Killer Instinct.
4070000	4075000	Choose one of these three options. Oh, God. I can only imagine what that's going to look like.
4075000	4084000	But, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious, like, okay, well, how is this second screen experience going to really be enhanced?
4084000	4089000	Because Smart Glass, as it is right now, is kind of, eh? So, I don't know.
4089000	4094000	Anyhow, that's it. Smart Glass on Xbox One.
4094000	4099000	Hopefully, it will be something that doesn't fade away in a few months.
4099000	4101000	Dark Sakura?
4101000	4107000	Well, there is actually some stuff going on for Microsoft in Europe right now.
4107000	4118000	So, what's going on is that they have this Xbox Live Rewards thing that's going to be going on, where basically you get rewards for playing new games.
4118000	4128000	As it works is that if you play a new game for more than ten hours, a disc-based release on top of that, you get a thousand credits every time you play a game.
4128000	4136000	Well, in the UK, that would be 67 pence. That's like a soda, I think.
4136000	4140000	It's basically, in North America, I think it's a thousand credits equals a dollar.
4140000	4148000	Yeah. So, at any rate, of course, you know, the more games you play, the more rewards you get, the more points you get.
4148000	4161000	And, like, if you get up between $3,000 to $9,999, you get Contender, and the lowest is where you just get 50 credits back on every little bit that you spend.
4161000	4164000	That would be the equivalent of 800 Microsoft points.
4164000	4171000	So, it's supposed to be deposited every 15th and 30th of each month once you hit 5,000 credits.
4172000	4184000	So, I don't know how this is going to work. Like, right now, I know that when I switched all of my stuff over from my points to money, it gave me a dollar. I bought a song.
4184000	4194000	Here's how you earn credits in this. Basically, you can complete an apps punch card, which I think you have to buy so many apps or something, or use the apps for so long.
4194000	4197000	Was that like how when I buy ten pink berries, I get a free one?
4197000	4198000	Something like that.
4198000	4199000	That's weird.
4199000	4205000	They have a complete My Map Pack punch card, so if you buy, like, so many map packs, you get 5,000 credits.
4205000	4210000	Make your first Xbox store purchase 1,250 credits.
4210000	4214000	Complete My Movies and TV punch card, 3,000 credits.
4214000	4217000	Take a survey, 250 credits.
4217000	4225000	And then, also, see, play a new game for ten hours is 1,000 credits. Refer a friend, 1,000 credits.
4225000	4228000	This sounds like how to get a badge in Steam. One of those badges.
4228000	4235000	Renew my membership. What I want to know is how many fucking credits do I get on my birthday because it used to be 25 cents.
4235000	4242000	So, is that any better now? Do I get 25 cents still? Or is it like, you know, 50 cents?
4242000	4245000	Ooh. Well, inflation and interest and all that.
4245000	4252000	I think it's a little bribery. Plus, I think the playing ten hours thing is a little excessive.
4253000	4258000	I mean, it can't be ten hours at a time. It has to be something that you're going to play for a couple of days and then you get your thing.
4258000	4260000	I think it's during the month. I think it's within a month of it releasing.
4260000	4264000	If I was getting Kingdom Hearts HD on 360, that might be happening.
4264000	4270000	Yeah, but I haven't sat down to play a game like that. Well, I have on my PC. I take that back. So...
4270000	4272000	Well, I don't think it's at a time. It's just...
4272000	4278000	Well, I know it's not at a time, but there's sometimes... You know, people have busy lives. Some people only play on the weekends for a few hours at a time.
4278000	4282000	Really? You couldn't squeak out ten hours of Mass Effect in the month that it came out?
4282000	4285000	While I'm unemployed, yes.
4287000	4294000	Actually, and I easily sunk a hundred hours into Mass Effect across three months, I should be ashamed to say.
4294000	4297000	So I would have hit this ten hours easy when Mass Effect first came out.
4297000	4299000	Well, I did do that in one day.
4299000	4306000	I don't want to think ten hours isn't that ridiculous. There is a cap, though, I know what you can get a month...
4306000	4312000	As long as it wasn't ten hours over and over and over and over again, but yeah, ten hours is not too hard to meet.
4312000	4315000	I know people that watch that much TV.
4315000	4321000	I think the other thing, though, with having that ten hour limitation is that they basically also discourage any return time.
4321000	4329000	Because I know that, like, and I only know Game Stops because Dan managed one, their return policy was like a full refund in seven days.
4329000	4336000	And not, I don't know how many people are going to get ten hours of gameplay in, like, say it's like the average student, okay?
4336000	4342000	You got school all day, you have homework, you come home, and then are you really going to have a lot of time to play?
4342000	4344000	Most of the play is going to be done on the weekends.
4344000	4347000	So that's going to cut out some of that return time right there.
4347000	4353000	That's where I see the ten hours coming in, but at the same time, I think it's a little underhanded.
4353000	4355000	Well, it's only really twenty minutes a day.
4355000	4357000	I guess that's true.
4357000	4361000	I mean, it's twenty minutes you could be exercising or you could play some Mass Effect.
4361000	4362000	Exercise your fingers.
4362000	4369000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games you can sink ten hours into this month as we look at some release dates.
4371000	4378000	Let's see, so this week we've got NHL 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4379000	4383000	On PC, the Elder Scrolls Anthology.
4383000	4389000	If you just learned about this Elder Scrolls series, you know, you can pick up all of those games on PC.
4389000	4391000	All the cool kids are playing this Elder Scrolls.
4391000	4395000	Exactly, Elder Scrolls, that sounds like games for old people.
4397000	4403000	Kingdom Hearts HD, or 1.5 HD Remix on PlayStation 3 this week.
4403000	4406000	Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.
4407000	4410000	The Sims 3 has an expansion pack coming out.
4410000	4415000	Sims 3 movie stuff, so that's coming out this week as well.
4415000	4423000	And on Vita, hopefully, hopefully and actually a good first person shooter now on the Vita.
4423000	4426000	Killzone Mercenary coming out this week as well.
4429000	4431000	I believe that's it, I think.
4431000	4435000	Let me quickly glance over this real quick.
4435000	4437000	Didn't forget anything.
4437000	4439000	Nope, that would be it.
4439000	4442000	Alright, let's travel to Japan then and check out the releases over there.
4442000	4443000	Oh, I did, I did.
4443000	4444000	God damn it, Loki.
4444000	4446000	One week from today, I forgot. One week from today, Wonderful 101.
4446000	4449000	A Sunday release as Nintendo releases tend to be.
4449000	4454000	Alright, let's go to Japan and check out PlayStation 3 releases.
4454000	4463000	Air Conflicts Vietnam on September 12th, along with AKB1 149 Renee So Senkyou comes out in regular and limited edition.
4464000	4465000	What?
4465000	4469000	No, I think that's something that I was looking at the other day.
4469000	4473000	Was it? Here's what it looks like. Isn't this like a girly band?
4473000	4475000	Never mind, that's, yeah.
4475000	4480000	This is like girly band karaoke, pretty swimsuit photos, I don't know.
4480000	4484000	Yeah, that's not what I think it is. I was thinking of something else.
4484000	4488000	What is this labeled adventure? Is this like the Spice World game or something? Who knows?
4488000	4489000	I don't know.
4489000	4492000	Wait a minute, that was the limited edition. Let me look at the regular one.
4492000	4496000	The regular one, are there screenshots? Nope, just the box art.
4496000	4501000	Pretty Japanese girls, some playing the guitar, some are getting married, whatever.
4501000	4503000	I was wondering if that was like an AKB48 thing.
4503000	4504000	No.
4504000	4510000	Max Payne 3, it goes into the classics, so that means a price reduction this week in Japan on September 12th.
4510000	4518000	Going over to the Xbox 360, just Air Conflicts Vietnam is the only release that is also on the 360 this week.
4518000	4523000	Going to the PlayStation Vita, nothing until the 19th, this week looks pretty empty.
4523000	4529000	But if we look at the Wii U and the 3DS, the Wii U doesn't really get anything until September 26th.
4529000	4535000	That's when Epic Mickey 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the 26th, but that'll be a ways out.
4535000	4548000	Looking at the 3DS, however, on the 14th there's quite a few games because old Monster Hunter 4 is being released on the 3DS, which is kind of a big deal.
4548000	4556000	There's a shit ton of peripherals that go with that for Monster Hunter 4, such as like you want a new stand for it or a sticker or pouches or what have you.
4556000	4557000	That is huge.
4557000	4561000	There's also a special 3DS-LL coming out for Monster Hunter 4.
4561000	4564000	There's a black version and a white version.
4564000	4566000	There's special packs that come with the game.
4566000	4568000	That is on the 14th.
4568000	4578000	So, I imagine that's Japan's big release and the one that actually some people over here would probably be importing because I know some people are really into their Monster Hunter.
4578000	4582000	Sony PSP, not to be left out in the cold.
4582000	4584000	Yes, PSP, not V.
4584000	4590000	Brothers Conflict Brilliant Blue in regular and limited edition this week on the PSP.
4590000	4593000	There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.
4593000	4596000	Well, we have a few things coming out in the UK.
4596000	4603000	On the 10th we have Amnesia, A Machine for Pigs on PC and Metro Last Night on Mac.
4603000	4609000	For the 11th we have DuckTales Remastered coming out on Xbox 360 and Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.
4609000	4613000	On the 12th we have Arma 3 and NHL 14.
4613000	4624000	And on the 13th we have I Am Alive on PC, King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix and Rayman Legends on the Vita.
4626000	4627000	That's it.
4627000	4631000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4631000	4637000	Yes, so Steam is adding some more stuff to their trading system.
4637000	4641000	Now they have this Steam Trade Offers program.
4641000	4650000	And I guess what it allows you to do is it allows, I guess, friends to suggest trade deals for inventory items.
4650000	4653000	Which you can accept, counter, or decline.
4653000	4659000	And I guess it's a way to negotiate cards maybe?
4659000	4663000	I don't know. It would be nice if I could trade my games that I have that I don't use.
4664000	4668000	But yeah, so that's what they have right now.
4668000	4673000	I guess you can check out other people's inventories and so if they have a card that you want or something you can be like,
4673000	4677000	Hey, can I have that card? I'll trade you my other card.
4681000	4685000	More stuff on Steam to waste your time and money.
4685000	4689000	I was very disappointed. I didn't get a single booster pack while I was at Dragon Con.
4689000	4693000	But I bet the card trading has died down because the summer sale is over.
4693000	4697000	So how do you get booster packs in games? I play a lot of...
4697000	4701000	Once you've got the most...
4701000	4706000	Let's say a game has six cards available. Three of them will drop as you play the game.
4706000	4709000	For like every twenty minutes you play the game you get a card.
4709000	4712000	But up to half the most that's in the set.
4712000	4717000	After you've got all those drops you're eligible for a booster pack.
4717000	4722000	So when someone else crafts a badge, somebody in the community at random will get a booster pack.
4722000	4727000	That's how it keeps going. So the more people craft the more booster packs that go out.
4727000	4733000	Okay, I guess I got all mine in Saints Row IV because I have four cards.
4733000	4737000	Does it say that you have any left to earn?
4737000	4741000	I can't see how in Saints Row IV. You've probably played that to death.
4741000	4745000	Yeah, I don't have any more to earn. I have duplicates even.
4745000	4749000	Okay, yeah, so you'll be eligible for booster packs for Saints Row IV.
4749000	4754000	But to be honest, some people trade them, but I just got to the point where I got lazy.
4754000	4759000	I sold all my duplicates in the marketplace and then bought what I wanted to make badges.
4759000	4762000	It worked! So there you go.
4762000	4767000	ActDef saying, I got a Team Fortress 2 booster pack yesterday, so some people are getting them.
4767000	4773000	Alright, I got some music game news for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.
4773000	4777000	And the first game I want to talk about is a game called Cross Beats.
4777000	4783000	It's Cross X Beats, which makes me think this game is called Cross Cross Beats, which actually would make sense.
4783000	4787000	Because guess who's making Cross Cross Beats? Guess who the producer is?
4787000	4792000	It's Naoki Madaya is actually producing this game for Capcom.
4792000	4797000	He no longer works at Konami.
4797000	4800000	He left Konami a year ago if you weren't aware.
4800000	4804000	Well, no, they're still making DDR. It's different producers.
4804000	4810000	But anyway, if you don't know who Naoki is, we used to talk a lot about DDR back in the day,
4810000	4815000	and Naoki used to be the producer of DDR. He did a lot of songs that were very famous that were in the game.
4815000	4818000	He had all these different pseudonyms that he created songs under.
4818000	4821000	He was a big driving force behind the music in the game.
4821000	4826000	So it goes without saying that a lot of these fans of Bamani projects in the past,
4826000	4829000	Naoki was still at Konami for a very long time.
4829000	4837000	He did the Dance Dance Party or whatever that game was that wasn't so bad on the 360 arcade.
4837000	4840000	That was all Naoki.
4840000	4845000	So he's left Konami now, and with Capcom he's going to do Cross Cross Beats.
4845000	4848000	It's an IOS game. It's a rhythm game on IOS.
4848000	4851000	Not a lot known about the game. We don't know when it's coming out.
4851000	4855000	Rumor is it could show up at Tokyo Game Show. That would certainly make sense.
4855000	4858000	It looks like the game is played with tapping, swiping, flicking.
4858000	4866000	Probably, considering it's on a touch screen, it'll probably get some easy similarities to Elite Beat Agents and Technica and that style of play.
4866000	4871000	But I'm sure there will be unique things that differentiate it, such as the music.
4871000	4878000	If you've been playing Bamani games for a while, you might recognize Tatch is also doing some of the songs.
4878000	4884000	Void, Simon, Who's Some Thinker, DJ Simon, and all those guys appeared in media 2DX and the like.
4884000	4885000	That's happy news.
4885000	4886000	Over the years.
4886000	4892000	Also speaking of music games, Theatrhythm apparently set to get a sequel.
4892000	4898000	Theatrhythm, the Final Fantasy music game on 3DS, I guess did well enough to necessitate a sequel called Final Fantasy Curtain Call.
4898000	4900000	No idea what this could be.
4900000	4908000	But my thought is, could it maybe be that this is the fully packaged game with all the DLC?
4909000	4915000	So I wouldn't necessarily think it's a full sequel, but certainly Square has enough music in their archive.
4915000	4920000	Especially if you were to throw Chrono Trigger and other Square games into the mix.
4920000	4923000	The Secret of Mana and Evermore and all those games.
4923000	4927000	I'm sure there would be enough music to fill up a second game.
4927000	4937000	But I'm wondering if Curtain Call wouldn't just be an end of the year edition that packages everything and maybe a couple bonus tracks to try and sell this game all over again.
4937000	4938000	We'll see.
4938000	4941000	But there you go for music game news.
4941000	4944000	I liked Theatrhythm when I played it.
4944000	4945000	I did too.
4945000	4951000	My only problem with Theatrhythm was that, I don't know, it was a bit expensive for me.
4951000	4955000	But at least the iOS version, you could do a little more piecemeal.
4955000	4963000	Anyhow, if Curtain Call really is even more songs, that'll help justify the price tag.
4963000	4965000	Square likes money.
4965000	4966000	Who doesn't like money?
4966000	4969000	Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week.
4969000	4973000	Back when games were very expensive, no matter what it was you were buying.
4973000	4976000	Because they were all in cartridges.
4976000	4981000	Dark Sakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that she thinks that you kids should be playing this week.
4981000	4984000	Dark Sakura, what is the expensive cartridge classic game of the week?
4984000	4988000	It's Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord for the Sega Master System.
4988000	4991000	And also, I'm sorry that I could not find a longer music sample.
4991000	4994000	All of the Let's Plays have freaking people talking over it.
4994000	4995000	It's fucking annoying.
4995000	4998000	I don't listen to the stupid thing to hear your voice.
4998000	5001000	I hear it. I watch it to watch the game.
5001000	5006000	Anyway, in Japan it was known as Hajanofuin, which is Seal of the Dark Lord.
5006000	5010000	And it came out on the PC-88 and then was ported to other systems.
5010000	5013000	Like I said, we got it on the Master System over here.
5013000	5015000	It's very similar to Phantasy Star.
5015000	5022000	It has this grid type map to show you where parts of interest are in the game.
5023000	5027000	And it also has this sort of traveling feature it looks like.
5027000	5031000	So basically in this game, you play the hero and you have different screens.
5031000	5035000	Well, different parts of your screen that indicate what you do in the game.
5035000	5044000	So you have to collect all these mystical weapons in the armor and defeat the bad guy named Tararim and Seal of the Dark Lord around.
5044000	5049000	So each of the areas on the screen, there's four parts.
5049000	5055000	You have your stats on the lower left and that also lists all your party stats.
5055000	5061000	And then on the right you have your money, your weapon, that type of thing.
5061000	5068000	You also have a kind of maze map on top that's more grid shaped that shows you where you are laid out.
5068000	5072000	And then you have sort of a walking section, the upper left one.
5072000	5076000	It'll either show you the world you're walking in or the cave that you're walking in and your surroundings.
5076000	5078000	In battle it shows you your foes.
5079000	5082000	So it is built on a grid format.
5082000	5085000	You can move around and visit other places.
5085000	5089000	It shows you where you need to be based on white squares that are there.
5089000	5093000	And it's a pretty classic RPG.
5093000	5098000	I mean this is one of the, I'd have to say one of the top ones for the Master System.
5098000	5105000	You also have different types of things that happen to you in the game.
5105000	5110000	There's flame spells that you can be attacked with, sleep spells, you know the usual ones.
5110000	5116000	And every time you're put to sleep you take damage which I think is a little bit different than a lot of RPGs.
5121000	5125000	It's all kinds of different strategies that you have to use to make it through the game.
5125000	5128000	And the world itself has three continents.
5128000	5130000	There's different types of land.
5130000	5132000	You have the plain, forest, mountains, and desert.
5132000	5138000	And each place of course has its own type of enemies that are indigenous to such land.
5138000	5144000	So you've got your towns too, you have smiths who can repair your weapons and healers and different shops.
5144000	5149000	And I mean it's typical RPG fare but it is one of the early ones.
5149000	5153000	So the game is Miracle Warriors Seal of the Dark Lord.
5153000	5156000	If you don't have it, why not?
5156000	5158000	Probably because not many people have a Master System anymore.
5158000	5160000	Yeah not anymore.
5160000	5164000	Find yourself a power-based converter, hook it into your Genesis, you're good to go.
5164000	5169000	There it is, your classic game of the week for the Sega Master System, Miracle Warriors.
5169000	5172000	Nice obscure pick, Dark Sakura.
5172000	5177000	That's kind of one I had to look into it a little more and I did watch some of those let's plays with the people talking and I was like, oh okay.
5177000	5178000	Dungeon Buster is actually funny.
5178000	5182000	Terror in the Dark Lord who is a half-naked demoness at the end of the game.
5182000	5184000	Did you have this game on Sega Master System?
5184000	5186000	I think I had two copies of this game.
5186000	5188000	Oh my gosh, is this something you came across later?
5188000	5194000	Keep in mind, Dan already had some of his games and he came into a box of Master System games for dirt cheap.
5194000	5201000	That's why we have, we will be doing, actually I was going to say we are going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.
5201000	5211000	So I'm going to give VOG listeners first chance whenever we put up an auction, I'm giving VOG listeners first go at it.
5211000	5213000	We will post it.
5213000	5214000	How are you going to do that? Twitter, Tumblr?
5214000	5215000	Forums.
5215000	5222000	So we just had a Ninja Gaiden, we actually still have Ninja Gaiden Trilogy up on eBay right now if you've got 300 bucks.
5222000	5225000	In the box manual mint condition.
5225000	5226000	Super rare game.
5226000	5227000	Super rare game.
5227000	5228000	But great game.
5228000	5229000	Yes.
5229000	5234000	If I knew it was going to go for that I would have stolen the copy that I rented from my local store when I was younger.
5234000	5238000	Well we also have Final Fight Guy which is probably going up soon.
5238000	5239000	Nice.
5239000	5242000	Alright we're going to take a quick break but we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5242000	5244000	The Frugal Question of the Week.
5244000	5247000	Some news on a new MOBA that's based off a familiar franchise.
5247000	5251000	A fan made movie which I'm sure will get shut down in a matter of time.
5251000	5258000	Rapid Fire News and your calls and tweets and so forth when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5258000	5273000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening September 8th 2013 with the 518th episode of our program.
5273000	5283000	Before we get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News I did want to mention and thank here on the program our good buddy Jason or VX JasonXV if you will.
5283000	5287000	I don't know if you guys noticed but there was a new voice in the intro tonight and you'll hear him in the outro as well.
5287000	5300000	Decided to be our voiceover guy because he was doing some of the VOG bumpers anyway so it made sense and I don't know if you know but before it was me kind of processed through Audition with an echo and slowed down.
5300000	5303000	What? It wasn't a real robot voiceover person.
5303000	5316000	Magic. It's magic so I always you know it was always a little bit silly so I'm trying something a little new so hopefully you guys like Jason's intro because I will say that takes commitment to do that because he basically has to kind of guess what we're going to talk about.
5316000	5322000	Guess what we're going to talk about and have it recorded by Saturday or Sunday and change it if I don't like it.
5322000	5333000	No but he's pretty good about being able to know what we're going to talk about on the show so big thanks to Jason and I should also thank because we really don't thank him enough and we've used this song for what freaking like eight years.
5333000	5340000	Midi Head did the intro the actual music that you hear in the background and the other announcer here at the top of the show.
5340000	5348000	Midi Head you know we had him on the show way back in the day because he was well known he did some of the songs that were in the DDR Xbox games.
5348000	5355000	So we'd had him back on the show back when we were all about DDR and I think he ended up having a song in 2DX as well if I remember correctly.
5355000	5360000	One of his remixes the In My Eyes remix or one of them was Jelly Kiss was in 2DX I think.
5360000	5373000	So big thanks to Midi Head and I don't plug him enough and he's still going to midihead.com I believe he does a lot of sounds and incidental stuff for actually for use for podcasting and so forth.
5373000	5378000	So if you like our intro maybe Midi Head can do something for you for a small fee.
5378000	5386000	Alright let's get back into some gaming news with rapid fire news and a lot of stuff tonight. Loki.
5386000	5399000	Yes so let's see as I was talking about with Rob and Jimmy earlier there was a Mass Effect texture pack for the Minecraft Xbox 360 version.
5399000	5408000	Now not only does it kind of reskin everything it also includes a level based off of the Mars facility.
5408000	5417000	So that's kind of cool and then you also get character skins along with that so you can play as your characters and create your own worlds and do all that fun stuff.
5417000	5423000	So check it out it's only $2 or I'm sorry $4 is what that's available for.
5423000	5426000	Totally forgot to check that out and I need to.
5427000	5438000	And then of course there's this cool device and actually kind of inspired I want to make something very similar I was actually researching how much it would cost to do something like this.
5438000	5449000	But it's called the cross plane kind of think of the Wii U's gamepad but you can use it with pretty much any game console.
5449000	5460000	So what it's going to have is basically the second screen it's got a small LCD screen that's HD and a wireless HDMI adapter built inside of it.
5460000	5472000	And then also these you know basically the same layout as the Wii U gamepad and it's got these cartridges that plug in the top that map the signal for whatever you're playing.
5472000	5480000	You know if you have an Xbox 360 version you know you have that you can play with the Xbox 360 or using your PC I guess with that.
5480000	5488000	And then they have a PlayStation 3 one which you could sync up with the PlayStation 3 or with an Ouya so they've got those.
5488000	5501000	And they're seeking $350,000 to begin production if you want to back one of these it would cost you $300 or $350 to actually get one of the cross play devices which should be available.
5501000	5507000	I think sometime next year which for me is way too damn long for me to wait to make you know buy something like that.
5507000	5515000	So I kind of want to make one my own but it's hard to finding a cheap and good wireless HDMI extender.
5515000	5527000	They do exist but it's hard to find them and I was trying to peek in their video to see what what they were using because I can see it but they move the camera too fast so I couldn't read what it was.
5528000	5531000	It looks cool though so that's on Kickstarter.
5531000	5543000	And then if you happen to like free games there's a free remake of Ultima 4 the Commodore 64 version that's on iOS.
5543000	5548000	And you can actually it has a little keyboard on it and everything and you can play the full game.
5548000	5552000	It's near 100% replica of the game.
5552000	5559000	And I guess it's free to download Ultima 4 C64.
5559000	5561000	So go check it out.
5561000	5563000	Downloading As We Speak.
5563000	5571000	Which is great because the Ultima game that they put out on iOS EA actually did one like a free to play game.
5571000	5573000	I didn't like it at all.
5573000	5576000	I couldn't get very far through it at all I just really didn't like it.
5577000	5578000	Looks neat.
5578000	5582000	Yeah I've seen a C64 emulators on iPhone already.
5582000	5584000	I don't know if it still exists.
5584000	5589000	I think so because I think it uses a lot of free to play games and things that they have the rights to.
5589000	5593000	But you know who am I to say no to a Commodore 64 experience in my pocket.
5593000	5594000	Yes.
5594000	5599000	Speaking of in your pocket there's a rumor going around that Infamous will be coming to the Vita.
5599000	5601000	Which you know shouldn't be a big surprise.
5601000	5603000	Infamous is huge for Sony.
5603000	5605000	We know that Second Son is going on right now.
5605000	5608000	But this is because of a recent Q&A that happened.
5608000	5614000	Where there was a Dual Shockers interview with the folks behind Infamous Second Son.
5614000	5620000	It was the director Nate Fox specifically that I guess got asked some question.
5620000	5622000	But kind of gave a misinterpreted answer.
5622000	5626000	But he said quote right now we're only talking about the PS4 game.
5626000	5631000	I would love to talk to you about any Vita related titles when or if the time comes.
5631000	5633000	That still seems a little bit non-committal to me.
5633000	5636000	But the reality is Infamous is a huge franchise for Sony.
5636000	5639000	I'm kind of thinking of course there's going to be something for the Vita.
5639000	5640000	Of course.
5640000	5642000	Even if it's not necessarily the same studio.
5642000	5644000	I mean that's what they did with Uncharted right?
5644000	5646000	I think that they'll have an Infamous game.
5646000	5649000	And I can see it coming out around the same time as Second Son too.
5649000	5652000	Just because it would be a good tie in.
5652000	5658000	You could like have like you take your PlayStation 4 character to you know that game or vice versa.
5658000	5660000	I would also think they would try to do like the remote play or something.
5660000	5662000	They would try to tie that feature in as well.
5662000	5667000	Did you hear the Final Fantasy XIV is supposed to be getting something like that on PlayStation 4.
5667000	5670000	Not to do too tangity but this sounded really awesome.
5670000	5673000	That they're talking about doing a remote play for the PlayStation 4 version.
5673000	5676000	It would be limited but it would allow you to do things like crafting and stuff.
5676000	5677000	It's pretty cool.
5677000	5679000	I don't see why you couldn't play the game.
5679000	5681000	I mean aside from being able to text chat and stuff.
5681000	5682000	I think it's just a resource.
5682000	5685000	Yeah the text chat and some of the other stuff is a resource hog so.
5686000	5688000	Just don't text chat. I never text chatted.
5689000	5692000	Well I liked having the ability to chat from my phone and wow.
5692000	5693000	True.
5693000	5694000	Doing stuff like that.
5694000	5695000	You still can yeah.
5695000	5698000	Well yeah but even though I don't have a subscription anymore.
5698000	5702000	But I mean I think that having more remote options for doing other stuff in the game.
5702000	5705000	Especially you know for things that you're trying to kill time with.
5705000	5707000	I think that's actually pretty good.
5708000	5713000	Very interesting rumors coming out of Microsoft with the whole you know their DRM features.
5713000	5716000	That originally rolled out and then they were just kidding.
5716000	5718000	You guys are really mad so we're not going to do that.
5718000	5721000	Well according to Xbox director Albert Piniello.
5721000	5725000	This ability to trade and loan digital games.
5725000	5728000	Which is going to be a part of this whole DRM restriction.
5728000	5730000	It could return at some point.
5730000	5733000	I'm not talking about the 24 hour check ins and all this.
5733000	5735000	Here's the quote in an interview from GameSpot.
5735000	5739000	Quote we were trying to implement the ability to trade and loan digital games with your friends.
5739000	5741000	Which is something that no one else was doing.
5741000	5745000	I believe in retrospect that people have calmed down and gone back and actually looked at what we said.
5745000	5749000	People are starting to understand wow they did want to actually allow me to loan and trade.
5749000	5752000	Which other digital ecosystems don't want to do.
5752000	5754000	And so yeah I think we need to do that.
5754000	5758000	I get a lot of mails saying God please bring back the family sharing.
5758000	5760000	We'd love to figure out how to bring that back.
5760000	5761000	I still think it was a good idea.
5761000	5765000	So kind of clinging to that idea that maybe something could come back.
5765000	5768000	But I'm assuming that would not include the 24 hour check ins.
5768000	5773000	Although as I was saying plenty of times before when this whole mess happened in the first place.
5773000	5779000	Why not just have a separate digital license does this stuff and the disc license does this stuff.
5779000	5780000	Done!
5780000	5782000	Because that would make sense.
5782000	5784000	So silly.
5784000	5788000	Peter Molyneux has his new game coming called Godus.
5788000	5791000	Not to be confused with the show at the Stardust in a famous movie.
5791000	5794000	But that's G-O-D-U-S. Godus is the game.
5794000	5795000	Maybe it's Godus.
5795000	5797000	Godus. Oh I like that. Godus.
5797000	5801000	Godus he was talking about the royalties because the guy who opened the box.
5801000	5804000	The curiosity box gets some royalties from the game.
5804000	5805000	But it's not going to be much.
5805000	5807000	It's between 1 and 5 percent.
5807000	5809000	They don't say exactly what it is.
5809000	5813000	But Godus will have offline play available.
5813000	5818000	And in his ever so eloquent style Peter Molyneux speaking with RPS Rock Paper Shotgun.
5818000	5822000	Mentioned that if he did come out and say that the game would always be online quote.
5822000	5826000	This red dot would appear on my forehead and I'd be sniped to death.
5827000	5833000	He does say though that playing online will allow for these other charming moments.
5833000	5837000	Such as syncing with a villagers social feed.
5837000	5839000	Isn't that what happens in Tiny Tower?
5839000	5840000	Kind of sounds like that.
5840000	5843000	He said quote my wife tweets and it comes up in the world.
5843000	5845000	It's a stupid feature. It's just a piece of text.
5845000	5850000	But you end up caring for your little people because they love you so much.
5851000	5854000	Godus will be out on Steam September 13th.
5854000	5859000	And there will be an iPad version at the end of October and Android version soon after that.
5859000	5863000	And you can smoke some of the crack that Peter Molyneux is smoking himself.
5863000	5867000	No in all reality I do kind of want to check it out because I did like black and white.
5867000	5870000	I liked Populous from back in the day.
5870000	5873000	So I feel like I should check it out.
5873000	5875000	As soon as that kind of game would be up your alley.
5875000	5876000	Yeah it is.
5876000	5879000	Especially when I liked Civ so much in the original Sim City.
5879000	5882000	I mean I do feel like I need to check it out.
5882000	5883000	Godus.
5883000	5884000	Godus.
5884000	5885000	Dark Saga.
5885000	5889000	Well we have some Assassin's Creed news.
5889000	5898000	They basically have for the Vita Assassin's Creed 3 liberation is supposed to be re-released on other systems.
5898000	5903000	They're looking like PC, PSN and Xbox Live launches.
5903000	5905000	Probably likely.
5905000	5908000	And also on the list was Assassin's Creed Pirates.
5908000	5910000	Excuse me.
5910000	5915000	And then Ubisoft was also going to have another tie in for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.
5915000	5919000	So that's for Assassin's Creed fans.
5919000	5920000	Good news.
5920000	5924000	Also EA has six to eight new IPs going on.
5924000	5929000	They are going to definitely do more sequels for The Sims.
5929000	5931000	I was watching some of the stuff on Sims 4 stuff.
5931000	5935000	As long as they fixed that memory issue I might be down for that because I liked some Sims.
5935000	5939000	Need for Speed, Battlefield, FIFA.
5939000	5942000	Titanfall was the only new name.
5942000	5946000	But they were also indicating that there's new Star Wars and Mirror's Edge 2.
5946000	5954000	They are basically working on trying to take the IPs that people like and give them new life.
5954000	5959000	Still nothing on another Mass Effect.
5960000	5964000	Well, but the team behind the original Mass Effect is doing one of those new IPs. Don't forget.
5964000	5967000	I know. That means it won't suck.
5967000	5969000	Maybe. Depends on the writing.
5969000	5982000	Anyway, and also for fans of Monster Hunter 4, in the direct that came out there are going to be outfits available in the game for Mario, Link and Luigi.
5982000	5988000	So if you like running around looking like other Nintendo characters you can do it in the new Monster Hunter.
5989000	6002000	And they actually said that it appeared in the video that they showed that the Mario and Luigi outfits were for the Mario and Luigi Dream Team outfits.
6002000	6011000	They have hammers and that the Link outfit has the Master Sword and the bow from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
6012000	6021000	Also, you can download the Mario and Luigi costumes at 7-Elevens in Japan, but 7-Elevens in America are not cool enough to do it.
6021000	6023000	The end.
6023000	6027000	Well, are we even getting Monster Hunter 4 here? I don't think so.
6027000	6028000	Not yet.
6028000	6030000	Not yet? Be a little while?
6030000	6031000	Probably next year.
6031000	6033000	How did the Wii U Monster Hunter sell? Didn't it do alright?
6033000	6035000	Not good, I don't think.
6035000	6037000	That's too bad.
6037000	6041000	I don't think any Wii U titles sold well already, I mean.
6041000	6045000	But, yeah, probably not good.
6045000	6051000	Alright, we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week. I just want to address real quickly though, because some people in chat were asking if I'm okay.
6051000	6054000	Yeah, I'm recovering from Con Crud the sequel.
6054000	6061000	When I got back from Dragon Con I felt fine for a couple days, but probably around Thursday it really started to hit me.
6061000	6065000	Unlike the Con Crud I got at GamerX, this one didn't come with a fever.
6065000	6071000	So I haven't had high temperatures, but definitely the coughing, the snifflies, and all that crap.
6071000	6076000	So if I'm sounding a little out of it tonight, that is why, so I apologize.
6076000	6079000	That kind of stuff is really not a Radio Guy's best friend.
6079000	6082000	But what can you do? Let's go to the Fugu question of the week.
6082000	6094000	Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together, you get Fugu.
6094000	6099000	And tonight's Fugu question of the week is about the Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter. Don't call it Mega Man.
6099000	6103000	We talked about it earlier in the show, and here's the question we asked quite plainly.
6103000	6108000	Tell us if you back the Kickstarter, or plan to, or not, and why.
6108000	6112000	We just kind of wanted to know where you guys' heads were at with this.
6112000	6118000	Redertainment responded on Google+, and said no, due to my pursuit of Project Buy a House.
6118000	6122000	Act Def said, I'm definitely backing this Kickstarter when I get the money.
6122000	6125000	I want to do $175 US dollars for the plushie tier.
6125000	6130000	And well, Inafune wants to give what Mega Man fans want, and I support that.
6130000	6133000	And there's an all-star team behind it, so I do have high hopes for it.
6133000	6136000	There's a yes and a no from Google+.
6136000	6142000	Let's go over to Fugu, excuse me, Facebook, part of Fugu.
6142000	6146000	I apologize for the Facebook noises, I really thought I turned those off.
6146000	6152000	Going to a comment from Rene, over from Cooper Club.
6152000	6158000	He says, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I didn't find out about it until just after it met its Kickstarter goal.
6158000	6160000	But now I really want to.
6160000	6166000	They still got the stretch goals, and for what, another 22 days, you can still basically pre-order the game.
6166000	6173000	Elliot B says, considering the talent involved, I reckon this particular Kickstarter is more likely to bear fruit than most.
6173000	6178000	That said, I never really got quite the appeal of Mega Man, so I guess I'll pass.
6178000	6180000	That's kind of surprising.
6180000	6182000	Well, I mean, I shouldn't say it that way.
6182000	6187000	I mean, some people just don't like certain games that may be popular otherwise, but I find it interesting that he's like,
6187000	6190000	yeah, it's a bunch of talented people, but eh, not my type of game.
6190000	6196000	Mason D said, HD2D art, the track record of the people involved, it seemed like a no-brainer.
6196000	6200000	Bumble D said, I'm going to pre-order the digital copy of the game this weekend.
6200000	6205000	It reminded me how much time I killed playing Mega Man 1 through 6 back in the NES days.
6205000	6209000	I recently bought the Mega Man X collection just to re-sharpen my skills for when this comes out.
6209000	6215000	Burr replied on Facebook and said, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I knew it would succeed anyway.
6216000	6219000	I try to back things that need the push over the finish line.
6219000	6223000	In this case, I can sit back and wait to see the reviews before taking the plunge.
6223000	6227000	I'm also a bit apprehensive about supporting something so similar to an existing IP
6227000	6232000	and wish people would have given attention to a more original idea like Ravensdale.
6232000	6237000	That's a very interesting perspective where he's kind of saying, or at least what I'm getting out of this is,
6237000	6240000	these guys didn't need the money.
6240000	6242000	Interesting.
6242000	6247000	Critical Myth says, no, but I prefer to get opinions on the final product first.
6247000	6252000	There have been plenty of great ideas that wound up having poor execution or unforeseen roadblocks.
6252000	6255000	Raginator says, nope, just because.
6255000	6259000	Daniel S. replied and said, I haven't heard of this until just now.
6259000	6262000	And then said, dude, this looks amaze balls.
6262000	6265000	A little bit Mega Man and a little bit Meta Bots, I'm in.
6265000	6269000	Also, screw Capcom for not letting Inafune make Mega Man games.
6269000	6273000	Here's something to think about, though, just to kind of go off of that point a little bit.
6273000	6277000	Since you're really excited about how it looks, something to consider is,
6277000	6282000	if he had been able to make a new Mega Man game, would we have got this?
6282000	6284000	And could this be better?
6284000	6286000	Just something to think about.
6286000	6289000	Monty Boggs replied on Facebook and said, yes, he backed it,
6289000	6292000	because I wanted to see the Mega Man games evolve
6292000	6295000	and I want them to achieve the stretch goal and put it on consoles.
6295000	6298000	This should also show Capcom that people want these games
6298000	6302000	and they've been dropping the ball, otherwise this Kickstarter wouldn't exist or succeed.
6302000	6308000	Ryan B. replied and said, no, he didn't back it, though I do want to, because I'm poor.
6308000	6313000	Hitstun replied and said, this could be the project that finally gets me to create a Kickstarter account.
6313000	6317000	I want the game to be good, but I'm on the fence about throwing money at it.
6317000	6321000	I typically don't buy a game until I see the finished product in motion.
6321000	6324000	So there's the answers from Facebook and Google Plus.
6324000	6327000	And I think you pretty much heard what we had to say about it earlier,
6327000	6333000	but I thought we would see a lot more of, yes, I was throwing my money at it,
6333000	6335000	I was rubbing my credit card at the screen,
6335000	6338000	but I found that there's a lot more of you out there that are kind of like,
6338000	6341000	yeah, we'll wait and see when the finished game's out.
6341000	6343000	I'll wait for the reviews. I'll check it out then.
6343000	6345000	They don't need my money right now. I'll give it to them later.
6345000	6348000	So I was kind of surprised by that, but in a good way.
6348000	6351000	So there you go, our FUGL question of the week.
6351000	6354000	Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.
6354000	6359000	All right. So let's talk a little bit about disappointment.
6359000	6364000	And the disappointment I have that such an awesome concept as the Aluma Room is not going to happen.
6364000	6368000	And it kind of makes sense because I was like, wow, that looks really cool,
6368000	6372000	but how the hell are they going to pull that off without it being incredibly expensive?
6372000	6374000	Well, the problem is they never figured out a way to do that.
6374000	6381000	So it would cost thousands of dollars at implement because it does require a nice HD projector
6381000	6388000	and a really specific setup because who has an HD projector attached to the ceiling
6388000	6393000	and an extra connect sensor attached to that and just not going to work.
6393000	6398000	So unfortunately, they said, you know, hey, it was a very it's it's very, very cool tech,
6398000	6403000	but it's like for a consumer, it will requires a projector and things.
6403000	6408000	It's really super neat if you're in the lab and you've got Microsoft money and you can set this up.
6408000	6411000	But we looked at it for an average consumer. It's like thousands of dollars.
6411000	6415000	So unfortunately, it's not going to go beyond proof of concept.
6415000	6421000	I say right now, but I think later on, maybe when that technology comes down in price a lot,
6421000	6425000	maybe like in three, four years, we might see something like that.
6425000	6429000	That's kind of where my head's at, because all technology comes down in price eventually.
6429000	6431000	Yes. So it might be thousands of dollars now.
6431000	6437000	But this is something maybe this is technology we're looking at for the Xbox two or whatever is.
6437000	6441000	God, I can't believe we're here. We are already talking about the next Xbox.
6441000	6446000	The new one's not even out yet. But, you know, this could be something that happens with whatever Xbox.
6446000	6450000	Just pick a random number to be like Xbox fifty seven or something like that.
6450000	6455000	Xbox thirty seven. You'll buy them all in a row.
6455000	6459000	They stack up in a row to create a giant Voltron.
6459000	6465000	All right. Well, for those of you that are upgrading to a new Xbox, maybe you'll be happy about these programs.
6465000	6468000	And we touched on this a little bit in the last show,
6468000	6473000	but now some more details coming out about who is going to allow you to upgrade to your Xbox one games.
6473000	6475000	Cheap Best Buy is one of them.
6475000	6480000	Best Buy is going to be rolling out a program that will offer ten dollar next gen upgrades.
6480000	6483000	GameStop and Amazon already had these programs in place.
6483000	6491000	Eligible games include FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Call of Duty, Ghost, Battlefield 4 and Watch Dogs.
6491000	6494000	This is interesting, though, what you have to do.
6494000	6497000	If you purchase one of the games within a set period after its release,
6497000	6501000	you'll be given a ten dollar coupon to put towards the Xbox one incarnation.
6501000	6508000	When you want to upgrade, you do the coupon and the game and then Best Buy gives you forty dollar credit,
6508000	6511000	reducing the final cost of the Xbox one game to ten dollars.
6511000	6513000	So it's this whole...
6513000	6515000	It seems weird.
6515000	6519000	It is a little bit weird, but it's like you get the coupon and then you get the value of the trade game and then you...
6519000	6526000	So if you don't use the coupon, then you get ten dollars off another game later on? Is that how that works?
6526000	6529000	I suppose you could do it that way. I don't know.
6529000	6531000	That just seems confusing.
6531000	6534000	Well, but then it says towards the game's Xbox one incarnation. I don't know, whatever.
6534000	6537000	What if I'm upgrading from say, like, uh...
6537000	6539000	How many people is this really going to affect?
6539000	6544000	I mean, if it's only for a certain period of time, either you're buying the one this year or you're not.
6544000	6555000	What if I wanted to upgrade from say, like, you know, I don't know, Disney Planes to like, say, Rise.
6555000	6557000	Is that an upgrade that I can do?
6557000	6559000	I don't think you can do that, Loki. I'm sorry to say.
6559000	6565000	What about like, you know, I don't know, Ben 10 Galactic Racing to Forza 5?
6565000	6568000	Because that's technically an upgrade. It's still driving.
6568000	6572000	Alright, look, I just wanted to add that the Microsoft store is doing this deal as well.
6572000	6576000	They will also be doing Xbox One games for $10 when you trade in 360 copies.
6576000	6587000	The titles include NFL Madden 25, Battlefield 4 Need for Speed Rivals, Call of Duty Ghosts, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.
6587000	6592000	All you have to do for this one, you bring the game to a Microsoft store and you get the Xbox One copy for $10.
6592000	6598000	Just throwing it out there, Watch Dogs not apparently on the list for the Microsoft store.
6599000	6604000	So if you're going to be participating in these programs for whatever reason, you better look at what games what stores are taking.
6604000	6610000	So, but now you have, what, three, four options? GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft Store.
6610000	6611000	I have one word for the whole thing.
6611000	6612000	What?
6612000	6613000	Blah!
6613000	6617000	Well, yeah, my whole thing is like, either you're getting the one this year or you're not.
6617000	6621000	If this program continues into next year, alright, well then I get it.
6621000	6626000	Yeah, but if it's such that, such a small window, just maybe, I don't know, here's a thought.
6626000	6627000	Wait a little bit.
6627000	6634000	Like, for example, like, if Grand Theft Auto 5, well, okay, no, that's a bad example because I wouldn't be able to wait for Grand Theft Auto 5.
6634000	6639000	But let's just say like Saints Row 4 was coming out on the PlayStation 4 or something.
6639000	6642000	It'd be like a really super awesome upgraded version or something.
6644000	6650000	I probably wouldn't have bought the game, you know, on PlayStation, well, I definitely didn't buy it on PlayStation 3.
6650000	6654000	So why would I, you know, buy one version of the game?
6654000	6659000	Or, I mean, it's even worse when they're talking about, like, Assassin's Creed that's literally coming out a month before.
6659000	6668000	Just wait and just pay, you know, pay the same amount of money that you would have bought, you know, the current gen version for.
6668000	6673000	Alright, let's move on with some new game news, right, DarkSakura?
6673000	6675000	Yes, we do have some new game news.
6675000	6683000	A, DungeonMuster just said, actually in chat, that ShameStop dropped the price for Xenoblade down to 65 bucks.
6683000	6684000	What a deal!
6686000	6688000	$65, that's still...
6688000	6693000	Could that, you're telling me nobody was buying it for 90 because they were just all downloading it from the internet?
6693000	6696000	I mean, just saying.
6696000	6701000	There's a new battle arena game online and it's King of Fighters.
6701000	6702000	Hmm.
6702000	6703000	Very weird.
6703000	6711000	It's actually in a closed beta in Thailand and I hate Destructoid, sorry, on my tablet, I hate it on my tablet.
6711000	6713000	I like this site, I hate it on my tablet.
6713000	6716000	Fix your tablet version, seriously.
6716000	6719000	And yeah, it's a MOBA.
6719000	6722000	They've done some weird stuff with, you know, King of Fighters.
6722000	6725000	Remember that they had a SHMUP game that was with King of Fighters?
6725000	6727000	Yes, that was awesome though.
6727000	6729000	It's weird though, I mean...
6729000	6736000	Well, so far the characters that are revealed have been Kyo, Iori, Joe, Griffin, and Terry.
6736000	6739000	So, and it's being developed by Dragonfly.
6739000	6746000	It's kind of cute in a way because, you know, you look at a game like League of Legends, it's all about the heroes, and you have to select one of the heroes, right?
6746000	6747000	Or the stupid Marvel game.
6747000	6750000	A fighting game lends itself very well to that.
6750000	6751000	Yeah.
6751000	6755000	Well, the Marvel game's more like a Diablo dungeon crawler than it is a MOBA.
6755000	6756000	It's not all that fun.
6756000	6759000	MOBA's a very kind of growing genre of games though.
6759000	6768000	You know, you have League of Legends, then you have DOTA is the other big one, and now you've seen some more pop up, like the heroes in New Earth is one.
6768000	6770000	You know, there's more and more, so...
6770000	6772000	Because League of Legends does very well.
6772000	6775000	Lots and lots of people play in that game or have played it at some point, so...
6775000	6777000	Yeah, as long as they've changed their passwords now.
6777000	6781000	Remember, they were going after old data, so the password could be used other places.
6781000	6783000	That is very true, be careful.
6783000	6790000	So, wow, I wish I could try this out at least, but just have to wait for it to float its way over here from Thailand.
6790000	6792000	Oh well.
6792000	6796000	Through the inner tubes, through unofficial translation patches.
6796000	6799000	The same way the rest of us played Ragnarok back in the day.
6799000	6801000	Who would be your hero in a King of Fighter MOBA?
6801000	6803000	It'd be Leona.
6803000	6805000	That's who I play every time I play the damn game.
6805000	6811000	Mine would have to be Kim Kap Wan, because that's who I loved in the game, or of course Mai.
6811000	6812000	Yeah, what is your dream team?
6812000	6813000	That was always my team.
6813000	6814000	Of three?
6814000	6815000	Yeah.
6815000	6816000	And a striker.
6816000	6822000	Kim Kap Wan, Mai, and Joe Higashi.
6822000	6823000	Who would be your striker?
6824000	6827000	I forget, who are the strikers?
6827000	6832000	You can pick any character as a striker, because you're a call-in person.
6832000	6834000	I'm thinking...
6839000	6842000	I don't know, come back, I always think about, I always go back to CVS.
6842000	6844000	Answer hazy, try again later.
6844000	6846000	I always go back to CVS and think about that.
6849000	6851000	Shit, I don't know, Andy Bogard.
6851000	6852000	I liked Andy.
6852000	6857000	My team was always Leona, Mai, and Athena.
6857000	6859000	Of course, a girl power team.
6859000	6862000	Or Yuri, with one of them being a striker.
6862000	6866000	So I would go between, because Yuri had the fine butt attack.
6866000	6868000	Was King in King of Fighters?
6868000	6869000	Yes, King was in King of Fighters.
6869000	6870000	That would be my striker, I liked King.
6870000	6871000	King was awesome.
6874000	6875000	Alright.
6875000	6876000	What about you, Loki?
6876000	6877000	I never played the game.
6877000	6878000	See?
6878000	6879000	What?
6879000	6881000	It was free on PlayStation Plus, one of the newer ones.
6881000	6883000	Yeah, so I checked it out a while back.
6883000	6884000	Anyway.
6885000	6887000	Loki, what do you got for us?
6887000	6892000	Alright, so I've got some Kickstarter information.
6892000	6896000	It's kind of a combination of Kickstarter and Ouya.
6896000	6901000	So Ouya's got this, I don't know what you'd call it, campaign that they're doing right now,
6901000	6903000	called the Free the Games campaign.
6903000	6907000	Basically, they're offering a million dollars, or they have this million dollar fund,
6907000	6915000	that they are matching Kickstarter, or Kickstarted games for the Ouya.
6915000	6919000	They're matching them up to, I think, $50,000.
6919000	6921000	Might be more than that.
6921000	6927000	But basically, the stipulations are that the game has to be exclusively for the Ouya.
6927000	6931000	It has to have a minimum goal of $50,000.
6931000	6941000	And I think that, I want to say that $50,000 might have been the, I think it actually goes up from there.
6941000	6945000	I think $50,000 is not the cap on that.
6945000	6947000	But anyway, so they're going to match funding.
6947000	6951000	Well, two games so far have reached their funding targets.
6951000	6957000	This game called Gridiron Thunder and Elementary My Dear Homes.
6957000	6960000	Well, there's a little bit of a problem with that.
6960000	6966000	The two games, as a lot of people were kind of looking at, had some fishy information regarding them.
6966000	6974000	For example, Gridiron Thunder, which is a football game, had several backers.
6974000	6985000	They had basically less backers than were on, like for example, less backers than there were, the money funded.
6985000	6993000	So it would have basically averaged out to about $626 per backer, would have been the average price.
6993000	6999000	So there was backers on there that were pledging tens of thousands of dollars at a time.
6999000	7007000	And you could see it, even if you look at Kick Track, you can see these spike days that they like earned $40,000 or something on it.
7007000	7012000	And that was a little fishy, being that, you know, basically the thought is,
7012000	7017000	okay, so there's a guy who creates a Kickstarter, you know, has people back it or whatever.
7017000	7021000	Who matches that and then they take the money and run, kind of thing.
7021000	7028000	Well, it's even gone further. Elementary My Dear Homes had a bunch of fake, or I should say,
7028000	7037000	made up people that were one time backers that were backing this project, including made up characters, celebrities,
7037000	7043000	a person that's been kidnapped, and just all sorts of weird stuff.
7043000	7050000	Is that interference from people related to the game, or is that like a 4chan prank?
7050000	7057000	I think it's people that are related to the game that are backing their own projects so that they put basically,
7057000	7066000	okay, the project's $50,000, I put in $50,000 of my own money, I get 10% of that taken out or whatever from Kickstarter and Amazon.
7066000	7069000	And I get another $50,000 from Ouya.
7069000	7073000	Oh, this is one of those, I gotta make sure I meet my goals. Well, then go Indiegogo.
7073000	7078000	Well, here's the thing though, it's not that, it's they're getting money matched from Ouya.
7078000	7085000	And what they're gonna do basically is they're getting free money and then they're going to either create a really shoddy game,
7085000	7090000	you know, or they're just gonna take the money and leave, you know, type thing.
7090000	7095000	So, however, the Elementary My Dear Homes has been suspended.
7095000	7106000	It hit its funding goal of $50,000 and it was currently at $58,770 and it's been suspended because of suspicious accounts.
7109000	7112000	So yeah, so it sounds like, you know, they were trying to scam it.
7112000	7115000	And there's a lot of conspiracy theories about it.
7115000	7119000	They're saying, well, it's, I'm not so sure about the Elementary My Dear Homes one,
7119000	7127000	but the other one that Ouya is actually kicking money in there because they want to make it look like these games are being successful and stuff.
7127000	7135000	And I don't know, it's weird, but yeah, Kickstarter, there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on there.
7135000	7136000	You don't say.
7136000	7137000	Yeah, and speaking of-
7137000	7140000	When there's a way to make money on the internet, shady things happen, get out.
7140000	7145000	Yeah, I know. Speaking of which, remember how I talked about, it was months ago, about that nine-year-old-
7145000	7146000	I have to say this real quick.
7146000	7149000	sj100mattinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,
7149000	7154000	heaven help us if the Nigerian internet scammers make it to Kickstarter unless they're already there.
7154000	7155000	Well, speaking of internet scams.
7155000	7161000	Yes, speaking of scams, there was, remember that nine-year-old, there was a Kickstarter,
7161000	7166000	it was that nine-year-old wants to make her first RPG because her brother said that she can't do this and this whole STEM thing.
7166000	7172000	I went into detail about it, about how she didn't really need the money because her mom's like a millionaire,
7172000	7177000	and that's beside the point, but she said originally it was to go to this RPG camp,
7177000	7182000	and then the camp was canceled, so she was going to MIT or something.
7182000	7184000	Oh, now the money's for a laptop.
7184000	7188000	Oh, well, then she got a laptop gifted to her from Alienware and Dell.
7188000	7193000	Oh, well, now the money's for something, and it was an RPG Maker game.
7193000	7197000	Well, guess what? The date that that game was supposed to be released came and gone,
7197000	7202000	and no real updates, and they've kind of all disappeared.
7202000	7205000	So, once again, people called it a scam.
7205000	7208000	They got called out, the creators called them trolls.
7208000	7212000	All the internet people that ran it, Kotaku and some other ones,
7212000	7218000	defended the Kickstarter people and said, oh, yeah, all those people that are ganging up against that nine-year-old,
7218000	7221000	they're just trolling them and stuff like that.
7221000	7228000	Well, are they out here now to say that, well, maybe they were right because they didn't come up with anything.
7228000	7231000	No, because it failing isn't newsworthy.
7231000	7234000	No, it didn't fail. They succeeded.
7234000	7237000	I mean, sorry, it failing to produce isn't newsworthy.
7237000	7242000	Yes, so basically she got $28,000 for doing nothing.
7242000	7244000	So, yeah.
7244000	7251000	Wow. Well, hope it pays for college and not for, you know, trips to Headey.
7251000	7253000	I want someone to pay for my college.
7253000	7254000	Wouldn't that be nice?
7254000	7255000	Yeah, really.
7255000	7259000	I want someone to pay for me to get additional classes in my profession. That would be nice.
7259000	7262000	All right, let's move on with another story.
7262000	7268000	Well, somebody's going to be getting a lot of money, and that's, I wouldn't mind having $15 million in damages,
7268000	7273000	and that is a lawsuit with Microsoft versus Motorola Mobility.
7273000	7277000	This is a long-running lawsuit surrounding patent infringement.
7277000	7279000	Jury ruled in favor of Microsoft.
7279000	7285000	Microsoft gets $15 million because the Xbox 360 console, it was ruled last year,
7285000	7290000	it infringed on four of Motorola's patents surrounding video decoding, Wi-Fi technology.
7290000	7296000	But earlier this year, that decision was overturned, and the same judge cleared Microsoft of the infringement.
7296000	7302000	Now, a district court jury decided that it was Motorola that breached its agreements with Microsoft.
7302000	7311000	Because Motorola was not providing the patent licenses for fair and reasonable terms, this is why Microsoft got the damages.
7311000	7315000	I can't imagine that this is going to be over by any stretch of the imagination.
7315000	7318000	Is this shit going to go to the Supreme Court? Is that what's going to happen?
7318000	7320000	I'm really surprised the two didn't settle.
7320000	7322000	That's what always happens in this shit. There's always a settlement.
7322000	7331000	Yeah, I went to jury, and the jury awarded it to Microsoft, saying that, nope, it's Motorola's fault because they weren't allowing Microsoft to have it reasonably.
7331000	7334000	I'm sure this is not the last of it.
7334000	7342000	No, probably not. I think, in some cases, trying to push things through to an actual jury trial is a way to set a precedent.
7342000	7343000	Yeah.
7343000	7350000	Alright. Well, we're going to allow you to set some precedents on our show right now with the emails that you send us.
7350000	7356000	Every week you guys send us mailbags, or not, to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7356000	7358000	Bags of mails? Ooh.
7358000	7363000	So Dark Soccer's going to jump in the mailbag and see the flood of email awaiting us tonight.
7363000	7367000	More like the drippy one.
7367000	7369000	In the two weeks we were off...
7369000	7371000	Yeah, we got one email.
7371000	7376000	And I'm saying drippy not because of the person, but because it's like, drip, drip, drip.
7377000	7381000	You open the bag to dump it out and one little email came floating down.
7381000	7383000	Hi everyone at OLR.
7383000	7384000	Hi.
7386000	7387000	Rob.
7387000	7389000	What? The listeners say hi, I gotta say hi back.
7389000	7392000	Do you paraphrase Final Fantasy VII since you love it so much?
7392000	7396000	Sit your ass down in that chair and eat your goddamn Ricola.
7396000	7399000	Hearts, hearts.
7399000	7402000	I actually came with like a bucket of Ricolas and...
7402000	7404000	I'm actually very thankful.
7405000	7407000	It's your favorite person in the whole world.
7407000	7409000	He did a face.
7409000	7411000	Raginator.
7411000	7416000	As you probably remember, Sony officially retired the PS2 earlier this year after a 12 year...
7416000	7419000	Well, he said ear run, but I think he means ear.
7419000	7425000	I think it's safe to say that in terms of the last gen systems, the PS2 was the leading favorite and most people had it.
7425000	7431000	Either as a primary console or a secondary, or even just as a DVD player that just so happened to play games.
7431000	7436000	All that being said, I'd like to pose a question to the three of you and to the chat room as well.
7436000	7441000	Those of you who had a PS2, do you have any fond memories revolving around the PS2 and if so, what were they?
7441000	7444000	Getting my JPS2 and playing the hell out of Beatmania 2DX?
7444000	7452000	You stole my damn answer. I would say getting the Japanese PlayStation 2, which I owned before a US PlayStation 2, and playing the shit out of Beatmania 2DX.
7452000	7453000	Bam.
7453000	7454000	Fist bump.
7454000	7455000	Yep.
7455000	7457000	Loki, PlayStation 2 memories?
7458000	7459000	Uh...
7460000	7463000	I'm my HD loader in the...
7463000	7468000	Actually, I'd say... when was the first thing I got on PlayStation 2?
7468000	7471000	Well, I got Armored Core was one of the first games in there.
7471000	7473000	I'd say probably like, uh...
7475000	7478000	Grand Theft Auto... well, that was PlayStation 1.
7478000	7481000	No, no, that was PlayStation 2. Grand Theft Auto 3?
7481000	7483000	Yeah, Vice City and all that was PlayStation 2.
7483000	7484000	Yeah.
7485000	7486000	Goddammit.
7486000	7487000	Don't die.
7487000	7491000	Also, playing music games online with DDR and Amplitude was good times.
7491000	7493000	You know what I did like?
7493000	7500000	Not having to do the button trick every time I wanted to put in that pen CD for Beatmania.
7500000	7504000	So it was actually a way to play my old 5-key Beatmania stuff.
7506000	7511000	I also just had... well, you know how many import PlayStation 1 games I had.
7511000	7513000	It was nice not having to rely on a separate device.
7513000	7516000	We'd just have to change the plugs and bam, there it was, you know.
7517000	7518000	But, um...
7518000	7521000	Yeah, I really... I really have to say I had a lot...
7521000	7527000	Even though I still laugh my ass off to this day with the Dreamcast vs. PS2 video that was online.
7528000	7530000	What a disappointment video.
7530000	7531000	You remember that one?
7531000	7534000	I do. You've done it as a cookie here on the shelves before, yeah.
7534000	7535000	That was great.
7535000	7537000	So, um... moving on.
7537000	7542000	Now, as a secondary closing topic, I'd like to get some information from you three if possible.
7542000	7543000	Well, that's what we do a show for.
7543000	7544000	We charge.
7544000	7546000	By the hour.
7546000	7549000	I've been mulling over some notion of starting my own business,
7549000	7555000	specifically an arcade that primarily focuses on games spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s,
7555000	7559000	with a few music games like DDR thrown in for good measure for a good 10 years now.
7559000	7564000	The main hurdle is that I know virtually nothing about the subject of starting up and running a business.
7564000	7568000	I know that there are some basics, like having to lease retail space, pay for utilities,
7568000	7573000	needing to incorporate the business, possibly filing for either loans and or grants,
7573000	7578000	buying necessities for the business in case of PC for business purposes, and of course the arcade games.
7578000	7580000	But that's the extent of what I know.
7580000	7583000	That being said, what advice can you give regarding this?
7583000	7588000	And yes, I know that arcades are pretty much dead, but I'm confident that I can make this work.
7588000	7592000	Any info that you have would be provided would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance.
7592000	7596000	This email is brought to you by Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo. Hey!
7596000	7600000	I will give some very blunt, frank advice with the whole business.
7600000	7604000	I've never started a business, so I honestly couldn't tell you like some insider secret.
7604000	7606000	We've run one. Dan and I have.
7606000	7609000	Well, this is my advice. Maybe you will agree or you won't agree.
7609000	7614000	My advice is you need to take a class or read a book on starting your own business,
7614000	7618000	and if you don't have the time to do that or the money to do that, then you don't have the time or the money to start your own business.
7618000	7628000	Exactly. That being said, Dan went into business with the lady that used to be one of the owners of video game swappers locally here.
7628000	7632000	And so in that case, there was already the space. There was already the inventory.
7632000	7637000	We put up a lot of our own games, too. All of our Dragon Ball Z figures, my old manga.
7637000	7639000	We sold a lot of our own stuff.
7639000	7645000	The big thing is that if you've got the space and the stuff in that you need to get the business license,
7645000	7649000	and before you need the business license, you need to look up what the local laws are.
7649000	7653000	You need to make sure that you don't have to have just a county business license.
7653000	7657000	You may have to have a city license.
7657000	7661000	For me as a massage therapist, I had to have a county and city license.
7661000	7663000	In some cases, you need a state license.
7663000	7666000	So like I said, I've been on multiple sides of this.
7666000	7669000	I agree with Rob. You should really take a business class.
7669000	7672000	In some cases, a lot of it is fairly common sense.
7672000	7676000	You can figure it out if you've got that kind of logical mind,
7676000	7681000	but you really do need to know the legalities of it before you remotely put down any money,
7681000	7683000	before you remotely look for any sponsors.
7683000	7686000	We're still trying to start VOG as a legitimate business
7686000	7688000	so we can do some of these things like sell t-shirts
7688000	7690000	and some of the other things you guys have been asking for,
7690000	7693000	and it's not easy to make sure we do it right.
7693000	7698000	Especially in our case, we're looking at a multinational type of thing.
7699000	7702000	There's a lot of stuff that goes into it,
7702000	7708000	but you're going to have to have your fictitious name for your business.
7708000	7713000	It's the name that goes on your business license, and then it is registered to you.
7713000	7718000	From that point on, any of your accounts are going to be registered in that fictitious name,
7718000	7723000	being your bank account, being any savings associated with it, paying your taxes.
7723000	7726000	You're going to need an accountant, that's for damn sure.
7726000	7730000	It's a lot of money that goes into running a business, and I don't suggest doing it by yourself.
7730000	7733000	Yeah, that's great advice too. Find a business partner.
7733000	7738000	Just be careful with that idea. A lot of people lose a lot of money on that.
7738000	7740000	Arcades are dying, and you're not going to save them alone.
7740000	7744000	But if you have a good idea, you never know what might happen.
7744000	7748000	What's going to be the thing that draws people to your arcade when they can play games at home?
7748000	7750000	Is that going to be that you do kick-ass birthday parties?
7750000	7752000	Do you sell booze?
7752000	7754000	That's what Dave & Buster's is doing.
7754000	7756000	Well, that's what a lot of these retro arcades do.
7756000	7764000	Well, the other thing to also, and this just occurred to me too, is that especially in regards to...
7764000	7766000	God, I forgot what I was going to say.
7766000	7774000	Because I know it's a big thing too, is you need to make sure that not only do you check with the legality behind it,
7774000	7779000	you also check with not just the legality behind getting the license,
7779000	7783000	but the legalities around how you handle your money with the place.
7783000	7791000	Keep in mind that any, I think the rule of thumb is that any business is expected to lose money in its first five years before it turns a profit.
7791000	7795000	Also check with your local, you know, wherever you have to register through.
7795000	7799000	There are first-time business startup plans that can help you with this.
7799000	7806000	A lot of places have a complete checklist on their, you know, be it county, be it city website, that's going to show you what to do.
7806000	7813000	So you've got the information out there, but I think you've done a lot of research clearly.
7813000	7821000	I think the best thing for you to do is look at everything that you need, make yourself an outline, and make yourself a timeline.
7821000	7827000	And make sure that you have, that if there's any cost associated with whatever is coming up on your timeline,
7827000	7830000	that you have that money by then, and that you've got some extra.
7830000	7836000	Now fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there's a novel idea, arcade and strippers.
7836000	7843000	Now that's something that hasn't been done, that could have, but then again, a whole other set of laws that come when you have titties out in the open.
7843000	7845000	I will tell you this, you know, it's incredibly stupid.
7845000	7846000	What?
7846000	7852000	Is that in San Francisco, if I was going to be a massage therapist there, I would actually have to have an adult entertainment license.
7852000	7854000	To do massage.
7854000	7855000	So you could do topless massage?
7855000	7864000	No. They treat, this is so stupid, they treat the massage, the massage and holistic health industry as adult entertainment.
7864000	7866000	So fucking stupid.
7866000	7870000	It's not like there's any shortage of adult entertainment in San Francisco.
7870000	7874000	It's the whole happy ending thing that's ruined it for all of us.
7874000	7878000	They talked about that day one in massage school. I can't do it anymore because of my hand.
7878000	7880000	Aww, happy ending?
7880000	7882000	No!
7883000	7885000	You're so mean. Alright, is that it for the email?
7885000	7888000	I like the video where the happy ending is just parties and clapping.
7888000	7889000	Yes, me too.
7889000	7890000	That was funny.
7890000	7895000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give Jamie some work for a future week.
7895000	7900000	In the meantime though, it's time for the FUs of the Week.
7900000	7902000	Why? I don't know.
7912000	7928000	I have a big FU to the person who was driving the not so fresh El Camino in the rain the other day on my street, zipped around the corner and nearly ran into Dan's car.
7928000	7935000	So yeah, don't speed on the damn road when it's raining. Don't speed through a neighborhood.
7935000	7940000	You are the lowest of low. There's a special place in hell for you if I believed in hell.
7940000	7945000	And you know what? I might just believe in hell for the vague reason that you might go there.
7945000	7947000	You're gonna make an exception.
7947000	7949000	I'll make an exception.
7949000	7955000	Uh, FU to having to coordinate shipping Grand Theft Auto V.
7955000	7965000	As much as I can't wait to play the game, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare. It's like Call of Duty two times this year instead of once.
7966000	7976000	My FU of the Week goes to being sick again from a convention. It's not like I don't wash my hands and drink vitamin C and all the things you're supposed to do.
7976000	7977000	It's all the other people that don't.
7977000	7981000	Yeah, it's all the other people. That's what it is. Other people's fault. Never my fault.
7981000	7982000	Rob. What?
7982000	7989000	You do know the theory goes that doing all of those extra preventative measures might actually weaken your immune system to fighting off colds?
7989000	7992000	Weren't you the one telling me to take zinc when I went?
7992000	8000000	I was telling you to take zinc, but regardless of that, you know, people rely on that stuff too much instead of making themselves stronger.
8000000	8003000	I just wouldn't say an FU to being sick. It's awfully inconvenient.
8003000	8009000	Instead of washing your hands when you get done at the con, you just lick them clean. And then you'll feel much better later on.
8009000	8011000	You're such an asshole.
8011000	8015000	I'm serious. This is really draining me. I'm really having to push to finish the show tonight.
8015000	8021000	Thank God we only have two more stories and then we get into Twitter topics and calls and then we're done.
8021000	8025000	Don't get me wrong. I love doing this show and I love all you guys that turn out to listen.
8025000	8027000	I should have brought you some soup, Rob. I'm sorry.
8027000	8031000	Oh no. Why would you apologize for not buying me something?
8031000	8035000	Because I do nice stuff for people and I feel bad when it occurs to me after the fact.
8035000	8040000	You know what I'm going to do right now? I'm going to go fix myself an emergency while Loki does this next story.
8040000	8042000	Okay.
8042000	8049000	So that oft rumor that, hey, there's going to be another TimeSplitters game is finally true.
8049000	8054000	There is going to be another TimeSplitters game. It's not going to be new necessarily. It's TimeSplitters Rewind.
8054000	8062000	It's basically a, I guess they're saying the ragtag team of fans constructing the game.
8062000	8067000	And they're going to start on developing a PlayStation 4 version of the game.
8067000	8074000	And they said, you know, we actually are going to go ahead and start development of TimeSplitters Rewind on PlayStation 4.
8074000	8078000	We're pretty confident Crytek's going to say go ahead and do it.
8078000	8085000	But we don't want them saying go ahead and do it when we're caught with our pants down.
8085000	8087000	Like we're halfway through development.
8087000	8094000	So Crytek, I guess they've approved the PC version of the game.
8094000	8098000	And I guess that's going through some testing right now as well.
8099000	8104000	But not really approved, I guess, the PlayStation 4 version yet.
8104000	8108000	But hey, I don't care. PC version's good enough for me.
8108000	8110000	Kids like PCs.
8110000	8114000	Exactly. So, I don't know.
8114000	8121000	You know, TimeSplitters kind of HD, I guess, with all the crazy stuff in there.
8121000	8123000	I could dig that.
8124000	8127000	Oh, thank you. DarkSakura's giving me more Ricola.
8127000	8129000	I'm saving away from my ride home.
8129000	8130000	You're taking pity on me.
8130000	8134000	Trust me, I buy huge, massive bags of Ricolas.
8134000	8136000	I would feel guilty if I got one of you guys sick, though.
8136000	8139000	But I've got to be past that point. I never really had a fever.
8139000	8144000	But anyhow, Final Fantasy VI.
8144000	8147000	I know we talked earlier about Final Fantasy VII being the anniversary.
8147000	8150000	Oh, actually, sorry. We did that during the music break, so the podcasters didn't hear that.
8150000	8154000	But Final Fantasy VII is 17 years old as of yesterday, right?
8154000	8158000	But one game that's still near and dear to people's hearts is Final Fantasy VI.
8158000	8165000	And what's interesting is that there's a fan-made Final Fantasy VI movie being made.
8165000	8168000	It's called Final Fantasy Terra.
8168000	8173000	And it's being made, you know, for an amateur film, it's pretty well-made, you know?
8173000	8177000	It's amazing what people can do with their phones and HD cameras.
8177000	8179000	I don't think anyone needs filming that with their phones.
8179000	8183000	You know what I mean, though? But I'm just saying in general, you have HD cameras on your phone,
8183000	8189000	you know, just spend another thousand or two dollars and you get these fancy cameras that are capable of a lot.
8189000	8195000	So anyway, the group that's producing it is Bad Pixel, and there's actually a trailer that's out there that you can see.
8195000	8202000	They are actually pitching the idea to Square Enix to try to get permission to proceed with development.
8202000	8207000	If that is successful, they're going to turn to Kickstarter to raise the funds to actually make the film.
8207000	8213000	There's a whole part about Square Enix screenlining it, though. I don't think that's going to happen in a million years. Sorry.
8213000	8220000	Well, at least they're going the correct route instead of let's go ahead and do it on Kickstarter and wait for it to get shut down.
8220000	8221000	Right.
8221000	8224000	Rather than, you know, let's ask permission first and then...
8224000	8228000	Right. So, yeah, at least they're going about it that way.
8228000	8235000	But, yeah, I just, you know, when they shut down that Chrono Trigger remake project and, you know, they're very protective of their IPs.
8235000	8241000	I just kind of don't see this happening. You know, they want to do...they have, what, Advent Children.
8241000	8246000	They have the spirits within. They kind of want to make their movies animated, and I don't know, they just...
8246000	8254000	Final Fantasy VI is a pretty precious franchise, and I think it's still due for a remake at some point, isn't it?
8254000	8261000	Because V got its remake on iOS. Shouldn't VI get something? Maybe they're saving it for something big. Who knows?
8262000	8269000	But, good luck to these guys. I'm not saying I don't want to see it happen, but I just...I don't know.
8269000	8275000	I just kind of think Square Enix isn't going to give it permission, but props to you guys for creating the impressive trailer that you did.
8275000	8284000	That is our last story for tonight, so that's the point where we're going to open up our Skype line and see if we get any calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8284000	8287000	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
8288000	8297000	We do still have the 800 number as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course, again, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8297000	8304000	So that is open now for your calls. If you want to talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or possibly a different topic, we will get to that.
8304000	8308000	In the meantime, last minute stories. I don't know if we have anything, Loki?
8308000	8309000	Nah, I don't have anything.
8309000	8310000	Really?
8310000	8311000	At least not yet.
8311000	8314000	I think we covered a lot of stuff during the show.
8314000	8319000	Yeah, there's just not a whole ton of new stuff right now.
8319000	8325000	Especially no stories about Grand Theft Auto 5 leaking out there on the internet, unfortunately.
8325000	8326000	Oh, has it leaked?
8326000	8330000	No, I said it has not. Unfortunately it has not, yeah.
8330000	8335000	Alright, well I do have a few, oh, we have a call coming in, so let's go to it.
8335000	8338000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8338000	8342000	This is Ron Moon. We're going to make sure the Skype line does not crap out on anybody tonight.
8342000	8343000	Let's hope.
8343000	8344000	Hang up after a few seconds.
8344000	8348000	I know, you gotta last 20 seconds to beat your call into Bobby's show. What's up?
8348000	8354000	Not much. I have my stopwatch ready, but Rob, as someone who's been going to cons for about 15 years,
8354000	8358000	I'm going to give you a basic homemade remedy that should fix things up for you.
8358000	8359000	Okay.
8359000	8371000	Black tea, two shots of honey, a bit of lemon, a little shot of vodka, half a shot, and two tablespoons of tussin. You'll be fine.
8371000	8373000	Ugh, tussin, ugh.
8373000	8377000	Actually, just raw honey is really, really good for all that. Raw honey.
8377000	8387000	I've been trying to drink tea, so yeah, no, I don't, man, it's just weird that it's happening after every convention that I go to, so I just, yeah, irritating.
8387000	8394000	Well, the more conventions you go to, your comp plague immunity builds up, so.
8394000	8400000	Yeah, I guess that's true. Well, congrats, you made it a full minute, so apparently it was your connection with Bobby
8400000	8404000	that was not appreciated by Skype. What else is on your mind, buddy?
8404000	8410000	I want to go back to about two weeks ago when I called you out by accident about DuckTales.
8410000	8411000	Yeah.
8411000	8417000	Okay. I mean, I understand your issues with the game, with the sound and the cutscenes and so forth.
8417000	8426000	I mean, personally, I guess because I bought it for, I got it for PS3, I didn't have any issues with the sound, the voices, but with the cinematic sequences,
8426000	8434000	I really enjoyed it. It felt like as if I was just watching, like, a five-part miniseries just as I'm going through every stage.
8434000	8444000	Yeah, I mean, I didn't, I think at the end of the day, I did recommend the game. I just kind of thought, like, there wasn't enough action before those sequences would consistently break things up.
8444000	8451000	That was one thing that kind of irritated me, and I guess in some regards, that is true, the NES version had some of that too,
8451000	8458000	but I don't know, it just felt like the action kept being interrupted on the newer one. That was just what really bugged me.
8458000	8464000	I guess, but I do remember from the original NES game, there were maybe about two or three cutscenes.
8464000	8470000	All the cutscenes just turned into, like, a brand-new movie or something, and as I'm playing through the game, I'm like,
8470000	8475000	I remember this area, that area, I know what's over there, this, this, this, this, and that,
8475000	8480000	and I noticed, like, the extra perks that they threw in and stuff like that make the game awesome.
8480000	8487000	Sound production issues aside, it is a great love letter to the cartoon that many people grew up on,
8487000	8495000	so I can see why people that really loved DuckTales growing up, which, by the way, was a cartoon I didn't watch as much of as some of my peers,
8495000	8500000	I can see why you've got to play this game at least once.
8500000	8506000	Yeah, my only issue is the fact that I had to go to Shame Stop to pick up the Collector's Edition.
8506000	8509000	Come to find out that certain target locations had it.
8509000	8510000	Oh.
8510000	8511000	Mm-hmm.
8511000	8513000	But at least you got the pin.
8513000	8515000	Yes, I did, and it's sitting on my shelf in the case.
8515000	8517000	Next time you go to a Disney park, you can wear it.
8517000	8518000	Damn right.
8518000	8519000	There you go.
8519000	8524000	All right, well, Rama, buddy, any other comments or questions for us tonight?
8524000	8529000	Quick funny thing, this was at my old job, and my supervisor was a big DuckTales fan,
8529000	8535000	and he would repeat this line from one of the episodes where Scrooge was losing his mind about a sea monster ate his ice cream.
8535000	8539000	I turned around and looked at him and was, that was not his, this is along the lines of,
8539000	8542000	that was a sea monster, that was half his fortune.
8542000	8544000	He looked at me crazy, I'm like, go to YouTube.
8544000	8549000	He pulled up that episode, and that was the follow-up line to it, and he just gave me this look of how do you know that,
8549000	8554000	and I'm like, I have this odd tendency for odd pop culture cartoons and references like that.
8554000	8561000	Come on, I'm sure they screen DuckTales at 3 a.m. at some anime conventions, you get high and watch some, come on.
8562000	8568000	No, the only time you get high at anime conventions is somebody's doing Anime Hell Knight or something like that,
8568000	8574000	and you just sit there and you just lose your effing mind, and you chant for blue screen over and over.
8574000	8575000	Oh my gosh.
8575000	8580000	Rob, there are stories. We will have to talk offline, but I have some stories for you.
8580000	8585000	I'm sure, and they can, the listeners can hear some of those stories on Anime Jam Session.
8585000	8590000	Yes, and we're getting ready for our very first 21-plus anime convention this weekend.
8590000	8592000	Ooh, that sounds like it might be fun.
8592000	8600000	I have been told it's okay to walk around, um, bottomless, topless, alcohol without alcohol, because we have our own private beach.
8600000	8602000	Where the hell is this being held, Nevada?
8602000	8605000	No, uh, Provincetown, Massachusetts.
8605000	8608000	Oh, yeah, alright, yeah, makes sense. P-Town.
8608000	8610000	I get told that too.
8610000	8615000	Yeah, let me put it this way, I've never even been there, but I want to go.
8617000	8619000	I've heard a lot about it.
8619000	8621000	Alice, you join us next year.
8621000	8634000	We'll see, oh my god, my con budget, I'm like, between PAX East, uh, the Gamer X2, E3 hopefully, and Dragon Con 2014, I'm busy, bro.
8634000	8648000	Dude, don't even get me started on PAX East. I am ready with, my staff knows as soon as they hear about the hotels, you call, text, tweet, whatever, so I can jump to a computer and shank somebody for two rooms at the Westin.
8648000	8658000	Well, I'm praying that at least one of the VoG guys is able to get a room, and I can piggyback on that, because I'm pretty sure Travis and Bobby and Brad will all be hammering the phones the day those open up, so.
8658000	8661000	Remember, I'm also Team VoG, I got you, remember.
8661000	8662000	Alright.
8662000	8663000	I get the rooms, it comes to us first.
8663000	8668000	Oh, sorry, I was talking about Dragon Con, but yes, PAX East, PAX East, I will look you up, buddy.
8668000	8669000	Hell yeah, man.
8669000	8677000	Alright, I should let you go to get more calls, but take care, and everybody check out Anime Jam Session now, immediately following Electric Sisterhood, Tuesdays at VoG.
8678000	8679000	Alright, take care, buddy.
8679000	8680000	Alright, later.
8680000	8681000	Bye.
8681000	8687000	1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8687000	8689000	And give us a call.
8689000	8691000	A couple tweets I'm getting here.
8691000	8694000	Let's see, some tweets from Tigerclaw tonight.
8694000	8698000	EA to close Battleforge next month.
8698000	8703000	Battleforge is one of EA's studios, and they are sadly going to be closed.
8703000	8705000	I'm trying to bring up the story to see what they made.
8706000	8708000	Oh, they were Play for Free.
8708000	8710000	Where are these guys?
8710000	8711000	That's too bad.
8711000	8716000	I'm trying to see what games they made, but I don't see anything in the list here, but they are closing at the end of October.
8716000	8721000	Never good to hear about people losing their jobs, so our thoughts go out to them.
8721000	8728000	Tigerclaw sends us one more tweet about the Halo designer calling out Hideo Kojima over the sexy comments.
8729000	8732000	Oh god, did you hear about Kojima's sexy comments?
8732000	8734000	Because it was creating quite the stir.
8734000	8741000	About Metal Gear Solid 5 and how Quiet needed to be more erotic so more people would cosplay her for Tokyo Game Show.
8741000	8742000	Really?
8742000	8745000	Yeah, he kind of put his foot in his mouth with that comment.
8749000	8754000	Kojima clarified with Polygon later he meant to say sexy, not erotic.
8755000	8757000	Well, okay.
8758000	8761000	I just think it was bad word choice all around.
8761000	8763000	I started to give him the benefit of the doubt.
8763000	8767000	I was like, is it maybe one of those things that's lost in translation or something?
8769000	8775000	Anyhow, in this article that Tigerclaw linked us, let's see, who is this?
8775000	8784000	David Ellis, Halo designer, said, eccentricity is a cute cover word for objectification and sexism.
8784000	8787000	We got another call coming in, let's go to it.
8787000	8791000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, it's still connecting there.
8791000	8793000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8793000	8796000	Boom, it's Jim Sally.
8796000	8797000	Hey Jim Sally!
8797000	8798000	Jim Sally, you're sideways.
8798000	8799000	Yeah, you're sideways today.
8799000	8800000	That's okay, we will turn our...
8800000	8801000	Oh, there you go.
8801000	8802000	Now you're...
8802000	8803000	He's in MTV camp.
8803000	8805000	Jim Sally's tech support with a smile.
8806000	8808000	You have very nice teeth, Jim Sally.
8808000	8810000	I do, don't I? I brush every day, man.
8810000	8811000	That's good, that's good.
8811000	8812000	You should.
8812000	8813000	You have that big gap right there, though.
8813000	8815000	That's okay, Madonna gets away with it, so do you.
8815000	8818000	I look, yeah, exactly. I look just as cute as she does, I think.
8818000	8821000	We're gonna start calling you the material boy.
8821000	8823000	Material boy, nice.
8823000	8825000	So what's up, Jim Sally?
8825000	8829000	Well, actually, a little sidetrack for the last caller.
8829000	8831000	I've been to Providence town, man, many a time.
8831000	8832000	Oh, really?
8832000	8836000	My family, we're from Canada, but we vacationed in Cape Cod in this little town called Falmouth,
8836000	8839000	and we used to always go to Providence town to...
8839000	8843000	You know what, I'm gonna be honest with you, I had the cleanest beaches, nice places to walk.
8843000	8850000	And it's definitely a different place when you go there compared to the rest of America.
8850000	8851000	Yeah.
8851000	8853000	You wanna hear a funny story that happened to me when I went there?
8853000	8854000	Sure.
8854000	8855000	You could tell me if you think this...
8855000	8859000	Bobby doesn't think my stories are real, by the way, but this is real, Robert, I'm telling you.
8859000	8860000	I believe you.
8860000	8867000	I was about 12, 13, I was just starting to get into baseball, and I thought it was pretty cool,
8867000	8869000	and I thought I was gonna be the best back catcher ever.
8869000	8875000	So we went to Providence, and I was buying a lot of Red Sox gear and stuff there, right, because Boston's close by.
8875000	8880000	And I went to this one place that was selling T-shirts, and they had Boston Red Sox, there they go.
8880000	8886000	And then they had novelty T-shirts, and there was one that I thought was back catching related, so I got it.
8886000	8890000	My mom let me buy it, she's portraiting, she doesn't know any better, and the T-shirt said,
8890000	8893000	You Pigeon, I'm Catching.
8893000	8895000	Oh, no.
8895000	8899000	I was like, wow. I looked good in it, though, right? Like, it was tight on my arms and stuff.
8899000	8902000	Like, I had little 12-year-old pipes back then, too.
8902000	8907000	So, yeah, I have a lot of pictures of me, like, 12 years old on that vacation wearing a T-shirt that says,
8907000	8909000	You Pigeon, I'm Catching.
8909000	8911000	Did you wear it to baseball practice when you got home?
8911000	8914000	Because I'm sure all the other kids just ate you alive.
8914000	8917000	Dude, yeah, that's where I found out about what that shirt really meant.
8920000	8922000	Oh, my God.
8922000	8923000	Can you believe that, man?
8923000	8928000	But you just wanted to be a catcher in baseball. In baseball. Literally in baseball.
8928000	8931000	Yeah, otherwise, Jim Salley throws with his cannon.
8934000	8938000	That means that you should vacation there, man. I'm gonna take my daughter there next year.
8938000	8940000	I would love to visit there.
8940000	8944000	I have seriously entertained the idea, and I don't know when I'm gonna have the time or the money to do this,
8944000	8950000	but I've really entertained the idea of just going out to the East Coast and flying in there into a cheap airport
8950000	8954000	and renting a car and just driving around the Northeast to all the places I wanted to go,
8954000	8959000	because I want to see people in New York City, although the idea of driving in New York City terrifies me.
8959000	8963000	I want to go to the Fun Spot Arcade that's out there. I'd love to go to P-Town.
8963000	8966000	And there's just tons of stuff I'd love to do out there.
8967000	8972000	Speaking of arcades, we had someone talking a while ago about wanting to start throwing an arcade.
8972000	8973000	I believe it was in the email.
8973000	8974000	It was in the email.
8974000	8979000	When I was 17, I managed an arcade in Kitchener for about three months.
8979000	8983000	A little word of advice from me to that guy.
8983000	8989000	You can get a lot of stuff on consignment where the guys that own the machines, just put them in your store.
8989000	8991000	You don't have to pay anything for them, but you have to give them a cut.
8991000	8992000	You know what I'm saying?
8992000	8994000	They get one quarter, you get another quarter, sort of a deal.
8994000	8999000	You can build up a lot of inventory that way without having to shell out a lot of cash, right?
8999000	9004000	Jim Salley, do you know who actually ran a very successful arcade on consignment like that?
9004000	9005000	Disneyland.
9005000	9006000	Disneyland.
9006000	9007000	Really?
9007000	9011000	Yeah, when they had the Electronica event that was going on with Tron.
9011000	9014000	A lot of those machines that were in there were from local owners.
9014000	9019000	Yeah, it's a great way too, because those local owners don't have the facility to make any money.
9019000	9022000	So for them, it's free money if you want to take the machine for a while.
9022000	9024000	That's right, especially at Disneyland of all places.
9024000	9026000	Hello, those machines got used heavily.
9026000	9029000	And in fact, they finally did.
9029000	9031000	It's like they read Disneyland fans' mind.
9031000	9036000	They kind of did this mishmash of Flynn's Arcade and Wreck-It Ralph.
9036000	9040000	And they put it in the arcade that's right next to the exit at Space Mountain.
9040000	9041000	So it kind of lives on a little bit.
9041000	9043000	There's a lot of cool stuff in there.
9043000	9044000	That's cool.
9044000	9045000	Yeah.
9045000	9046000	I'm walking around the house.
9046000	9047000	I'm looking for my dog.
9047000	9048000	My dog ran outside.
9048000	9051000	I know, I love that we're getting the tour of Jim Salley's house.
9051000	9054000	So quickly, Jim Salley, what else on your mind tonight?
9054000	9058000	I have a little delay in the podcast.
9058000	9061000	I listened to my first one and it was a little too macho.
9061000	9062000	I toned down the machoness.
9062000	9067000	But I decided I'm going to start a new one called Jim Salley's Review Review.
9067000	9069000	Jim Salley's Review Review.
9069000	9072000	Jim Salley's Reviewing Your Review.
9072000	9074000	Are you going to sing the theme song?
9074000	9077000	Yeah, I review other people's reviews.
9077000	9078000	That's pretty much how they do it.
9079000	9081000	I'm going to review other people's reviews.
9081000	9084000	Oh my God, I love it.
9084000	9085000	Did you get that, Narsagra?
9085000	9086000	Jim Salley's Review Review.
9086000	9089000	He's going to review other people's reviews.
9089000	9090000	I love it.
9090000	9092000	So it's sort of like a critique.
9092000	9093000	Yes, in a way.
9093000	9095000	It's a critique of other people's critiques.
9095000	9097000	Because some people's critiques need critiquing.
9097000	9098000	You know what I'm saying?
9098000	9102000	That's an amazing idea, Jim.
9102000	9104000	I look forward to hearing the first episode.
9105000	9110000	I'm so excited to hear that you are taking the podcasting idea to heart and really giving it a try.
9110000	9114000	I'm sure Bobby would like a quick review of my review of Saints Row IV.
9114000	9117000	He's probably recommending giving it a try.
9117000	9119000	I'm going to give you a piece of advice.
9119000	9121000	Stay away from the articles written on VoG.
9121000	9122000	Don't review those.
9122000	9125000	Oh, well there's reviews that come in Robert.
9127000	9128000	Uh oh.
9128000	9131000	Alright, Jim Salley, before I let you go, any last thoughts?
9132000	9135000	No, I just wanted to say hi to everybody today.
9135000	9136000	I really missed you guys last week.
9136000	9137000	You should have called me.
9137000	9138000	I know.
9138000	9139000	I'm sorry.
9139000	9140000	I was having so much fun at Dragon Con.
9140000	9142000	Jim Salley, I was so drunk.
9142000	9143000	Dude.
9143000	9144000	I was so drunk.
9144000	9145000	Dude.
9145000	9150000	Brad from Pod Culture had me drink things I never thought I'd drink in my life.
9150000	9151000	And it was marvelous.
9151000	9152000	Ewww.
9152000	9153000	Liquor?
9153000	9154000	Oh my god.
9154000	9156000	Stop being ridiculous.
9156000	9159000	Did you take your man with you?
9159000	9160000	I can't remember his name though.
9160000	9161000	Alan?
9161000	9162000	Did you take Alan with you?
9162000	9165000	No, Alan was not able to come because Alan, it's kind of expensive.
9165000	9166000	Alan hung out with me.
9166000	9167000	He had to work.
9167000	9168000	Yeah, Alan and Dark Sakura hung out.
9168000	9172000	Alan hung out with me and he helped me with my Skyrim and my Dragon Age stuff.
9172000	9174000	Oh yeah, that's two other games I did play.
9174000	9175000	Skyrim and Dragon Age.
9175000	9176000	Yeah, they had a girls' night.
9179000	9180000	More like an after.
9180000	9182000	And then I drank mimosas all night and played rock band.
9182000	9183000	There you go.
9183000	9184000	That's a party.
9184000	9189000	Alright, Jim Salley, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in one more call,
9189000	9190000	but thank you as always.
9190000	9191000	You macho man.
9191000	9192000	You catcher.
9192000	9193000	I'm gonna love you.
9193000	9194000	Alright, bye buddy.
9194000	9195000	I love you Jamie, you're still my number one.
9195000	9196000	You know you are.
9196000	9197000	You know.
9197000	9198000	Touching you.
9198000	9199000	I'm making hearts but you can't see it.
9199000	9200000	Touching you.
9200000	9201000	Ah, he's gonna poke me in the eye.
9201000	9202000	Alright, bye Jim Salley, bye.
9202000	9203000	Oh my god.
9203000	9204000	I love it.
9204000	9205000	Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.
9205000	9206000	O-L-R.
9206000	9207000	O-L-R.
9207000	9208000	O-L-R.
9208000	9209000	O-L-R.
9209000	9210000	O-L-R.
9210000	9211000	O-L-R.
9211000	9212000	O-L-R.
9212000	9213000	O-L-R.
9213000	9214000	O-L-R.
9214000	9215000	O-L-R.
9216000	9219000	Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.
9219000	9220000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9220000	9222000	I feel like he just poked me in the eye.
9222000	9223000	I feel dirty.
9223000	9224000	A little bit.
9224000	9225000	A little bit.
9225000	9226000	A little dirty.
9226000	9227000	A little dirty.
9227000	9228000	I kinda like it.
9228000	9230000	Oh my.
9230000	9231000	Ah, going to Twitter.
9231000	9234000	I'm trying to see if there's other stuff here on the Twitter.
9234000	9236000	I do see a tweet from Bobby Blackwolf.
9236000	9238000	I'm trying to see if it's a troll.
9238000	9240000	Oh no, it's not.
9240000	9241000	This is legit.
9241000	9244000	What he's sending us here from the website Road to VR.
9244000	9250000	Oculus Rift support confirmed coming to Slender The Arrival, which is the sequel to Slenderman,
9250000	9256000	the eight pages, which Shane got me to play that on Let's Play, and now Slender is spreading
9256000	9258000	throughout the World of Warcraft community.
9258000	9261000	Because Gemet and Syl started playing, it's like the new thing.
9261000	9265000	You know how you watch a video or something like that on YouTube, and it could be just
9265000	9270000	a random video of something, and they'll recommend other videos based on usually what you've
9270000	9271000	watched.
9271000	9276000	I had one that was a, it was a Slender game with Teletubbies in it.
9276000	9278000	It was weird.
9278000	9280000	I watched it though.
9280000	9283000	SSJ100Matt, again, one more plug for the phones to see if we get any calls.
9283000	9287000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9287000	9294000	A tweet from SSJ100Matt tweeting us about that is apparently another arcade war documentary,
9294000	9296000	a la King of Kong, on its way out.
9296000	9301000	It's called Man vs. Snake, and it's about the game Nibbler.
9301000	9303000	What?
9303000	9308000	And I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, is that the game that's like Snake on the,
9308000	9310000	you know, old school cellular phones?
9310000	9312000	And I guess Nibbler was like that.
9312000	9314000	I don't remember Nibbler in the arcades.
9314000	9317000	I remember they had Nibbles, which was on Basic.
9317000	9322000	It was the first game that had a high score table that could handle one billion plus points.
9323000	9326000	That's just ridiculous.
9326000	9328000	One billion?
9328000	9330000	Yeah, a lot.
9330000	9334000	So Man vs. Snake is running a Kickstarter campaign, which, you know, isn't that what they're all doing?
9334000	9336000	To try and get funded.
9336000	9338000	So it can be in a theater near you.
9338000	9340000	There you go.
9340000	9344000	Alright, one more call for calls, and then we'll end it if nobody else wants to call.
9344000	9348000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9348000	9355000	I should also pimp out my independent documentary about Whacking Days, also called Man vs. Snake.
9358000	9360000	Where's the sad trombone, Rob?
9360000	9362000	I'm not playing it after that. That was funny.
9366000	9368000	I like that. Man vs. Snake.
9368000	9370000	That should be the sequel.
9370000	9372000	It's more co-op, though.
9372000	9376000	That should be the sequel to, like, you know, Snakes on a Plane, you know, like Man vs. Snake.
9378000	9380000	I got nothing.
9380000	9382000	Alright, I guess nobody's calling in. How sad.
9382000	9384000	And there's our dick joke of the night.
9384000	9389000	That's alright, because my voice is starting to give out, so I think it's in all of our best interests that we wrap up the show.
9389000	9392000	No, it wasn't a dick joke. You thought that was a dick joke?
9392000	9395000	It's not a dick joke. It's a reference to The Simpsons.
9395000	9400000	Whacking Days, it's a day where they go around with sticks and they beat up snakes.
9400000	9403000	You dirty birdie. You dirty birdie.
9403000	9407000	Confirmed dark soccer is the biggest perv on the show.
9408000	9411000	That's not true, just because she may have missed that up.
9411000	9415000	I do hold the title of biggest perv on the show.
9415000	9417000	Alright, we won't challenge you for that.
9417000	9420000	That's only because your wife isn't here, because then she would be the biggest perv on the show.
9423000	9426000	Nellie is just the queen of the off-color remark.
9426000	9429000	She's great, though. We gotta get her on the show sometime.
9429000	9432000	Even though I know she hates the show, we gotta get her on it sometime.
9432000	9435000	Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange On Radio.
9435000	9440000	Thank you guys so much for joining us and inviting us into your life after our week off.
9440000	9445000	Hope we entertained you tonight. Sorry I was sick for most of it, but blame Dragon Con.
9445000	9448000	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
9448000	9454000	If you like what you heard, remember we don't ask for your money to do this show, so just help us spread the word.
9454000	9456000	Tell a friend or two or five about the show.
9456000	9462000	We really appreciate all the thumbs up on Stitcher, the five-star reviews on iTunes.
9462000	9467000	We haven't got any in a long time, so if you haven't left us a five-star review on iTunes, we really appreciate it.
9467000	9471000	And helping to spread the word. What more can we say? Thanks for the support.
9471000	9478000	And it motivates us to get our family to grow and get more input and do more shows for you guys.
9478000	9482000	Before we say goodnight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
9482000	9489000	My final thought is Alan really needs to charge his Kindle, because this thing has been sitting on the dead battery screen for like two weeks.
9489000	9493000	But I'm impressed at how long this thing can sit on a dead battery screen with no battery.
9493000	9496000	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
9496000	9503000	Um... meh. That's it.
9503000	9505000	And Loki, last but not least, your final thought?
9505000	9510000	Um... hopefully Grand Theft Auto this week.
9510000	9516000	We'll see. Could we get an early review of Grand Theft Auto 5 next week? We will see.
9516000	9519000	A+.
9519000	9521000	It's not rigged at all.
9521000	9525000	I know, Bobby's giving a C+. That's fine. No one's bitter, I guess.
9525000	9531000	Alright, tune in to find out. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again. Have a great week, everybody. Goodnight.
9546000	9561000	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
9561000	9563000	See you next week.
9576000	9594000	Thanks for watching!
