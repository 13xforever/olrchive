8254	25713	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, one of Mega Man's creators successfully kickstarts a spiritual successor, a classic fighting game becomes a MOBA, Naoki announces a new rhythm game with Capcom, and could Sony release a VR headset for the PS4?
31553	36156	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36196	38917	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
38997	44400	Here we are, episode number 518 for this September the 8th, 2013.
44460	47122	I hope you guys all had a good week off, Labor Day week.
47162	50043	We weren't here last week, but we're back to do it all again tonight.
50403	53425	Talk about video games and gaming culture and have some laughs.
53925	57167	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
57367	60249	First off, the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
60589	62010	I'm in your town raiding your fruits.
62070	62710	Yes, you are.
62771	65212	You are definitely helping out with Animal Crossing.
66333	71656	Are you impressed though that I actually, I went in when I was flying to Atlanta and cleaned up the whole town.
72157	74378	I found that Animal Crossing is a great flight game.
74839	75319	It is.
75959	83064	It's also a great, I have nothing to do so I'm going to play Animal Crossing for three hours type of game and the cat won't get off of me.
83084	84125	I'm going to play Animal Crossing.
84807	85528	DragonCon, DragonCon, DragonCon
106104	107105	TechMasterLoki
122166	122927	I don't know, I got nothing.
123047	125107	That's so after-school inspirational of you.
125528	126508	It is a little bit, isn't it?
126568	127148	How are you, Loki?
127728	128369	I'm fine.
129469	130870	Counting down the days until Grand Theft Auto?
132150	132510	Sort of.
132590	134191	Yeah, I guess.
135111	136091	Just waiting for the leak.
137812	139333	Which I'm sure it will soon enough.
141313	143014	Well, Rockstar's not shipping anything out.
143054	147956	Well, they're not shipping anything out to distribution until Friday, so...
149907	152008	Probably next weekend, I'm sure.
153229	160053	Don't know if I'll be getting mine early because the powers that be above me are kind of being anal.
162494	164515	I'm still going to do it, but we'll see.
164535	167156	I may get slapped on the wrist for that.
167597	171979	Is it like the guy who put up the YouTube today of the Xbox One and...
172259	173700	Well, see, I'm not that dumb.
174801	177083	Are they worried about early leaks and things like that?
177123	187331	They're just worried about like because they're requiring manifests of like the orders that go out and stuff just to make sure that no one's getting their product on Friday or whatever.
187791	188632	No stores.
188672	189733	I mean, I'm not a store.
189773	190173	I'm not going to.
191935	197261	I thought I already saw on Reddit or one of those sites that somebody's got the game and the disc.
197581	201626	You saw Photoshop and it was from... Well, that was a good Photoshop.
201666	203788	Gamertag Radio posted that on Twitter.
203868	204329	Oh, okay.
204589	206531	But yeah, it was a Photoshop of somebody.
206992	207492	They did that.
207572	210616	Yeah, there's no actual copies of the game out there yet.
210916	211156	Okay.
211236	211437	I mean...
212137	231123	yeah no there there are there are shippers that are out there like full palette shippers but um those are like intended for i think target walmart and stuff okay so those are out there and someone did break in the one of those to take a picture on i saw that on reddit but aside from that i don't think any copies have mysteriously vanished from those yet
232924	237427	So the retail release though is the Tuesday after this Tuesday, right?
237567	238028	Next Tuesday?
239369	239589	17th?
239889	240089	17th.
240690	242671	This week is Kingdom Hearts HD.
242711	244252	I just got my pre-order in for that today.
244873	247795	Kingdom Hearts and Puppeteer and NHL.
248334	250074	So we're getting into that time of year.
250294	253435	It's going to start ramping up with Kingdom Hearts and Grand Theft Auto.
253475	257196	Those are definitely two big things to kick off this season, right?
258016	261297	Yeah, and Kingdom Hearts is just an HD compilation.
261317	270319	But Kingdom Hearts is like, I don't know, like I'm really liking this whole square going back to some of the PS2 games and kind of making bigger and better and all that.
270699	271339	I like that idea.
272139	278023	I mean, it's kind of cool and all, but I think it's going to be more interesting to see Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XV.
280225	284528	So, I want to talk about... Gosh, there's a lot to catch up on since we were gone last week.
286109	287189	I don't even know where to begin.
288470	290712	I'm sick a little bit again, which kind of sucks.
290812	294094	I got Com Plague yet again from DragonCon.
294134	296356	I don't even know how that happens, but there you go.
297077	303608	We should probably talk about some of the things that happened last week in gaming news because it's only a three hour show so we don't have time to talk all about last week and this week.
303988	307615	So we want to do a segment we call Last Week's News Set to Holic.
310626	310966	and DarkSakura.
339220	341122	or the Nintendo Toast is kind of what it looks like.
341463	344526	But it is definitely targeted towards the younger set.
345267	348210	Seriously missed opportunity with that, I think.
348310	351153	It does not fold and it only displays images in 2D.
351213	356118	Apparently it uses one screen that's separated by the plastic in order to pull it off.
356198	359922	But it is aimed at 5 and 6 year olds per Reggie.
361179	386197	Zelda Link Between Worlds got a release date, November 22nd is the big day Wonderful 101, sales figures, not as good as it had hoped But I think it might be a little early to tell with that That's because it's on the Wii U It also hasn't released over here yet, it comes out on the 15th, one week from today But that is the news out of Japan, so there you go Let's see, I guess something else we could talk about there Um...
387578	393423	How about WayForward's Kickstarter of Shantate Half Genie Hero for Wii U?
394143	396425	That's a thing that's happening on Kickstarter from WayForward.
396665	396905	Cool.
397105	397586	There you go.
397766	399247	That's last week's news set to Holic.
399567	401609	Most of the big stuff obviously around Nintendo.
402369	404211	Loki, did you want to elaborate on the 2DS real quick?
404431	418398	Well, the thing, you know, you mentioned that it's one screen with a piece of plastic in between, and I saw some people, you know, on Ars Technica and stuff, they were showing, like, here's what we think that this should have looked like instead, being, like, a whole tablet.
418518	433366	Like, basically, just remove that plastic and leave just, like, kind of a barrier there, and have it where maybe you can have some new software that's supported by the 2DS, you know, have 2DS software that supports the whole, like, almost like a whole tablet instead of two screens.
433386	433586	Yeah.
433877	435178	Well, I don't know.
435238	438881	I'm just trying not to overthink this because you'll notice it was very intentional.
438941	440782	Nintendo did not roll this out at E3.
440863	442604	They did not even do a direct for it.
443064	443925	It's not a big deal.
443945	458877	But here's the thing is the thought is that this is where it's going to go for the next handheld system that will be a tablet with one screen because this is what they did with the Game Boy Advance SP where you had that hinge in the foldable screen and then that later showed up in the Nintendo DS.
459757	461058	I might be reading into it a lot.
461259	461879	I don't know about that.
463220	474693	And this is also Nintendo trying to... If you think about it, Nintendo the last time they did something really crazy with their hardware, aside from the 3DS being in 3D, was the Wii.
475174	477697	And since then they haven't really done too much
478537	482939	I think it's kind of, once again, the 2DS is confusing, I think, to consumers.
483679	492942	It's just, the name itself is going to confuse people because they're going to be like, well, 2DS, so I don't see any 2DS games I can buy for this.
493722	495102	I only see 3DS games.
496643	498363	I just don't think they're going to get it.
498383	505906	And also, you're saying that there's a market out there of people that have 5 and 6 year olds that actually read the small little print that's on those boxes?
505926	506046	Yeah.
506326	507267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
525504	526544	So, I like that.
526725	529085	And the print that's larger, fuck that, can't read it.
529306	534568	Oh, small print that's, you know, something that doesn't really possibly affect my, you know, kids' eyes.
534948	537049	Well, we'll read that and be scared of it.
537289	541430	I just think the 2DS is kind of a non-factor as far as we're all concerned.
541770	547152	You know, it's like that Wii that they released in Canada that didn't even have any internet functionality or what have you.
547273	547913	Like, remember that?
548613	549854	It was released with a little fanfare.
549874	551234	They did that with the PSP as well.
551274	553555	They had one with no Wi-Fi and stuff or something.
553795	581476	whatever yeah it's no big deal but I just think it's kind of weird you know why would you invest money well actually I'm glad you know if Nintendo is doing this new thing every year I'm glad that this system is a step backwards in some ways and not a step forward because I'd be I'd be kind of irritated if I had a new 3DS I'd want to buy you know so I'm kind of glad we have a year off from all this you know stuff and maybe there'll be a 3DS Uber or who knows what 2DS XL I doubt it I doubt it
581676	592846	All right, well, our chat room is lighting up, and I do want to acknowledge our live chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
593146	594207	And if you... Excuse me.
595308	599511	I still have hiccups and other horrible radio things from being sick from the con plague.
599531	600232	I got a Dragon Con.
601413	604956	If you do join us live for a live show, don't forget to join our chat room live...
606449	608051	dot VOG Network dot com.
608111	609071	I hope I make it through the show.
609932	614936	Where we have comments like Tiger Claw says that 2DS is going to screw up a lot of kids Christmas.
615217	616618	I don't know if I see the logic in that.
616718	618219	Why would that screw up a kid's Christmas?
618339	622683	That's actually perfect because I was Julian has started to read.
623484	624184	He's six years old.
624224	624805	He's in first grade.
624825	625265	He's reading.
625545	629609	He's been reading me play Animal Crossing which I've been trying not to get him to repeat Pork Sword.
630049	632251	Thank you to Queen Simia and Jet for that.
633712	635374	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
651764	653505	Yeah, and there's no hinges to break on the 2DS.
654126	658069	But it's also too big to fit in the pockets, but I think that actually might be a good thing.
658149	661172	You don't want a six-year-old fitting that stuff in their pockets and taking it to school.
662473	662834	I don't know.
662914	665977	You don't want those portable systems to be portable?
666117	675145	I'm worried I'm going to get accused of being a Nintendo defendist or whatever, but I just don't think this system is as big of a deal as Twitter made it seem to be this week.
675165	677966	Well, I'm glad that they decided that, you know, fuck it.
678006	680727	We can't create a hinge that actually won't break very easily.
680807	685448	So we're just going to make a system that's super weird looking.
687168	687548	Let's see.
688149	692510	DC Nate in chat says, iPads don't fit in pockets either and they sell just fine.
693730	698373	So talking about that maybe that type of affordability isn't necessarily a deal breaker.
699014	702456	I understand that, but who's having their kids bring iPads to fucking school?
703817	705077	Well, it's huge in college.
706038	707399	Okay, yeah, that's college.
707699	712422	But five and six-year-olds where this is actually targeted, are you really going to spend that kind of money on it?
712502	715164	Well, Dan's 12-year-old cousin, not Dan's...
716785	722767	I think it was like when Becky or Chris's relatives got a 12 year old iPhone 5.
724147	725048	What 12 year old needs that?
725388	726388	But it's a 12 year old.
726468	730770	I'm talking about a little kid that has a goddamn iPad.
732389	734211	I mean, here's the thing.
734511	745421	You're talking to kids again, and once again, the main thing was 3D, they don't really like the 3D because parents are concerned that they don't understand how to use a Switch, which is ridiculous.
745441	748444	Well, and you can actually turn off 3D and parental settings on the 3DS today.
748484	748925	Exactly.
749305	750546	Oh, oh, parental settings.
750926	753829	Well, they'll read the small print there, but they won't read the manual, so whatever.
753889	756672	Okay, so they're confused by the Switch and stuff, and...
757052	758374	Oh, that hinge is going to break.
758974	762018	What do you think is going to happen to the 2DS?
762358	763539	The kid's going to drop on the ground.
763679	766142	Oh, look, both of those fucking screens are scratched now.
767323	767944	Congratulations.
767964	774551	I just think if you don't like it, don't buy it, and this isn't going to break Nintendo's bank if this thing flops because I really don't think they're making that many of them.
774631	776894	I guess they don't care if another system flops now, don't they?
777034	784136	Well, it's... Again, they did not have the fanfare with E3 or even a Nintendo Direct or anything.
784176	785856	This was on a press release under the radar.
785956	789057	I don't think they have an expectation for this release.
789077	797860	They're just trying to put out another system to drive some more sales because Pokemans is coming out right around the corner and they have to make up for the losses of the Wii U. Because the Wii U, let's be honest...
798780	802542	Wind Waker HD, I love Wind Waker, it's not going to fucking pull that system out.
803443	816510	Mario Kart 8 is really, I know there's the Mario game as well, but I think the combo of that and Mario Kart 8 is going to be, that's going to be, and if another price drop can squeeze in when Mario Kart 8 comes out, that will really seal the deal.
816790	820012	And I'm talking, even if they can drop it just like 20 bucks, I think that would be huge.
821193	821593	We'll see.
821853	822534	I mean, we got a ways.
823175	824075	So, all right.
824135	825677	Anyhow, last week's news.
826237	826518	Done.
826638	826998	Over with.
827599	827919	Damn it.
828039	829340	Kabuki needs to move to my town.
830141	831543	One of your villagers moved to my town.
831703	833745	Yeah, I went by and saw Butch, that traitor.
834886	835867	I'm going to steal Kabuki.
836087	841232	I was really surprised because I was like, oh, he came from Normandy.
841312	842092	Oh, that's Jamie's town.
842173	844595	Oh, she's going to be pissed because this isn't the one she was trying to lose.
845174	845514	DragonCon
867245	896193	I got pulled onto a panel Monday morning at the last minute about streaming media and I got to talk about the live 365 days and everything from that to the modern Twitch TV and I had a lot of fun so I just want to say hey to anybody who I might have met doing that or the VOG Network Super Show panel which sadly didn't have the greatest turnout live but what's interesting is that apparently it had a great turnout online and we're getting good download numbers for it so I guess just a lot of you couldn't make it to DragonCon in person but I hope you enjoyed that show
896633	897714	We had a lot of fun doing it.
898736	900998	And it sounds like we're gonna be doing it again next year.
901179	903461	So I'm making my plans to go to DragonCon 2014.
903962	906565	But I had a wonderful time at DragonCon.
906605	907967	I'm gonna be honest, the first couple days...
909195	910056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
936151	937372	It's... Well, I've never been to AX.
937392	940194	A lot of AX was spread across a convention center and three hotels.
940294	940534	Is it?
940855	941815	At least it was last time I went.
942976	953044	But like, oh my gosh, just like the main floor of the Marriott, just wall-to-wall people, and then you go downstairs, there's like multi-level, and there's these different ballrooms, or there's Artist Alley, and...
953564	970514	were a room where you can walk up and meet celebrities and a board game room in the basement I think that was at the Hilton had a board game area in the basement that was huge and that's the one that had the mech systems that Bobby's talked about on his show before and you could lose track of time in there easy no windows to the outside because it's in the basement
971195	985271	and I can see how people can get stuck in there playing the wolf game or werewolf or whatever you call it till 8 in the morning which by the way was the first time I ever saw that being played live I'd played it online on DDR Freak back in the day but getting to see that playing live was a lot of fun
985891	987912	So, lots of panels.
988193	990954	I really like how DragonCon separates things into tracks.
991375	998179	And it's like, okay, Hilton 203 is going to be nothing but podcasts, unless we get a really, really big thing that might be one of the other rooms.
998439	1000980	And they had an MMO track and a video game track.
1001461	1005183	The one thing I was a little less impressed with was the digital gaming room.
1005343	1008065	Sorry, I know some people work hard to put that on, but...
1008625	1033914	just it's not I mean to be fair Dragon Con is not a video game expo it's not PAX it's not a video game show so that wasn't supposed to be their main draw but barely any console stuff to be seen it was very PC and you know there was a Smash Brothers tournament going on but that was about it like if it wasn't a tournament or some PC play that's really about it but lots of 3DS street passing to be had that's for sure
1035094	1062706	so yeah I don't know what else to say about DragonCon I had a great time it was great to just meet people that I've worked with for many years finally getting to meet Brad from PodCulture and some of his cohorts and they were very generous in getting me very drunk very quickly so thank you for that and meeting some of Bobby's friends these are people like I've heard about but haven't really met and one of his friends Sue and I hit it off really well I just love her to bits and she was giving out vodka soaked gummy bears all weekend so love her
1063266	1064207	I wanna go next year, Rob
1088627	1089507	Getting to see Travis.
1089587	1092048	You realize it's been like 10 years since I've seen Travis.
1092628	1095149	So getting to be there with him when he was doing his cosplay.
1095510	1097791	He did an amazing job as Commander Shepard.
1097811	1105014	If you guys haven't heard, him and his wife Jenna, Mark Meir, the voice of Mail Shep, renewed their vows one of the mornings.
1105214	1107775	I'm very pressed because it was a surprise.
1108075	1109436	So I wasn't told it was going to happen.
1109476	1110096	So I didn't go.
1110176	1111737	Were you all the clumped for not going?
1112257	1113918	I was a little bit like, you did what?
1114858	1115699	Why wasn't I told?
1115719	1116320	I would have got up.
1116400	1117662	I would have forced myself out of bed.
1118383	1118643	Oh well.
1119985	1120746	I had a great time.
1122047	1124388	Yeah, so I'm already planning to go back next year.
1125569	1127730	I feel bad for PAX Prime.
1129151	1132594	Apparently there was plenty of fuckery that happened in one of the panels.
1132734	1137797	I don't really want to get into that controversial issue right now because I'm sure you've all read about it.
1137817	1138858	I love fuckery panels.
1138878	1139879	Those are the best to watch.
1140899	1148284	All I'm saying is that Penny Arcade Expo, I love the vibe of Penny Arcade Expo and I still do kind of want to go to Penny Arcade East.
1150986	1154188	Some people there really need some PR help big time.
1154328	1157430	Some people there need to get their foot out of their mouth.
1158151	1160892	And it seems to be perpetual is the problem I'm starting to have.
1160932	1165695	It's like every time you think they're on the right path, it's just whoop, foot goes right back in mouth.
1165755	1166236	And it's like...
1168317	1182100	You guys are... There's a lot of good things that those guys do, but then it's like, you know, how long are we going to sit here and just, like, kind of turn the other way when there's... One of them won't stop with this running his mouth.
1183060	1183320	Anyway.
1183580	1187521	Rob, next year, if I can make it to DragonCon, by the way, we need to cosplay.
1188581	1193162	I'm already talking about cosplay with Travis, too, but I would be down... I mean, there's, like, four days of cons, so that's four cosplays.
1193782	1198405	I've actually already been working on my costume for one of the SAC anime next year.
1200427	1202148	I would like to consider going to PAX East.
1202328	1203388	Just throwing that out there.
1203408	1205690	I still would like to try and make that happen.
1206150	1206510	We'll see.
1206711	1208732	It's money at this point, you guys.
1208752	1209833	Cons be expensive.
1210173	1212835	And then they just announced GamerX2 is going to be earlier next year.
1212875	1215296	It's going to be Alan's birthday weekend in mid-July.
1215396	1217598	So there's that con to look forward to as well.
1218898	1220259	What else did I want to say about DragonCon?
1221420	1221820	I don't know.
1222060	1228443	I think I said, do you guys have questions or anybody in chat at live.vognetwork.com?
1229283	1233305	Did you notice any of the sci-fi or fantasy writers who were guests that year?
1233725	1234285	I didn't see.
1235106	1236826	I didn't really do celebrity sightings.
1236986	1240027	I didn't even go to see Kathy and Jimmy, which was the one celebrity I really wanted to see.
1240068	1240948	I kind of just skipped all that.
1241168	1243729	I know Travis ran into George Takei, the lucky fucker.
1243829	1248771	I would have totally wanted to see was it the guys from Mythbusters are over there.
1248851	1251713	They did a whole special show at the Fox Theater one night.
1252113	1254595	They did a special live show, and then they did a panel.
1254615	1255876	Yeah, it was a good time.
1256516	1260238	Oh, Bobby's mentioning the Parsec Awards.
1260419	1261519	Yes, that was a lot of fun.
1261559	1265522	We got to present at this prestigious award they do for speculative fiction casts.
1265922	1267444	DragonCon DragonCon DragonCon DragonCon
1288763	1290444	VOG got to present that award.
1290484	1293506	So we had a whole little spiel we made up like 30 minutes before the thing.
1293926	1294746	And that went pretty well.
1295247	1299049	I had an Oprah moment up on stage and pretended to be... I was not really drunk.
1299069	1299929	You gave everyone bees?
1300490	1300670	Huh?
1300730	1301590	You gave everyone bees?
1302391	1307814	No, I said something along the lines of, I wish everybody could have an award because all the indie podcasters work so hard.
1307834	1310215	And if I were Oprah, I'd say, you get an award and you get an award.
1310675	1311996	And I think I actually danced.
1312076	1314778	So you can see me all jiggling up there on stage.
1315018	1315138	So...
1315788	1316829	I'm leaving your village now.
1317489	1317889	Bye-bye.
1317929	1318729	I've already looted it.
1319070	1319430	Get out.
1320490	1320771	All right.
1321611	1327174	Okay, I think that's all I want to say on DragonCon because I know we have a lot of gaming news and other stuff we want to get into, but good time.
1327374	1328214	WoodCon again.
1329035	1329055	A++.
1331385	1336088	Let's get into our gaming weeks, I suppose it's time for.
1336668	1338229	I'm a little off after having a week off.
1338249	1339369	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1339810	1341531	What have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?
1341691	1353297	Animal Crossing, and I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV, but apparently my account was rendered inactive, so when I went to go register my collector's edition code, it created another account.
1353937	1378362	so now I have two accounts one of them with no characters and the other one with my characters on it that I can't access so I've opened a ticket I'm calling Square tomorrow hopefully get everything fixed but man they don't have their phone number anywhere on their site and I had to go look at that locate customer service website so I've got that um I played some more uh Fractal I'm super addicted to that game um I actually started DuckTales um
1380497	1393600	and uh yeah that's about it I mean I've really had a lot on my plate I had a job interview and oh no I played something else um I don't remember what it is so it's not important your turn
1394577	1397098	Alright, well, this week I didn't play a whole ton.
1397838	1399518	I did a little bit of catching up.
1399658	1402099	Well, this is even kind of including last week a little bit.
1402459	1408160	Saints Row 4, so I finished playing that kind of... I mean, I'm still... What was it?
1408220	1415842	Last night I spent a good while modding the files in there to try to unlock DLC without paying for it.
1416242	1422624	But that didn't work, so I was trying to then unlock weapons that were...
1423724	1430050	Not really weapons that you can use, but they're weapons that are in the game, kind of like some of the enemies have in some of the flashback missions and stuff.
1430611	1433353	But I didn't get that to work.
1433453	1447006	And then I was playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 4 just because I'd watch somebody do or attempt to do this kind of six-star run from one side of the map to the other.
1447826	1447967	And...
1448607	1449187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1466753	1467774	That just didn't work.
1467834	1469396	And plus, the AI is really cheap.
1469536	1476743	I mean, you jump into the water, there's no boats, and then like two seconds later, all of a sudden there's five boats, and they've run over you multiple times.
1476763	1479626	It's like, where did those boats just teleport from?
1479946	1481148	They weren't here a second ago.
1481788	1482049	So...
1484030	1485710	Yeah, I didn't really end up doing that.
1485790	1495412	So I ended up instead filming some of my... I don't know if I want to call it parkour, but like free climbing, I guess.
1495452	1502414	It's something I used to do in multiplayer because I got tired of beating everybody so badly in our multiplayer games at work.
1503034	1507695	And so I used to climb buildings and still kill them.
1508656	1514105	So I filmed some of those buildings and things that I used to climb on and I thought that'd be fun.
1514446	1517571	I have to edit it together and do some more stuff, but
1518490	1519991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1545069	1547536	That's what happens when they lay off all your friends, you know.
1549101	1550003	Bummer, wow.
1550184	1551387	All the people that I used to play with.
1552611	1553233	So what are you going to do?
1554949	1555229	That's it.
1555589	1556129	Stock them.
1556810	1557130	All right.
1558870	1559570	My gaming week.
1559730	1565972	You know, because I was at a con for several days, I didn't get to play a lot of new stuff at the con, except for one thing I'll talk about at the end.
1567152	1569053	But I did come home.
1569093	1576555	I played quite an obscene amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but I know we've talked about it to death on this show, and there's really not a lot more I can say.
1576755	1578856	I got White Mage.
1579636	1582117	I did play a couple new games on PlayStation 3.
1583277	1587602	I played Castle of Illusion, the HD remake or whatever that came out.
1588643	1591125	Did they change a lot in that game or is it just me?
1591305	1592707	Because there's like things in it.
1592787	1594349	I'm like, wait a minute, this wasn't here before.
1595169	1606521	They were saying, I was watching an interview with the creator and also the original designer and the new people and they were talking about how they actually did make some changes to make it more of a Disney film-like.
1606701	1610124	I think if you enjoyed the Genesis version enough, you probably already bought this.
1631843	1635565	One game I spent a little more time playing was a music game on PlayStation 3 called Kickbeat.
1635585	1637006	I don't know if you guys have heard of this.
1637086	1644971	It's a music game, which I haven't got to play a lot of those lately, although I also played the demo for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F, and I won it.
1644991	1646052	That was actually a lot of fun.
1646092	1647973	It reminded me of a PlayStation 2 music game.
1648474	1650695	The price is what's scaring me on that game.
1650755	1653397	I'm like, $50 for Hatsune Miku?
1653517	1653937	Really?
1654678	1655619	That's too much money.
1656079	1657880	But Kickbeat is more like $10 or $15.
1657980	1659161	I think it was $15 as a download title.
1661343	1677843	and essentially it's set up like it's a little karate thing but your buttons like X and square and circle are all laid out as up, down, left and right as they are on the pad and these little ninja dudes will come out onto the spot and that's when you kick them
1678323	1701862	and so like you'll be you know playing along to the music and you know you'll see a little ninja come out and you hit the button and it kills them but you have a little bit of warning so it's just like a different way of reading instead of notes scrolling down the screen it's little ninjas setting themselves into position and depending on the shirts they wear tell you kind of like when the beats are so like if it's a yellow it's on the on the beat if it's blue then you're gonna have half beats or third beats or
1702202	1702682	Does he duck turn?
1718638	1720360	Not quite.
1720561	1722643	He's not as fabulous as Parappa was.
1722663	1725106	I'm going to tell you what else isn't as fabulous as Parappa was.
1725526	1729892	This is completely a matter of opinion and some of you are going to disagree with me strongly on this.
1730492	1732094	I don't like the song list in the game at all.
1732635	1734297	It's a lot of hard rock music.
1735077	1739881	Some of you would like Pendulum, and those were the songs that bothered me the least, probably, in the game.
1739901	1745805	But one of them's a remix, and one of them... They're not like... What were the huge Pendulum songs?
1746005	1747146	Colors, was that their song?
1747166	1748126	Colors, yeah.
1748387	1749107	That's not in there.
1749848	1750768	It's other stuff.
1750828	1756112	It's probably Slam, or... I'm trying to think of the other one.
1756192	1760255	But it's just stuff I don't really listen to in my normal life, you know?
1760948	1786270	I liked my techno DDR stuff and all that you know so but but there are people that like that music that will be very excited about this game that it incorporates that into it and apparently if you beat the game once you can import your own music into it I'm not sure how well that's going to work because it doesn't always work very well those algorithms but I'd like to try it I'm trying to play through the game one time so I can at least try it but um
1786570	1787671	AkumaJP is sexy and I know it in there.
1787691	1788032	Very much no.
1788072	1789073	Unless you play it as your own mp3.
1806630	1808552	Marilyn Manson's The Beautiful People is in it.
1808572	1810514	That was one song I recognized.
1810574	1810855	What's that?
1811395	1812937	Boom!
1813778	1815340	Don't ask me to sing these songs.
1815400	1816201	It's terrible.
1816481	1817182	What is that band?
1817222	1817762	P.O.D.?
1817822	1818343	Is that their name?
1818743	1819524	That song's in there.
1821807	1825391	Actually, that song, a remix of that song was in Amplitude.
1825951	1826451	Oh, that's true.
1826631	1826811	Yeah.
1826991	1827432	That's true.
1828072	1828852	Alright, well, anyway.
1829292	1829993	So that's Kickbeat.
1830753	1835175	And between that and Final Fantasy, that's pretty much all I did, you know, because I was gone for a week.
1835815	1841177	However, at DragonCon, Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus Rift, after all.
1841217	1844098	He threatened not to bring it because we were all going to be too drunk to play it.
1844698	1846139	That's the perfect time to play it!
1846799	1851341	Well, I can understand, because it's a very expensive piece of hardware, and, you know, he doesn't want to fling it around.
1851381	1852281	It's over your eyes, not your mouth.
1852321	1853682	If you vomit, it's going to miss it.
1855296	1858859	Well, he didn't bring Slenderman either, so I didn't get to do the scary game.
1858879	1862021	But from what I understand, Slenderman's on injection drivers.
1862221	1863142	It's more of a hack anyway.
1864043	1874010	He did YouTube me playing it for the first time, some type of roller coaster demo that we were doing where the roller coaster, like the track, just ends up missing at one part, so your car goes flying.
1874710	1875571	I will say this.
1875931	1876072	It's...
1877172	1878974	It's an impressive piece of technology.
1879435	1880636	I was very impressed with it.
1881056	1883158	And it is exactly what you think it is.
1884159	1886661	If you haven't heard of Oculus Rift, it's a headset.
1886922	1887862	You put it on your head.
1888123	1889484	It ties to the PC right now.
1890425	1896671	And what you see is you see full 3D out the goggles, but as you turn your head, your field of vision moves.
1896991	1897752	So when you look up,
1898112	1899732	You look up, when you look down, you look down
1922879	1939957	and you can go in these rooms and you can flip the stage upside down so you kind of have that sensation of flipping upside down while you're doing it and that was a really cool little demo to do now Bobby did do some injection drivers so we could do some fun stuff like he had a Super Nintendo emulator thing so we could play Mario Kart
1940217	1941498	GameCube Emulator with F-Zero GX
1966778	1972603	So I got to play F-Zero GX on the Rift, and I'll tell you, the first time I went around a loop, that was quite the sensation.
1973143	1974284	That was something else.
1974464	1978727	Because, you know, imagine you put this thing on, you have headphones on, it's a trip.
1980329	1982971	So yeah, it's something you have to experience.
1983091	1987314	I can't explain it to you, but I will tell you, it's a pretty impressive piece of technology.
1987674	1988195	It works.
1988715	1993919	The one thing I could say about it is that it's low resolution, but it's supposed to be because it's a dev kit.
1993939	1994520	Right now, yeah.
1994560	1995881	Yeah, right now it's a dev kit.
1996381	2004930	and if I looked really closely I could actually see like the little pieces of glass or whatever that make up the RGB or whatever it is.
2005171	2011097	Like you know how like if you sit up really close to an old television you could see the little pieces of color that make up the big picture?
2011377	2013819	Yeah, you can kind of see that in the rift a little bit.
2014140	2016602	Like the RGB artificing, right?
2016762	2017463	Exactly, yeah.
2017523	2019264	But again, I'm being like super nitpicky.
2019284	2024609	Because the sensation of being able to look around and having it move with you in real time is pretty cool.
2024669	2025970	And the 3D is done very well.
2026270	2032196	The last time I played a VR game, it was at Santa Cruz, the boardwalk.
2032896	2033016	And...
2034378	2042604	It was Quake 1 and I think Duke Nukem 3D, but we played two deathmatches in that.
2043825	2048289	Yeah, that was kind of derpy because it's Quake.
2050370	2053453	You can imagine those screens were very low resolution.
2053713	2056355	It's like having two TVs in front of your eyes, but it was fun.
2056876	2057056	Yeah.
2057396	2081832	well apparently on the PC while you have the headset on Bobby could see what I was doing because it shows you on the PC it just splits the screen and left and right like what's going on in the left eye and what's going on in the right eye so he could see everything I was doing in the rift so which is cool let's see Black Wolf is in chat right now our good pal Bobby Black Wolf who tapes before us at Voices Geeks Network says the gallery air world demo was the name of the missed thing I was playing that was pretty cool
2082873	2086276	There was another demo that involved a house, but all you did was watch it.
2086556	2087817	You know what it really reminded me of?
2087857	2093423	It was the modern version of, remember all those old virtual reality demos back in the mid-90s?
2094124	2096366	I remember there was this old one where you walked around the neighborhood with a car.
2096386	2100270	They should totally have that for the Oculus Rift, like the old 90s virtual reality demos.
2100330	2101491	They probably do.
2101611	2102812	Bobby didn't show me everything.
2102852	2103493	He didn't have time.
2103553	2106556	You know what just keeps popping into my head over and over with Oculus Rift?
2106676	2107476	The Lawnmower Man.
2107536	2107837	Yes.
2107977	2108817	I was thinking of, yes.
2109037	2111118	Well, the movie, the book had nothing to do with it.
2111438	2114460	Now is the time to bring back the Lawnmower Man game or something.
2114560	2114740	Right.
2114760	2115500	That'd be kind of fun.
2115820	2119382	So, again, Oculus Rift is one of those things you just have to try it for yourself.
2119422	2125285	Like, I can't, not even a TV show could explain it to you because you have to have it on your head and try it yourself.
2126365	2127086	I will say this, too.
2127106	2127426	One other thing.
2127446	2128546	That means you have to give it head.
2128786	2130347	Well, here's the thing, Dark Sakura.
2130767	2131248	You'd hate it.
2132128	2134732	I was getting motion sick playing Borderlands 2 I can't possibly see
2148289	2152172	How somebody can have, like, a two-hour marathon gaming session with this thing.
2152633	2160218	You might get used to it or something, but I just... I really worry about the effect it may have on people.
2160338	2163861	I mean, here we are talking about, earlier in the show, Nintendo putting out a 2D system.
2163881	2164522	He had porn.
2164762	2166323	He did not share porn with you.
2166483	2167524	He didn't show me the porn!
2168144	2168284	What? !
2169505	2171706	That is not... He's making me come back next year.
2171746	2172347	That's what it is.
2172407	2174248	It's a big ploy to get me to come back next year.
2174268	2176689	That is just downright... I could have seen boobies on Oculus Rift.
2176709	2180791	That is very rude that you don't share porn with your guests.
2181211	2181732	Very rude.
2182312	2182652	Bobby.
2183372	2183673	Alright.
2184693	2187335	Well, anyway, I guess it gives me a reason to go back next year.
2187555	2190837	But the sickness thing, though, that's a legit concern I would have.
2191898	2195840	I'm really curious to see, like, what are the long-term effects this thing has?
2196201	2198082	Like, what do the warnings on this thing look like?
2198122	2199463	What do doctors think about it?
2199743	2200704	Because they are legitimate concerns.
2200724	2202345	There's bound to be epilepsy concerns.
2202465	2214313	Long-term effects, you may be immersed into the 3D world and may become a cybernetic being that will then try to take over the whole electric infrastructure and internet.
2214833	2216054	This is the start of the Matrix.
2216274	2217114	Yeah, right.
2217134	2218154	This is the start of the Matrix.
2218294	2219295	A la Lawnmower Man.
2219615	2221275	Well, when you're... I mean, it is.
2221516	2226697	I mean, remember when you get killed in the Matrix, you get killed in real life just because of the sensations or whatever?
2226758	2230319	Like, when you are going over this loop...
2230879	2231079	Bobbie!
2254138	2259687	Bobby Blackwolf is defending his choices in chat saying Rob wanted to go drink before I got to the porn.
2260048	2261109	Well, that is probably accurate.
2261169	2264996	I think booze over porn is... To be fair, that is probably accurate.
2265016	2266899	And besides that, porn is just really bad comedy.
2268939	2271421	All right, so yes, try the Oculus Rift, people.
2271521	2283130	Not that I'm going to say you have that kind of money to buy one, but I'm sure these demos are going to start to get out there more and more at other expos and so forth.
2283170	2285011	It was something you have to experience for yourself.
2285872	2290195	It very well could be the future of gaming, as we'll get into in gaming news here in a minute.
2290555	2293656	But first, some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.
2294197	2296538	Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2296798	2299999	You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2300299	2303181	We do have a quick housekeeping note here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
2303681	2310464	Something that we did announce at our DragonCon panel on Saturday was that a new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network Radio.
2310544	2311244	Yay!
2311824	2314986	And very happy to have this show on board with us.
2315046	2320088	The show is Electric Sisterhood and it's going to be debuting Tuesdays at 5pm
2320668	2321609	I'm always getting screwed up by time.
2321969	2330376	Tuesdays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern and this is really cool because it's going to lead right into Anime Jam Sessions pre-show and their live show.
2330676	2331677	Now we have a Tuesday block.
2331717	2335540	We have a Monday block, a Wednesday block, and a Tuesday block now instead of just one show on Tuesdays.
2335600	2336221	So it's pretty nice.
2336541	2337382	Have we gone up a level?
2338300	2339180	We have leveled up.
2339380	2345002	And I really like that Electric Sisterhood is very much a girl power show.
2345362	2348003	It's fronted by two sisters who live out of Boston.
2348483	2352585	And I love – obviously they have guys that they work with too.
2352625	2355766	There's the Boston Bastard Brigade, some of them that we met at E3 and so forth.
2355806	2358626	And they do a lot with EGM now and so forth.
2358706	2359987	But I just –
2360547	2362489	I am loving what we're doing here at VOG
2382881	2384042	We embrace diversity.
2384262	2384823	That is right.
2385183	2389888	We play Genesis and Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx.
2389928	2395975	And once in a while, you may catch us off the air listening to Sonic US and Japanese soundtracks.
2396015	2396455	Just saying.
2396616	2397797	No.
2397837	2397957	No.
2398337	2398958	That doesn't happen.
2401120	2401481	All right.
2402221	2402882	Ranma's in chat.
2402902	2404404	That only happens when I hook up the Sega CD.
2404824	2408727	Ranma's in chat very excited saying, East Coast run Tuesday nights on VOG Network.
2408747	2409587	Yes, I guess that is true.
2409627	2412329	It is an East Coast night Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network.
2413169	2421515	If you have a geek-centered show or you know someone that produces a geek-centered show that you think would be a good fit for the Voice Geeks Network, we are looking to add to our family even more.
2421775	2423436	You can get in touch with me, Rob, at
2423476	2424756	at vognetwork.com.
2425096	2435459	All we ask is that it be an established show because we want to make sure that the people are dedicated to their craft because so many podcasts do fizzle in the first few weeks, unfortunately.
2435519	2438219	So we want to make sure that it's already established that the folks are dedicated.
2438720	2442200	And we are a little filled up on video game shows at this point.
2442780	2446361	Electric Sisterhood also focuses on video games, although they also do tech and anime.
2446781	2447522	So they're a little bit that.
2447562	2448882	So if your show is...
2449662	2474586	primarily video games that might be a bit too much for the network right now but we have big time openings for board games as a show I want real bad we don't have anything on comics and I'd love to get a comic based show I've been trying to talk to a couple people well where is that pilot madam well you know what I need to hear from a certain somebody who lives in the Bay Area why'd you make my accent come back but you get the idea so you can contact me again rob at vog network dot com
2476826	2482789	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SPOON.
2483110	2484711	Alright, enough promotion.
2484811	2486352	Let's get into video game news.
2486432	2487452	It's what you guys are here for.
2487912	2488193	Loki!
2488873	2490814	Alright, so let's talk about promotion.
2492035	2496677	The Xbox One, they finally announced that their launch date will be the 22nd.
2497018	2504462	Also a Friday, also eight years after the Xbox 360 launch, and one week past the PlayStation 4 launch date.
2504742	2509244	and also one week before Black Friday, which is when you expect consoles are going to come out.
2509565	2510745	So I don't know.
2510805	2515748	Why were people so dead set on, oh, Xbox One's going to be the first to market and it has to be the first?
2516525	2518246	Honestly, I still think it's coming out too early.
2518286	2519586	I think that they're not going to have enough...
2537413	2538954	I almost wanted to respond back.
2538994	2540695	I'm like, it's not that impressive.
2540715	2541915	That's only two systems, buddy.
2543836	2547018	That would have been rude of me, and I did not do that.
2547258	2551460	So I thought that in my head, laughed to myself, and went back to working.
2551900	2553961	But yeah, so that is coming out there.
2554121	2556022	It's going to be launching in 13 markets.
2557003	2559964	And, you know, cool.
2559984	2561805	500 bucks, all that fun stuff.
2562885	2566088	On top of that, though, there's going to be some minor tweaks.
2566448	2572031	One, they made the announcement that they're going to be upping the processor speed a little bit.
2572111	2582538	I guess that they tested the system runs cool enough, and so now they can kick up the processor speed to 1.75 gigahertz instead of 1.6 gigahertz.
2582918	2588562	And then, of course, the CPU got boosted early in August from, was it...
2589542	2591604	From 800 to 853 MHz.
2592505	2595288	What kind of difference that's going to make, I don't think it's going to be night and day, but whatever.
2596429	2599211	So, cool, better specs.
2599311	2608159	Also, in Europe, you're going to be getting FIFA 14 with your Xbox One Day One Edition consoles.
2608579	2612501	Also, there were a few retailers in case you didn't want the FIFA.
2614401	2616382	You can also get Forza 5.
2616542	2618103	So, I believe that's separate.
2618523	2621064	Nothing like that announced yet for the U.S.
2621184	2622044	or North America.
2623825	2625525	Not sure if they're going to do anything like that.
2625886	2627906	But, I don't know.
2628006	2628687	It'd be interesting.
2630087	2634669	And then also, there was... And this is like a bunch of bullet points from different things.
2635189	2661936	so the Xbox One can support up to 8 controllers at once remember the Playstation 3 can support up to 7 and I believe there was like NBA 2K used that and I don't know maybe FIFA and that's about it and then of course Playstation 4 only 4 so you know right there people are going there you go Xbox One is going to win this generation because they support 8 controllers when have you ever had that many people over playing one video game
2662376	2663658	Well, I shouldn't say that.
2663698	2668724	There are parties and I've seen rock band nights and so forth, but that's so few and far between.
2668744	2670687	Implementation is going to be very limited.
2670847	2680139	I mean, like I said, there is only a couple, like, I swear, less than five games that probably use that seven controller configuration because they're just not going to do that.
2680459	2698164	I mean, sure, Microsoft would like you to believe that there's going to be a lot of situations that require that so you have to buy those extra controllers but I don't think that there's actually going to be you know, there's probably going to be four players like most games are going to be four players I don't think you're going to have eight people and definitely not split screen because that would be just fucking stupid
2698884	2699785	Don't get me wrong.
2699905	2700826	I think it's cool.
2701567	2708673	I'm not knocking Xbox One for having that, but I'm just saying it's not the deal-maker or breaker that some people on the internet are making out to be.
2708713	2710635	It's like, okay, neat.
2710775	2712176	Let's see what games are going to do with that.
2712276	2713237	What are games going to do with that?
2715599	2715880	We'll see.
2716820	2718582	It'd be better if you could hook up 8Kinects.
2719303	2719783	No, it would not.
2719803	2721004	TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.
2723976	2729782	All right, and then also external storage will not be supported at launch.
2729922	2743056	So the 500 gigabyte hard drive that comes in there, well, that's going to have to be enough for a while because that's all you can do with it because you're not going to be able to store stuff using the USB ports yet.
2745298	2746760	So I hope those games aren't that big.
2748370	2750573	I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.
2766132	2777888	I think that they think that the price point is still too high and that they keep trying to lure more people into buying the system Europe pays more for their systems though in games in general though, don't they?
2777968	2779911	When you convert dollars to euros and all that?
2780649	2781530	I don't fucking care about Madden.
2801425	2803427	Yeah, but a lot of fucking people care about Madden.
2803747	2804348	I understand that.
2804368	2806190	That is a pretty big deal if they do get that.
2806270	2817441	I mean, as much as I'm sitting here saying I don't think people should have an expectation about it, if they do come out and say Madden's coming out free with the Xbox One, there's going to be a lot of people that are like, oh dude, but if you get Xbox One, you get Madden.
2817742	2821185	But I still think that price difference is going to be a little like, but it's also $100 more, dude.
2821986	2848147	I think what they could do is like maybe some free live maybe or free something else yeah you know that doesn't really cost them anything like you know free like digital stuff you know maybe like a free you know you get well a killer instinct I don't know maybe that would be kind of you get killer instinct well you are getting that but then again you know it's free to play you know essentially at first demos free to play um
2849328	2849608	I don't know.
2849628	2856113	I think it seems like you get more value with the PlayStation 4 as far as PlayStation Plus because you're getting some free games with that.
2857654	2864940	Maybe if they offer some free games with gold because they're doing that games with gold thing right now with Xbox 360.
2865761	2869524	Maybe they offer something like that for the Xbox One, like one of the games.
2871165	2871465	I don't know.
2871485	2875568	I don't think it's necessary, but I think that might be something they need to do when...
2878210	2880373	and maybe that close to Black Friday.
2880393	2886540	They're going to have some retailers doing that already.
2886780	2887401	Let's move on.
2887761	2892867	This isn't necessarily console-based, at least for now, but it looks like it might end up there.
2892987	2894869	This was some huge news that came out.
2894949	2896611	It technically was the week we were off
2897051	2897671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2924464	2932593	Like, it's not... I'm not... You're not supposed to say that because, you know, oh, well, there are some differences in the way things are... It's fucking Mega Man.
2932673	2933214	It's fucking Mega Man.
2933234	2934235	It's fucking Mega Man.
2934956	2939361	It's the game people want that Capcom, for whatever reason, figured would fail.
2939982	2945107	And now Capcom's having to eat a little crow with this because this Kickstarter currently... It was funded...
2946108	2947969	I want to say within the first day.
2947989	2949390	A couple hours.
2949751	2950511	It was a couple hours.
2950551	2951672	And where is it at right now?
2952332	2953833	1.8 million.
2954354	2954854	1.8 million.
2955815	2957636	32,000 backers with 22 days to go.
2957676	2960257	Which means now we get a Linux version, a Mac version.
2960317	2960778	That's right.
2961218	2964060	A making of documentary, New Game Plus, and Turbo Mode.
2964520	2965580	Almost console versions.
2965761	2966901	Almost console versions.
2966961	2972663	If they hit 2.2 million, which they will, they're going to get PS3, 360, and Wii U versions of this game.
2972683	2976245	I'm just upset that it uses Amazon Payments, which for some reason for me is not working.
2976605	2977265	Oh, for Kickstarter?
2977285	2979186	Because this was going to take my Kickstarter virginity.
2979366	2979766	Was it?
2979886	2980566	Just hold out.
2980586	2980707	Oh, yes.
2980767	2982827	I was going to... My body was ready.
2982927	2983188	Why?
2984128	2985168	Because freaking Mega Man.
2986329	2986629	Fuck!
2988314	2988774	Fair enough.
2988794	2990235	Does that need an explanation?
2990835	2992015	But it's not Mega Man.
2992335	2993496	This is Mighty No.
2993516	2993496	9.
2994016	2994576	Do not care.
2994796	2995856	It will be Mega Man in my heart.
2995876	2998057	The art is only similar because it's the same guy.
2998077	2999457	Do not care.
2999477	3000038	Here's the thing.
3000518	3001238	I'm not backing it.
3001418	3004019	And it's not because I don't like it, but because...
3004999	3006740	I've kind of learned with Kickstarter stuff now.
3006780	3011744	It's like I put money down now and the game doesn't come out until like late next year or something.
3011784	3013185	It's like, no thanks.
3013365	3017708	I'll just keep my money now and I'll buy it when it comes out because it's going to be probably about the same price anyways.
3017768	3019469	It's $10, $15 and you put down $10 or $15 for the game now.
3019529	3020270	It's like...
3025020	3025380	Whatever.
3025940	3026281	That's it.
3026701	3031503	I've been very conservative with Kickstarter stuff, except for Video Game High School, of course.
3031803	3032803	I'll back anything they put out.
3033123	3036165	I found it very interesting in that video.
3036185	3037665	Did you guys watch the Kickstarter video?
3037685	3041007	The little five-minute, well-produced thing that had the pitch in it?
3041647	3050891	There was a very quick line, but something that really caught my attention was something about, he said, when the game he wanted to make or the game that he was making was canceled, he was devastated.
3051471	3078989	and this and I was kind of like wow so this whole like Mega Man universe thing really burned him to the point where he's gonna he's gonna make it anyway well you know it's not Mega Man but you know like this this is just so crazy to me how Capcom really just said you know what this franchise just isn't it was worth investing in anymore and now you've got 32,000 people in climbing saying yes it is
3080322	3085185	Well, you had 100,000 people that joined that Facebook group, and then more.
3085305	3087266	Yeah, but it's important to put your money where your mouth is.
3087426	3088627	That's what Kickstarter's all about, right?
3088647	3091389	I think that a lot of those people are going to put their money where their mouth is.
3091689	3092490	I think they will, too.
3092550	3097813	I think there are quite a few people like you that just don't want to participate in Kickstarter that will wait for the game to come out.
3097833	3106959	There's a lot of reasons why, especially that there's a lot of... We'll get into some of that stuff later on, but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on with Kickstarter that some of these projects aren't worth backing.
3106999	3108600	Not to say that this one is one of those, but...
3109440	3112282	It's just kind of... Is it the Ouya burn?
3112662	3113562	No, it's not the Ouya.
3113703	3117465	It's just, like, there's other projects out there.
3117605	3121727	I've gotten into some of that stuff before, but you don't have to get so far off topic.
3121787	3126870	It's just, I don't really want to... I've been very, you know, much... I'm going to put money down.
3126910	3130592	Like, I did that for Shadowrun and, like, Shadowrun Online and stuff.
3130652	3134635	And Shadowrun's awesome, and I haven't played that game since I got it.
3135075	3138537	You know, I got the game, and I'm like, cool, I have the game.
3138806	3140507	Alright, I'm going to go off and do something else now.
3140547	3141488	And like Shadowrun Online.
3141528	3141908	Cool!
3142008	3143349	I pledged for that.
3144470	3145511	And I haven't played that yet.
3145531	3148734	And there's still a few more games that I have back that haven't even come out yet.
3149454	3152817	And I just don't play them once I've paid for them.
3153766	3161407	Here's how Beck, the hero of Mega Man, which I think, isn't there supposed to be a female companion called Call?
3161847	3164668	So instead of Rock and Roll, we get Beck and Call, right?
3165208	3166648	Okay, so here's how Beck is different.
3167168	3180331	Beck takes the abilities of the enemy robots he defeats, but he uses those abilities further, transforming parts of his body, like his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields.
3180871	3181392	Thanks for watching!
3201462	3203403	I was really concerned once they called the main character Beck
3224979	3228027	But once Call came to my attention, I was totally okay with it.
3228568	3230212	I totally fucking hate that band Beck.
3231436	3232799	It's not a band, it's a person.
3232819	3233361	Whatever.
3235825	3237806	If you have two turntables and a microphone, you're banned.
3237826	3239668	That's like Alan's favorite musician.
3239688	3242290	But the Ghetto Chip Malfunction EP was really good.
3242450	3243250	It was really good.
3243390	3244671	Beck should do music for that.
3244731	3252036	Actually, no, he shouldn't because they actually have the original lady that did the Mega Man 1 music is doing the music for this.
3252277	3254458	Besides that, Beck did a lot of the music for Scott Pilgrim.
3254558	3257080	Let me pull up the... Yes, I do.
3257480	3258101	And that was great.
3258141	3263544	Let me pull up the Kickstarter real quick because... Sorry, live radio.
3263684	3264165	What can you do?
3264805	3268468	I want to actually play a little bit of this because they actually have it on the Kickstarter page.
3268868	3276814	They have some of the It's Not Mega Man, Mega Man number nine theme song by scrolling down here.
3277134	3280236	God, Lord, there's so much content on this page already.
3283219	3284179	Oh, this is terrible radio.
3284199	3284960	I'm very sorry, you guys.
3286141	3292328	And I like how he's the number nine because there were eight other bosses that he's gonna have to fight.
3292448	3301499	Manami Matsume did the soundtrack of the original Mega Man and the iconic soundtracks and she is going to be doing this game and already has the theme song out there.
3308395	3311941	You can just see the camera panning up the tall story building to this music.
3312482	3314286	Actually, I think they did that in the Kickstarter video.
3314827	3315267	Didn't they?
3315989	3316490	I think they did.
3316810	3318954	Let me fast forward a little bit so you get more of that vibe.
3331246	3332587	Totally not Mega Man.
3332647	3334028	Totally a new thing.
3334088	3334668	Totally.
3335088	3342212	You gotta admit, though, the music, the vibe with the music between the first Rockman and second one had a completely different play vibe.
3342292	3348035	It did, and I gotta be honest, my favorite music was the first Mega Man game, like the Lechman stage and Gutsman.
3348075	3349176	I mean, those are iconic to me.
3349196	3351157	I was actually a really big fan of Fireman's music.
3351257	3355299	Not that two was bad, because you had things like Bubble Man, but one was great.
3355319	3359842	I totally love those new characters that instead of having construction helmets, they have construction cones on their head.
3360482	3365688	And then also the robotic dog that looks nothing like Rush, but is Rush.
3367229	3372495	So it does look like we're totally going to see this... It's not a bad thing, but dude, it's Mega Man.
3372695	3374256	No, and I'm excited about this.
3374336	3381163	And I like the art style they're going with it, because what I like about it is that... You remember how Mega Man 9 and 10 purposefully went retro?
3381724	3383585	DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3403192	3405173	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom brings up a good point.
3406273	3415455	Manami Matsume also did some of the soundtrack for Shovel Knight, which isn't Mega Man per se, but it was very... And that Kickstarter did crazy good too.
3415696	3416636	I think I backed that one.
3416656	3417416	I did back that one.
3417456	3417736	Did I?
3418076	3419577	No, I think I just missed it, unfortunately.
3419597	3420057	I backed it.
3420317	3420597	Yeah.
3421097	3424258	I'll probably get it later when the game comes out, but...
3425658	3425838	Yeah.
3426538	3434920	Anyhow, I could talk about this further, but this game's happening, folks, and it'll at least be on Steam, but I'm hard-pressed to imagine it's not going to make it to PlayStation 3.
3434960	3439321	Are we going to get a sidekick that's going to have a sword, too, and his name will be Minus?
3439641	3440801	No, that'll be a Mighty No.
3440821	3440801	10.
3441021	3441641	Mighty No.
3441661	3441641	10.
3442821	3443221	Or whatever.
3443721	3445102	How will they call the sequels to this?
3445482	3450523	Because this isn't true, not Mega Man, unless you have Mighty No.
3450543	3451463	9 Part 2, Mighty No.
3451483	3451583	9 Part 3.
3453544	3455747	Maybe they'll do letters instead, that'll be how it differs.
3455787	3456307	MM9?
3456388	3458531	Yeah, no, Mighty No.
3458651	3460173	9B, Mighty No.
3460293	3463517	9C, I don't know, whatever.
3464619	3465941	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3466721	3467001	PS4, PS5, PS6
3492623	3499368	So it's like they're trying to get past the move aspect and really lean toward the rift.
3500208	3501289	That's what it seems like to me.
3502050	3510676	I mean, I wonder if the PS4 is going to have games that are compatible with either or both or if they're going to insist on using just their headsets.
3511377	3516043	Well, there is even a rumor still going around that Microsoft's going to go the same route.
3516103	3521670	I mean, with their leaked... Remember their whole leaked game plan or whatever you want to call it?
3524092	3527953	with Kinect and stuff and this crazy VR shit with that.
3529353	3533394	Even with the Xbox One and the tagline for it and everything, it was all accurate.
3533494	3538975	So next year we're supposed to see some of this weird shit unless it gets pushed a little bit.
3539295	3546257	I'd say next year to early 2015 we'll be hearing something about this, but I think it's the way it's going to go.
3546477	3554038	I'm telling you if a Sony executive or a Microsoft executive played the Oculus Rift, that's why they're trying to get a slice of it.
3554861	3560462	Well, I mean, and it seems like it's really just gaining a lot more speed for people developing for that kind of technology.
3560502	3562703	I mean, look who they're getting, supporting it.
3563563	3565463	Nintendo, this is your chance.
3565723	3567204	Nintendo On, remember?
3567344	3568764	Remember that whole concept video?
3569844	3579826	There is no shame in going back and saying, hey, we saw that April Fool's joke or whatever you want, pre-E3 joke, and we're going to make it happen anyways.
3579926	3580486	You know what?
3581287	3583227	We could be seeing the return of the Virtual Boy.
3584915	3586355	But it's so different.
3586555	3590396	The Virtual Boy was silly and the 3D didn't work very well and it was all one color.
3590456	3592017	The Oculus Rift is awesome.
3592197	3594037	But now the technology is there to make it work.
3594598	3607721	I mean, imagine if you had something like, say, for your DS that would play the upper screen stuff through a virtual environment or even hook up your Wii to do a virtual Wii.
3609229	3610950	Here's the thing about this.
3611310	3616292	Although I'm excited for it, I would like to see something like this happen, especially if they can make it economical.
3616453	3618494	I don't want all of gaming to go down this route.
3619254	3622616	Like, I just don't want to see the entire industry hop on this.
3623096	3624837	It's all about the VR headsets.
3624877	3626237	That's just like motion gaming.
3626257	3626958	Just like 3D?
3627498	3631480	Yeah, it's kind of like I don't want everybody to go there.
3632120	3636303	Part of that has to do with the fact, again, I don't think you can play it for as long periods of time.
3636623	3639505	You have some serious accessibility issues with a VR headset.
3639905	3643988	I mean, you know, Jamie, can you imagine if all your games were on a VR headset?
3644008	3648331	You'd probably be pissed because it's like... Well, I wouldn't buy them if they were all on a VR headset.
3648391	3650172	That's the final thing.
3650692	3658958	I would have to have something that I can play that, number one, wouldn't make me want to barf all over the house and I could use a mouse.
3658978	3659058	Okay.
3659375	3660976	And we'll always have indies.
3661196	3665679	I mean, if nothing else, we always have, you know, there'll always be people that don't want to develop for this kind of stuff.
3665699	3672504	But I'm just saying, I like this as an enhancement, not as a, this is the rest of the industry forever.
3672784	3678248	But, you know, I really do want to say that Nintendo really did give us the big idea.
3678268	3682430	I would have to say was one of the first inspirations for this type of thing.
3682851	3689235	I mean, yeah, we had those little virtual environment things before, like at QZAR, you know, where you could get in, it gave me a rotten headache.
3690116	3695363	But the Virtual Boy was the first attempt, I think, of bringing a gaming experience in a virtual environment home.
3695543	3701131	Isn't it funny that Gunpei Yokoi got so much shit over that system, but yet maybe he was just really ahead of his time?
3701744	3703865	I think that's the problem with any wise invention.
3704686	3720055	How many great technologies come out that are basically shot down because of either the technology is not caught up to it, the concept is too advanced, or people are not used... Well, in the Virtual Boys case, it was that the technology wasn't truly there.
3720175	3721936	I mean, the red was the problem.
3721956	3724318	Yeah, but the concept of that type of thing...
3725618	3733842	We've seen different types of techs come out that are basically poo-pooed because they're not commercially viable.
3734702	3736743	Just look at our energy issues right now.
3736763	3742366	We could be running on very clean energy right now if it wasn't that petroleum was so marketable.
3744366	3750209	I mean, hell, Betamax was far superior to VHS, yet look what went out.
3750612	3752833	Well, because porn went VHS for one.
3753193	3755053	Wasn't VHS the cheaper option too?
3755073	3757874	It was a little cheaper, but the better quality was the Betamax.
3757914	3762896	I mean, people are avoiding the better items because of market scare.
3764296	3765636	But I mean, yeah, you're right.
3765776	3770518	The technology wasn't there for the Virtual Boy, but it was a very advanced concept for its time.
3771518	3776561	And I think if it had waited another two years, it could have been something really great.
3776701	3778703	Or until the point that they could get full color on it.
3778723	3779783	Or until they could have done Mode 7.
3780183	3780444	Boy.
3782065	3782305	All right.
3782365	3782625	Anyhow.
3784606	3785327	Up next, Loki.
3786067	3786467	All right.
3786667	3793992	So there may be a slight delay in getting the Gaikai service for PlayStation 4 to roll out in Europe.
3794212	3797194	Apparently the problem is to issues with...
3797734	3800115	Broadband Internet Availability in Europe
3824788	3829990	And now, I guess they touched upon issues in broadband in Europe.
3830110	3837873	And during the presentation, they said that Europe is of course part of the roadmap, but the service will be deployed at some point in the future.
3839373	3843395	And for reasons outside of their control, it's been delayed.
3843955	3844135	And...
3844835	3852998	You know, it kind of makes me wonder, you know, at the same time, remember all those features they were trying to push originally with the Xbox One and stuff and having to be always connected and having broadband internet?
3853018	3865402	Man, that would have been a real big clusterfuck in Europe because if they're having issues with, you know, some decent broadband in that area, I mean, what would have made people think, you know, this other cloud stuff's going to work?
3865422	3866723	I don't know.
3868280	3872982	Well, or as you brought up when all the fuckery with Final Fantasy XIV was happening a couple weeks ago.
3873002	3874683	Oh, God, yeah.
3874723	3875803	Is that fixed now?
3875823	3877484	Yeah, it's a lot better now.
3877544	3889588	I mean, obviously, there's still issues like what DarkSakura was talking about earlier that she's having and all these other weird, isolated things, but it's not on the large scale like we were having it, but there's still pain points, if that makes sense.
3889828	3890569	Yeah.
3891649	3895871	But there is a good percentage of people who are playing like it is a normal video game at this point.
3897295	3901854	I'm still going to document what my experience with their customer service is like tomorrow.
3902239	3904360	Yeah, good luck getting through.
3904400	3906601	I've heard some nightmare stories about customer service.
3906641	3912785	But it seems that that's the only way people are getting anything to happen because they have so many tickets open and people keep reopening their ticket.
3915226	3916507	Well, anyhow, let's move on.
3916847	3921129	Something that is supposed to help you with your Xbox One experience is Smart Glass.
3921189	3927633	That's right, Smart Glass, which I kind of was thinking Microsoft might have abandoned at one point because it came out for the 360 and then...
3929614	3930134	Well, that's it.
3930995	3942542	But Smart Glass is happening on Xbox One, and there was some more information this week in an interview with Xbox Wire from Microsoft General Manager Ron Pestner, who talked about that the app will be more responsive for one.
3943203	3945824	This app will connect to the Xbox One within four seconds.
3946285	3948386	That's much faster than the 360 connects today.
3949247	3953789	Up to 16 Smart Glass devices are supposed to connect with a single Xbox One console.
3954050	3954270	Why?
3955331	3975589	8 controllers and 2 phones a person sounds plausible well no the smart glass devices would be like tablets so why would you need 16 fucking tablets or phones well I will put it I will give it this if it's supposed to be interactive with movies and second screen with that then people don't have to share one like each person could have one
3976189	3989831	or maybe it's like, you know, that somebody can be registered with the console and maybe you're talking family members too maybe, I don't know but smart glasses on phones, I think that having the 16 devices around if you have the people is not that hard to get
3991880	3999643	Anyhow, there could be the use for game controllers with this, but I don't think that's where they're actually going.
3999683	4002023	I mean, you can kind of use game control.
4002143	4006685	I mean, not game control, but you can console control with smart glass today, but it's a little eh.
4006925	4008305	That would be fantastic.
4008405	4009086	Hey, cool.
4009126	4014007	I can use on-screen digital game pads.
4014267	4016268	You know, I still have that smart glass app on my phone.
4016829	4017309	I haven't used it
4037407	4041069	That will aid players either in-game or through smart glass.
4041750	4046413	And you can actually say Xbox Help, and then the help thing will appear in the console.
4046633	4053157	But you can also do it in smart glass, where you click on the help icon, and it will show you exactly whatever it is that you want to see there.
4053957	4062783	It should be noted, though, when you do say Xbox Help, you'll see a poof of smoke, and then out from the shadows, Clippy will arrive.
4062803	4062983	Yeah.
4065507	4066567	You summon me?
4067248	4069848	It looks like you're trying to access Killer Instinct.
4070708	4072189	Choose one of these three options.
4072289	4072749	Oh, God.
4073649	4075329	I can only imagine what that's going to look like.
4076129	4084311	But, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious, like, okay, well, how is this second screen experience going to really be enhanced?
4085312	4088272	Because smart glass as it is right now is kind of, eh?
4088752	4089332	So, I don't know.
4090193	4091713	Anyhow, that's it.
4093014	4094515	Smart Glass on Xbox One.
4094876	4098940	Hopefully it will be something that doesn't fade away in a few months.
4100001	4100901	DarkSakura?
4101282	4106467	Well, there is actually some stuff going on for Microsoft in Europe right now.
4109304	4117731	So what's going on is that they have this Xbox Live Rewards thing that's going to be going on where basically you get rewards for playing new games.
4118411	4128219	As it works is that if you play a new game for more than 10 hours, a disc-based release on top of that, you get 1,000 credits every time you play a game.
4128319	4133703	Well, in the UK, that would be 67 pence.
4133823	4136145	That's like a soda, I think.
4136665	4140087	It's basically, in North America, I think it's 1,000 credits equals a dollar.
4140387	4140628	Yeah.
4141648	4148352	So, at any rate, of course, you know, the more games you play, the more rewards you get, the more points you get.
4148973	4153836	And, like, if you get up between 3,000 to 9,999, you get Contender.
4154936	4161640	And the lowest is where you just get 50 credits back on every little bit that you spend.
4161660	4163501	That would be the equivalent of 800 Microsoft points.
4164082	4164222	So...
4166169	4167570	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4185046	4186687	Here's how you earn credits in this.
4186747	4194232	Basically, you can complete an apps punch card, which I think you have to buy so many apps or something or use the apps for so long.
4194472	4196993	Is that like how when I buy 10 pink berries, I get a free one?
4197154	4197694	Something like that.
4198654	4199195	That's weird.
4199335	4202257	They have a complete My Map Pack punch card.
4202297	4205459	So if you buy so many map packs, you get 5,000 credits.
4206759	4209341	Make your first Xbox store purchase 1,250 credits.
4211162	4214664	Complete My Movies and TV Punch Card, 3,000 credits.
4215004	4216906	Take a Survey, 250 credits.
4218747	4223309	And then also see Play a New Game for 10 Hours is 1,000 credits.
4223710	4225190	Refer a Friend, 1,000 credits.
4225210	4227172	This sounds like how to get a badge in Steam.
4227452	4228152	One of those badges.
4228192	4229353	Renew membership.
4229753	4232855	What I want to know is how many fucking credits do I get on my birthday?
4232895	4234916	Because it used to be 25 cents.
4235356	4236817	So is that any better now?
4236877	4239038	Do I get 25 cents still?
4239558	4242520	Or is it like, you know, 50 cents?
4243540	4245221	Well, inflation and interest and all that.
4247172	4248514	I think it's a little bribery.
4248554	4252138	Plus, I think the playing 10 hours thing is a little excessive.
4253279	4255201	I mean, it can't be 10 hours at a time.
4255221	4258024	It has to be something that you're going to play for a couple of days and then you get your thing.
4258105	4258865	I think it's during the month.
4258885	4260567	I think it's within a month of it releasing.
4260727	4263811	If I was getting Kingdom Hearts HD on 360, that might be happening.
4264150	4264930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4287742	4292644	Actually, and I easily sunk 100 hours into Mass Effect across three months.
4293164	4294225	I should be ashamed to say.
4294285	4297727	So I would have hit this 10 hours easy when Mass Effect first came out.
4297807	4299107	I did do that in one day.
4300408	4302549	I don't want to think 10 hours isn't that ridiculous.
4303989	4305030	There is a cap, though.
4305070	4306210	I know what you can get a month.
4306250	4308651	As long as it wasn't 10 hours over and over and over and over and over again.
4308832	4311673	But yeah, 10 hours is not too hard to meet.
4312813	4314034	I know people that watch that much TV.
4315353	4343628	I think the other thing though with having that 10 hour limitation is that they basically also discourage any return time I know that like and I only know GameStops because Dan managed one their return policy was like a full refund in 7 days and not, I don't know how many people are going to get 10 hours of gameplay say it's like the average student okay, you got school all day, you have homework, you come home and then are you really going to have a lot of time to play, most of the playing is going to be done on the weekends
4344408	4347310	So that's going to cut out some of that return time right there.
4347470	4353013	That's where I see the 10 hours coming in, but at the same time, I think it's a little underhanded.
4353253	4354634	Well, it's only really 20 minutes a day.
4354654	4356675	I guess that's true.
4357075	4361237	I mean, it's 20 minutes you could be exercising or you could play some Mass Effect.
4361417	4362297	Exercise your fingers.
4362858	4368961	All right, let's travel around the world and check out what games you can sink 10 hours into this month as we look at some release dates.
4371772	4378394	Let's see, so this week we've got NHL 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4379755	4383496	On PC, the Elder Scrolls Anthology.
4383596	4388538	If you just learned about this Elder Scrolls series, you can pick up all of those games.
4389218	4391219	All the cool kids are playing this Elder Scrolls.
4391239	4392619	Exactly, Elder Scrolls.
4392739	4394720	That sounds like games for old people.
4395980	4402925	Um, Kingdom Hearts HD, uh, or 1.5 HD Remix on PlayStation 3 this week.
4403305	4405566	Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.
4405626	4412711	Uh, The Sims 3 has a, an expansion pack coming out, Sims 3 Movie Stuff.
4413831	4415332	So that's coming out this week as well.
4416153	4417654	And, um, on Vita...
4418434	4426604	Hopefully, and actually a good first person shooter now on the Vita, Killzone Mercenary coming out this week as well.
4429227	4431469	I believe that's it, I think.
4431589	4435734	Let me quickly glance over this real quick.
4435854	4437196	Didn't forget anything.
4437736	4438938	Nope, that would be it.
4439355	4441256	I think that's something that I was looking at the other day.
4469218	4491188	was it here's here's what it looks like isn't this uh no it's like a girly band never mind that's yeah this is like girly band karaoke pretty swimsuit photos yeah that's not what I think it is I was thinking of uh something else why is this labeled adventure is this like the spice world game or something who knows I don't know wait a minute that was the limited edition let me look at the regular one
4492068	4494049	The regular one, are there screenshots?
4494269	4495290	Nope, just the box art.
4496430	4500752	Pretty Japanese girls, some playing the guitar, some are getting married, whatever.
4501093	4503014	I was wondering if that was like an AKB48 thing.
4503474	4503594	No.
4504654	4509997	Max Payne 3, it goes into the classics, so that means a price reduction this week in Japan on September the 12th.
4510717	4517081	Going over to the Xbox 360, Just Air Conflicts Vietnam is the only release that is also on the 360 this week.
4518401	4519142	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4538594	4561705	on the 14th there's quite a few games because uh old Monster Hunter 4 is being released on the 3ds which is kind of a big deal uh there's a shit ton of peripherals that go with that for Monster Hunter 4 such as like you know you want a new stand for it or a sticker or pouches or what have you that is huge uh there's also a special 3ds ll coming out for Monster Hunter 4 there's a
4562405	4564026	Black version and a white version.
4564066	4565866	There's special packs that come with the game.
4566246	4567427	That is on the 14th.
4568647	4577330	So I imagine that's Japan's big release and the one that actually some people over here would probably be importing because I know some people are really into their Monster Hunter.
4578390	4581952	Sony PSP, not to be left out in the cold.
4582272	4589234	Yes, PSP, not V. Brothers Conflict Brilliant Blue in regular and limited edition this week on the PSP.
4590814	4592295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4609664	4612505	On the 12th, we have Arma 3 and NHL 14.
4613285	4623788	And on the 13th, we have I Am Alive on PC, King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, and Rayman Legends on the Vita.
4626289	4626569	That's it.
4627529	4631350	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4631980	4636781	Yes, so Steam is adding some more stuff to their trading system.
4637421	4641443	Now they have this Steam Trade Offers program.
4641843	4653106	And I guess what it allows you to do is allows, I guess, friends to suggest trade deals for inventory items, which you can accept, counter, or decline.
4654466	4657367	And I guess it's a way to negotiate deals.
4658047	4659007	Cards, maybe?
4659247	4659648	I don't know.
4659768	4662889	It would be nice if I could trade my games that I have that I don't use.
4664850	4666050	But, uh, yeah.
4666310	4667571	So, that's what they have right now.
4668311	4674593	I guess you can check out other people's inventories and so, like, if they have a card that you want or something, you can be like, hey, can I have that card?
4675233	4676594	I'll trade you my other card.
4682009	4684933	More stuff on Steam to waste your time and money.
4686135	4686936	I was very disappointed.
4686976	4689359	I didn't get a single booster pack while I was at DragonCon.
4689659	4692764	But I bet the card trading died down because the summer sale is over.
4694333	4695394	So how do you get booster packs?
4695754	4703780	I play a lot of... Once you've got the most... Let's say a game has six cards available.
4704341	4706523	Three of them will drop as you play the game.
4706623	4708924	For every 20 minutes you play the game, you get a card.
4709285	4711666	But up to half the most that's in the set.
4713208	4716991	After you've got all those drops, you're eligible for a booster pack.
4717411	4722054	So when someone else crafts a badge, somebody in the community at random will get a booster pack.
4723135	4724316	And that's how it keeps going.
4724476	4727118	So the more people craft, the more booster packs that go out.
4728159	4728519	Okay.
4728879	4732041	I guess I got all mine in Saints Row 4 because I have four cards.
4733662	4735163	Does it say that you have any left to earn?
4737325	4739086	I can't see how in Saints Row 4.
4739126	4740267	You've probably played that to death.
4741639	4743140	Yeah, I don't have any more to earn.
4743660	4745783	I have duplicates even, thank God.
4746263	4749066	Yeah, so you'll be eligible for booster packs for Saints Row 4.
4749366	4753870	But to be honest, some people trade them, but I just got to the point where I got lazy.
4754031	4758435	I sold all my duplicates in the marketplace and then bought what I wanted to make badges.
4759116	4759536	It worked.
4760757	4761178	So there you go.
4761978	4764719	Actdeft saying, I got a Team Fortress 2 booster pack yesterday.
4764820	4767301	So some people are getting them.
4768561	4768801	All right.
4769662	4773304	I got some music game news for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.
4773344	4776725	And the first game I want to talk about is a game called Cross Beats.
4777405	4785909	It's Cross X Beats, which makes me think this game is called Cross Cross Beats, which actually would make sense because guess who's making Cross Cross Beats?
4786070	4786930	Guess who the producer is?
4787410	4792092	It's Naoki Midea is actually producing this game for Capcom.
4792493	4795194	Huh.
4795234	4796555	He no longer works at Konami.
4796655	4798396	He left Konami a year ago.
4798416	4800016	Probably when they stopped making DDR.
4800357	4802678	Yeah, if you... Well, no, they're still making DDR.
4802698	4803278	In the US.
4803558	4804439	It's different producers.
4804579	4805039	But anyway...
4805599	4830687	um if you don't know who Naoki is you know we used to talk a lot about DDR back in the day and Naoki used to be the producer of DDR he did a lot of songs that were very famous that were in the game he had all these different pseudonyms that he created songs under you know he was a big driving force behind the music in the game so it goes without saying that a lot of these fans of Bamani projects in the past Naoki was still a Konami for a very long time I mean he did Dance Masters he did the um
4832047	4837868	Dance Dance Party or whatever that game was that wasn't so bad on the 360 arcade.
4838448	4839288	That was all Naoki.
4840149	4844289	So he's left Konami now and with Capcom he's going to do Cross Cross Beats.
4844729	4845710	It's an iOS game.
4845770	4847110	It's a rhythm game on iOS.
4848010	4849550	Not a lot known about the game.
4849570	4850710	We don't know when it's coming out.
4850851	4853151	Rumor is it could show up at Tokyo Game Show.
4853171	4854211	That would certainly make sense.
4854851	4858052	But it looks like the game is played with tapping, swiping, flicking...
4859252	4866434	Probably, considering it's on a touchscreen, it'll probably get some easy similarities to Elite Beat Agents and Technica and that style of play.
4866474	4871375	But I'm sure there'll be unique things that differentiate it, such as the music.
4872715	4878236	If you've been playing Monty Games for a while, you might recognize Totch is also doing some of the songs.
4878416	4884137	Void, Simon, who some think are DJ Simon, and all those guys appeared in Beatmania 2DX and the like.
4884458	4885058	That's happy news.
4885098	4885498	Over the years.
4887058	4908643	um also speaking of music games uh Theatrhythm apparently set to get a sequel Theatrhythm the Final Fantasy music game on 3DS I guess did well enough to necessitate a sequel called Final Fantasy Curtain Call no idea what this could be um but but my thought is could it maybe be that this is the fully packaged game with all the DLC um
4910124	4936805	so I wouldn't necessarily think it's a full sequel but certainly Square has enough music in their archive especially if you were to throw like Chrono Trigger and you know other Square games into the mix The Secret of Mana and Evermore and all those games you know I'm sure there would be enough music to fill up a second game but I'm wondering if Curtain Call wouldn't just be like a you know end of the year edition that packages everything and maybe a couple bonus tracks to try and sell this game all over again
4937691	4938111	SquareLikesMoney
4965735	4966517	Who doesn't like money?
4967258	4969922	Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week.
4970002	4973127	Back when games were very expensive, no matter what it was you were buying.
4974549	4975771	Because they were all in cartridges.
4977449	4981512	DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that she thinks that you kids should be playing this week.
4982233	4985235	DarkSakura, what is the expensive cartridge classic game of the week?
4985255	4988838	It's Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord for the Sega Master System.
4989139	4991841	And also, I'm sorry that I couldn't find a longer music sample.
4991961	4994303	All of the Let's Plays had freaking people talking over it.
4994623	4995324	It's fucking annoying.
4995524	4998046	I don't listen to the stupid thing to hear your voice.
4998887	4999307	I hear it.
4999647	5001389	I watch it to watch the game.
5001669	5001949	Anyway.
5002630	5006473	In Japan, it was known as Hajan no Fuin, which is Seal of the Dark Lord.
5007033	5010734	and it came out on the PC-88 and then was ported to other systems.
5011154	5013275	Like I said, we got it on the Master System over here.
5013835	5015615	It's very similar to Phantasy Star.
5015935	5022577	It has this grid-type map to show you where parts of interest are in the game.
5023577	5027258	And it also has this sort of traveling feature, it looks like.
5027338	5035240	So basically, in this game, you play the hero and you have different parts of your screen that indicate what you do in the game.
5036500	5044402	So you have to collect all these mystical weapons and the armor and defeat the bad guy named Terrarine and seal the Dark Lord around.
5045182	5049703	So each of the areas on the screen, there's four parts.
5050263	5055204	You have your stats on the lower left that also lists all your party stats.
5055905	5061306	And then on the right you have your money, your weapon, that type of thing.
5062507	5068416	You also have a kind of maze map on top that's more grid shape that shows you where you are laid out.
5068856	5071901	And then you have sort of a walking section, the upper left one.
5072321	5075946	It'll either show you the world you're walking in or the cave that you're walking in and your surroundings.
5076367	5077609	In battle it shows you your foes.
5078910	5082212	So, it is built on a grid format.
5082272	5085173	You can move around and you visit other places.
5085853	5088975	It shows you where you need to be based on white squares that are there.
5089215	5093277	And it's a pretty classic RPG.
5093357	5097779	I mean, this is one of the, I'd have to say, one of the top ones for the Master System.
5098799	5106462	You also have different types of things that happen to you in the game.
5107103	5110604	There's flame spells that you can be attacked with, sleep spells, the usual ones.
5111345	5116587	And every time you're put to sleep, you take damage, which I think is a little bit different than a lot of RPGs.
5118788	5118988	But...
5121801	5125182	It's all kinds of different strategies that you have to use to make it through the game.
5125282	5128123	And the world itself has three continents.
5128743	5130124	There's different types of land.
5130164	5131944	You have the plain, forest, mountains, and desert.
5132624	5137646	And each place, of course, has its own type of enemies that are indigenous to such land.
5138326	5139267	You've got your talents too.
5139307	5144549	You have smiths who can repair your weapons and healers and different shops.
5144689	5148371	It's typical RPG fare, but it is one of the early ones.
5150512	5152933	The game is Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord.
5153554	5155194	If you don't have it, why not?
5156035	5158316	Probably because not many people have a master system anymore.
5158716	5159436	Yeah, not anymore.
5159456	5161918	Find yourself a power-based converter.
5161958	5163478	Hook it into your Genesis.
5163498	5164019	You're good to go.
5165046	5168449	There it is, your classic game of the week for the Sega Master System, Miracle Warriors.
5169890	5171491	Nice obscure pick, DarkSakura.
5171851	5176755	That's kind of one I had to look into it a little more and I did watch some of those Let's Plays with the people talking and I was like, oh, okay.
5177215	5178456	Dungeon Buster's actually funny.
5178496	5181299	Terror in the Dark Lord who is a half-naked demoness at the end of the game.
5182920	5186082	Did you have this game on Sega Master System or was this just something you... I think I have two copies of this game.
5186162	5186683	Oh my gosh.
5186743	5188284	I was like, or is this something you came across later?
5188804	5194629	Keep in mind, Dan already had some of his games, and he came into a box of Master System games for dirt cheap.
5194929	5201234	That's why we will be doing... Actually, I was going to say, we are going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.
5202597	5205518	So I'm going to give VOG listeners first chance.
5206118	5210999	Whenever we put up an auction, I'm giving VOG listeners first go at it.
5211879	5212259	We will post it.
5212279	5213499	How are you going to do that?
5213679	5214240	Twitter, Tumblr?
5214260	5215020	All right, forums.
5215040	5215380	There you go.
5215700	5217680	So we just had Ninja Gaiden.
5217740	5222161	We actually still have Ninja Gaiden Trilogy up on eBay right now if you've got $300.
5223442	5225282	In the box, manual, mint condition.
5225542	5226262	Super rare game.
5226462	5227102	Super rare game.
5228063	5228763	But great game.
5229023	5229263	Yes.
5230507	5236431	If I knew it was going to go for that, I would have stolen the copy that I rented from my local store when I was younger.
5236451	5238733	We also have Final Fight Guy, which is probably going up soon.
5238973	5242776	We're going to take a quick break, but we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5242816	5258067	The Fugle Question of the Week, some news on a new MOBA that's based off a familiar franchise, a fan-made movie, which I'm sure will get shut down in a matter of time, Rapid Fire News, and your calls and tweets and so forth when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5264131	5273118	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, September 8th, 2013 with the 518th episode of our program.
5273678	5283125	Before we get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News, I did want to mention and thank here on the program our good buddy Jason, or VXJasonXV if you will.
5283485	5283565	What?
5301670	5303752	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5322049	5322769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki,
5342660	5343300	Thanks for watching!
5360567	5363649	So, big thanks to MidiHead.
5364190	5365591	And I don't plug him enough.
5365691	5367452	And he's still going at MidiHead.com.
5367492	5373857	I believe he does a lot of sounds and incidental stuff for actually for use for podcasting and so forth.
5373897	5378160	So if you like our intro, maybe MidiHead can do something for you for a small fee.
5378780	5385485	All right, let's get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News and a lot of stuff tonight.
5385525	5385785	Loki.
5386325	5388347	Yes, so let's see.
5389488	5399595	As I was talking about with Rob and Jimmy earlier, there was a Mass Effect texture pack for the Minecraft Xbox 360 version.
5399955	5407881	Now, not only does it kind of reskin everything, it also includes a level based off of the Mars facility.
5408661	5409482	So that's kind of cool.
5409742	5416927	And then you also get character skins along with that so you can play as your characters and create your own worlds and do all that fun stuff.
5417067	5418828	So check it out.
5418888	5422631	It's only $2, or I'm sorry, $4 is what that's available for.
5423651	5425633	Totally forgot to check that out, and I need to.
5426073	5427454	Yeah.
5427674	5428514	And then, of course...
5430560	5432001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5455875	5459859	and a wireless HDMI adapter built inside of it.
5459939	5465204	And then also these, you know, basically the same layout as the Wii U game pad.
5465625	5471550	And it's got these cartridges that plug in the top that map the signal for whatever you're playing.
5471590	5476094	So, you know, if you have an Xbox 360 version, you know, you have that.
5476175	5479618	You can play with the Xbox 360 or using your PC, I guess, with that.
5480818	5509433	and then they have a Playstation 3 one which you can sync up with the Playstation 3 or with an Ouya so they've got those and they're seeking $350,000 to begin production if you want to back one of these it would cost you $300 or $350 to actually get one of the crossplay devices which should be available I think sometime next year which for me is way too damn long for me to wait to buy something like that so I kind of wanted to make one of my own but
5509873	5515320	It's hard to find a cheap and good wireless HDMI extender.
5515841	5518404	They do exist, but it's hard to find them.
5518704	5527235	I was trying to peek in their video to see what they were using because I can see it, but they moved the camera too fast so I couldn't read what it was.
5528902	5530843	It looks cool though, so that's on Kickstarter.
5532904	5542990	And then, if you happen to like free games, there's a free remake of Ultima 4, the Commodore 64 version, that's on iOS.
5543070	5548013	And you can actually, it has a little keyboard on it and everything, and you can play the full game.
5548153	5549294	It's near 100% replica of the game.
5549314	5549374	And...
5555297	5555717	It looks neat.
5578277	5582519	Yeah, I've seen C64 emulators on iPhone already.
5583099	5584239	I don't know if it still exists.
5584419	5588981	I think so, because I think it uses a lot of free-to-play games and things that they have the rights to.
5589061	5593443	But, you know, who am I to say no to a Commodore 64 experience in my pocket?
5593923	5594103	Yes.
5595044	5601490	Speaking of in your pocket, there's a rumor going around that Infamous will be coming to the Vita, which shouldn't be a big surprise.
5601550	5602871	Infamous is huge for Sony.
5603231	5614380	We know that Second Son is going on right now, but this is because of a recent Q&A that happened where there was a Dual Shockers interview with the folks behind Infamous Second Son.
5614421	5617863	It was the director, Nate Fox, specifically, that I guess...
5619064	5626327	I got asked some question, but kind of gave a misinterpreted answer, but he said, quote, Right now we're only talking about the PS4 game.
5626668	5630789	I would love to talk to you about any Vita-related titles when or if the time comes.
5631270	5636712	That still seems a little bit noncommittal to me, but the reality is Infamous is a huge franchise for Sony.
5636752	5638893	I'm kind of thinking, of course, there's going to be something for the Vita.
5639053	5641995	Of course, even if it's not necessarily the same studio.
5642035	5643655	I mean, that's what they did with Uncharted, right?
5644076	5648578	I think that they'll have an infamous game, and I can see it coming out around the same time as Second Son, too.
5650759	5652360	Just because it would be a good tie-in.
5652620	5657663	You could, like, have, like, you take your PlayStation 4 character to, you know, that game or vice versa.
5657683	5660485	Well, I would also think they would try to do, like, the remote play or something.
5660505	5662326	They would try to tie that feature in as well.
5663146	5667507	Did you hear that Final Fantasy XIV is supposed to be getting something like that on PlayStation 4?
5667607	5670108	Not to do too tangenty, but this sounded really awesome.
5670568	5673749	They're talking about doing a remote play for the PlayStation 4 version.
5673809	5676530	It would be limited, but it would allow you to do things like crafting and stuff.
5677050	5677550	It's pretty cool.
5677870	5679631	I don't see why you couldn't play the game.
5679831	5682311	I mean, aside from being able to text chat and stuff.
5682391	5685372	Yeah, the text chat and some of the other stuff is a resource hog.
5686292	5686993	Don't text chat.
5687033	5687853	I never text chatted.
5688922	5691782	Well, I liked having the ability to chat from my phone on WoW.
5692563	5692783	True.
5692803	5693503	Doing stuff like that.
5693523	5694163	You still can, yeah.
5694343	5695143	Well, yeah.
5695203	5697463	Well, even though I don't have a subscription anymore.
5698364	5706885	But, I mean, I think that having more remote options for doing other stuff in the game, especially for things that you're trying to kill time with, I think that's actually pretty good.
5708445	5716347	Very interesting rumors coming out of Microsoft with the whole, you know, their DRM features that originally rolled out and then they were just kidding.
5716367	5718107	You guys are really mad, so we're not going to do that.
5718587	5730079	Well, according to Xbox director Albert Pinello, this ability to trade and loan digital games, which is going to be a part of this whole DRM restriction, it could return at some point.
5730880	5732902	I'm not talking about the 24-hour check-ins and all this.
5733062	5734764	Here's the quote in an interview from GameSpot.
5735184	5735404	Quote,
5741130	5745392	I believe in retrospect that people have calmed down and gone back and actually looked at what we said.
5745752	5751894	People are starting to understand, wow, they did want to actually allow me to loan and trade, which other digital ecosystems don't want to do.
5752234	5754195	And so, yeah, I think we need to do that.
5755095	5758116	I get a lot of mail saying, God, please bring back the family sharing.
5758396	5759917	We'd love to figure out how to bring that back.
5760117	5761457	I still think it was a good idea.
5761858	5768420	So kind of clinging to that idea that maybe something could come back, but I'm assuming that would not include the 24-hour check-ins, although...
5769160	5783247	as I was saying plenty of times before when this whole mess happened in the first place why not just have a separate digital license does this stuff and the disc license does this stuff done because that would make sense so silly
5785148	5787749	Peter Molyneux has his new game coming called Godus.
5788190	5790491	Not to be confused with the show at the Stardust in a famous movie.
5790791	5792331	But that's G-O-D-U-S.
5792512	5794092	Godus is the game.
5794112	5794873	Maybe it's Godus.
5795113	5795513	Godus.
5795773	5796273	Oh, I like that.
5796313	5796713	Godus.
5797914	5804717	Godus, he was talking about the royalties because the guy who opened the box, the curiosity box, gets some royalties from the game.
5804757	5805798	But it's not going to be much.
5805978	5806598	Between 1% and 5%.
5807378	5808799	They don't say exactly what it is.
5809840	5826176	GADUS will have offline play available and in his ever so eloquent style Peter Molyneux speaking with RPS Rock Paper Shotgun mentioned that if he did come out and say that the game would always be online quote this red dot would appear on my forehead and I'd be sniped to death
5827932	5837039	He does say, though, that playing online will allow for these other charming moments, such as syncing with a villager's social feed.
5837599	5839101	Isn't that what happens in Tiny Tower?
5839461	5840141	Kind of sounds like that.
5840702	5841302	He said, quote,
5852148	5862915	Gadus will be out on Steam September 13th and there will be an iPad version at the end of October and Android version soon after that and you can smoke some of the crack that Peter Molyneux is smoking himself.
5863255	5867637	No, in all reality, I do kind of want to check it out because I did like Black and White.
5867797	5873361	I liked Populous from back in the day, so I feel like I should check it out.
5873441	5875082	As soon as that kind of game would be up your alley.
5875430	5876071	Yeah, it is.
5876471	5879155	Especially when I like Civ so much and the original SimCity.
5879195	5881978	I mean, I do feel like I need to check it out.
5882479	5882899	Gadus!
5883380	5883800	Gadus.
5884841	5885222	DarkSakura.
5886327	5889609	Well, we have some Assassin's Creed news.
5889969	5898593	They basically have, for the Vita, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation is supposed to be re-released on other systems.
5898633	5905057	They're looking like PC, PSN, and Xbox Live launches, probably likely.
5905877	5908418	And also on the list was Assassin's Creed Pirates.
5909459	5909819	Excuse me.
5910359	5915502	And then Ubisoft was also going to have another tie-in for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.
5916963	5919884	So that's for Assassin's Creed fans.
5919944	5920304	Good news.
5920885	5924727	Also, EA has six to eight new IPs going on.
5925587	5929109	They are going to definitely do more sequels for The Sims.
5929169	5931250	I was watching some of the stuff on Sims 4 stuff.
5931710	5959829	as long as they fix that memory issue I might be down for that because I like some Sims Need for Speed, Battlefield, FIFA Titanfall was the only new name but they were also indicating that there's new Star Wars and Mirror's Edge 2 they are basically working on trying to take the IPs that people like and give them new life still nothing on another Mass Effect
5960174	5964436	Well, but the team behind the original Mass Effect is doing one of those new IPs, don't forget.
5964576	5964776	I know.
5965096	5965937	That means it won't suck.
5967277	5967557	Maybe.
5968238	5968858	Depends on the writing.
5969958	5981704	Anyway, and also for fans of Monster Hunter 4, in the direct that came out, there are going to be outfits available in the game for Mario, Link, and Luigi.
5982264	5987246	So if you like running around looking like other Nintendo characters, you can do it in the new Monster Hunter.
5989993	6002378	and they actually said that it appeared that in the video that they showed that the Mario and Luigi outfits were for the Mario and Luigi Dream Team outfits.
6002959	6010682	They have hammers and that the Link outfit has the Master Sword and the bow from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
6012344	6020869	Also, you can download the Mario and Luigi costumes at 7-Elevens in Japan, but 7-Elevens in America are not cool enough to do it.
6022210	6022470	The end.
6024071	6026212	Well, are we even getting Monster Hunter 4 here?
6026252	6026913	I don't think so.
6026953	6027593	Not yet.
6027753	6028133	Not yet?
6028594	6029154	Be a little while?
6029454	6030335	Probably next year.
6030535	6032016	How did the Wii U Monster Hunter sell?
6032036	6032636	Didn't it do alright?
6032676	6033917	Not good, I don't think.
6035418	6036058	That's too bad.
6037239	6040861	I don't think any Wii U titles sold well already, I mean.
6042676	6045037	But, yeah, probably not good.
6045657	6047458	Alright, we're going to get to the Fugo question of the week.
6047478	6051459	I just want to address real quickly, though, because some people in chat were asking if I'm okay.
6051479	6054179	Yeah, I'm recovering from Con Crud, the sequel.
6055000	6061102	When I got back from Dragon Con, I felt fine for a couple days, but probably around Thursday it really started to hit me.
6062062	6065163	Unlike the Con Crud I got at GamerX, this one didn't come with a fever.
6065503	6069304	So I haven't had high temperatures, but definitely the coughing, the snifflies, and
6070124	6081851	all that crap so if I'm sounding a little under out of it tonight that is why so I apologize that kind of stuff is really not a radio guy's best friend but what can you do let's go to the fugal question of the week
6089758	6093820	Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together, you get FOOGLE!
6094320	6097001	And tonight's FOOGLE question of the week is about the Mighty No.
6097201	6097802	9 Kickstarter.
6098142	6098942	Don't call it Mega Man.
6099302	6102164	We talked about it earlier in the show, and here's the question we asked.
6102224	6107726	Quite plainly, tell us if you backed the Kickstarter, or plan to, or not, and why.
6108266	6111648	We just kind of wanted to know where you guys' heads were at with this.
6112328	6117271	Red Entertainment responded on Google+, and said, "...no, due to my pursuit of Project Buy a House."
6118351	6121632	Actdeft said, I'm definitely backing this Kickstarter when I get the money.
6122132	6124912	I want to do $175 for the plushie tier.
6125693	6129553	And well, Inafune wants to give what Mega Man fans want, and I support that.
6129873	6132994	And there's an all-star team behind it, so I do have high hopes for it.
6133594	6135915	There's a yes and a no from Google+.
6136535	6138335	Let's go over to Fugle.
6139476	6140436	Excuse me, Facebook.
6140856	6141476	Part of Fugle.
6142796	6144257	I apologize for the Facebook noises.
6144297	6145477	I really thought I turned those off.
6147218	6148579	and DarkSakura.com.
6166933	6172701	Elliot B says, considering the talent involved, I reckon this particular Kickstarter is more likely to bear fruit than most.
6173161	6178048	That said, I never really got quite the appeal of Mega Man, so I guess I'll pass.
6178608	6179630	That's kind of surprising.
6180834	6182395	Well, I mean, I shouldn't say it that way.
6182435	6185757	I mean, some people just don't like certain games that may be popular otherwise.
6185837	6190179	But I find that interesting that he's like, yeah, it's a bunch of talented people, but not my type of game.
6192060	6195422	Mason D said, HD 2D art, the track record of the people involved.
6195482	6196363	It seemed like a no brainer.
6197304	6200905	BumbleD said, I'm going to pre-order the digital copy of the game this weekend.
6201186	6205187	It reminded me how much time I killed playing Mega Man 1 through 6 back in the NES days.
6205567	6209469	I recently bought the Mega Man X collection just to resharpen my skills for when this comes out.
6210649	6215611	Burr replied on Facebook and said, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I knew it would succeed anyway.
6216031	6218892	I try to back things that need the push over the finish line.
6219252	6222874	In this case, I can sit back and wait to see the reviews before taking the plunge.
6223394	6224134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6240436	6240936	Interesting.
6242417	6246699	Critical Myth says, No, but I prefer to get opinions on the final product first.
6246999	6251542	There have been plenty of great ideas that wound up having poor execution or unforeseen roadblocks.
6252182	6254283	Ragenator says, Nope, just because.
6255684	6258725	Daniel S replied and said, I haven't heard of this until just now.
6259205	6261226	And then said, Dude, this looks amazeballs.
6261587	6263968	A little bit Mega Man and a little bit Metabots?
6264268	6264648	I'm in.
6264888	6268030	Also, screw Capcom for not letting Inafune make Mega Man games.
6269585	6272786	Here's something to think about, though, just to kind of go off of that point a little bit.
6274247	6281589	Since you're really excited about how it looks, something to consider is, if he had been able to make a new Mega Man game, would we have got this?
6282429	6283970	And could this be better?
6284994	6285715	Just something to think about.
6286516	6294784	Monty Boggs replied on Facebook and said, Yes, he backed it because I wanted to see the Mega Man games evolve and I want them to achieve the stretch goal and put it on consoles.
6295204	6299368	This should also show Capcom that people want these games and they've been dropping the ball.
6299488	6301671	Otherwise, this Kickstarter wouldn't exist or succeed.
6302572	6307256	Ryan B replied and said, No, he didn't back it, though I do want to because I'm poor.
6308605	6313393	HitStun replied and said, this could be the project that finally gets me to create a Kickstarter account.
6313793	6316818	I want the game to be good, but I'm on the fence about throwing money at it.
6317158	6320463	I typically don't buy a game until I see the finished product in motion.
6320864	6323608	So there's the answers from Facebook and Google+.
6324569	6350327	and I think you pretty much heard what we had to say about it earlier but it was I thought we would see a lot more of yes I was throwing my money at it I was rubbing my credit card at the screen but I found that there's a lot more of you out there that are like kind of like yeah we'll wait and see when the finished game's out I'll wait for the reviews I'll check it out then they don't need my money right now I'll give it to them later so I was kind of surprised by that but in a good way so there you go our fugal question of the week
6351212	6353033	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6366483	6367344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6385554	6390897	Who has an HD projector attached to the ceiling and an extra Kinect sensor attached to that.
6391077	6393098	It's just not going to work.
6393918	6402982	Unfortunately, they said, it's very, very cool tech, but for a consumer, it requires a projector and things.
6403282	6407544	It's really super neat if you're in the lab and you've got Microsoft money and you can set this up.
6408104	6425295	but we looked at it for an average consumer it's like thousands of dollars so unfortunately it's not going to go beyond proof of concept I say right now but I think later on maybe when that technology comes down in price a lot maybe like in three four years we might see something like that
6425475	6426355	XBOX 37 You'll buy them all in a row
6455122	6473758	They stack up in a row to create a giant Voltron Alright, well for those of you that are upgrading to a new Xbox Maybe you'll be happy about these programs And we touched on this a little bit in the last show But now some more details coming out about Who is going to allow you to upgrade to your Xbox One games cheaply
6474198	6479704	Best Buy is going to be rolling out a program that will offer $10 next-gen upgrades.
6480065	6482507	GameStop and Amazon already had these programs in place.
6483268	6490356	Eligible games include FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Call of Duty, Ghosts, Battlefield 4, and Watch Dogs.
6491117	6492038	This is interesting, though.
6493248	6501738	What you have to do, if you purchase one of the games within a set period after its release, you'll be given a $10 coupon to put towards the Xbox One incarnation.
6502299	6510789	When you want to upgrade, you do the coupon and the game, and then Best Buy gives you $40 credit, reducing the final cost of the Xbox One game to $10.
6512050	6513312	So it's this whole...
6514133	6514913	It seems weird.
6514954	6516175	I suppose you could do it that way.
6516195	6516455	I don't know.
6516475	6517356	That just seems confusing.
6531161	6533703	Well, but then it says towards the game's Xbox One incarnation.
6533963	6534303	I don't know.
6534363	6534664	Whatever.
6534684	6539027	What if I'm upgrading from, say, like... How many people is this really going to affect?
6539247	6544551	I mean, if it's only for a certain period of time, either you're buying the one this year or you're not.
6544871	6554999	What if I wanted to upgrade from, say, like, you know, I don't know, Disney Planes to, like, say, Rise.
6555219	6557561	Is that an upgrade that I can do?
6557581	6558761	I don't think you can do that, Loki.
6558781	6559342	I'm sorry to say.
6559702	6565186	What about like, you know, I don't know, Ben 10 Galactic Racing to Forza 5?
6565266	6566927	Because that's technically an upgrade.
6566987	6567908	It's still driving.
6568148	6572131	Alright, look, I just wanted to add that the Microsoft store is doing this deal as well.
6572191	6575993	They will also be doing Xbox One games for $10 when you trade in 360 copies.
6577594	6603635	The titles include NFL Madden 25, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed Rivals, Call of Duty Ghosts, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag All you have to do for this one, you bring the game to a Microsoft store and you get the Xbox One copy for $10 Just throwing it out there, Watch Dogs, not apparently on the list for the Microsoft store So if you're going to be participating in these programs for whatever reason, you better look at what games what stores are taking
6604475	6607118	But now you have, what, three, four options?
6607479	6609661	GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft Store.
6609781	6611023	I have one word for the whole thing.
6611163	6611383	What?
6611724	6613125	Blah.
6613546	6617030	Well, yeah, my whole thing is like either you're getting the one this year or you're not.
6617070	6620714	If this program continues into next year, all right, well, then I get it.
6620874	6627243	Yeah, but if it's such a small window, just maybe, I don't know, here's a thought, wait a little bit.
6627443	6634513	Like, for example, if Grand Theft Auto V, okay, no, that's a bad example, because I wouldn't be able to wait for Grand Theft Auto V.
6635020	6635620	Thanks for watching!
6655308	6659671	It's even worse when they're talking about Assassin's Creed that's literally coming out a month before.
6660431	6668015	Just wait and just pay the same amount of money that you would have bought the current gen version for.
6669396	6672157	Alright, let's move on with some new game news.
6672257	6672918	Right, DarkSakura?
6673778	6675319	Yes, we do have some new game news.
6675499	6681982	Hey, DungeonBuster just said actually in chat that Shamestop dropped the price for Xenoblade down to $65.00.
6683419	6684621	What a deal!
6684641	6693452	$65, that's still... You're telling me nobody was buying it for $90 because they were just all downloading it from the internet?
6693592	6693833	I mean...
6696450	6700953	There's a new Battle Arena game online and it's King of Fighters.
6702434	6702894	Very weird.
6703755	6708658	It's actually in a closed beta in Thailand and I hate Destructoid.
6709098	6709358	Sorry.
6710139	6710719	On my tablet.
6710759	6711600	I hate it on my tablet.
6711820	6712521	I like the site.
6712541	6713421	I hate it on my tablet.
6713521	6715643	Fix your tablet version.
6715723	6716243	Seriously.
6717024	6718785	And yeah, it's a MOBA.
6719454	6721856	Kyo Iori, Joe Griffin, and Terry Dragonfly
6739645	6746369	It's kind of cute in a way because, you know, you look at a game like League of Legends, it's all about the heroes, and you have to select one of the heroes, right?
6746429	6747610	Or the stupid Marvel game.
6747690	6750011	A fighting game lends itself very well to that.
6750271	6750431	Yeah.
6750451	6754814	Well, the Marvel game's more like a Diablo dungeon crawler than it is a MOBA.
6755314	6782789	it's not all that fun MOBA is a very kind of growing genre of games though you know you have League of Legends then you have Dota is the other big one and now you've seen some more pop up like the Heroes of New Earth is one and you know there's more and more so because League of Legends does very well lots and lots of people play in that game or have played it at some point as long as they've changed their passwords now remember they were going after old data so the password could be used other places that is very true be careful
6784350	6801644	So wow, I wish I could try this out at least, but just have to wait for it to float its way over here from Thailand Oh well Through the inner tubes, through unofficial translation patches The same way the rest of us played Ragnarok back in the day Who would be your hero in a King of Fighters MOBA?
6802065	6805628	It'd be Leona That's who I play every time I play the damn game
6806229	6810351	Mine would have to be Kim Capuan, because that's who I loved in the game.
6810612	6811412	Or, of course, Mai.
6811632	6812533	Yeah, what is your dream team?
6812573	6813353	That was always my team.
6814114	6814494	Of three?
6814734	6815554	Yeah.
6815855	6816375	And a striker.
6816975	6822038	Kim Capuan, Mai, and Joe Higashi.
6822238	6822979	Who would be your striker?
6825440	6825780	I forget.
6825820	6826961	Who are the strikers?
6827401	6829062	You can pick any character as a striker.
6830283	6831464	Because you're a call-in person.
6833265	6833825	I'm thinking...
6839375	6839756	I don't know.
6840657	6842719	I always think about... Answer hazy.
6842739	6843640	Try again later.
6843720	6845822	I always go back to CVS and think about that.
6849105	6849706	Shit, I don't know.
6849806	6850426	Andy Bogard.
6851247	6851788	I liked Andy.
6852068	6857253	My team was always Leona, Mai, and Athena.
6858014	6859015	Of course, a girl power team.
6859804	6862165	or Yuri with one of them, the other ones being a striker.
6862706	6865968	So I would go between, because Yuri had the flying butt attack.
6866368	6867749	Was King in King of Fighters?
6867829	6869110	Yes, King was in King of Fighters.
6869130	6869870	That would be my striker.
6869890	6870430	I liked King.
6870671	6871351	King was awesome.
6871511	6871711	Yeah.
6874553	6874853	All right.
6874873	6875493	What about you, Loki?
6876054	6876654	I never played the game.
6877154	6877315	See?
6877475	6877655	What?
6878275	6880597	It was free on PlayStation Plus, one of the newer ones.
6881217	6882398	So I checked it out a while back.
6882838	6883098	Anyway.
6885459	6886160	Loki, what do you got for us?
6886846	6891629	All right, so I've got some Kickstarter information.
6892190	6895992	It's kind of a combination of Kickstarter and Ouya.
6896953	6902957	So Ouya's got this, I don't know what you'd call it, campaign that they're doing right now called the Free the Games campaign.
6903397	6914563	Basically, they're offering a million dollars, or they have this million dollar fund that they are matching Kickstarter, or Kickstarted games for the Ouya.
6915763	6917144	They're matching them up to, I think, $50,000.
6917264	6920846	Might be more than that.
6921526	6922747	But basically, the...
6923647	6927089	Stipulations are that the game has to be exclusively for the Ouya.
6927650	6929511	It has to have a minimum goal of $50,000.
6929631	6934274	And I think that... I want to say that $50,000 might have been the...
6940487	6941748	I think it actually goes up from there.
6941768	6945289	I think $50,000 is not the cap on that.
6945329	6947009	But anyway, so they're going to match funding.
6947570	6951191	Well, two games so far have reached their funding targets.
6951791	6956953	This game called Gridiron Thunder and Elementary My Dear Homes.
6957713	6959834	Well, there's a little bit of a problem with that.
6960734	6963035	The two games, as a lot of people were kind of looking at...
6963735	6964115	DarkSakura.com
6986773	6987394	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7004455	7009779	They earned $40,000 or something on it, and that was a little fishy.
7010139	7020726	Basically, the thought is, okay, so there's a guy who creates a Kickstarter, has people back it or whatever, OUYA matches that, and then they take the money and run.
7021506	7023268	Well, it's even gone further.
7023468	7033454	Elementary, my dear homes, had a bunch of fake, or I should say, made-up people that were one-time backers that were backing this project,
7034796	7043187	Made up characters, celebrities, a person that's been kidnapped, and just all sorts of weird stuff.
7043608	7050638	Is that interference from people related to the game, or is that like a 4chan prank?
7051158	7051378	I got it.
7069983	7070723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7089993	7095118	So, however, the Elementary My Dear Homes has been suspended.
7095859	7105869	It hit its funding goal of $50,000 and it was currently at $58,770 and it's been suspended because of suspicious accounts.
7107371	7107471	Um...
7109150	7130349	so yeah so it sounds like you know they were trying to scam it and there's a lot of conspiracy theories about it they're saying well it's I'm not so sure about the elementary my dear homes one but the other one that we is actually kicking money in there because they want to make it look like these games are being successful and stuff and I don't know it's weird but
7131621	7132742	Well, speaking of internet scams...
7156078	7157499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7174668	7175749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7194788	7202410	The date that that game was supposed to be released came and gone and no real updates and they've kind of all disappeared.
7202871	7205431	So once again, people called it a scam.
7205451	7206572	They got called out.
7207032	7208412	The creators called them trolls.
7208972	7221136	All the internet people that ran it, Kotaku and some other ones, defended the Kickstarter people and said, oh yeah, all those people that are ganging up against that nine-year-old, they're just trolling them and stuff like that.
7221556	7224197	Well, are they out here now to say that
7225097	7227418	Well, maybe they were right because they didn't come up with anything.
7229139	7230779	No, because it failing isn't newsworthy.
7231840	7232460	No, it didn't fail.
7232600	7233280	They succeeded.
7233360	7236981	I mean, sorry, it failing to produce isn't newsworthy.
7237061	7241643	Yes, so basically she got $28,000 for doing nothing.
7244804	7245244	Wow.
7246325	7250486	Well, hope it pays for college and not for trips to Tahiti.
7251827	7253188	I want someone to pay for my college.
7253609	7254269	Wouldn't that be nice?
7254289	7254790	Yeah, really.
7254890	7258693	I want someone to pay for me to get additional classes in my profession.
7258713	7259174	That would be nice.
7259754	7260015	All right.
7260835	7262136	Let's move on with another story.
7262156	7268182	Well, somebody's going to be getting a lot of money, and I wouldn't mind having $15 million in damages.
7268842	7273367	And that is a lawsuit with Microsoft versus Motorola Mobility.
7273687	7277010	This is a long-running lawsuit surrounding patent infringement.
7277370	7279310	Jury ruled in favor of Microsoft.
7303936	7308718	because Motorola was not providing the patent licenses for fair and reasonable terms.
7309078	7311219	This is why Microsoft got the damages.
7311839	7315140	I can't imagine that this is going to be over by any stretch of the imagination.
7315180	7316760	Is this shit going to go to the Supreme Court?
7316920	7317661	Is that what's going to happen?
7318721	7320283	I'm really surprised the two didn't settle.
7320544	7321885	That's what always happens in this shit.
7321905	7322806	There's always a settlement.
7322846	7331417	But yeah, I went to jury and the jury awarded it to Microsoft saying that nope, it's Motorola's fault because they weren't allowing Microsoft to have it reasonably.
7332559	7334061	I'm sure this is not the last of it.
7334995	7335936	No, probably not.
7335956	7342721	I think, you know, in some cases, trying to push things through to an actual jury trial is a way to set a precedent.
7343121	7343322	Yeah.
7343662	7343862	So.
7344763	7345023	All right.
7345463	7350427	Well, we're going to allow you to set some precedents on our show right now with the emails that you send us.
7350527	7356412	Every week you guys send us mailbags, or not, to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7356452	7357473	Bags of mails?
7357633	7358473	Ooh, no.
7358493	7363017	So DarkSakura's going to jump in the mailbag and see the flood of email awaiting us tonight.
7363277	7367219	More like the drippy one.
7367319	7368759	In the two weeks we were off.
7369880	7371040	Yeah, we got one email.
7371740	7376462	And I'm saying drippy not because of the person, but because it's like drip, drip, drip.
7377002	7380744	You opened the bag to dump it out and one little email came floating down.
7381684	7383104	Hi, everyone at OLR.
7383124	7383525	Hi.
7386226	7386486	Rob.
7386846	7386986	What?
7387026	7388807	The listeners say hi, I gotta say hi back.
7388827	7391908	So you paraphrase Final Fantasy 7 since you love it so much?
7392890	7395253	Sit your ass down in that chair and eat your goddamn Ricola.
7397557	7398318	Hearts, hearts.
7399720	7401602	I actually came with like a bucket of Ricolas.
7402283	7403365	I'm actually very thankful.
7405086	7406707	It's your favorite person in the whole world.
7407728	7408869	He did a face.
7409749	7410310	Ragenator.
7411230	7418856	As you probably remember, Sony officially retired the PS2 earlier this year after a 12-year... Well, he said ear run, but I think he means ear.
7420237	7430705	I think it's safe to say that in terms of last-gen systems, the PS2 was a leading favorite and most people had it, either as a primary console or a secondary or even just as a DVD player that just so happened to play games.
7431505	7435706	All that being said, I'd like to pose a question to the three of you and to the chat room as well.
7436067	7440128	Those of you who had a PS2, do you have any fond memories revolving around the PS2?
7440248	7441308	And if so, what were they?
7441688	7444269	Getting my JPS2 and playing the hell out of Beatmania 2DX?
7444309	7445470	You stole my damn answer.
7445510	7451972	I would say getting the Japanese PlayStation 2, which I owned before a US PlayStation 2, and playing the shit out of Beatmania 2DX.
7452972	7453272	Bam.
7453472	7453912	Fist bump.
7454112	7454313	Yep.
7455193	7456473	Loki, PlayStation 2 memories?
7458414	7458514	Uh...
7460579	7467564	My HD loader in the... Actually, I'd say... When was the first thing I got on PlayStation 2?
7468185	7469265	Well, I got Armored Core.
7469305	7470866	It was one of my first games on there.
7470906	7477131	I'd say probably like... Grand Theft Auto... Well, that was PlayStation 1.
7477991	7479132	No, that was PlayStation 2.
7479372	7480213	Grand Theft Auto 3?
7480373	7482635	Yeah, Vice City and all that was PlayStation 2.
7483015	7483215	Yeah.
7483255	7484216	Yeah.
7486366	7486806	Don't die.
7487127	7491690	Also, playing music games online with DDR and Amplitude was good times.
7491730	7492671	You know what I did like?
7493331	7499576	Not having to do the button trick every time I wanted to put in that pen CD for Beatmania.
7500597	7503860	So it was actually a way to play my old 5-key Beatmania stuff.
7506261	7511124	I also just had, well, you know how many import PlayStation 1 games I had.
7511545	7513766	It was nice not having to rely on a separate device.
7513806	7516388	We'd just have to change the plugs and bam, there it was, you know.
7517409	7527756	But, yeah, I really have to say I had a lot, even though I still laugh my ass off to this day with the Dreamcast vs. PS2 video that was online.
7529036	7530277	What a disappointment video.
7530717	7531338	You remember that one?
7531438	7531698	I do.
7531778	7534060	You've done just a cookie here on the show before, yeah.
7535260	7536580	So, um, moving on.
7537541	7541881	Now, as a secondary closing topic, I'd like to get some information from you three, if possible.
7542221	7543362	Well, that's what we do a show for.
7543442	7543882	We charge.
7544882	7545562	By the hour.
7545862	7558124	Now, I've been mulling over some notion of starting my own business, specifically an arcade that primarily focuses on games, spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, with a few music games like DDR thrown in for good measure.
7558584	7563585	For a good ten years now, the main hurdle is that I know virtually nothing about the subject of starting up and running a business.
7564245	7578159	I know that there are some basics like having to lease retail space, pay for utilities, needing to incorporate the business, possibly filing for either loans and or grants, buying necessities for the business in case of PC for business purposes, and of course the arcade games.
7578659	7580101	But that's the extent of what I know.
7580261	7583124	That being said, what advice can you give regarding this?
7583644	7588066	and yes, I know that arcades are pretty much dead but I'm confident that I can make this work.
7588146	7592408	Any info that you have would be provided would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.
7592728	7594969	This email is brought to you by Mr. Hanky the Christmas Pooh.
7595089	7596030	Howdy ho!
7597384	7600345	I will give some very blunt, frank advice with the whole business.
7600505	7604026	I've never started a business, so I honestly couldn't tell you like some insider secret.
7604386	7604547	Huh?
7604647	7605067	We've run one.
7605607	7606127	Dan and I have.
7606227	7607788	Well, this is my advice.
7607868	7609248	Maybe you will agree or you won't agree.
7609788	7614230	My advice is you need to take a class or read a book on starting your own business.
7614350	7618491	And if you don't have the time to do that or the money to do that, then you don't have the time or the money to start your own business.
7618671	7619052	Exactly.
7619692	7620292	That being said...
7622524	7638502	Dan went into business with the lady that used to be one of the owners of Video Game Swappers locally here and so in that case there was already the space, there was already the inventory we put up a lot of our own games too all of our Dragon Ball Z figures, my old manga we sold a lot of our own stuff
7639823	7649231	The big thing is that if you've got the space and the stuff and that you need to get the business license and before you need the business license, you need to look up what the local laws are.
7649491	7653554	You need to make sure that you don't have to have just a county business license.
7653855	7656857	You may have to have a city license.
7657638	7661081	For me as a massage therapist, I had to have a county and city license.
7661721	7663363	In some cases, you need a state license.
7663983	7666404	So, like I said, I've been on multiple sides of this.
7667584	7668284	I agree with Rob.
7668364	7669745	You should really take a business class.
7669905	7672746	In some cases, a lot of it is fairly common sense.
7673386	7676887	You know, you can figure it out if you've got that kind of logical mind.
7677847	7684489	But you really do need to know the legalities of it before you remotely put down any money, before you remotely look for any sponsors.
7684509	7691031	We're still trying to start VOG as a legitimate business so we can do some of these things like sell t-shirts and some of the other things you guys have been asking for.
7691071	7692392	And it's not easy.
7692412	7692632	Yeah.
7693533	7694654	to make sure we do it right.
7694834	7699660	Especially in our case, we're looking at a multinational type of thing.
7701122	7702303	It's a lot of stuff that goes into it.
7702984	7708270	But you're going to have to have your fictitious name for your business.
7709071	7712655	It's the name that goes on your business license and then it is registered to you.
7713576	7729664	from that point on any of your accounts are going to be registered in that fictitious name being your bank account being any savings associated with it being paying your taxes you're going to need an accountant that's for damn sure it's a lot of money that goes into running a business and I don't suggest doing it by yourself
7731080	7732341	Yeah, that's great advice too.
7732421	7733242	Find a business partner.
7734322	7736324	And just be careful with that idea.
7736344	7738205	A lot of people lose a lot of money on that.
7738345	7740587	Arcades are dying and you're not going to save them alone.
7741067	7743929	But if you have a good idea, you never know what might happen.
7745130	7748152	What's going to be the thing that draws people to your arcade when they can play games at home?
7748352	7750273	Is that going to be that you do kick-ass birthday parties?
7750633	7751614	Do you sell booze?
7752515	7754036	That's what Dave and Buster's do.
7754056	7756017	Well, that's what a lot of these retro arcades do.
7756357	7765268	Well, the other thing to also, and this just occurred to me too, is that especially in regards to... I forgot what I was going to say.
7766009	7775300	Because I know it's a big thing too, is you need to make sure that not only do you check with the legality behind it, you also check with...
7776181	7783225	Not just the legality behind getting the license, but the legalities around how you handle your money with the place.
7783885	7791129	Keep in mind that I think the rule of thumb is that any business is expected to lose money in its first five years before it turns a profit.
7792249	7809769	also check with your local you know wherever you have to register through there are first time business startup plans that can help you with this a lot of places have a complete checklist on their you know be it county be it city website that's going to show you what to do so you've got the information out there but I think
7811610	7829854	you've done a lot of research clearly I think the best thing for you to do is look at everything that you need make yourself an outline and make yourself a timeline and make sure that you have that if there's any cost associated with whatever is coming up on your timeline that you have that money by then and that you've got some extra
7830782	7835567	Now, fifth dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, there's a novel idea, Arcade and Strippers.
7836368	7837909	Now, that's something that hasn't been done.
7838910	7842774	But then again, a whole other set of laws that come when you have titties out in the open.
7842994	7843635	I will tell you this.
7843875	7845256	It's incredibly stupid.
7845356	7845557	What?
7845997	7851803	Is that in San Francisco, if I was going to be a massage therapist there, I would actually have to have an adult entertainment license.
7851823	7852003	Mm-hmm.
7853104	7854005	To do massage.
7854125	7855346	So you could do topless massage.
7855506	7855746	No.
7856607	7858548	This is so stupid.
7858568	7863812	They treat the massage and holistic health industry as adult entertainment.
7864713	7865614	So fucking stupid.
7867635	7870498	It's not like there's any shortage of adult entertainment in San Francisco.
7870618	7873742	It's the whole happy ending thing that's ruined it for all of us.
7874262	7876365	They talked about that day one in massage school.
7876485	7877966	I can't do it anymore because of my hand.
7879348	7879908	Happy ending?
7881029	7881370	No!
7883252	7883852	You're so mean.
7884113	7885854	Is that it for the email?
7885995	7888617	I like the video where the happy ending is just parties and clapping.
7888737	7889398	Yes, me too.
7890900	7895484	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to give Jamie some work for a future week.
7896004	7899947	In the meantime, though, it's time for the FUs of the week.
7900748	7901148	Why?
7901168	7902329	I don't know.
7918194	7927679	I have a big F you to the person who was driving the not-so-fresh El Camino in the rain the other day on my street, zipped around the corner, and nearly ran into Dan's car.
7929059	7933081	So yeah, don't speed on the damn road when it's raining.
7933121	7934682	Don't speed through a neighborhood.
7935742	7936783	You are the lowest of low.
7936803	7939684	There's a special place in hell for you if I believed in hell.
7940745	7941185	And you know what?
7941305	7944767	I might just believe in hell for the vague reason that you might go there.
7945247	7946327	You're gonna make an exception.
7946708	7947528	I'll make an exception.
7949926	7955390	Uh, FU to having to coordinate shipping Grand Theft Auto 5.
7955570	7959753	As much as I can't wait to play the game, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare.
7959793	7963176	It's like Call of Duty 2 times this year instead of once.
7966222	7970283	My a few of the week goes to being sick again from a convention.
7970983	7975805	It's not like I don't wash my hands and drink vitamin C and all the things you're supposed to do.
7976085	7977165	It's all the other people that don't.
7977245	7978305	Yeah, it's all the other people.
7978465	7979085	That's what it is.
7979145	7980026	Other people's fault.
7980126	7980866	Never my fault.
7981046	7981326	Rob.
7981486	7981726	What?
7982266	7988428	You do know the theory goes that doing all of those extra preventative measures might actually weaken your immune system to fighting off colds?
7989318	7991801	Weren't you the one telling me to take zinc when I went?
7992042	7993444	I was telling you to take zinc.
7993844	7999972	But regardless of that, you know, people rely on that stuff too much instead of making themselves stronger.
7999992	8001695	I just want to say an F you to being sick.
8001795	8003036	It's awfully inconvenient.
8003057	8006241	Instead of washing your hands when you get done at the con, you just lick them clean.
8007402	8009282	And then you'll feel much better later on.
8009302	8011523	You're such an asshole.
8011563	8012243	I'm serious.
8012403	8013523	This is really draining me.
8013543	8015484	I'm really having to push to finish the show tonight.
8015524	8020405	Thank God we only have two more stories and then we get into Twitter topics and calls and then we're done.
8021505	8022125	Don't get me wrong.
8022205	8024986	I love doing this show and I love all you guys that turn out to listen.
8025006	8026366	I should have brought you some soup, Rob.
8026426	8027346	I'm sorry.
8027526	8027806	Oh, no.
8028306	8030687	Why would you apologize for not buying me something?
8030767	8030987	Because.
8031087	8039696	because I do nice stuff for people and I feel bad when it occurs to me after the fact you know what I'm going to do right now I'm going to go fix myself an emergency while Loki does this next story
8042083	8048728	So that oft rumor that, hey, there's going to be another TimeSplitters game is finally true.
8049068	8050669	There is going to be another TimeSplitters game.
8050809	8052590	It's not going to be new necessarily.
8052910	8054131	It's TimeSplitters Rewind.
8054191	8062457	It's basically a, I guess they're saying it's a ragtag team of fans constructing the game.
8062977	8067120	And they're going to start on developing a PlayStation 4 version of the game.
8067880	8074147	And then he said, you know, we actually are going to go ahead and start development of TimeSplitters Rewind on PlayStation 4.
8074807	8087240	We're pretty confident Crytek's going to say go ahead and do it, but we don't want them saying go ahead and do it when we're caught with our pants down, like we're halfway through development and start...
8087780	8094185	So, Crytek, I guess they've approved the PC version of the game.
8095506	8098128	And I guess that's going through some testing right now as well.
8099089	8103613	But not really approved, I guess, the PlayStation 4 version yet.
8103693	8105294	But, hey, I don't care.
8105374	8107516	PC version's good enough for me.
8109537	8110278	Kids like PCs.
8110891	8111552	Exactly.
8111752	8114073	So, I don't know.
8114654	8120639	You know, TimeSplitters, kind of HD, I guess, with all the crazy stuff in there.
8121839	8123040	I could dig that.
8125522	8125903	Oh, thank you.
8126223	8127924	DarkSakura's giving me more Ricola.
8128124	8129305	I'm saving one for my ride home.
8129325	8130606	You're taking pity on me.
8130726	8134129	Trust me, I buy huge, massive bags of Ricolas.
8134522	8135143	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8151363	8154405	Final Fantasy 7 is 17 years old as of yesterday, right?
8170620	8173664	For an amateur film, it's pretty well made.
8173905	8177109	It's amazing what people can do with their phones and HD cameras.
8177169	8178751	I don't think anyone needs filming out their phones.
8178771	8184458	Well, you know what I mean though, but I'm just saying in general, you have HD cameras on your phone, just spend another...
8185619	8189020	and you get these fancy cameras that are capable of a lot.
8189840	8195302	So anyway, the group that's producing it is Bad Pixel and there's actually a trailer that's out there that you can see.
8196082	8201584	They are actually pitching the idea to Square Enix to try to get permission to proceed with development.
8202124	8207045	If that is successful, they're going to turn to Kickstarter to raise the funds to actually make the film.
8208426	8210746	There's a whole part about Square Enix screen lighting it though.
8211066	8212627	I don't think that's going to happen in a million years.
8212927	8220409	Well, at least they're going the correct route instead of let's go ahead and do it on Kickstarter and wait for it to get shut down.
8220530	8220770	Right.
8220970	8224911	Rather than, you know, let's ask permission first and then... Right.
8226211	8228812	So, yeah, at least they're going about it that way.
8228892	8235574	But, yeah, I just... You know, when they shut down that Chrono Trigger remake project and, you know, they're very protective of their IPs.
8235634	8237095	I just kind of don't see this happening.
8237575	8241397	You know, they want to do... They have, what, Advent Children.
8241477	8242878	They had The Spirits Within.
8242918	8244839	They kind of want to make their movies animated.
8245379	8245719	I don't know.
8245739	8254643	They just... Final Fantasy VI is a pretty precious franchise, and I think it's still due for a remake at some point, isn't it?
8254823	8256724	Because V got its remake on iOS.
8256884	8258105	Shouldn't VI get something?
8259706	8261126	Maybe they're saving it for something big.
8261166	8261526	Who knows?
8262307	8262447	But...
8264733	8265854	Good luck to these guys.
8265894	8271778	I'm not saying I don't want to see it happen, but I just, I don't know, I just kind of think Square Enix isn't going to give it permission.
8271838	8274920	But props to you guys for creating the impressive trailer that you did.
8276075	8277076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8303194	8303875	We will get to that.
8304255	8306358	In the meantime, last minute stories.
8306618	8307660	I don't know if we have anything, Loki?
8308220	8308901	I don't have anything.
8309502	8309762	Really?
8309782	8310583	At least not yet.
8311044	8313307	I think we covered a lot of stuff during the show.
8314386	8318767	Yeah, it's just not a whole ton of new stuff right now.
8319868	8324850	Especially, like, no stories about, like, Grand Theft Auto V leaking out there on the internet, unfortunately.
8325310	8326130	Oh, has it leaked?
8326370	8327630	No, I said it has not.
8327951	8328051	Oh.
8328271	8329771	Unfortunately, it has not, yeah, so.
8331012	8332172	All right, well, I do have a few.
8332392	8334933	Oh, we have a call coming in, so let's go to it.
8336175	8337215	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8337255	8337635	Who's this?
8338256	8339016	This is Ranma.
8339036	8342317	We're going to make sure the Skype line does not crap out on anybody tonight.
8342477	8343077	Let's hope.
8343097	8344697	Hang up after two seconds.
8344717	8347898	You've got to last 20 seconds to beat your call into Bobby's show.
8347938	8348298	What's up?
8349079	8349439	Not much.
8349479	8358381	I have my stopwatch ready, but Rob, as somebody who's been going to cons for about 15 years, I'm going to give you a basic homemade remedy that should fix things up for you.
8358521	8358781	Okay.
8360622	8361142	Black tea.
8361162	8363282	Two shoots of honey.
8363302	8365043	A bit of lemon.
8366047	8370733	A little shot of vodka, half a shot, and two tablespoons of tussin.
8370913	8371414	You'll be fine.
8372515	8373537	Ugh, tussin, ugh.
8374111	8376773	Actually, just raw honey is really, really good for all that.
8377073	8377834	Raw honey.
8377914	8387080	I've been trying to drink tea, so, yeah, no, I don't... Man, it's just weird that it's happening after every convention that I go to, so I just, yeah, irritating.
8387100	8395525	Well, the more conventions you go to, your complex immunity builds up, so... Yeah, I guess that's true.
8395906	8402170	Well, congrats, you made it a full minute, so apparently it was your connection with Bobby that was not appreciated by Skype.
8402590	8403531	What else is on your mind, buddy?
8404451	8409073	Um, I want to go back to about two weeks ago when I called you out by accident about DuckTales.
8410233	8410453	Yeah.
8411213	8411473	Okay.
8412193	8416755	I mean, I understand your issues with the game, with the sound and the cutscenes and so forth.
8417015	8427218	I mean, personally, I guess because I bought it for, I got it for PS3, I didn't have any issues with the sound, the voices, but with the cinematic sequence, just, I really enjoyed it.
8427498	8433460	It felt like as if I was just watching like a five-part miniseries just as I'm going through every stage.
8434522	8438364	Yeah, I mean, I think at the end of the day, I did recommend the game.
8438444	8443626	I just kind of thought there wasn't enough action before those sequences would consistently break things up.
8444147	8446168	That was one thing that kind of irritated me.
8446228	8449209	And I guess in some regards, that is true of the NES version.
8449229	8450410	It had some of that too.
8451290	8451910	But I don't know.
8452310	8455672	It just felt like the action kept being interrupted on the newer one.
8455692	8457413	That was just what really bugged me.
8458308	8459309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8477105	8479466	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8501004	8506106	Yeah, my only issue is the fact that I had to go to Shamestop to pick up the collector's edition.
8506426	8509187	Come to find out that certain Target locations had it.
8509727	8509887	Oh.
8511007	8511248	Mm-hmm.
8511488	8512548	But at least you got the pin.
8513248	8515429	Yes, I did, and it's sitting on my shelf in the case.
8515689	8517410	Next time you go to a Disney park, you can wear it.
8518150	8518690	Damn right.
8518730	8519190	There you go.
8519971	8523612	All right, well, Ranma Buddy, any other comments or questions for us tonight?
8524585	8525305	Quick funny thing.
8525345	8529067	This was at my old job, and my supervisor was a big DuckTales fan.
8529147	8535270	And he would repeat this line from one of the episodes where Scrooge was losing his mind about a sea monster ate his ice cream.
8535350	8541012	I turned around and looked at him and goes, that was not his... It's just along the lines of, that was a sea monster.
8541032	8542153	That was half his fortune.
8542313	8543193	He looked at me crazy.
8543233	8544534	I'm like, go to YouTube.
8544734	8547815	He pulled up that episode, and that was the follow-up line to it.
8547835	8549536	And he just gave me this look of, how do you know that?
8549576	8549956	And I'm like...
8550456	8554657	I have this odd tendency for odd pop culture cartoons and references like that.
8554757	8559518	Come on, I'm sure they screen DuckTales at 3am at some anime conventions.
8559558	8560938	You get high and watch some.
8561018	8561478	Come on.
8562338	8562838	No!
8563159	8574061	The only time you get high at anime conventions is somebody's doing Anime Hell Night or something like that and you just sit there and you just lose your effing mind and you chant for blue screen over and over.
8574081	8574881	Oh my gosh.
8576461	8577641	Rob, there are stories.
8578122	8580623	We will have to talk offline, but I have some stories for you.
8580864	8581224	I'm sure.
8581284	8585146	And the listeners can hear some of those stories on Anime Jam Session.
8585767	8590250	Yes, and we're getting ready for our very first 21-plus anime convention this weekend.
8590550	8591931	Ooh, that sounds like it might be fun.
8592592	8600037	I have been told it's okay to walk around bottomless, topless, alcohol without alcohol, because we have our own private beach.
8600077	8601398	Where the hell is this being held?
8601478	8601938	Nevada?
8602698	8604820	No, Provincetown, Massachusetts.
8605134	8606035	DragonCon 2014 I'm busy bro
8634656	8636657	Dude, don't even get me started on PAX East.
8636837	8648164	I am ready with... My staff knows as soon as they hear about the hotels, you call, text, tweet, whatever, so I can jump to a computer and shank somebody for two rooms at the Westin.
8648384	8657849	Well, I'm praying that at least one of the VOG guys is able to get a room and I can piggyback on that, because I'm pretty sure Travis and Bobby and Brad will all be hammering the phones the day those open up, so...
8659230	8660390	Remember, I'm also Team VOG.
8660430	8660971	I got you.
8661071	8662611	Remember.
8662651	8663191	It comes to us.
8663231	8666572	Sorry, I was talking about DragonCon, but yes, PAX East.
8666652	8667593	I will look you up, buddy.
8668333	8669013	Hell yeah, man.
8669433	8677396	Alright, I should let you go to get more calls, but take care and everybody check out Anime Jam Session now, immediately following Electric Sisterhood, Tuesdays at VOG.
8678776	8679456	Alright, take care, buddy.
8679916	8680397	Alright, later.
8680517	8680697	Bye.
8682657	8686599	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8688120	8689060	And give us a call.
8689860	8691521	A couple tweets I'm getting here.
8692421	8692982	Let's see.
8693142	8694702	Some tweets from Tigerclaw tonight.
8695483	8698164	EA to close Battleforge next month.
8699504	8703446	Battleforge is one of EA's studios, and they are sadly going to be closed.
8703506	8705807	I'm trying to bring up the story to see what they made.
8706367	8708188	Oh, they were a play for free.
8708988	8709909	Who are these guys?
8711189	8711809	That's too bad.
8711829	8714971	I'm trying to see what games they made, but I don't see anything in the list here.
8714991	8716552	But they are closing at the end of October.
8717332	8721635	Never good to hear about people losing their jobs, so our thoughts go out to them.
8722695	8728658	TigerClaw sends us one more tweet about the Halo designer calling out Hideo Kojima over the sexy comments.
8729759	8730219	Oh, God.
8730259	8731840	Did you hear about Kojima's sexy comments?
8731860	8733381	Because it was creating quite the stir.
8734261	8741243	about Metal Gear Solid 5 and how Quiet needed to be more erotic so more people would cosplay her for Tokyo Game Show.
8741843	8742143	Really?
8742603	8745163	Yeah, he kind of put his foot in his mouth with that comment.
8750324	8754405	Kojima clarified with Polygon later he meant to say sexy, not erotic.
8757106	8757306	Okay.
8758723	8761624	I just think it was a bad word choice all around.
8762085	8763545	I started to give him the benefit of the doubt.
8763565	8767107	I was like, is it maybe one of those things that's lost in translation or something?
8769728	8773010	Anyhow, yeah, in this article, the Tiger Claw linked us.
8774491	8775391	Let's see, who is this?
8777612	8784615	David Ellis, Halo designer, said, eccentricity is a cute cover word for objectification and sexism.
8786256	8787297	We got another call coming in.
8787337	8787957	Let's go to it.
8789073	8790234	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.
8790775	8791556	It's still connecting there.
8791576	8792437	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8792457	8792817	Who's this?
8794599	8795019	Boom!
8795159	8796140	It's Jim Sally.
8796380	8797041	Hey, Jim Sally.
8797061	8798382	Jim Sally, you're sideways.
8798422	8799544	Yeah, you're sideways today.
8799584	8799964	That's okay.
8800004	8801305	We will turn our... Oh, there you go.
8801405	8803628	Now you're... He's in MTV cam.
8803648	8805450	Jim Sally's tech support with a smile.
8807111	8808513	You have very nice teeth, Jim Sally.
8809113	8809694	I do, don't I?
8809714	8810755	I brush every day, man.
8810775	8811716	That's good, that's good.
8811876	8812156	You should.
8812176	8813438	I had that big gap right there, though.
8813458	8813958	That's okay.
8814058	8815500	Madonna gets away with it, so do you.
8816501	8817262	Yeah, exactly.
8817282	8818883	I look just as cute as she does, I think.
8819264	8821026	We're going to start calling you the Material Boy.
8821046	8823088	Material Boy, nice.
8823869	8824870	So what's up, Jim Sally?
8825871	8829254	Well, actually, a little sidetrack for the last caller.
8829294	8831256	I've been to Providence Town, man, many a time.
8831276	8831617	Oh, really?
8831637	8831837	Really?
8832588	8838210	My family, we're from Canada, but we vacationed in Cape Cod in this little town called Falmouth, and we used to always go to Providence Town.
8838830	8839550	You know what?
8839570	8840691	I'm going to be honest with you.
8840711	8850534	It had the cleanest beaches, nice places to walk, and it's definitely a different place when you go there compared to the rest of America.
8851734	8853915	You want to hear a funny story that happened to me when I went there?
8853975	8854215	Sure.
8854535	8855796	You can tell me if you think this.
8855876	8858837	Bobby doesn't think my stories are real, by the way, but this is real, Robert.
8858857	8859357	I'm telling you.
8859657	8860317	I believe you.
8860858	8861318	I was about 12, 13.
8863724	8866745	I was just starting to get into baseball and I thought it was pretty cool.
8867145	8869166	And I thought I was going to be the best backcatcher ever.
8869906	8873707	So we went to Providence and I was buying a lot of Red Sox gear and stuff there, right?
8873747	8874728	Because Boston's close by.
8874748	8877928	And I went to this one place that was selling t-shirts.
8878349	8880169	And they had Boston Red Sox, everything else.
8880769	8882390	And then they had novelty t-shirts.
8883010	8885911	And there was one that I thought was backcatching related, so I got it.
8885931	8886731	My mom let me buy it.
8886771	8887951	She's Portuguese, she doesn't know any better.
8888472	8889732	And the t-shirt said...
8890755	8894316	You Pitchin', I'm Catchin' Oh no!
8894336	8897797	I was good at it though, right?
8897857	8899277	It was tight on my arms and stuff.
8899317	8902078	I had little 12-year-old pipes back then too.
8903018	8911120	I have a lot of pictures of me 12 years old on that vacation wearing a t-shirt that says, You Pitchin', I'm Catchin' Did you wear it to baseball practice when you got home?
8911140	8913960	Because I'm sure all the other kids just ate you alive.
8914840	8917181	Dude, yeah, that's where I found notable what that shirt really meant.
8920433	8921574	Oh my god.
8923276	8926499	But you just wanted to be a catcher in baseball.
8926960	8927981	Literally in baseball.
8929082	8931444	Otherwise, Jim Sully throws with his cannon.
8935028	8936609	That being said, you should vacation there, man.
8936629	8937891	I'm going to take my daughter there next year.
8939362	8966305	I would love to visit there I have seriously entertained the idea and I don't know when I'm going to have the time or the money to do this but I've really entertained the idea of just going out to the east coast and flying in there into a cheap airport and renting a car and just driving around the northeast to all the places I wanted to go because I want to see people in New York City although the idea of driving in New York City terrifies me I want to go to the Fun Spot Arcade that's out there I'd love to go to P-Town and there's just tons of stuff I'd love to do out there
8968194	8972238	Speaking of arcades, we had someone talking a while ago about wanting to start their own arcade.
8972278	8973239	I believe it was in the email.
8973339	8974080	It was in the email.
8974780	8979005	When I was 17, I managed an arcade in Kitchener for about three months.
8979185	8980446	Yeah.
8980526	8983269	A little word of advice from me to that guy.
8983969	8989154	You can get a lot of stuff on consignment where the guys that own the machines just put them in your store.
8989174	8991036	You don't have to pay anything for them, but you have to give them a cut.
8991056	8991697	You know what I'm saying?
8991717	8991797	Yeah.
8992225	8994447	Everything at one quarter, you get another quarter sort of a deal.
8994647	8999311	But you can build up a lot of inventory that way without having to shell out a lot of cash, right?
8999331	8999632	Who?
8999652	8999772	Really?
8999792	8999892	Yeah.
9014997	9019319	Yeah, it's a great way too because those local owners can't, they don't have the facility to make any money.
9019399	9022261	So for them, it's free money if you want to take the machine for a while.
9022361	9024282	That's right, especially at Disneyland of all places.
9024342	9026463	Hello, those machines got used heavily.
9027024	9029765	And in fact, they finally did.
9029805	9031666	It's like they read Disneyland fans' mind.
9031686	9040171	They kind of did this mishmash of Flynn's Arcade and Wreck-It Ralph and they put it in the arcade that's right next to the exit at Space Mountain.
9040291	9041611	So it kind of lives on a little bit.
9041731	9042772	There's a lot of cool stuff in there.
9043672	9044093	That's cool.
9044333	9044533	Yeah.
9045902	9046742	I'm walking around my house.
9046762	9047702	I'm looking for my dog.
9047742	9048763	My dog ran outside.
9048803	9049003	I know.
9049023	9051583	I love that we're getting the tour of Jim Sally's house.
9051943	9054124	So quickly, Jim Sally, what else is on your mind tonight?
9056324	9058245	I have a little delay in the podcast.
9058285	9061025	I listened to my first one and it was a little too macho.
9061585	9062625	I toned down the macho-ness.
9063326	9067126	But I decided I'm going to start a new one called Jim Sally's Review Review.
9067666	9069527	Jim Sally's Review Review.
9069887	9072287	Jim Sally's Review Review.
9072487	9073388	Are you going to sing the theme song?
9075461	9077042	Yeah, I review other people's reviews.
9077303	9078323	That's pretty much how it goes.
9079865	9081446	I'm going to review other people's reviews.
9083027	9084128	Oh my god, I love it.
9084329	9085710	Did you get that, DarkSakura?
9085750	9087331	Jim Salley's Review Review.
9088232	9089833	He's going to review other people's reviews.
9090434	9090914	I love it.
9091695	9092796	So it's sort of like a critique.
9093176	9094097	Yes, in a way.
9094117	9097259	It's a critique of other people's critiques, because some people's critiques need critiquing.
9097660	9098240	You know what I'm saying?
9098280	9099021	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
9100319	9102780	That's an amazing idea, Jim.
9103700	9105121	I look forward to hearing the first episode.
9105141	9110043	I'm so excited to hear that you are taking the podcasting idea to heart and really giving it a try.
9110063	9113324	I'm sure Bobby would like a quick review of my review of Saints Row 4.
9114945	9116686	Yes, it's a good idea.
9116706	9119247	I'm going to give you a piece of advice.
9119327	9121207	Stay away from the articles written on VOG.
9121368	9121988	Don't review those.
9122848	9124889	Oh, there's reviews coming, Robert.
9127057	9127337	Uh-oh.
9127897	9128277	All right.
9128757	9131118	Jim, Sally, before I let you go, any last thoughts?
9133138	9135319	No, I just wanted to say hi to everybody today.
9135379	9136719	I really missed you guys last week.
9136759	9137639	You should have called me.
9138139	9138539	I know.
9138599	9138959	I'm sorry.
9139019	9140380	I was having so much fun at DragonCon.
9140640	9141980	Jim, Sally, I was so drunk.
9142520	9144120	I was so drunk.
9146141	9151482	Brad from PodCulture had me drink things I never thought I'd drink in my life, and it was marvelous.
9151502	9151542	Ew.
9153616	9154096	Liquor!
9154257	9156178	Oh my god, stop being ridiculous.
9156758	9156978	So.
9157779	9159280	Did you take your band with you?
9159320	9160181	I can't remember his name now.
9160281	9160541	Alan?
9160561	9161361	Did you take Alan with you?
9161501	9164844	No, Alan was not able to come because Alan, it's kind of expensive.
9164864	9166005	Alan hung out with me.
9166225	9166685	He had to work.
9166705	9168086	Yeah, Alan and DarkSakura hung out.
9168446	9172789	Alan hung out with me and he helped me with my Skyrim and my Dragon Age stuff.
9173049	9174430	Oh yeah, that's two other games I did play.
9174510	9175291	Skyrim and Dragon Age.
9175311	9176191	Yeah, they had a girls night.
9178953	9179774	More like an actor.
9179834	9182355	And then I drank mimosas all night and played rock band.
9182476	9182956	There you go.
9183256	9183896	That's a party.
9184397	9184737	Alright.
9185637	9189940	Jim, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in one more call, but thank you as always.
9190821	9191621	You macho man.
9192762	9193582	You catcher.
9195203	9196024	Alright, bye buddy.
9197285	9197985	I love you, Jamie.
9198025	9199046	You're still my number one.
9200962	9201783	You know you are.
9203384	9205665	I'm making hearts, but you can't see it.
9206426	9208127	It's like he's going to poke me in the eye.
9208147	9208387	All right.
9208688	9210048	Bye, Jim Sally.
9210089	9210389	Bye.
9213511	9214171	Oh, my God.
9214592	9215012	I love it.
9215993	9216873	All right.
9216893	9219855	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9219875	9221276	I feel like he just poked me in the eye.
9222697	9223298	I feel dirty.
9223857	9224397	A little bit.
9224417	9225057	A little bit.
9225077	9225637	A little dirty.
9225817	9226358	A little dirty.
9226698	9227378	I kind of like it.
9228578	9228938	Oh my.
9230438	9231479	Going to Twitter.
9231519	9233999	I'm trying to see if there's other stuff here on the Twitter.
9234299	9235899	I do see a tweet from Bobby Blackwolf.
9235939	9238140	I'm trying to see if it's a troll.
9238660	9239580	Oh no, it's not.
9239980	9240780	This is legit.
9240840	9244001	What he's sending us here from the website Road to VR.
9244781	9248522	Oculus Rift support confirmed coming to Slender The Arrival.
9249102	9250363	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9278682	9301552	I watched it though SSJ100Matt, again, one more plug for the phones to see if we get any calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio a tweet from SSJ100Matt tweeting us about that is apparently another Arcade War documentary a la King of Kong on its way out, it's called Man vs. Snake and it's about the game Nibbler
9302898	9303238	What?
9303779	9310886	And I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, is that the game that's like Snake on the old school cellular phones?
9310946	9312247	And I guess Nibbler was like that.
9312327	9313809	I don't remember Nibbler in the arcades.
9313829	9317012	Well, remember they had Nibbles, which was on Basic.
9317092	9321816	But it was the first game that had a high score table that could handle one billion plus points.
9322577	9322857	And so...
9324719	9325881	That's just ridiculous.
9326422	9326863	One billion?
9327123	9328365	Yeah, a lot.
9328446	9333454	So Man vs. Snake is running a Kickstarter campaign, which, you know, isn't that what they're all doing?
9334195	9335297	To try and get funded.
9335898	9337201	So it can be in a theater near you.
9337221	9338443	There you go.
9339676	9344240	Alright, one more call for calls and then we'll end it if nobody else wants to call.
9344260	9347723	1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9347803	9354729	She'll also pimp out my independent documentary about whacking days, also called Man vs. Snake.
9357531	9358832	Where's the sad trombone, Rob?
9359893	9361214	I'm not playing it after that.
9361254	9361755	That was funny.
9362075	9363336	Womp, womp.
9365789	9369613	Man vs. Snake And there's our dick joke of the night
9384025	9384505	DarkSakura.com
9408681	9409241	That's not true.
9409582	9411803	Just because she may have missed that up.
9412003	9415145	I do hold the title of biggest perv on the show.
9416246	9417226	We won't challenge you for that.
9417346	9420468	That's only because your wife isn't here because then she would be the biggest perv on the show.
9421509	9423270	I don't know about that.
9424170	9426311	Nellie is just the queen of the off-color remark.
9427192	9427832	She's great, though.
9427872	9429053	We've got to get her on the show sometime.
9429073	9429754	We need to have Nellie on the show.
9429774	9431815	Even though I know she hates the show, we've got to get her on it sometime.
9432415	9432695	All right.
9433516	9435438	That does it for another episode of Orange Sound Radio.
9435478	9440323	Thank you guys so much for joining us and inviting us into your life after our week off.
9440844	9441965	Hope we entertained you tonight.
9442185	9444828	Sorry I was sick for most of it, but blame DragonCon.
9447270	9448872	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
9449032	9452075	If you like what you heard, remember, we don't ask for your money to do this show.
9452715	9477511	so just help us spread the word tell a friend or two or five about the show we really appreciate all the thumbs up on Stitcher the five star reviews on iTunes we haven't got any in a long time so if you haven't left us a five star review on iTunes we really appreciate it and helping to spread the word what more can we say thanks for the support and it motivates us to get our family to grow and get more input and do more shows for you guys
9478231	9481674	Before we say goodnight, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
9482355	9489081	My final thought is Alan really needs to charge his Kindle because this thing has been sitting on the dead battery screen for like two weeks.
9489401	9493084	But I'm impressed at how long this thing can sit on a dead battery screen with no battery.
9494826	9495927	DarkSakura, your final thought.
9503007	9503467	and Loki.
9503527	9504788	Last but not least, your final thought.
9508290	9509411	Hopefully Grand Theft Auto this week.
9510572	9511072	We'll see.
9512073	9514855	Could we get an early review of Grand Theft Auto 5 next week?
9514935	9515575	We will see.
9516216	9516236	A+.
9519858	9522221	I know, Bobby's giving a C+.
9523763	9525205	No one's bitter, I guess.
9525585	9527327	Alright, tune in to find out.
9527828	9529670	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
9529751	9530692	Have a great week, everybody.
9530732	9531012	Good night.
9535197	9535817	See you next week.
