00:13.888 --> 00:25.830
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Steam allows you to share games with your family, Buzz begins around a new Geometry Wars, a beloved music game continues its lineage onto the Wii U, Final Fantasy is headed to cell phones, and Loki reviews Grand Theft Auto V.

00:31.638 --> 00:36.319
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.399 --> 00:45.742
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio here on September the 15th of 2013 with the 519th episode of our show.

00:45.842 --> 00:52.163
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:52.523 --> 00:55.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

00:55.717 --> 00:57.178
[SPEAKER_06]: I want people to buy my anime sales

01:13.192 --> 01:13.672
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what?

01:13.732 --> 01:14.493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anime sales.

01:14.653 --> 01:15.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Now anime sales.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I may have a buyer for my most expensive one.

01:19.596 --> 01:30.544
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have two BeatX sales, two Fushigi Yugi sales, and the other one that I have up is Dragon Ball Z. Is that what this show is for you?

01:30.604 --> 01:31.624
[SPEAKER_02]: A place to hawk your wares?

01:31.804 --> 01:32.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

01:32.865 --> 01:41.333
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I would rather this stuff go to people who I know would appreciate it and that I would at least be able to see a picture of it from time to time.

01:41.953 --> 01:42.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

01:42.714 --> 01:43.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that was mine.

01:44.135 --> 01:44.496
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:45.336 --> 01:46.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:47.178 --> 01:47.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

01:47.698 --> 01:49.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what are you selling on this show tonight?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.985
[SPEAKER_11]: I have DVDs on eBay right now, but I mean, that's about it.

01:55.125 --> 01:55.906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it, huh?

01:56.506 --> 01:56.987
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:57.107 --> 01:58.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really selling anything.

01:58.726 --> 02:10.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as I mentioned, we are live here and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

02:10.710 --> 02:13.950
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably an Ouya next week because I really don't play that anymore.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.111
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be selling your Ouya?

02:15.151 --> 02:15.711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so.

02:15.731 --> 02:17.071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, boy, the Ouya.

02:17.091 --> 02:18.872
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dan would give you five bucks for it.

02:19.812 --> 02:21.313
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a little bit more than five bucks.

02:21.353 --> 02:27.695
[SPEAKER_02]: The OUYA stuff, I know we have some stories on it coming up later, but it certainly seems like it's going downhill fast.

02:27.775 --> 02:29.276
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's wrong?

02:29.596 --> 02:30.736
[SPEAKER_02]: What went wrong in OUYA Town?

02:31.216 --> 02:33.337
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the support.

02:34.277 --> 02:35.438
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing's been kind of...

02:36.298 --> 02:37.539
[SPEAKER_11]: Mishandled from the beginning

02:58.847 --> 03:00.990
[SPEAKER_02]: are they sitting in a DHL warehouse somewhere?

03:01.030 --> 03:14.508
[SPEAKER_11]: probably it's probably some DHL black hole I don't necessarily blame I would be so mad I would blame them for going so cheap DHL is just the big problem right there but the fact that you chose to use them

03:15.649 --> 03:18.131
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's not a good idea.

03:18.892 --> 03:27.358
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just use the, well, you know, the post office because you're shipping across, you know, the ocean, but... They had to be cost effective, though.

03:27.498 --> 03:31.420
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, a $99 system means you're going to take some budget corners, right?

03:32.641 --> 03:34.041
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's still mishandled, though.

03:34.061 --> 03:35.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, charge more for shipping then or something.

03:36.002 --> 03:36.862
[SPEAKER_11]: Or charge shipping.

03:37.002 --> 03:38.562
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you need to do.

03:38.622 --> 03:41.243
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, it's really handled poorly.

03:41.363 --> 03:43.984
[SPEAKER_11]: And just their customer service is just terrible.

03:44.424 --> 03:54.266
[SPEAKER_11]: And on top of that, now with this whole, you know, free the games thing, it's just not working out to what they want it to be or what people want it to be.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.306
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being abused.

03:55.606 --> 03:58.407
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we'll get into later, they don't fucking care.

03:59.312 --> 04:02.876
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what happens now to these other Android consoles?

04:02.916 --> 04:05.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we just kind of wrecked it for everybody?

04:05.259 --> 04:10.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that maybe, you know what, there's a rumored Amazon console, there's, wasn't there a Mad Catz?

04:10.524 --> 04:11.546
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep track of them all now.

04:11.566 --> 04:16.191
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that a lot of it is going to be, people are going to be a little cautious about these micro consoles and stuff.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.212
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's ruined it.

04:17.612 --> 04:46.528
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, definitely people are going to be comparing any console that comes out to the Ouya, but in the case of, like, you know, the Mad Catz console and stuff, that just plays straight-up Android games, you know, that you can get on the Google Play Store, and you can tie your Google Play account to, so I don't think they're really in that much trouble, since it can be, you can basically map your controller to work with games that don't even use controllers and stuff like that, so I think that's kind of cool, and that might end up working out for them, and then, like, the GameStick and stuff, where they have their own stores...

04:47.508 --> 04:57.557
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be a little bit tricky when they have their own marketplace and they're kind of separating themselves from everybody else because they want a piece of the money from the games they're selling on there.

04:58.658 --> 04:58.999
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

04:59.019 --> 05:02.382
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have to wait because right now, really, there's only one

05:02.782 --> 05:03.062
[SPEAKER_11]: PSP TV

05:22.645 --> 05:25.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think... Well, before you... You mean the PS Vita TV?

05:25.226 --> 05:25.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.687
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP TV, I think, would be a little bit dated.

05:28.707 --> 05:30.508
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what people wanted, and you can do with that.

05:30.908 --> 05:31.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that's true.

05:31.608 --> 05:31.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

05:32.108 --> 05:45.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, before you cut corners there, I was going to say, a lot of people, I think, were predicting that this was going to screw Kickstarter, too, because, in a way, the Ouya, in these unfulfilled orders and so forth, were giving Kickstarter a bad name.

05:45.793 --> 05:46.133
[SPEAKER_02]: But then...

05:46.613 --> 05:48.013
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:14.279 --> 06:17.282
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's been a lot of other scams.

06:18.183 --> 06:21.646
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of them even put this Ouya thing, which we'll probably get into a little bit more.

06:21.666 --> 06:27.131
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about that Great Iron Thunder and stuff and where it was being backed by family members.

06:27.652 --> 06:30.354
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there was like 187 people backed it and they had like...

06:31.215 --> 06:32.116
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:00.413 --> 07:00.674
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

07:00.894 --> 07:06.286
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, and considering that they're doubling that budget when they match the funds, $100,000 for an Android game?

07:06.606 --> 07:07.889
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's... That's a lot.

07:07.909 --> 07:08.631
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially on the Ouya.

07:08.651 --> 07:09.673
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're talking like...

07:11.443 --> 07:19.829
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's some probably high-end projects on there, but a lot of these video games are being developed by a team of maybe one person to maybe five.

07:21.150 --> 07:21.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Very small teams.

07:22.091 --> 07:22.731
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you need $100,000.

07:22.771 --> 07:29.277
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the tough thing, too, with these is that these sites are really about pre-ordering.

07:29.337 --> 07:34.761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially these are all pre-order sites, and if the rewards aren't good, I don't think people are going to buy into it.

07:34.961 --> 07:36.863
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the Kickstarters that I've seen fail...

07:37.463 --> 07:38.223
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:57.433 --> 08:04.580
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these send my nine-year-old to RPG camp or whatever aside, those are the few and far between.

08:04.760 --> 08:12.007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, unfortunately, a lot of these more charity, quote-unquote, things, you have to really catch on viral or it ain't going to happen.

08:12.447 --> 08:14.569
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of wishful thinking out there.

08:14.589 --> 08:17.632
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend just recently do an Indiegogo that didn't do so well.

08:18.093 --> 08:20.115
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of think a lot of that was the...

08:21.776 --> 08:24.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he really pushed well enough what rewards were in it.

08:47.349 --> 08:49.970
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:10.336 --> 09:17.443
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should say this first, it came to my attention that there's some sort of embargo out there for press reviews until tomorrow morning, 10am.

09:18.704 --> 09:28.295
[SPEAKER_02]: As an indie site, we are under no such embargo, we were not given a media preview copy of this game or whatever, thanks to Loki's industry connection, he has other ways.

09:28.852 --> 09:32.434
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they want to avoid this in the future, they need to hook us up.

09:32.494 --> 09:39.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's a guy in Oakland selling some for $120, you know.

09:39.639 --> 09:42.241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to resort to silly blackmail.

09:42.821 --> 09:52.868
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're being facetious, but it's one of those things where it's like, you know, fans of the game will find a way, and some of these people work in the industry like Loki and can do that.

09:52.888 --> 09:56.190
[SPEAKER_11]: There's people that had it way before me, so I don't want to tell you this.

09:58.271 --> 10:05.253
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out of GameStop and Targets and those people that are getting their pallets of shit, that stuff, way before everything else.

10:05.393 --> 10:06.033
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what?

10:06.053 --> 10:07.854
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a whole 15 hours early.

10:07.874 --> 10:08.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-dee-doo.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.414
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't really do a full review of the game, right?

10:10.495 --> 10:12.395
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I've only played eight hours of it.

10:12.415 --> 10:17.077
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so tell us Loki's little preview of the game from your extreme fanboy perspective.

10:18.892 --> 10:24.074
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, even though, yeah, I am a fanboy of the series and stuff like that, it is a fantastic game.

10:24.455 --> 10:31.638
[SPEAKER_11]: It is... They have just taken... Like, Grand Theft Auto 4, when I first played it, it was just a big, like, holy crap, this looks amazing, that type of stuff.

10:32.098 --> 10:38.140
[SPEAKER_11]: This... Ford has nothing on the... This is just ridiculous, the amount of detail that they have in it.

10:38.401 --> 10:42.602
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not just murky and kind of brown and stuff like Liberty City was.

10:43.002 --> 10:45.964
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just... It's very vibrant and colorful and there's...

10:46.644 --> 10:47.905
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:07.997 --> 11:34.315
[SPEAKER_11]: all sorts of stuff to see I've only played it for 8 hours and I haven't even been to most of the map in the game it's just huge and one of the things I do like about it though is the characters that they have created in it are great, they're very interesting and each one has their own kind of stuff going on and then at the same time their kind of stories intertwine with each other and so you're kind of figuring out how

11:35.376 --> 11:36.517
[SPEAKER_11]: How that's happening.

11:36.617 --> 11:41.961
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you have Franklin, who's kind of this gangster guy that's trying to go legit.

11:42.001 --> 11:49.606
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just trying to get out of that life and stuff and just trying to make money and make an honest living, I guess.

11:49.646 --> 11:57.871
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have Michael, who's this retired bank robber who's killed people and done all sorts of crazy stuff.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you have Trevor, who's just fucking nuts.

12:00.313 --> 12:04.075
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you have all these characters and how they interact and stuff.

12:05.416 --> 12:06.036
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.

12:07.457 --> 12:11.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk a little bit about the vastness and the things to do in the game?

12:11.299 --> 12:24.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even in the short three minutes I saw in the studio before we went live tonight, I was like, wow, I can tell that the size of this game and the size of the continent that you're on is way bigger than previous Grand Theft Auto games.

12:25.185 --> 12:27.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just amazed that they can do that on these current gen consoles.

12:27.466 --> 12:28.706
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks really good.

12:45.931 --> 13:12.186
[SPEAKER_11]: and even just like the details with um you go as as time progresses through the night and stuff when you're driving around you know at night you'll have you know people will be street racing you'll see that going on you'll see cops chasing after you know you just cop cars going by and stuff you know if you see a car or something like that crash or you catch a car and fire you know eventually the fireman will come and put out the fire and all sorts of stuff like that but tell me can you drive a piano

13:12.915 --> 13:13.855
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't drive a piano.

13:14.295 --> 13:14.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

13:14.675 --> 13:15.956
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a mod.

13:16.176 --> 13:17.736
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you drive to Piano?

13:19.637 --> 13:27.679
[SPEAKER_11]: But they've got, for example, they have the Santa Monica Pier, or their version of it, and it's got a roller coaster you can go on.

13:27.859 --> 13:30.340
[SPEAKER_11]: It has the Ferris wheel you can go on.

13:31.640 --> 13:42.143
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the missions you had to play as Michael, your daughter was hanging out with these porn directors and stuff like that, and they thought that she's going to go shoot some porn.

13:42.163 --> 13:42.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Gasp.

13:42.443 --> 13:43.823
[SPEAKER_02]: GASP PORNOGRAPHY

14:10.349 --> 14:12.291
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not a Sharknado.

14:12.812 --> 14:13.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait for the DLC.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.234
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all sorts of animals, though.

14:17.536 --> 14:21.339
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a deer in the first mission you play as Trevor that runs out in front of your car.

14:21.439 --> 14:24.342
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to miss it both times, but it's scripted that it'll hit your car.

14:26.264 --> 14:27.825
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think what some of the other crazy stuff.

14:27.845 --> 14:30.186
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they have the strip club and stuff.

14:30.466 --> 14:33.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard it took you no time to find some titties in the game.

14:33.208 --> 14:41.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's full frontal or, you know, topless women in the game, unlike the pasties in 4, you know, straight up boobies in this one.

14:42.194 --> 14:50.321
[SPEAKER_11]: and they even have a little minigame portion of it where you can touch the strippers while the bouncers aren't looking and stuff like that.

14:50.401 --> 14:54.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you invite someone in for some hot coffee?

14:54.625 --> 14:59.009
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do a booty call with them if you want to later on.

14:59.309 --> 15:01.611
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the same prostitute stuff is...

15:02.992 --> 15:03.592
[SPEAKER_11]: What else I did?

15:04.633 --> 15:17.200
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one portion of the game where Michael takes drugs and he has this massive trip where he sees aliens trying to abduct him and so he has to take him down with a minigun.

15:17.701 --> 15:22.203
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a funny thing that was done with this website.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.984
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Facebook type thing.

15:24.204 --> 15:26.586
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like LifeStalker or something like that.

15:27.406 --> 15:27.927
[SPEAKER_02]: How appropriate.

15:27.967 --> 15:28.107
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

15:29.127 --> 15:36.313
[SPEAKER_11]: and you have to infiltrate their headquarters in order to sabotage something and it really goes weird.

15:36.533 --> 15:39.476
[SPEAKER_02]: But do we still have the classic Grand Theft Auto mainstay?

15:39.556 --> 15:44.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still allowed to get the services of a hooker and then kill them?

15:44.279 --> 15:44.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, of course.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.462
[SPEAKER_06]: So are there male prostitutes and male strippers too?

15:47.482 --> 15:47.522
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

15:49.003 --> 15:49.203
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

15:49.563 --> 15:50.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Patriarchy.

15:51.524 --> 15:52.785
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm serious.

15:53.025 --> 16:03.271
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be fair, though, there is male full frontal nudity in the game, but not full frontal female nudity in the game.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.391
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get Wang.

16:04.911 --> 16:05.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

16:05.412 --> 16:06.552
[SPEAKER_02]: That's patriarchal.

16:07.113 --> 16:07.933
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfair.

16:08.013 --> 16:09.754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's matriarchal, in fact.

16:10.054 --> 16:14.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we could use a little bit more matriarchy, okay?

16:14.196 --> 16:15.137
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do agree.

16:15.157 --> 16:16.538
[SPEAKER_02]: To be serious, I do agree.

16:16.578 --> 16:16.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair is fair.

16:17.518 --> 16:17.998
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:40.572 --> 16:41.632
[SPEAKER_11]: The storyline is great.

16:41.692 --> 16:47.694
[SPEAKER_11]: And plus, if you just don't want to do the storyline, there's so much to do and there's so many activities and just stuff to fuck around with.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.696
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some characters from Grand Theft Auto 4 that do make a return.

16:52.216 --> 17:01.959
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I don't want to spoil anything, but there's one character in particular from 4 that meets his untimely demise in the very first mission of Trevor's.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.180
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets interesting.

17:04.540 --> 17:13.369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm just laughing here because I'm watching our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and of course DarkSakura was in there going, you know, when are we going to get our game with male strippers and prostitutes?

17:13.389 --> 17:16.192
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh, never mind, never mind, never mind, y'all, I'm fine.

17:16.553 --> 17:17.193
[SPEAKER_02]: We got cock.

17:17.373 --> 17:17.694
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

17:17.754 --> 17:18.154
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

17:18.174 --> 17:18.955
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.437
[SPEAKER_06]: There's cock and boobs.

17:20.617 --> 17:21.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.259
[SPEAKER_06]: There's equal representation.

17:22.938 --> 17:24.320
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to make like a special man whore.

17:44.079 --> 17:50.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat room for some other comments, live.vognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says, Grand Theft Auto 4 was too bleak.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.541
[SPEAKER_02]: The story was great, but it was all very super serious.

17:53.941 --> 17:59.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully 5 injects a tiny bit of the insanity we've come to love from Grand Theft Auto 3 and Saints Row.

17:59.382 --> 18:06.503
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of these people that you meet on the street, kind of like the stuff in Grand Theft Auto 4 where you can meet these random strangers and do things.

18:07.683 --> 18:10.264
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like freaks and strangers missions or something like that.

18:11.204 --> 18:13.586
[SPEAKER_11]: and there's one that's a member of the paparazzi.

18:14.226 --> 18:24.813
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this first thing you're doing is you're riding, the first mission you have with him, you're riding or driving a motorcycle and he's taking pictures on the back of the motorcycle trying to get a crotch shot of some celebrity or whatever.

18:25.093 --> 18:30.016
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one is you find out, oh hey, this one celebrity's really into anal sex.

18:30.456 --> 18:33.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go take a picture of her having anal sex in her backyard.

18:33.978 --> 18:35.178
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yes, that's what you do.

18:35.218 --> 18:36.179
[SPEAKER_11]: You sneak up on her.

18:36.259 --> 18:39.261
[SPEAKER_11]: You take a picture of her having, you record her having anal sex.

18:39.901 --> 18:43.122
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she comes and chases after you with her boyfriend.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.823
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like trying to run you down with her car.

18:44.843 --> 18:45.944
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Paris Hilton type.

18:47.245 --> 18:53.551
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so much like insane, like Saints Row IV or whatever, where that's just ya nasty.

18:53.731 --> 18:57.074
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Grand Theft Auto V, what you're describing is just ya nasty.

18:58.135 --> 19:08.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Buster said in chat that in an adult game that's actually adult, but Fifth Dream's retort, not an adult game would entail not being able to pay your bills, accidental pregnancy, and your car breaking down on the way to work.

19:08.365 --> 19:09.566
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not entirely graphic.

19:09.586 --> 19:13.148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, her pants are down, the guy's pants are down, and there's humping going on.

19:13.168 --> 19:14.509
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you can't see anything.

19:14.569 --> 19:16.751
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, like, you know, very detailed.

19:16.811 --> 19:18.412
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you said anal sex.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.414
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also dog sex in the game.

19:20.434 --> 19:23.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why do you keep bringing up anal sex on the show?

19:24.797 --> 19:30.261
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so the first mission that you have Chop, he has sex with a dog, too, so... Oh my god, you're nasty!

19:30.461 --> 19:32.803
[SPEAKER_11]: It's dog sex, because there's two dogs, yeah.

19:33.443 --> 19:35.865
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my... You can put that on the back of the box.

19:37.131 --> 19:39.073
[SPEAKER_06]: You like dog fucking.

19:40.414 --> 19:43.176
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll like Grand Theft Auto V. Along with Raven, of course.

19:43.217 --> 19:44.137
[SPEAKER_02]: You're nasty.

19:45.318 --> 19:45.939
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great game.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.020
[SPEAKER_11]: It seriously is.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.662
[SPEAKER_11]: All strangers aside, it's great.

19:49.702 --> 19:52.164
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a bunch of really interesting characters.

19:53.966 --> 19:58.370
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, I heard you can also smoke weed in Grand Theft Auto V. Yes, you can.

19:59.212 --> 20:00.233
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:17.943 --> 20:21.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Dartituya says, so is this Loki's game of the year?

20:23.087 --> 20:24.227
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, yeah.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.049
[SPEAKER_11]: Most likely?

20:26.289 --> 20:27.970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, really good.

20:28.050 --> 20:38.316
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've only played eight hours of it yet, so I don't know a lot of the missions that they're showing off, like what I'm talking about in the press, I haven't really gotten to yet.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.238
[SPEAKER_11]: But so far, it's been interesting.

20:40.278 --> 20:43.620
[SPEAKER_11]: I did the first heist mission, which was fun, and

20:45.518 --> 20:45.858
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

20:45.958 --> 20:46.939
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just going to be good.

20:47.399 --> 20:52.443
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know tomorrow you're going to see a lot of perfect 10 reviews or at least high 9s.

20:52.543 --> 20:53.544
[SPEAKER_11]: High 9s, perfect 10s.

20:53.744 --> 20:54.524
[SPEAKER_11]: I guarantee it.

20:54.925 --> 20:55.785
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple dog fucks.

20:56.486 --> 21:01.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, Dog fucking lovers have been so underserved in the gaming community.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now a game for y'all.

21:05.092 --> 21:16.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I also saw a GIF on Reddit where it shows Franklin running up to a cow in a field and he kicks over the cow.

21:17.302 --> 21:19.904
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's all sorts of animal violence and stuff in this game.

21:20.164 --> 21:23.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure animal violence is hilarious, Loki.

21:24.226 --> 21:24.746
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fake.

21:24.966 --> 21:26.467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not real, okay?

21:26.707 --> 21:28.288
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying go kick a real cow.

21:28.528 --> 21:29.729
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fake.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.070
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a digital cow.

21:31.430 --> 21:31.790
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

21:31.830 --> 21:33.211
[SPEAKER_11]: Digital violence is okay.

21:33.451 --> 21:35.372
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, actually, that does lead me to something.

21:36.152 --> 21:36.593
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

21:36.713 --> 21:41.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see, I reposted on my Facebook a while back, but Fox News put up a poll.

21:41.896 --> 21:44.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that violent video games cause violence?

21:44.797 --> 21:46.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was all over the internet, but yeah.

21:46.098 --> 21:46.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

21:46.798 --> 21:49.740
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like 90% of the responses was no.

21:50.222 --> 21:54.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but that's because 4chan, I'm sure, did something to the poll.

21:54.964 --> 21:57.525
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked at it the first time, it was a little more even.

21:57.845 --> 22:01.547
[SPEAKER_06]: Who gives two fucks what some internet poll has to say?

22:01.907 --> 22:04.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wait for all the news to come out after this.

22:05.598 --> 22:08.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for... That was the point I was getting to.

22:09.321 --> 22:09.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.343
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually bring up something to make a point.

22:14.425 --> 22:25.293
[SPEAKER_06]: The point I was getting to is that I wonder what they're going to say after the game is officially out and there's reviews of it and say, well, our poll was skewed because that game man came out yet.

22:25.353 --> 22:31.018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picturing a meme in my head with the Game of Thrones guy where it says, brace yourselves.

22:31.598 --> 22:31.698
Yes.

22:33.039 --> 22:36.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Cable News gets Grand Theft Auto 5 this week or something like that.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.280
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

22:37.300 --> 22:37.960
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Cable News.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.861
[SPEAKER_11]: We won't be talking about Grand Theft Auto 5 for another 10 years.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.922
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll realize it after Grand Theft Auto 7 comes out.

22:43.942 --> 22:45.842
[SPEAKER_11]: That Grand Theft Auto 5 is super violent.

22:45.862 --> 22:47.042
[SPEAKER_11]: Rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.483
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also drive a riding lawnmower in the game, which is awesome.

22:51.744 --> 22:52.704
[SPEAKER_06]: But not a piano.

22:52.744 --> 22:53.324
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with that?

22:54.144 --> 22:55.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Because pianos don't drive.

22:56.845 --> 22:58.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen, for real, a motorized piano.

22:58.585 --> 22:58.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

22:58.785 --> 23:00.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you reenact scenes from The Happening?

23:01.266 --> 23:01.326
No.

23:03.740 --> 23:06.642
[SPEAKER_11]: Plants do not attack you as far as I'm aware What?

23:06.942 --> 23:07.902
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

23:08.122 --> 23:19.408
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do hear, because I've been reading a lot of Reddit I do hear though that there is possibly Here's the great thing about Grand Theft Auto This is how you do an homage to your older games

23:20.751 --> 23:26.533
[SPEAKER_11]: All the cheat codes from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas work in this game, by the way.

23:26.633 --> 23:27.133
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is awesome.

23:27.153 --> 23:30.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's great, because some people could care less about the story.

23:31.275 --> 23:32.955
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to run around and kill people.

23:33.015 --> 23:39.018
[SPEAKER_11]: They did, like, a lot of the things that, you know, there's all these, like, there's a killer in the woods, you know, in San Andreas.

23:39.038 --> 23:44.099
[SPEAKER_11]: That was one of the big myths of San Andreas.

23:44.380 --> 23:48.221
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I think they did put that in there as an Easter egg.

23:49.039 --> 23:49.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

23:50.580 --> 23:55.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask one more question, then we'll get into the rest of our gaming weeks and the games that Jamie and I have been playing this week.

23:58.310 --> 24:10.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we are talking about another game from the same generation, I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is from the same generation, but the way you describe Grand Theft Auto 5 and from what I've seen really makes it sound like it pushes things so much further.

24:11.098 --> 24:21.184
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think really changed to allow Grand Theft Auto 5 to push the boundaries in ways that Grand Theft Auto 4 apparently didn't, even though at the time we thought it was pushing the boundaries?

24:21.924 --> 24:24.066
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm surprised at how they were able to do it.

24:24.086 --> 24:26.367
[SPEAKER_11]: They must have really gone through and just...

24:27.745 --> 24:36.128
[SPEAKER_11]: Tweet the shit out of their engine because they've gotten in a way now where they basically have made it, okay, listen, we can make this map as big as we want it to be.

24:36.328 --> 24:38.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Storage being the only limitation.

24:38.628 --> 24:39.629
[SPEAKER_11]: Storage and, I guess, RAM.

24:40.029 --> 24:43.130
[SPEAKER_11]: But the detail is ramped up so much from 4.

24:43.570 --> 24:43.910
[SPEAKER_11]: There's...

24:45.760 --> 24:47.041
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, there's animals in there.

24:47.161 --> 24:48.382
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a ton more cars.

24:48.642 --> 24:50.084
[SPEAKER_11]: The detail's a lot bigger.

24:50.604 --> 24:51.605
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more colorful.

24:51.986 --> 24:52.947
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot more to do.

24:52.987 --> 25:01.135
[SPEAKER_11]: They have this whole ambient soundtrack in there for when you're not listening to stuff that actually is contextual to what you're doing.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.298
[SPEAKER_11]: There's more animations.

25:04.798 --> 25:06.941
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just a lot more better AI.

25:07.441 --> 25:12.744
[SPEAKER_11]: They've basically taken every aspect of Grand Theft Auto 4, split it all apart, and improved upon everything.

25:13.605 --> 25:15.205
[SPEAKER_11]: Combat in the game is a lot better.

25:16.086 --> 25:20.809
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things I did notice, I have run into a couple glitches.

25:20.869 --> 25:22.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be honest, there were a few glitches.

25:23.030 --> 25:24.631
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran into one where I was using...

25:25.051 --> 25:30.415
[SPEAKER_11]: and Franklin's special ability, which slows down time when you're driving to be able to maneuver quickly.

25:30.696 --> 25:40.744
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hit a fence in a certain way that when I undid the... Or when I took off the... Or turned off the power or whatever they had, it flipped my car upside down.

25:40.784 --> 25:43.206
[SPEAKER_11]: I got stuck on top of a fence, which is kind of funny.

25:43.446 --> 25:44.527
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was another one.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.007
[SPEAKER_11]: It was...

25:47.439 --> 26:04.166
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the other things oh i used to be able to like run and jump and grab onto a wall and stuff like that but a lot of times it doesn't quite work the same way in five and so you'll end up running to jump to grab something and instead it'll kind of flop against the wall and like slam into the wall which is kind of funny um

26:05.740 --> 26:06.220
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

26:06.280 --> 26:13.926
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just very... If you've played four, you just need to check out five, and it's going to be very obvious what they've done.

26:13.986 --> 26:16.148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just improved kind of all around.

26:16.168 --> 26:19.150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure anybody who touched four is probably making their plans to get five.

26:19.971 --> 26:21.112
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing with five.

26:21.152 --> 26:26.036
[SPEAKER_11]: I think even just in sandbox games in general, I think this is a good example of what to do.

26:26.116 --> 26:28.137
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of improvements with just...

26:29.358 --> 26:33.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though the world could be the same size, the city is bigger.

26:33.621 --> 26:38.964
[SPEAKER_11]: But it just seems a lot bigger even in the same amount of space that they had it before.

26:39.545 --> 26:41.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Just all the detail that they packed in.

26:42.187 --> 26:42.527
[SPEAKER_02]: I lied.

26:42.547 --> 26:44.328
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of another question before we get to Gaming Weeks.

26:44.368 --> 26:48.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before the show, TigerClaw had sent me this link wondering if we were going to talk about it tonight.

26:48.891 --> 26:50.212
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought now was a good time to bring it up.

26:50.852 --> 27:04.665
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an actual petition on Change.org that quite simply says to Rockstar Games, don't make a PC version of Grand Theft Auto V. And the title of this is, so PC gamers learn their lesson and stop stealing games.

27:04.825 --> 27:07.388
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the most stupid thing I've ever seen.

27:07.958 --> 27:12.080
[SPEAKER_02]: which how are most people playing Grand Theft Auto 5 right now if they're not in the press?

27:12.100 --> 27:12.661
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably stealing it.

27:12.681 --> 27:13.701
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably stole it.

27:14.942 --> 27:17.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing it on PC has nothing to do with the ability to pirate a game.

27:19.444 --> 27:26.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought the allure of PC was, well, for one, some people like the keyboard and mouse and some people like PC, but modding is huge on PC.

27:27.949 --> 27:30.691
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got people like me who have problems with controllers.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.073
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be a PC version at some point.

27:35.093 --> 27:36.935
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be a PlayStation 4 version at some point.

27:36.955 --> 27:37.755
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already leaked out.

27:37.815 --> 27:40.777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the configuration files that they make reference to that stuff.

27:41.138 --> 27:41.798
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's coming.

27:41.858 --> 27:46.761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just they haven't announced it yet because why would you cannibalize your sales for this current gen?

27:46.961 --> 27:48.342
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll come out maybe a year later.

27:49.743 --> 27:51.364
[SPEAKER_02]: With DLC or something.

28:11.335 --> 28:37.400
[SPEAKER_11]: at launch and then later on once that you know exclusivity ran up then it came out on PlayStation 3 and that's when the PC version came out as well so it's with that not being the case anymore I think it's just gonna be that they're gonna wait for some systems to sell and they're gonna wait for the sales to start dipping down a little bit because why would you say oh yeah by the way this PlayStation 4 version is coming out then no one's gonna buy it because they're gonna buy a new system

28:37.840 --> 28:42.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture asks, now will Grand Theft Auto 5 be one of those $9.99 upgrades?

28:42.806 --> 28:44.068
[SPEAKER_02]: No way, Jose.

28:44.248 --> 28:48.133
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the $10 upgrade stuff is mostly for stuff this year anyway.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to encourage people to make the leap sooner rather than later.

28:51.296 --> 28:55.601
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a game like Grand Theft Auto 5 kind of doesn't need the upgrade program.

28:56.122 --> 28:56.563
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll sell.

28:57.123 --> 29:06.846
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if I may, I would like to encourage people not to use change.org because they sign you up for 50 million mailing lists every time you sign a petition so they suck anyway.

29:06.886 --> 29:09.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're going to sign this petition then by all means go ahead.

29:09.246 --> 29:13.047
[SPEAKER_06]: No, if you're going to sign this petition then just don't tell me about it because I'll probably berate you.

29:16.369 --> 29:26.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see, uh, going to our chat room for more comments, live.vognetwork.com, uh, Datatrack says, is it sad that all I really enjoyed was the electronic music from the old Grand Theft Autos?

29:26.778 --> 29:29.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes me think, how's, how's the soundtrack for the game?

29:30.061 --> 29:30.582
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty good.

29:30.982 --> 29:35.647
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, I also like the electronic music, but I haven't really been messing with the radio stations because I,

29:36.067 --> 29:36.487
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget.

29:36.687 --> 29:40.328
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's two electronica stations, but I can only find one of them.

29:41.309 --> 29:44.190
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like how they changed the way you do the radio stuff.

29:44.230 --> 29:50.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you hold down a button and then you select it from a... There's like a radio selection that you select it from.

29:50.632 --> 29:52.052
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, there's a lot of music in the game.

29:52.312 --> 29:52.932
[SPEAKER_11]: A ton of music.

29:52.952 --> 29:55.513
[SPEAKER_11]: There's, I think, like 15 radio stations in it.

29:56.553 --> 30:02.775
[SPEAKER_11]: And even, like I said, when you're not listening to the radio and you're just in a mission and stuff, the contextual soundtrack that they have in there is really nice.

30:03.456 --> 30:03.696
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

30:04.776 --> 30:13.067
[SPEAKER_11]: And plus, the other thing too is if you're... If you're sensitive to the N-word, you might not want to pick up this game.

30:13.548 --> 30:14.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

30:14.469 --> 30:19.736
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all the other games kind of use that word and other provoking words.

30:19.896 --> 30:20.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's...

30:22.737 --> 30:30.080
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of, you know, because Franklin's missions and stuff, it's a lot of, it has to do with like, you know, gang banging and stuff.

30:30.141 --> 30:32.001
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

30:32.101 --> 30:32.822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting.

30:32.882 --> 30:34.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Just seriously, check out the game.

30:35.123 --> 30:35.763
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

30:35.863 --> 30:37.524
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone just went off on Twitter.

30:38.484 --> 30:39.185
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got a tweet.

30:39.225 --> 30:40.745
[SPEAKER_02]: I retweeted it so y'all could see there.

30:41.306 --> 30:44.207
[SPEAKER_02]: A tweet here from Marcus Boy, BOI, on tweet.

30:44.247 --> 30:47.409
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Grand Theft Auto 5, ya nasty edition.

30:47.569 --> 30:49.029
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, look at the box art.

30:49.049 --> 30:49.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Look carefully.

30:50.410 --> 30:51.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Inserted there in the corner.

30:54.606 --> 30:55.768
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, our listeners rule.

30:55.788 --> 30:56.409
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

30:56.449 --> 30:57.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

30:57.750 --> 30:58.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed that.

30:58.531 --> 30:58.832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

31:00.334 --> 31:02.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all we're going to say on Grand Theft Auto V for now?

31:02.296 --> 31:02.657
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

31:02.797 --> 31:04.740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you'll talk about it plenty more in the coming weeks.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, plenty more.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.183
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have more time to get your hands on it.

31:07.423 --> 31:10.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week in How Was Your Gaming Week?

31:10.687 --> 31:12.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, what other games have you been playing this week?

31:12.850 --> 31:13.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy 14.

31:14.811 --> 31:15.231
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost 21.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.692
[SPEAKER_01]: They finally fixed my account.

31:17.772 --> 31:18.432
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy.

31:19.272 --> 31:20.413
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Animal Crossing.

31:20.453 --> 31:21.833
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to call them and get on them either.

31:21.873 --> 31:22.973
[SPEAKER_02]: It just magically happened.

31:22.993 --> 31:23.734
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened on Monday.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.314
[SPEAKER_06]: What they were doing is they were actually handing out other...

31:28.335 --> 31:42.976
[SPEAKER_06]: basically like for people who had the collector's edition they were handing out new collector's edition codes so that you could put it on the proper account and then they said they would close whichever one was inactive so I actually went ahead and closed the inactive account myself so that my characters would be okay

31:44.157 --> 31:48.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, I played a little bit of, uh, Dragon Age Origins.

31:48.879 --> 32:01.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm gonna be starting over on that one, um, just because I really do not like how my character turns out, and I kinda, I was really, I felt nauseous playing through the female city elf thing.

32:01.583 --> 32:02.563
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just really nauseous.

32:02.583 --> 32:02.903
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna...

32:04.364 --> 32:05.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Finish the character.

32:09.547 --> 32:10.628
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I play?

32:11.068 --> 32:12.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I played some more Fractal.

32:13.410 --> 32:21.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Fractal is my game that I don't really... I mean, I care if I beat the level or not, but it's one that I don't mind the challenge.

32:21.535 --> 32:23.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll get so close.

32:24.096 --> 32:28.179
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a difficult game once you get up into the higher levels.

32:28.259 --> 32:30.120
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am just short of beating level 20.

32:30.160 --> 32:30.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

32:31.441 --> 32:37.485
[SPEAKER_06]: So, which I'm pretty proud of myself for making it that far because it really is a lot to keep track of in that game.

32:37.505 --> 32:48.812
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, one of our listeners gifted, I thought we were all gifted with a copy of Don't Starve, but it came on my account.

32:48.872 --> 32:49.772
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't think I got that.

32:50.213 --> 32:50.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

32:51.333 --> 32:51.693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

32:51.753 --> 32:54.255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one of our listeners gifted me with Don't Starve then.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.557
[SPEAKER_06]: So I haven't started it yet, but it's installed.

32:57.901 --> 32:58.141
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32:59.141 --> 33:00.122
[SPEAKER_02]: I've wanted to check that out.

33:00.162 --> 33:04.203
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be when the whole lending thing that we'll talk about later comes into play.

33:04.243 --> 33:05.223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to check that out.

33:05.883 --> 33:12.265
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's a really good thing because for all of us who are into different games, that gives us a chance to review everything.

33:12.845 --> 33:14.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Or unless it was today because I haven't checked today.

33:14.806 --> 33:15.746
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was a couple days ago.

33:15.866 --> 33:16.086
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

33:16.366 --> 33:40.198
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually just half asleep, heard my email beep, and checked as like, oh... No, actually, I gotta say, I just want to say a big, like, thank you to... Well, A, I want to thank all the listeners who take the time to listen to this show every week, because it often kind of comes to light how many of you there are that maybe aren't actively participating with the show, but that are just listening, whether it be on Stitcher or Apple podcast app or whatever.

33:40.559 --> 33:42.500
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say thank you for listening, for one.

33:42.560 --> 33:42.760
[SPEAKER_02]: But B...

33:43.741 --> 33:54.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you guys that take the time and money to actually buy us a game is such a cool, unexpected, nice thing.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of our listeners, Codeman, got me Outlast.

33:58.018 --> 33:58.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

33:58.639 --> 34:01.281
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, which is supposed to be a super scary game.

34:01.902 --> 34:08.267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's to egg me on to do a playthrough on Twitch TV to do a playthrough of that.

34:10.489 --> 34:14.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always very humbled by the generosity there.

34:15.232 --> 34:22.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully this week I'll have a chance to give it a better play just because, you know, I've got nothing to do except school.

34:23.779 --> 34:26.262
[SPEAKER_06]: And now all the major holidays are over, thankfully.

34:28.704 --> 34:34.689
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also, now, it's not a game, but I don't know if I've told people about it.

34:34.769 --> 34:36.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have mentioned it.

34:36.710 --> 34:38.412
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a neat little app is what it is.

34:39.232 --> 35:06.802
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've been playing playing with it it's called Art of Glow and basically all it is is you draw and it animates everything that you draw in different colors you can change how it does but I've actually been making kind of a game with it by seeing how I can control the colors on it it's actually just a fun little waste of time but you know it's not a game per se it's just a neat thing so I've been telling people about it it's Art of Glow is it free?

35:07.597 --> 35:13.924
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a free version I believe and then that Final Fantasy XIV Libra came out which I've been playing around in

35:14.713 --> 35:22.079
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very... I do like that on Final Fantasy XIV, every free company or whatever has a forum on the official thing.

35:22.139 --> 35:25.502
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go in and look, you can actually look at everybody's little character.

35:25.602 --> 35:27.624
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I should plug real quick.

35:27.684 --> 35:37.893
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are playing Final Fantasy XIV and you want a free company to join, you probably would have to roll a new character unless you're already on Midgarcimer as a server that we play on.

35:37.953 --> 35:39.314
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have our free company there.

35:39.334 --> 35:40.175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called End of Line.

35:40.675 --> 35:41.416
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been...

35:41.817 --> 35:45.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Active, and we're already rank 5 or whatever.

35:45.808 --> 35:48.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane's really good about getting that 5% experience boost perk every day.

35:49.127 --> 35:49.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good.

35:50.047 --> 35:50.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

35:50.227 --> 35:51.188
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a fun time.

35:51.388 --> 35:52.628
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually on my third dungeon.

35:53.008 --> 35:53.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

35:53.628 --> 35:55.389
[SPEAKER_06]: So when people want to run it with me.

35:55.629 --> 35:57.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to sound, I lost count.

35:57.449 --> 35:58.390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm on dungeon 11 or 12.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.391
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nice that they have all that to kind of keep you going.

36:01.451 --> 36:01.931
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good.

36:02.071 --> 36:06.512
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like that actually people who are higher level can go back and play with people who are lower level.

36:06.572 --> 36:06.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

36:07.192 --> 36:12.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of, you know, just that was a big annoying thing about WoW is that if I had friends at different levels, I couldn't.

36:13.559 --> 36:19.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, no, that is great, because, yeah, and I totally, well, I think I did help you run a dungeon the other night, right?

36:19.285 --> 36:20.646
[SPEAKER_06]: You ran my first two with me.

36:20.786 --> 36:30.175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so even though I was level, like, 35 or whatever, I was able to kind of level sync down to where you were at, and it wasn't a face roll thing, it was actually still challenging, I had to be alert.

36:30.536 --> 36:35.400
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't necessarily difficult, but it was still, you know, a game.

36:35.420 --> 36:35.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

36:36.301 --> 36:37.762
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

36:53.055 --> 37:15.244
[SPEAKER_06]: which I would say I hope you had a happy holiday although I know it's not really happy so I hope you had an insightful an easy fast for Yom Kippur everybody who does not know anything about Judaism never tell someone happy Yom Kippur because it's not a happy holiday you fast for 25 hours that alone does not sound happy

37:15.664 --> 37:17.325
[SPEAKER_06]: with no water or food.

37:17.425 --> 37:18.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

37:18.426 --> 37:19.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're supposed to afflict yourself.

37:21.067 --> 37:26.350
[SPEAKER_06]: And this also was on Shabbat, so it was like no internet, no nothing, no work.

37:26.370 --> 37:26.810
[SPEAKER_02]: No fun.

37:28.851 --> 37:31.853
[SPEAKER_06]: But you spend the day basically being apologetic and introspective.

37:32.093 --> 37:39.357
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to wish somebody something, you can tell them Shana Tova, you know, good new year, because it's right after Rosh Hashanah.

37:39.717 --> 37:41.198
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell them to have an easy fast.

37:41.878 --> 37:43.538
[SPEAKER_06]: and that would be a pleasant thing to say.

37:43.558 --> 37:45.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I tell you like I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over?

37:46.259 --> 37:46.999
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.280
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you eat a juicy hamburger in front of them?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, it's so good.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're being insensitive.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.601
[SPEAKER_02]: They're at synagogue all day anyway, right?

37:55.641 --> 37:58.661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're at synagogue all day and there's no hamburgers at synagogue.

37:58.721 --> 37:59.522
[SPEAKER_02]: No in and out at synagogue.

37:59.562 --> 38:01.122
[SPEAKER_02]: No standing in the window.

38:01.302 --> 38:06.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually we have police at our synagogue so they'd probably say move along, move along.

38:07.475 --> 38:07.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

38:07.916 --> 38:08.758
[SPEAKER_02]: I will use that next year.

38:08.778 --> 38:10.361
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll totally buy you a Taco Bell when it's over.

38:11.143 --> 38:11.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

38:11.464 --> 38:11.744
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

38:11.965 --> 38:14.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get me Adalbertos and then we'll say it's good.

38:15.896 --> 38:18.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week outside of the big one we talked about?

38:19.278 --> 38:23.380
[SPEAKER_11]: I played, actually, one sort of new game.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.961
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an old game, but new on PC.

38:26.821 --> 38:32.143
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Burnout Paradise because, hey, I got that in the Origin bundle, so why not?

38:32.824 --> 38:37.286
[SPEAKER_11]: And it runs fantastic on PC, so played a bit of that.

38:37.966 --> 38:39.887
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else?

38:40.816 --> 39:04.498
[SPEAKER_11]: a little bit of Saints Row 4 on PC although I've kind of run out of things to do in it so I didn't play it for very long I was just checking out some of the new mods in there they have a hydraulics mod now that Isle Ninja worked on so that's pretty sweet and what else oh also played a little bit of Call of Duty and that's pretty much it

39:05.565 --> 39:28.315
[SPEAKER_02]: my gaming week I've also been playing an unhealthy bingeful amount of Final Fantasy 14 but I'm not sorry but I did play some other games too I would take a break once in a while to play some other games one of the big games I've been playing of course huge release this week Kingdom Hearts HD on the PlayStation 3 was one I had to pick up on the day it was released and I've been playing that a little bit I haven't really been binging on Kingdom Hearts but I've been playing it enough and

39:28.955 --> 39:31.176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so gorgeous in HD.

39:31.376 --> 39:32.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Even right from the very beginning.

39:32.597 --> 39:36.238
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember the very beginning of Kingdom Hearts with the stained glass princess floors?

39:36.258 --> 39:37.599
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to show me after the show.

39:37.619 --> 39:39.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so beautiful.

39:40.180 --> 39:43.762
[SPEAKER_02]: In the HD and everything, the televisions, those colors just really jump.

39:43.842 --> 39:46.023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really pretty game to look at.

39:46.664 --> 40:01.701
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course you know it's the game you remember from the PlayStation 2 you know it's not like they really changed the game except well it is the final mix but I find those changes to be a little bit minor but I know for the Kingdom Hearts fans it's it's a big deal and you know the fact that it's out in the U.S.

40:01.741 --> 40:03.963
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time so that's that's cool um

40:04.824 --> 40:05.545
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

40:31.887 --> 40:50.669
[SPEAKER_02]: I get really frustrated with the camera still too granted they did make some changes some of the things that they had done with Kingdom Hearts 2 in regards to like control and things they went back and did with this which I'm thankful for and I'm so thankful for the fact you can invert the X and Y cameras and all that too and just kind of customize that so nice

40:52.091 --> 40:53.152
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

41:13.493 --> 41:15.854
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still a gorgeous story.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of fun to play.

41:19.236 --> 41:24.258
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I plan on playing more of it throughout the week and hopefully get even further in the game.

41:24.538 --> 41:27.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an option of Japanese dialogue?

41:27.579 --> 41:28.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I don't remember.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody in chat can answer that for me because I do not remember.

41:31.656 --> 41:39.162
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it would be nice if they gave you the option that you can have any of the music in Japanese, well, you know, the Itada Hikaru stuff, or any of the dialogue.

41:39.182 --> 41:41.925
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, because I don't remember that coming up at the very start of the game.

41:42.465 --> 41:47.490
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different levels of difficulty, and to be fair, I'm playing it on normal quote-unquote difficulty.

41:48.130 --> 41:55.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't drop it down to easy, because I didn't remember the game being that hard, but I guess, maybe I was playing on easy the first time, I didn't realize it, I don't know.

41:56.457 --> 41:56.978
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

41:57.558 --> 42:02.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com confirms, nope.

42:02.463 --> 42:16.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I mean, not that I mind Hayley Joel, but... Yeah, well, and to be fair, the Blu-ray is packed pretty full because it's not just Kingdom Hearts, they also have Chain of Memories HD, which I haven't even touched yet, but that whole game's in there waiting for you to play, and then they have...

42:17.619 --> 42:33.574
[SPEAKER_02]: 358 slash 2 that isn't playable but they turned it into like a three hour movie so you can just watch all the cut scenes and I think that's where all that voice acting and all that stuff kind of came in the extra stuff that they did so that's all on one blu-ray for 40 bucks so that is a great value

42:34.625 --> 42:37.730
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other games I played this week just quickly.

42:38.531 --> 42:47.385
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some free games on PlayStation Plus right now, so I checked out Galaga Dimensions, which is actually a couple years old.

42:47.425 --> 42:49.288
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happens to be free on PlayStation Plus right now.

42:49.888 --> 42:51.009
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

43:10.265 --> 43:16.650
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about kind of setting off the bombs at just the right time so that everything kind of, yeah, these chain reactions and everything.

43:16.690 --> 43:23.716
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like a game that kind of peels back the layers and shows its depth the more you play it, what might look stupidly simple in the beginning.

43:24.077 --> 43:25.778
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do give Galaga props for that.

43:25.938 --> 43:29.961
[SPEAKER_02]: That was because I remember playing it on 360 a couple years ago and I was kind of like, meh, don't get it.

43:30.302 --> 43:31.082
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really buy it.

43:31.403 --> 43:36.347
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that I have it for free, thanks to PlayStation Plus, I've been having a good time with it.

43:37.047 --> 44:05.189
[SPEAKER_02]: and um yeah that's that's really about it I played Star Wars pinball for like 30 minutes too which was also free and does things that you would never see a regular pinball table do like flying x-wings and stormtroopers that pop up on the table and shoot your ball so there is kind of that sense of ridiculousness but they are well done games from what I've played so far I mean Zen does a great job with all their pinball games so that is pretty much my gaming week in a nutshell um

44:06.150 --> 44:12.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Robert M in chat says, I really can't get into Galaga Legion's DX personally.

44:12.912 --> 44:15.772
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, the collision seems way too forgiving.

44:17.533 --> 44:22.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess I could see that, although I do notice that the game will do this slowdown thing.

44:22.874 --> 44:26.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you're about to get hit, the game will suddenly, like, slow down and zoom in.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.955
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually does this in Pac-Man 2.

44:28.015 --> 44:31.676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they kind of borrowed the idea from each other or what, but it does this in Pac-Man 2.

44:31.716 --> 44:34.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you're about to die, the game will slow and that.

44:34.517 --> 44:34.817
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

44:53.161 --> 45:20.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's really it as far as my gaming week and things I wanted to talk about So, housekeeping, I don't really have a lot to say tonight So please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR You can see that nasty thing I retweeted earlier, that's always fun And follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Not a super busy week for news, if I'm not mistaken But a few big things to talk about tonight So Loki, why don't you start us off?

45:20.623 --> 45:22.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it wasn't too busy of a week.

45:39.838 --> 45:43.481
[SPEAKER_11]: One of which, of course, was the Vita TV.

45:43.821 --> 45:48.184
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the Vita TV is this really small device that plugs into the TV.

45:48.224 --> 45:54.008
[SPEAKER_11]: It uses a DualShock 3 controller, which is not included with it unless you buy the more expensive bundle.

45:54.088 --> 46:02.854
[SPEAKER_11]: But it runs for about the equivalent of $99 US for the system itself, or $150 with the controller bundled in.

46:03.554 --> 46:28.585
[SPEAKER_11]: and it acts like a Vita without the screen so you can play Vita games on it it has a spot for the memory card and for the Vita cartridges and you can also do the game streaming stuff that you can with the Vita like for example you can stream you know PlayStation 3 games with it you can do PlayStation 4 games once you know that comes out and

46:29.545 --> 46:34.948
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing that it's limited on is obviously you can't technically stream.

46:36.449 --> 46:39.171
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't play games that use the touchscreen, obviously.

46:40.392 --> 46:41.973
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you can play all the digital stuff.

46:41.993 --> 46:46.896
[SPEAKER_11]: You can watch Netflix on it because there's the Netflix app.

46:47.416 --> 46:52.119
[SPEAKER_11]: So all the stuff that you can do on the Vita except for the touch stuff, now on this device.

46:52.139 --> 46:55.421
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can play PSP games and PlayStation 1 games and all that fun stuff.

46:56.241 --> 47:01.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me or does it seem like some of the Vita games are kind of abandoning the touch stuff, especially the rear touch thing?

47:02.626 --> 47:08.430
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see that, but that's just almost the same way as a lot of the PlayStation 3 games abandon the six-axis stuff.

47:09.611 --> 47:13.914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's... Okay, this is going to sound horrible, but this is just how I've lost track of time lately.

47:13.974 --> 47:16.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Japanese press conference this week?

47:16.236 --> 47:17.197
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sunday night.

47:17.377 --> 47:20.259
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's why it was right after the show.

47:20.279 --> 47:21.260
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually stayed up for it.

47:21.700 --> 47:28.246
[SPEAKER_02]: I did too, so we should say at some point there's those new Vitas too but do they even have the touchpacks?

47:28.626 --> 47:49.464
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they do, they're just smaller and they don't have the OLED screen, they have just a regular LCD screen and so they have that and they're a little bit cheaper but they're multicolored and stuff and a little slimmer and all that fun stuff and I think they have one gigabyte of memory built in to the system

47:50.064 --> 47:55.930
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, why would you want to stream PlayStation 3 games on the PlayStation Vita TV when the PlayStation 3 is right next to it?

47:56.731 --> 47:59.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this would be like the Vita TVs in your bedroom, right?

47:59.334 --> 48:01.316
[SPEAKER_11]: And the PS3s in the living room or something like that?

48:01.596 --> 48:11.806
[SPEAKER_11]: That and also the fact that like safe, I think what this could be is when they actually do get to, you know, the point where they have their Gaikai streaming service available and

48:12.307 --> 48:15.851
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't even need a PlayStation 3 to stream PlayStation 3 games.

48:15.911 --> 48:19.055
[SPEAKER_11]: You could play that stuff over the Vita.

48:19.616 --> 48:25.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Eventually they're going to have it where it'll come to the Vita as far as streaming all sorts of things.

48:26.625 --> 48:29.468
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think this is mainly for playing Vita games, which...

48:30.189 --> 48:37.056
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta say, it's a great idea, because even though the Vita does have the dual analog sticks, though, it's still kind of awkward to hold.

48:38.457 --> 48:44.303
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would love actually just having a dual shock available to be able to play that way, because I think that'd be great.

48:45.123 --> 48:49.828
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't put my finger on it, but I really want one of these things, and I don't even know why.

48:49.928 --> 48:51.389
[SPEAKER_02]: They just look so cool.

48:51.409 --> 48:53.371
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cheaper alternative to... Let's put it this way.

48:53.391 --> 48:54.993
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cheaper alternative for a Vita...

48:55.733 --> 49:20.631
[SPEAKER_11]: and for a person like me that doesn't really play on the go I'm sitting on my couch anyways playing the Vita this is fine because I'll just pop in a Vita game if I really want to play it and do that hey here's an idea you know I really wish they had this for like the 3DS you know have you know where I can play with an external controller and play a game on my TV and it put in the cartridges like a Wii U controller no

49:22.313 --> 49:23.034
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fine.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.697
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, actually, if that would be fine, that's the way they're going to get around having the second screen.

49:27.158 --> 49:34.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I still, to this day, I'm still saying that's a matter of time that they're going to have that where they will have 3DS games on the Wii U. It will happen.

49:35.025 --> 49:36.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Or regular DS games first.

49:36.387 --> 49:37.468
[SPEAKER_11]: It would just make sense.

49:37.528 --> 49:37.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

49:37.968 --> 49:39.350
[SPEAKER_11]: They are lacking content anyways.

49:39.370 --> 49:41.252
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a ton of fucking great 3DS games.

49:42.752 --> 49:48.254
[SPEAKER_02]: or even just DS games like Clubhouse Games and the Metroid Prime Hunters.

49:48.334 --> 49:49.655
[SPEAKER_02]: God, there was a ton of shit on DS.

49:49.815 --> 49:51.256
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon, come on!

49:54.517 --> 49:57.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, I want one, the Vita TV.

49:57.618 --> 50:01.839
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, to be able to play PSP and Vita games I missed out on on a big screen.

50:02.980 --> 50:04.180
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a better $99 spent than buying an Ouya.

50:08.681 --> 50:09.582
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, snap!

50:09.882 --> 50:10.843
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all down for that.

50:11.843 --> 50:14.085
[SPEAKER_11]: There's good Vita games out there.

50:14.105 --> 50:19.068
[SPEAKER_11]: At the time, I didn't really want to have a Vita for all that stuff.

50:20.108 --> 50:21.889
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is not a bad idea.

50:21.949 --> 50:26.872
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is, it's not planned for the US and Europe markets yet.

50:26.892 --> 50:27.813
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just for Japan.

50:28.333 --> 50:29.354
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think...

50:29.614 --> 50:29.814
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

50:29.834 --> 50:30.054
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

50:55.120 --> 51:00.301
[SPEAKER_00]: To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CLICK.

51:00.822 --> 51:03.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on and talk about Xbox for a little bit.

51:03.482 --> 51:06.323
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple pieces of news about Microsoft this week.

51:06.403 --> 51:08.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Some I'll talk about, some Jamie will talk about in a minute here.

51:09.084 --> 51:14.185
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them has to do with a domain, the xb1.com domain.

51:14.225 --> 51:16.706
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way it was capitalized, it more looked like the...

51:17.646 --> 51:21.688
[SPEAKER_02]: Infamous term you hear around the internet, the Xbone.com domain.

51:22.229 --> 51:24.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft... Excuse me.

51:24.530 --> 51:25.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love the hiccups on live radio.

51:26.291 --> 51:29.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft got this domain back this week.

51:29.873 --> 51:40.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Major Nelson, in a public way on NeoGAF, of all places, going public and saying that the Xbone name disrespects the people that created the Xbox One.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.621
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, quote, I don't like it.

51:42.941 --> 51:45.983
[SPEAKER_02]: It disrespects the teams that have put in thousands of hours already.

51:46.323 --> 51:47.663
[SPEAKER_02]: into the development of the product.

51:47.864 --> 51:50.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, it's cheeky, but I don't care for it myself.

51:50.724 --> 51:54.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Then maybe you should have named your fucking console Xbox One, you dumbass.

51:55.106 --> 51:57.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't that what they called it?

51:58.847 --> 52:00.228
[SPEAKER_02]: You said they should have named it.

52:00.248 --> 52:01.988
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean they shouldn't have named it.

52:02.008 --> 52:04.109
[SPEAKER_11]: Should not have named it the Xbox One.

52:04.329 --> 52:05.149
[SPEAKER_01]: Should not have.

52:05.249 --> 52:05.909
[SPEAKER_02]: Should not have.

52:05.969 --> 52:10.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like, you know, if you were Nintendo and didn't want penis jokes, maybe you shouldn't have named your console the Wii.

52:10.771 --> 52:12.051
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just a thought.

52:12.451 --> 52:12.732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

52:13.032 --> 52:13.512
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um...

52:14.352 --> 52:20.115
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about this domain is that it was originally purchased on March 20th of 2000.

52:21.356 --> 52:25.038
[SPEAKER_02]: So this domain was bought a long time before there was ever an Xbox One.

52:25.098 --> 52:27.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are saying, wow, they just got lucky with the guess.

52:28.180 --> 52:32.902
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more thinking, well, wasn't this around the time the first Xbox came out?

52:33.002 --> 52:33.943
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe...

52:34.523 --> 52:49.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Some lucky person thought that they would be calling the original Xbox the Xbox One, looking back, because you look at the PlayStation 1, the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, I think a lot of people would think that you would call that original Xbox the Xbox One.

52:49.470 --> 52:53.032
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably never thought that they would go back and make a new console named the Xbox One.

52:53.052 --> 52:53.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

52:53.732 --> 52:54.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Anonymous Report

53:22.801 --> 53:24.182
[SPEAKER_02]: was talking to Edge.

53:24.242 --> 53:29.447
[SPEAKER_02]: These were anonymous developers saying that the PlayStation 4 is in a better state of performance.

53:30.047 --> 53:33.891
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardware isn't locked yet, according to this source.

53:34.391 --> 53:36.713
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 4 apparently more capable.

53:36.793 --> 53:47.863
[SPEAKER_02]: The same game running on both consoles at 1080p at 30 frames a second is on PlayStation 4, but it will run on a lower resolution and frame rate on the Xbox One as of right now.

53:48.663 --> 54:16.948
[SPEAKER_02]: um I believe Microsoft put out a comment about this later on that was basically like it's bullshit to summarize uh but what do you guys think do you think there's any I mean sometimes where there's smoke there's fire with this stuff so I'll entertain it for a minute I thought the comment that they made wasn't necessarily that was bullshit but that you know it's not just about speed it's about all the specs together that make the console and type things so it's like yeah that may be the case but it's not gonna matter

54:17.208 --> 54:45.582
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to matter anyways because you're going to have just like the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 spec wise they were different and so they still have to make the games perform pretty much the same on both systems so I think you're going to see pretty much the games playing the same on both systems it's not going to be that dramatically different I think it has to play the same on both systems or that's like Microsoft would never put a system out there that can't handle it the same you know what I mean

54:46.528 --> 54:49.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you're not going to see something dramatically different.

54:49.673 --> 54:59.365
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to have Assassin's Creed 5 or something where it's stick figures on Xbox One and full 1080p graphics on the PlayStation 4.

54:59.726 --> 55:00.887
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not going to happen that way.

55:01.628 --> 55:05.350
[SPEAKER_02]: Coupa Kid Jeremy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Are the games fun?

55:05.690 --> 55:06.750
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I care about.

55:07.251 --> 55:09.952
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree, and it goes back to that old golden rule, right?

55:09.972 --> 55:11.773
[SPEAKER_02]: The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

55:11.973 --> 55:19.336
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to admit that if it does come out that such and such game, let's say Assassin's Creed 4 or whatever...

55:19.836 --> 55:27.522
[SPEAKER_02]: runs at this particular speed on the PlayStation 4, but the performance is five less frames a second on Xbox One.

55:27.883 --> 55:32.086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to get out on the Internet, and it's not going to make Microsoft look good.

55:32.526 --> 55:35.509
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, that happened to Sony in the last generation, didn't it?

55:35.529 --> 55:47.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I seem to remember with Oblivion especially, and I know I'm going way back, there was a lot of problems with PlayStation 3, and that was all over the Internet, and a lot of that was blamed on the Blu-ray drive, if I remember right.

55:47.358 --> 55:50.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there was Oblivion, Skyrim had issues.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.982
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of games that had issues on the PlayStation 3.

55:53.422 --> 55:54.703
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

55:54.904 --> 56:01.849
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that stuff does get reported on and tweeted about and Facebook messaged about and it all adds up to not looking so good.

56:02.009 --> 56:02.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

56:02.429 --> 56:03.670
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

56:03.730 --> 56:08.573
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do agree at the end of the day, if the games are fun, that's the most important thing, which...

56:09.614 --> 56:31.921
[SPEAKER_02]: is what Nintendo is banking on in a big way because these games that are going to run at 30 frames a second and what have you on Xbox One and so forth aren't even going to be made for the Wii U. So Nintendo kind of has to bank on these games that are experiences that are only going to be on Nintendo because most of them are by Nintendo pushing that system through 2014.

56:33.741 --> 56:36.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Wonderful 101 came out today, did it not?

56:36.303 --> 56:38.605
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hearing some good things about that.

56:38.986 --> 56:40.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Still haven't played the demo.

56:40.167 --> 56:45.191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bad fan, but blame all these other things like Kingdom Hearts taking away my attention for a minute.

56:45.752 --> 56:46.913
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check it out at some point.

56:48.544 --> 56:48.804
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

57:04.083 --> 57:10.307
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, well, we don't know specifically if it's taken from the Xbox idea, but it's a lot like it.

57:10.848 --> 57:19.213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically the Steam Family Sharing Program, which is very interesting because didn't we see something very similar to this?

57:20.634 --> 57:25.240
[SPEAKER_06]: At least described on the Xbox One when they first made their press announcement, right?

57:26.121 --> 57:33.791
[SPEAKER_06]: So what this is basically is if, say, I have a game installed, but you want to play it and you don't own it, I can authorize you to play it.

57:35.370 --> 58:00.492
[SPEAKER_06]: and then that way we can share the game but if I decide that I want to play it you get a few minutes to save your game or buy the game to continue playing it so it's a way to expose other people to a game like if I say Rob you really really have to play Fractal no I mean really you have to play Fractal I go here play Fractal and you can download it and play Fractal and then if I decide that I want to play it which literally might happen because I don't believe I own that game yeah

58:00.772 --> 58:02.972
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can be like, no, Jamie, Rogue Legacy.

58:03.172 --> 58:05.093
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Castlevania, but fun.

58:05.413 --> 58:07.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, Castlevania's fun, but you know what I mean.

58:07.273 --> 58:08.974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an indie Castlevania that's a lot of fun.

58:09.014 --> 58:09.914
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to check this game out.

58:09.934 --> 58:11.414
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can be like, here, go play this.

58:11.814 --> 58:19.555
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will have to figure out if I have any space left with all the other Steam games on my system, because I have almost filled up 500 gigabytes with games.

58:20.276 --> 58:20.756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's scary.

58:21.396 --> 58:23.676
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably should uninstall WoW now that I think about it.

58:24.616 --> 58:27.557
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, you know, it's...

58:28.417 --> 58:30.338
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say, here, play Fractal.

58:31.218 --> 58:38.580
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can say that you have gotten into Fractal, and I was like, you know, I want to play, I want to try to beat my game now, so I want to log in.

58:39.081 --> 58:43.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have the option then to stop playing the game, and it'll save your progress.

58:43.902 --> 58:49.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, if you can be like, well, you know what, I'm at level 10, and I really like this game, I'm going to buy it.

58:49.904 --> 58:52.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can buy it and keep playing, and I can go back to playing my game.

58:53.085 --> 58:55.408
[SPEAKER_02]: and I never have to walk into a GameStop.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.289
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to hand anybody cash.

58:57.650 --> 59:02.254
[SPEAKER_02]: I just click that little button that says drain all the imaginary money from my bank account.

59:02.995 --> 59:03.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

59:03.736 --> 59:12.604
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing with this too is that like at my house, Dan didn't have a Steam account for a while and now he has it for mostly his racing games.

59:13.124 --> 59:14.386
[SPEAKER_06]: And we play Borderlands together.

59:15.066 --> 59:16.868
[SPEAKER_06]: But say that

59:18.800 --> 59:26.745
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted to try out, like, I just bought that, oh yeah, there's another game I didn't talk about playing is that I played Duke Nukem 3D.

59:27.126 --> 59:30.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I bought the indie shooting thing.

59:30.748 --> 59:36.272
[SPEAKER_06]: But say that, you know, Dan wants to sit and play Duke Nukem 3D and I'm not playing it.

59:36.712 --> 59:38.493
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just go, okay, you're authorized on yours, here you go.

59:39.474 --> 59:43.937
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, given that we're in the same house, you know, it doesn't really matter.

59:45.558 --> 59:47.719
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to log out of my account for him to play my games.

59:48.900 --> 59:51.642
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to play your games, then he's going to get kicked out.

59:52.342 --> 59:54.203
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like a different game.

59:54.803 --> 59:57.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I always thought that, oh, okay.

59:57.064 --> 01:00:00.626
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that I understood it is that it's just authorization on that game.

01:00:01.006 --> 01:00:03.788
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on all your games, your entire library.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:12.272
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you play any game, if you're playing Duke Nukem 3D or something like that, and he's playing Borderlands, on your account, he will get kicked out of Borderlands.

01:00:12.312 --> 01:00:13.873
[SPEAKER_06]: Then while I'm at school, you know.

01:00:13.893 --> 01:00:16.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Or while you're playing Final Fantasy XIV, which isn't in your Steam library or something like that.

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:17.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:00:17.495 --> 01:00:21.498
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the only reason I linked it into my Steam is not one of my Steam games.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:25.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I just run it through Steam to screen cap, which by the way, they booted that out for the record.

01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:26.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

01:00:26.442 --> 01:00:28.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I haven't been able to do my screen caps through Steam.

01:00:29.044 --> 01:00:29.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that sucks.

01:00:29.664 --> 01:00:33.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also haven't been able to do my Mass Effect 3 screen caps through Steam either.

01:00:34.348 --> 01:00:34.728
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:35.749
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can for two.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:43.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's very easy to take screenshots in Final Fantasy XIV, but granted, I get that you can't post them or do the cloud or your captions.

01:00:43.816 --> 01:00:47.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, you can't take screencaps during cinematics.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, got it.

01:00:49.441 --> 01:00:52.243
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I was using Steam for, was taking screencaps during cinematics.

01:00:52.263 --> 01:00:52.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Tricky, tricky.

01:00:52.643 --> 01:00:53.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I gotcha.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:54.005
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:55.926
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:20.605 --> 01:01:27.607
[SPEAKER_02]: One person at a time in your library, and that person locks your library, including from you, basically.

01:01:28.587 --> 01:01:40.390
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can take control back of your library at any time, but it will prevent that person from playing that game any further outside of 120 seconds or whatever to wrap it up and save or buy the game and keep going.

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:46.918
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think it's a good feature and I think that they're handling it in a very intelligent manner.

01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:57.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's completely lacking at your account, like you said, what if I'm playing Final Fantasy and Dan wants to try out one of the other games I have or play through some, because I've got the whole Doom set and all the old school games.

01:01:58.574 --> 01:01:59.994
[SPEAKER_06]: If Dan wants to play through it, that's fine.

01:02:00.034 --> 01:02:04.575
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have a friend who wants to play Loom because she can't get her CD to work, I can say, oh, just play on mine.

01:02:04.615 --> 01:02:05.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, you're authorized.

01:02:07.456 --> 01:02:08.556
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it works very well.

01:02:09.216 --> 01:02:16.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, what other... I got another game on... What if I wanted a friend of mine to play Mass Effect, the very first one?

01:02:16.598 --> 01:02:18.619
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be like, okay, because mine was a Steam version.

01:02:18.939 --> 01:02:20.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, you can play on my account.

01:02:20.679 --> 01:02:21.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a text mod thing.

01:02:21.759 --> 01:02:23.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how to do all this crap.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.620
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and...

01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:56.046
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be just fine I think that it's a very good opportunity I think that it's better than demos because people are having access to the full version of the game the moment they get into a game and they're inconvenienced about playing the game when you want your game back that's going to give them even more encouragement to buy the game

01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:00.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?

01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:07.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's a great idea where developers will kind of be able to get their game demos out there.

01:03:07.707 --> 01:03:09.249
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially kind of a demo in a way.

01:03:09.529 --> 01:03:10.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:18.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically, I could probably borrow one of your little games while you're out of town for a week or something and probably beat it in that time frame, but

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:29.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cases are probably going to be less common than the cases where somebody is playing this epic RPG and can't finish because you want to be able to play your games so they have to buy it to finish it.

01:03:29.721 --> 01:03:32.302
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, if I wanted you to play Little Inferno.

01:03:32.322 --> 01:03:32.903
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have it, do you?

01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:37.602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, no.

01:03:53.156 --> 01:03:53.756
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the problem?

01:03:54.116 --> 01:03:58.759
[SPEAKER_02]: SS2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I just wonder how it will work with MMOs like DC Universe Online.

01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:00.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Will people be able to play on another person's account?

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.321
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.

01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:02.882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free anyway, so why?

01:04:03.802 --> 01:04:04.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:11.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that has like extra serial numbers or like basically MMOs and online games aren't going to apply.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.729
[SPEAKER_11]: It's anything that requires like you play, you can't do it.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:16.430
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't, if Games for Windows Live, you can't do it.

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:17.491
[SPEAKER_11]: MMOs, you can't do it.

01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:18.552
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much it.

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:18.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:24.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff that requires an additional serial, like, for example, you can't, you know, play online, like you mentioned, you need a code for that.

01:04:24.835 --> 01:04:26.076
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, those don't work.

01:04:26.797 --> 01:04:28.438
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, I'm looking forward to it.

01:04:28.538 --> 01:04:37.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're going to talk about this probably a little later in the show when we get into the Fugo Question of the Week, so if you haven't answered it yet, you might want to go answer it, because we're going to read these a little later, but...

01:04:37.543 --> 01:04:38.564
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:04:59.043 --> 01:05:03.266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get into that a little later, but we want to know what you think, and there's no right or wrong answer.

01:05:03.906 --> 01:05:05.828
[SPEAKER_02]: So go answer our Fugle Question of the Week if you haven't yet.

01:05:05.848 --> 01:05:09.130
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into those a little bit later in the game, or in the show.

01:05:10.091 --> 01:05:12.172
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, let's go on with some more news.

01:05:12.472 --> 01:05:12.732
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing.

01:05:13.153 --> 01:05:16.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to repeat what Spike said in the chat room.

01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:17.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:05:17.335 --> 01:05:22.979
[SPEAKER_06]: The information released indicated that games that require their own keys and accounts would not be shareable.

01:05:23.239 --> 01:05:23.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:23.980
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:28.646
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so something coming out of Kickstarter.

01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:36.589
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be seeing a lot of these old game resurgences, and one of which is River City Ransom Underground.

01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:46.173
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an officially licensed sequel to River City Ransom done in kind of the 8-bit style of River City Ransom.

01:05:46.853 --> 01:06:04.160
[SPEAKER_11]: and they kind of took like the 8-bit graphics and obviously added more color to them and stuff but it's in the same style and they're seeking $180,000 Canadian by October 9th and they'll probably make it.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.261
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks awesome.

01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:12.584
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now they're at about a third of the way and it's only been seven days and it looks pretty sweet.

01:06:13.924 --> 01:06:14.524
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at it.

01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:15.765
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost put some money on it.

01:06:17.463 --> 01:06:29.587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of with Loki, though, where it's like... It's got to be a really good Kickstarter at this point for me to jump on beforehand because there's just too much out there now where it's like, I don't want to buy all these games I'm not going to see for a year.

01:06:29.607 --> 01:06:30.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

01:06:30.327 --> 01:06:33.268
[SPEAKER_11]: This is expected out September 2014.

01:06:34.008 --> 01:06:37.109
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know they always get... Nothing ever comes out on time.

01:06:37.229 --> 01:06:38.669
[SPEAKER_11]: So, like, you know, 2015 or end of 2014, it's like...

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:48.696
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather just keep my money now and then I'll buy it when it comes out if I have time for it.

01:06:49.897 --> 01:06:51.238
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to back anything.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:54.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless it's hardware that I'm pre-ordering like an Oculus Rift or something like that.

01:06:55.081 --> 01:06:55.982
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little different.

01:06:56.442 --> 01:06:57.703
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's a digital game, I'm...

01:06:59.304 --> 01:07:00.685
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just buy it when it comes out.

01:07:01.086 --> 01:07:05.450
[SPEAKER_06]: I want an actual Kunio sequel, not branded under River City Ransom.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:10.955
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved going back and playing the PC Engine version of the hot-blooded downtown story.

01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:12.777
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:13.557
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quirky.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.459
[SPEAKER_02]: But is that really possible at this point?

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this really, you know, we're having to settle here?

01:07:17.881 --> 01:07:19.443
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's having to settle, really.

01:07:19.563 --> 01:07:22.966
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, that's just sort of like, eh, maybe not.

01:07:24.045 --> 01:07:32.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and it's like I want to wish these guys well and good luck, and I love the idea, and I hope the game's great, but I'll see you when you come out.

01:07:33.009 --> 01:07:33.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:34.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:35.370
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:44.254
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I might be tricked into kick-starting something like this if this were the way this game were to go because I did love me some Geometry Wars.

01:07:44.975 --> 01:07:48.116
[SPEAKER_02]: And Geometry Wars was really – I mean, let's be real.

01:07:48.216 --> 01:07:51.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Geometry Wars was like the best launch game on the Xbox 360.

01:07:51.338 --> 01:07:51.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:07:52.418 --> 01:07:53.299
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:19.517
[SPEAKER_02]: PhilSpencer

01:08:45.919 --> 01:09:06.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's right now the corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios Said on Twitter, take it or leave it Quote, I like Geometry Wars, great game from the old Bizarre Creations Activision picked up IP when they bought Bizarre Creations And then somebody followed up with a question like Would you work with Activision on a new game or buy the rights to it?

01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:14.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Spencer said, quote, oh I'll respond Let's just say as someone who worked on Project Gotham Racing I have a lot of love for Geometry Wars

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversations have been had.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was the tweet that drove everybody crazy.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:23.403
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's talking about it, bringing back Geometry Wars.

01:09:23.903 --> 01:09:29.965
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little surprised that if something was going to happen, it hasn't already.

01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:37.907
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think maybe this is something they're sitting on until the Xbox One or the inevitable next Project Gotham Racing game?

01:09:37.927 --> 01:09:39.208
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a nice launch title.

01:09:39.628 --> 01:09:41.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think it's going to be a launch title.

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:43.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, we'd know about it by now if it was.

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.655
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a Project Gotham?

01:09:45.775 --> 01:09:47.939
[SPEAKER_11]: No, there's not a Project Gotham at launch because there's a Forza, right?

01:09:48.019 --> 01:09:52.485
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have a conference or a presentation at Tokyo Game Show.

01:09:53.246 --> 01:09:53.867
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft.

01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:56.751
[SPEAKER_11]: That's ironic, but they're going to.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:00.730
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:26.676
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's hiring back some of the people who worked on it before, if they're not already happy somewhere else or what.

01:10:26.736 --> 01:10:36.025
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't just make another game with completely different people and then have it suck because we've seen that happen to other franchises and it's always depressing when that stuff happens.

01:10:37.546 --> 01:10:39.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into release dates, DarkSakura's got a story for us.

01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:45.254
[SPEAKER_06]: I do and it makes me kind of happy but kind of wary and sad at the same time.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:50.741
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the next Mass Effect because we all love some Mass Effect here.

01:10:50.841 --> 01:10:53.103
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least two out of three of us like Mass Effect.

01:10:53.143 --> 01:10:54.185
[SPEAKER_12]: And two out of three ain't bad.

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:55.891
[SPEAKER_06]: And two out of three are correct.

01:10:56.631 --> 01:11:00.374
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are calling it, at present, Mass Effect 4.

01:11:01.595 --> 01:11:03.196
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I guess that's their development name.

01:11:04.317 --> 01:11:08.340
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a series of quotes out about that from Casey Hudson.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:15.746
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's saying that they're basically reworking the universe, going to make it new and

01:11:16.366 --> 01:11:33.639
[SPEAKER_06]: and that it's not going to be about Shepard but that it could be about people who were in the previous Mass Effect games so who knows you could be any one of the crew you could be the elusive man which why would anybody want to be him because he sucks

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Chain Smoker.

01:11:38.201 --> 01:11:42.842
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were also saying that it was supposed to be a new fictional world.

01:11:42.922 --> 01:11:50.784
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if it's supposed to be alternate universe, another story, just something else occurring within the established canon.

01:11:51.364 --> 01:12:00.427
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally want to see something less human-centric, but I know why they make it human-centric, because people will more easily get into the series.

01:12:01.527 --> 01:12:11.612
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually, you know, part of me would like an MMO, but I would really rather have just another standalone game with, you know, the same awesome multiplayer that Mass Effect 3 had.

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:13.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think?

01:12:14.969 --> 01:12:17.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I only heard the first half of that.

01:12:17.452 --> 01:12:17.812
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

01:12:19.394 --> 01:12:20.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm multitasking.

01:12:20.475 --> 01:12:21.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave me alone.

01:12:21.196 --> 01:12:22.358
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're single-tasking.

01:12:26.122 --> 01:12:29.626
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been some rumors about it being MMO-style.

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:34.692
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be like Borderlands, though.

01:12:34.972 --> 01:12:47.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it would be fun to play around in that universe, but I would still rather have a single-player game that has all the same cinematic... To quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, it's the best movie I've ever played.

01:12:48.915 --> 01:12:51.676
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like another experience like that.

01:12:51.796 --> 01:13:04.399
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see more things about the other races, not have it just be human-centric, but understand that it was focused on humans because that would be what would get people more easily immersed in the game.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.825
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, how about Garrus as the main character for Mass Effect 4?

01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:09.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:11.388
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make the fandom happy.

01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:13.151
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally play Garrus the game.

01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:16.375
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Bioware was trying to get away from that universe, though.

01:13:17.076 --> 01:13:20.040
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that whole story in Shepard's crew and all that.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.244
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were trying to do something completely different.

01:13:23.544 --> 01:13:24.604
[SPEAKER_06]: But there'd be plenty.

01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:33.087
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I still think that there would be plenty to go on in a post-Reap Apocalypse world or universe or galaxy.

01:13:33.107 --> 01:13:34.168
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say galaxy.

01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:40.610
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, so would this next game be the Star Trek Voyager to Mass Effect 1 through 3 Star Trek Next Generation?

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know because Voyager was shit.

01:13:44.784 --> 01:13:51.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I liked Voyager, so I'm going to say hopefully, although apparently it will divide the fandom epically if that happens.

01:13:52.009 --> 01:13:52.449
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

01:13:52.749 --> 01:13:57.772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's travel around the universe and check out release dates coming to a planet near you, starting with the US.

01:13:57.832 --> 01:13:58.092
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:02.035
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver.

01:14:02.295 --> 01:14:08.599
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and who gives a shit?

01:14:09.159 --> 01:14:11.881
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think maybe Wii U. I don't know.

01:14:12.361 --> 01:14:12.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

01:14:14.102 --> 01:14:16.885
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also some stupid karaoke game, you know, Wii.

01:14:17.505 --> 01:14:19.487
[SPEAKER_11]: Wii Sing 80s or something like that.

01:14:19.547 --> 01:14:20.167
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on the Wii.

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:27.713
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the only game you really should get this week, Grand Theft Auto V. That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:14:27.893 --> 01:14:30.815
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go, Grand Theft Auto V. Your shopping's done.

01:14:31.235 --> 01:14:31.536
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy it.

01:14:31.836 --> 01:14:32.556
[SPEAKER_11]: Comes out tomorrow.

01:14:33.097 --> 01:14:33.857
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, not tomorrow.

01:14:34.038 --> 01:14:35.659
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not biased at all.

01:14:38.206 --> 01:14:39.287
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not biased.

01:14:39.888 --> 01:14:45.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Hot Wheels World's Best Driver, a game based off a YouTube series that has no Hot Wheel cars in it.

01:14:45.695 --> 01:14:49.901
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just about fucking rally driving with a really stupid premise built in.

01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:51.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, oh, we have all these teams.

01:14:51.202 --> 01:14:52.444
[SPEAKER_11]: We're telling them to do this...

01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:56.626
[SPEAKER_11]: Strategic Driving, which is like a really short course anyways.

01:14:57.266 --> 01:15:02.068
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have a karaoke title that they imported from the UK that's just lame on a Wii system.

01:15:02.268 --> 01:15:05.049
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have Grand Theft Auto, the game that's going to get perfect interviews.

01:15:05.249 --> 01:15:06.570
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you're going to see perfect interviews.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.870
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so easily wound up.

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:08.991
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so easily wound up.

01:15:09.051 --> 01:15:09.391
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:09.691
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:15:10.191 --> 01:15:14.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Japan, since unfortunately no Grand Theft Auto V in Japan this week.

01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get Grand Theft Auto V at some point?

01:15:16.653 --> 01:15:17.013
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually.

01:15:17.373 --> 01:15:26.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so instead, on the PlayStation 3 this week, you have Fairy Fencer F to look forward to over there, and I don't think they are actual fairies, just so you know.

01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:28.377
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like one of those epic RPGs.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:34.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it looks kind of cool, and it's by Compile, although I know the Compile of today is not the same as the Compile of yesterday.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Compile Heart, excuse me.

01:15:37.113 --> 01:15:56.863
[SPEAKER_02]: but we can still give them a little love that's right we can that game does look kind of neat so you got that coming out this week regular and limited edition Phantom Breaker Extra also in regular and limited edition on the Xbox excuse me on the PlayStation 3 this week and that Phantom Phantom Breaker is a fighting game with chicks and sailor suits

01:15:58.838 --> 01:16:07.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Going on to the Xbox 360 because it is still chugging along over there for the loyal supporters in Japan.

01:16:07.485 --> 01:16:11.989
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox 360 this week, Alan Wake gets a price reduction.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:16.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3 gets a price reduction including Halo 3 ODST, Halo Reach, Halo Wars.

01:16:16.793 --> 01:16:23.858
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the Phantom Breaker Extra game I mentioned earlier is also coming out this week on the Xbox 360.

01:16:24.238 --> 01:16:29.862
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a couple new Xbox console packs themselves, a 250GB one and a 4GB one that also includes Kinect.

01:16:33.084 --> 01:16:37.745
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess a soft launch, if you will, of the Xbox 360 and some new SKUs.

01:16:38.545 --> 01:16:39.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope they're cheap.

01:16:39.786 --> 01:16:51.248
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation Vita this week in Japan, Yahari Game Demo Ore no Saishin Love Kome wa Machigateru comes out this week in regular and limited edition.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:53.468
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to see quickly what this game is all about.

01:16:55.989 --> 01:16:59.190
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is, this is a dating sim, totally a dating sim.

01:17:00.498 --> 01:17:03.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, totally a dating sim, but you know, everything you expect.

01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:09.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Beach outfits, notes written on notepaper, all that stuff.

01:17:09.965 --> 01:17:13.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly checking the Nintendo platforms to see what we have to look forward to there.

01:17:13.507 --> 01:17:15.549
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, nothing on the Wii U this week.

01:17:15.569 --> 01:17:18.251
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any releases until the 26th of September.

01:17:18.931 --> 01:17:21.353
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the 3DS this week, a little more to choose from.

01:17:21.773 --> 01:17:29.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Jewel Master, Nobunaga Noyabu, also Sango Kushi comes out this week, all on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:17:30.837 --> 01:17:31.838
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:33.704
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some stuff.

01:17:34.264 --> 01:17:35.445
[SPEAKER_06]: God, if it'll ever load.

01:17:35.505 --> 01:17:35.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

01:17:36.405 --> 01:17:40.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, on the 17th, we have Grand Theft Auto V in the UK.

01:17:41.126 --> 01:17:43.707
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 19th, Angry Birds Star Wars 2.

01:17:44.948 --> 01:17:46.388
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the hell just happened to my thing?

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:51.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and on the 20th, we have Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which, ew, snails.

01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:53.330
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:57.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:17:57.576 --> 01:17:57.836
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

01:17:58.156 --> 01:18:00.759
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not just snails, they're snails on Nos, okay?

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.564
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that is like my big phobia, are mollusks of that nature.

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:09.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's even better when they moved at turbo speed.

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.371
[SPEAKER_11]: They can just... No, no, no, no.

01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:12.892
[SPEAKER_08]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

01:18:13.573 --> 01:18:14.573
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:18:14.713 --> 01:18:16.695
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is kind of interesting.

01:18:16.715 --> 01:18:19.537
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, here we thought that this channel was just done for.

01:18:19.857 --> 01:18:23.179
[SPEAKER_11]: They put the bullet into it and it was just done.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.883
[SPEAKER_11]: But up from the grave like a zombie rises G4, a husk of...

01:18:30.004 --> 01:18:37.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, pretty much nothing at this point because they fired all their staff, so G4 will no longer become the Esquire Network.

01:18:37.429 --> 01:18:45.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead, that wonderful title goes to Style Channel now is going to be the Esquire Channel.

01:18:45.274 --> 01:18:47.175
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going to happen to Bill and Juliana?

01:18:47.896 --> 01:18:49.137
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing about Style, though.

01:18:49.237 --> 01:18:52.479
[SPEAKER_11]: Style was like a totally different demographic, I think, than the Esquire Channel.

01:18:52.499 --> 01:18:54.500
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that focused more like women and stuff?

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.781
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's like, oh, Men Channel.

01:18:56.454 --> 01:18:57.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

01:18:57.435 --> 01:18:58.355
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in more homes.

01:18:58.555 --> 01:19:05.280
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at the end of the day, that's what they're trying to do is they're going to push the Esquire Network on a channel that's in more homes.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is about they suddenly wanted to give G4 a reprieve.

01:19:09.943 --> 01:19:11.984
[SPEAKER_02]: G4 is like a lame duck network now.

01:19:12.405 --> 01:19:15.507
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what the hell do you do with G4?

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.828
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you solve a problem like the G4 Network?

01:19:35.183 --> 01:19:37.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean we're still gonna have G4 at E3?

01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:39.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, that's... No, no, that's not gonna happen.

01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:43.914
[SPEAKER_02]: And BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, G4 died in 2004.

01:19:44.014 --> 01:19:44.515
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

01:19:44.995 --> 01:19:49.261
[SPEAKER_02]: And for all practical purposes, I think we banned all talk of this network in the future on the show.

01:19:49.661 --> 01:19:52.345
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'm entertaining it tonight because...

01:19:52.945 --> 01:20:01.331
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it is interesting to think, like, well, I mean, even though I think, you know, this network is damned, it's done for.

01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:04.853
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been more interested if they said, tech TV's coming back.

01:20:04.873 --> 01:20:12.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, is it possible that maybe they'll try to launch the network with this space that maybe should have been?

01:20:12.878 --> 01:20:13.379
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's gonna...

01:20:14.139 --> 01:20:17.601
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to mean an investment or somebody's going to have to come in and buy it.

01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:19.262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really know if that's going to happen.

01:20:19.342 --> 01:20:22.424
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is interesting that they have all this space and nothing to do with it.

01:20:22.464 --> 01:20:26.567
[SPEAKER_02]: You would think that they're going to try to repackage it and launch it as something.

01:20:27.087 --> 01:20:29.469
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might entail additional content.

01:20:29.509 --> 01:20:32.711
[SPEAKER_11]: You bring back Leo Laporte and Patrick Norton on screensavers.

01:20:33.431 --> 01:20:35.293
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll sign up for cable and watch that shit.

01:20:35.373 --> 01:20:43.659
[SPEAKER_02]: But until then, I don't give a shit about reruns of... Just pay those Twit guys in Petaluma to be on basic cable.

01:20:43.859 --> 01:20:44.580
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.481
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want that, they probably don't.

01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:51.385
[SPEAKER_02]: They've moved on.

01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:52.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's moved on.

01:20:52.406 --> 01:20:53.167
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's moved on.

01:20:54.167 --> 01:21:02.134
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to... I'm just saying, just saying, not that, you know, we love doing OLR and, you know, we're all getting to be in our mid-30s, but we're available.

01:21:03.675 --> 01:21:29.678
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd be cheap too Exactly, I said I will sell out in a second You don't understand I'll take a paycheck I don't care I'll introduce videos of cheaters if you want me to quip about something I don't care what you want Hey, this episode of Cops is classic We've got this druggie guy He tries to jump over the fence but a dog grabs him in the ass That's hilarious, let's watch that clip

01:21:29.998 --> 01:21:38.385
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll introduce things too, like, okay y'all, this is that episode of Cops where they try to arrest the drag queen and he's all, excuse my beauty.

01:21:38.766 --> 01:21:40.507
[SPEAKER_02]: So, don't change the channel.

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:41.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're rude.

01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:42.189
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be me.

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:44.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some shit.

01:21:45.171 --> 01:21:45.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch it.

01:21:46.492 --> 01:21:46.933
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

01:21:47.113 --> 01:21:54.139
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you would be like Dr. Claw where you would only allow your arm to be shot on video while you're petting Midna.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.500
[SPEAKER_06]: No, while I'm petting Midna.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.284
[SPEAKER_06]: While trying to get Midna to sit freaking still.

01:21:58.404 --> 01:22:01.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, wasn't that an enthusiastic episode of Campus PD?

01:22:02.029 --> 01:22:06.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Up next, Cheaters, followed by a rerun of MacGyver.

01:22:07.217 --> 01:22:09.100
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob, do you know what I would be?

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.241
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be the Kennedy.

01:22:11.537 --> 01:22:13.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the MTV days.

01:22:13.098 --> 01:22:13.858
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Kennedy.

01:22:14.078 --> 01:22:14.818
[SPEAKER_06]: She was awesome.

01:22:15.218 --> 01:22:21.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the, I got voted the least loved VJ and she had the tiara and everything.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to know a story that not a lot of people know that has to do with Kennedy?

01:22:26.102 --> 01:22:26.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me.

01:22:26.602 --> 01:22:28.122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I should admit this on the air.

01:22:28.142 --> 01:22:28.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.

01:22:28.662 --> 01:22:33.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so like many years ago when I was in high school, I was probably like a senior in high school, so it was a long time ago, right?

01:22:33.764 --> 01:22:35.204
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been 96, right?

01:22:36.105 --> 01:22:39.986
[SPEAKER_02]: There used to be this show on the radio that I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of called Loveline.

01:22:40.866 --> 01:22:44.029
[SPEAKER_02]: and Loveline back in the day had Adam Carolla, right?

01:22:44.389 --> 01:22:46.932
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Drew, which I think he still does.

01:22:46.952 --> 01:22:47.993
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Dr. Drew still does it.

01:22:48.013 --> 01:22:48.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he does it.

01:22:48.633 --> 01:22:50.335
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, amongst all the other stuff he does.

01:22:50.775 --> 01:22:59.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I called in one night and I called in because Kennedy was the guest and I just wanted to talk to Kennedy.

01:22:59.402 --> 01:23:05.368
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I asked, I don't even remember what it is I asked all these years later, but I was on an episode of Loveline

01:23:06.288 --> 01:23:10.593
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was something like, what's your advice to somebody who's trying to get into business?

01:23:10.613 --> 01:23:17.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at that time, I was thinking that I was going to go into broadcast journalism and all this stuff in college, and that's the type of stuff I really wanted to do.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.202
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do that type of radio stuff.

01:23:20.659 --> 01:23:22.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Look where I ended up.

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Kennedy, for your shitty advice.

01:23:24.781 --> 01:23:26.901
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what happened to her.

01:23:27.862 --> 01:23:29.362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she's still around and doing all that.

01:23:29.382 --> 01:23:31.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she did political stuff later on.

01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:37.065
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, she said, and it's really funny because they had to dump this from the air.

01:23:37.465 --> 01:23:40.466
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, well, don't work for the guy in Bleep.

01:23:40.886 --> 01:23:41.886
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's a dick.

01:23:42.327 --> 01:23:44.968
[SPEAKER_02]: And Adam Carolla goes, we're on in that station, you idiot.

01:23:45.028 --> 01:23:46.728
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to dump that from the airwaves.

01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:48.649
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to know what town she said...

01:23:49.409 --> 01:23:49.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't work in Portland.

01:23:52.713 --> 01:23:54.335
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the advice I got.

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:54.835
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.

01:23:55.496 --> 01:23:56.537
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we know.

01:23:56.898 --> 01:24:01.122
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on Loveline when I was 18 or something like that.

01:24:01.283 --> 01:24:01.923
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

01:24:02.924 --> 01:24:05.167
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, no juicy relationship questions for you.

01:24:06.067 --> 01:24:08.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa Kennedy Montgomery You know what?

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:09.490
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 35 and awesome

01:24:28.158 --> 01:24:29.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I'm 37 in a row.

01:24:50.302 --> 01:24:52.184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this finally is coming out.

01:24:52.244 --> 01:24:57.569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the same universe as Final Fantasy Type-0, which was a PSP game in Japan.

01:24:58.230 --> 01:24:59.652
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in that same universe.

01:24:59.692 --> 01:25:05.778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a free-to-play app for iOS and Android, which means you'll probably get to play the first part for free and then you're going to have to buy everything.

01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:10.120
[SPEAKER_02]: The play will be divided between solo play and team play.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.743
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be missions based around individual characters, and there'll be bosses that you fight as team play.

01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:21.305
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what release day this is, but it is something that will come out soon.

01:25:22.745 --> 01:25:25.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Square Enix, I just wanted to do a quick follow-up.

01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:35.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week we talked about Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, and it was suggested this could be a sequel to Theatrhythm, and I was sitting here going, no, it's probably just like a year-end edition that's going to package everything together.

01:25:35.729 --> 01:25:37.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was wrong.

01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:38.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

01:25:39.309 --> 01:25:46.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Curtain Call, or Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, it will be coming to the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 at some point.

01:25:46.911 --> 01:25:48.872
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be in Japan in spring.

01:25:49.692 --> 01:25:54.614
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 plus tracks, 60 plus characters, and a versus battle mode.

01:25:54.934 --> 01:26:02.697
[SPEAKER_02]: They say songs from Final Fantasy XIV as well as Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII-3, are some of the games featured in that.

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:06.318
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like it's going to be even bigger and better.

01:26:07.905 --> 01:26:14.509
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 tracks is a lot of tracks, but when it's all music from your own company, that shouldn't be too difficult to put together.

01:26:15.029 --> 01:26:17.751
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it'll just have all the regular tracks from Theatrhythm 1.

01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:19.632
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be interesting if they went that way.

01:26:20.813 --> 01:26:25.196
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's go back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.

01:26:25.216 --> 01:26:25.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

01:26:26.826 --> 01:26:29.367
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:26:29.387 --> 01:26:34.708
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic game of the week is Valus the Phantasm Soldier, or as it was called, Mugen Senshi Varisu in Japan.

01:26:51.659 --> 01:26:58.184
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first game in the Valis series, and it originally came out on the MSX and PC-88 home computers in 1986.

01:26:59.324 --> 01:27:12.833
[SPEAKER_06]: And then later on, there was a Famicom version, and then there was a Sega Mega Drive version, which I'm sure is the one that most people remember, either the Mega Drive version or the re-release that came out on PC Engine CD or Turbo Duo CD.

01:27:13.753 --> 01:27:27.675
[SPEAKER_06]: so um the game is basically a side-scrolling platformer you are a girl in a school uniform with a sword beating shit up and then you know later on she gets all magical outfits and everything

01:27:29.262 --> 01:27:43.132
[SPEAKER_06]: But the big part with this game is that it was one of the first Magical Girl games that, well, kind of Magical Girl games that came out that got a US release and was really popular.

01:27:44.733 --> 01:27:49.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the interesting thing about this is that the Famicom version was absolutely different from the game.

01:27:50.071 --> 01:28:01.397
[SPEAKER_06]: It had the same plot of the game, but it basically was more of a maze-style game with different paths, so it's supposed to be a lot harder.

01:28:01.817 --> 01:28:08.721
[SPEAKER_06]: For the Mega Drive game, it was pretty much side-scrolling, D-pad, hack, slash, slide, jump, swing your sword, that type of thing.

01:28:08.821 --> 01:28:10.281
[SPEAKER_06]: And you did have magic attacks.

01:28:11.882 --> 01:28:16.365
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a promotional video that came out with the game's release, but...

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:19.158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to find.

01:28:19.198 --> 01:28:20.402
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can find it anywhere.

01:28:20.522 --> 01:28:22.487
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the entire thing is on YouTube.

01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.831
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

01:28:26.288 --> 01:28:38.653
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with Valus, if anyone does want the PC Engine version, or I should say the PC Duo or Turbo Duo version, it actually comes with a Valus 1 and 2 collection.

01:28:39.274 --> 01:28:41.455
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get two games for the price of one.

01:28:41.815 --> 01:28:47.697
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is one of the classic RPGs that came out on Sega Systems.

01:28:47.877 --> 01:28:49.118
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely get it.

01:28:51.638 --> 01:28:54.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Valis to defend the earth and the spirit world and the dream world

01:29:15.356 --> 01:29:26.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some of these later stages now Yeah, and there were more sequels I mean, we had Valus 2, Valus 3, Valus 4 I think I played one of the later Valus games I seem to remember Valus 3 and 4 I think I played one of those

01:29:26.656 --> 01:29:28.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I'm trying to remember.

01:29:28.919 --> 01:29:30.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see what it was that Valus 4 came out on.

01:29:30.941 --> 01:29:32.463
[SPEAKER_02]: Valus was also on the NES.

01:29:32.503 --> 01:29:33.704
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at this related thing.

01:29:33.744 --> 01:29:36.528
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying, the Famicom version, but it was more of a maze game.

01:29:36.868 --> 01:29:38.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:46.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Valus 4 was on the Super Nintendo, or as it was known in Japan as a...

01:29:49.153 --> 01:29:57.196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was actually called it in America too, Super Valus 4, which was on the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.

01:29:57.957 --> 01:30:03.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Valus 3 did come out on PC Engine because I do have that game.

01:30:04.219 --> 01:30:16.304
[SPEAKER_06]: And with Valus 3 is basically you play as Yuko, but she has a couple other characters that are there named Valma and a warrior named Cham who are also in the game.

01:30:18.007 --> 01:30:21.410
[SPEAKER_06]: But I might cover the later Valis games at another time.

01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:25.712
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has to start somewhere, so going with the first Valis is pretty safe.

01:30:25.752 --> 01:30:28.754
[SPEAKER_02]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, I played Valis 3 on the Genesis.

01:30:28.794 --> 01:30:30.195
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the ones I played too.

01:30:30.235 --> 01:30:32.156
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played a later one because a friend of mine had it.

01:30:32.477 --> 01:30:35.539
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's nice to know where those games came from, right?

01:30:35.719 --> 01:30:36.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a...

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.560
[SPEAKER_06]: What was I trying to think?

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think it had a different release.

01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:51.863
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think... Was this one ever released on Wii?

01:30:52.863 --> 01:30:53.903
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it had a Wii release.

01:30:54.163 --> 01:30:55.224
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was.

01:30:56.144 --> 01:30:57.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this would have been perfect.

01:30:57.824 --> 01:30:58.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:30:58.665 --> 01:31:03.586
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dallas 1 and 2 set for PC Engine would have been a perfect Wii store release.

01:31:05.014 --> 01:31:05.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you never know.

01:31:05.735 --> 01:31:08.957
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always time on the Wii U virtual console, so you'll see.

01:31:09.557 --> 01:31:11.359
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it still has life in it.

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:13.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.241
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week.

01:31:15.882 --> 01:31:18.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Valus, the Phantasm Soldier.

01:31:19.144 --> 01:31:20.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, let's do a music break, guys.

01:31:21.026 --> 01:31:23.527
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

[SPEAKER_02]: We have some rapid-fire news for you guys.

01:32:03.226 --> 01:32:06.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:06.429 --> 01:32:07.369
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live.

01:32:07.429 --> 01:32:10.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 519 already in progress here at VOG Network.

01:32:11.513 --> 01:32:13.634
[SPEAKER_02]: September the 15th, 2013.

01:32:13.735 --> 01:32:15.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, this year is almost over.

01:32:15.876 --> 01:32:22.382
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is my favorite time of year right now because that is when pumpkin all the things come out at all the various stores.

01:32:22.902 --> 01:32:23.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Very happy.

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:25.484
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not just talking about pumpkin spice lattes.

01:32:25.504 --> 01:32:26.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.

01:32:26.084 --> 01:32:26.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really good.

01:32:27.265 --> 01:32:30.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Although one of the other coffee stores has a maple that's really good, too.

01:32:31.069 --> 01:32:31.929
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love pumpkin.

01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:32.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I love pumpkin.

01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:33.331
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumpkin Muffin

01:32:39.488 --> 01:32:45.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan and I at Target the other day got pumpkin waffles because I guess that's like a season thing now that Ago does like seasonal waffles.

01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:52.711
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was very happy because Noah's not only does pumpkin bagels this year, they have a pumpkin walnut bagel that is real good.

01:32:52.771 --> 01:32:54.191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like eating dessert for breakfast.

01:32:54.211 --> 01:32:57.512
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we need to do one day when it's an I Can Eat Week day?

01:32:57.632 --> 01:32:57.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:32:58.052 --> 01:32:59.032
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to go to Coco's.

01:33:00.012 --> 01:33:00.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:33:00.373 --> 01:33:04.773
[SPEAKER_06]: And get their pumpkin pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream.

01:33:05.053 --> 01:33:06.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to be that time of year.

01:33:06.374 --> 01:33:07.274
[SPEAKER_02]: IHOP soon too.

01:33:07.294 --> 01:33:07.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:10.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Pumpkin all the things.

01:33:10.078 --> 01:33:10.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Pumpkin all the things.

01:33:10.938 --> 01:33:11.218
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:22.986
[SPEAKER_02]: During that break, which I know you guys don't get to hear it on the podcast, but we play some songs for the live listeners while we take a quick break to rest our voices, refill our drinks and so forth, use the restroom.

01:33:24.046 --> 01:33:27.288
[SPEAKER_02]: During that break, Loki picked one of the songs tonight that we heard tonight.

01:33:27.308 --> 01:33:27.669
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

01:33:28.329 --> 01:33:32.852
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a parody of Prince Ali from Aladdin called DLC.

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:34.353
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so stupid.

01:33:34.373 --> 01:33:34.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:36.092
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:37.093
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to pick them.

01:33:37.574 --> 01:33:38.395
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sure dumb.

01:33:38.495 --> 01:33:39.256
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny.

01:33:39.396 --> 01:33:39.676
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:33:40.898 --> 01:33:44.883
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was awesome was the Grand Theft Auto V you were playing during the break.

01:33:44.924 --> 01:33:46.726
[SPEAKER_02]: You ran over there real quick and turned it on.

01:33:46.846 --> 01:33:49.790
[SPEAKER_02]: You were able to show me the little roller coaster sequence on the pier.

01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:50.631
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked pretty cool.

01:33:50.771 --> 01:33:50.992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:59.154
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to dive into the water too, but unfortunately I picked the spot that was too shallow, and so I dived in the water and smacked my head on the ground.

01:33:59.174 --> 01:34:00.095
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get to see you in the water.

01:34:00.375 --> 01:34:03.016
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something.

01:34:03.756 --> 01:34:16.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we are going to do a few rapid-fire news stories here, and then the Fugo Question of the Week coming up, and then Listless before too long, so I know you guys are excited for that, and you can play along with us if you are here live.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, podcast listeners, we don't have a way you guys can participate with us yet.

01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:26.663
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 2.0 upgrade later on, or more like 3.0 at this point.

01:34:27.023 --> 01:34:29.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with rapid fire news.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:40.187
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Humble Bundle 9, which I had to buy because unfortunately I am addicted to buying Humble Bundles.

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:44.729
[SPEAKER_02]: I am totally addicted to buying Humble Bundles, and I bought this one too the day it was announced.

01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:57.235
[SPEAKER_11]: So it came with some wonderful games, including Fez, Market the Ninja, also Brutal Legends, Trying To, and Faster Than Light.

01:34:59.176 --> 01:35:00.837
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, that's just the initial offering.

01:35:02.357 --> 01:35:07.840
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and Eats Munchies, I guess that's the sequel, and that's going to be in beta.

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:13.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Faster and Light and Fez of course are if you beat the average which is only $4.59 right now.

01:35:14.107 --> 01:35:15.249
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually went down in price.

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:22.117
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I have to give away a copy of Mark and the Ninja at some point because I already have that game.

01:35:23.158 --> 01:35:25.100
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised they don't have Brutal Legend yet.

01:35:27.463 --> 01:35:28.263
[SPEAKER_11]: The other ones I did not.

01:35:28.504 --> 01:35:34.086
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course they will be adding more games probably closer towards the end of the pay period there.

01:35:34.126 --> 01:35:35.067
[SPEAKER_11]: So another nine days.

01:35:35.087 --> 01:35:38.928
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably announcing some more games by the end of the week maybe.

01:35:40.809 --> 01:35:41.510
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're checking out.

01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:50.594
[SPEAKER_11]: And to go along with Grand Theft Auto V, they have this wonderful fake website that they made called...

01:35:52.186 --> 01:35:55.828
[SPEAKER_11]: I see, I called it LifeStalker, it was LifeInvader.

01:35:55.948 --> 01:35:56.328
[SPEAKER_11]: Still funny.

01:35:56.608 --> 01:35:57.289
[SPEAKER_11]: Close enough.

01:35:57.549 --> 01:36:00.690
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's kind of cool about LifeInvader is it's actually a real website you can visit.

01:36:00.731 --> 01:36:07.134
[SPEAKER_11]: So LifeInvader.com, you can go stalk a bunch of people on there, just like following them, I guess.

01:36:07.874 --> 01:36:19.160
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's kind of cool though is it ties in with your Rockstar Social Club account and you can stalk different businesses and it actually gives you in-game discounts and perks that way.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:19.660
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:22.501
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of a cool little thing that they had to do.

01:36:22.601 --> 01:36:24.562
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, you know, it plays a part in the game.

01:36:24.862 --> 01:36:27.203
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rockstar is taking advantage of the cloud.

01:36:27.624 --> 01:36:29.024
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that when you booted up the game.

01:36:29.064 --> 01:36:34.787
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a special little icon for when Rockstar is uploading info to the cloud so they can do things like this where you do something on the internet and it impacts your game.

01:36:34.807 --> 01:36:48.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's also going to be mainly for the multiplayer portion when that's going to... with Grand Theft Auto Online because there's a way you can quick switch between the characters and the fourth quick switch option is your multiplayer characters.

01:36:48.573 --> 01:36:48.693
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:36:49.233 --> 01:36:51.975
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be, you know, you'll be able to jump into it right away.

01:36:52.535 --> 01:37:01.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping back to your previous topic real quick, because we have a good question here from Robert M in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Hey, are Humble Bundle games win Mac Linux still?

01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.321
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's no Mark of the Ninja or Fez on Mac and Linux.

01:37:04.681 --> 01:37:07.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't I read somewhere that Fez was making its Linux debut with this Humble Bundle?

01:37:08.463 --> 01:37:12.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually we'll say which platforms they're on.

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:15.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes the Humble Bundles aren't on all platforms.

01:37:16.186 --> 01:37:17.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes they are.

01:37:17.687 --> 01:37:18.287
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends.

01:37:19.528 --> 01:37:23.770
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, I believe, let's see here, for Fez...

01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:29.295
[SPEAKER_11]: It is making its Mac and Linux debut.

01:37:29.356 --> 01:37:31.258
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:37:31.358 --> 01:37:33.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark of the Ninja is making its Mac and Linux debut.

01:37:34.602 --> 01:37:37.545
[SPEAKER_02]: These new platforms are debuting with this Humble Bundle.

01:37:37.565 --> 01:37:37.966
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

01:37:37.986 --> 01:37:40.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Trine 2 is not Linux, but it is Mac.

01:37:42.651 --> 01:37:47.555
[SPEAKER_11]: You usually just watch the video and it should clarify which games are and are not.

01:37:47.915 --> 01:37:54.320
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes it will also clarify what platforms they're on.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.582
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, the Origin bundle I don't think was Linux.

01:37:57.963 --> 01:38:00.364
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's been some other ones that have not been Linux.

01:38:00.825 --> 01:38:02.886
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good question from the chatroom, so I wanted to clarify that.

01:38:02.926 --> 01:38:04.708
[SPEAKER_11]: And you also get soundtracks, by the way, too.

01:38:04.728 --> 01:38:04.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:34.754
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, alright, and then, uh, on top of that, let's see, so, there was also another announcement this week, uh, you know, of course, Apple doing their announcements of the new iPhones and stuff, so the iPhone 5S is gonna be the brand new iPhone, and along with that, you're gonna get Infinity Blade 3, which is gonna launch September 20th, and is even more amazing because now they have, you know, the wonderful, um, graphics chips and stuff like that in the new phone, so...

01:38:36.431 --> 01:38:36.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:38:55.134 --> 01:39:00.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm not, but it's not enough of an upgrade and I'm already locked in a two-year contract with my current phone.

01:39:00.936 --> 01:39:07.599
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was up for renewal, I probably would be going to the 5S because I didn't have a 5 yet, I would assume.

01:39:07.759 --> 01:39:08.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

01:39:08.299 --> 01:39:12.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, it's one of these stupid pages I'm on.

01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:13.722
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an autoplay something something.

01:39:13.742 --> 01:39:14.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

01:39:15.262 --> 01:39:18.184
[SPEAKER_02]: It made your comment that much more dramatic.

01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:32.072
[SPEAKER_02]: E.G.

01:39:32.152 --> 01:39:34.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Anuma, Legend of Zelda Series Producer, was questioned by IGN about it.

01:39:34.374 --> 01:39:34.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote,

01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:04.392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to them if we want to interpret my laughter as, yeah, we're making it, or no, we're not.

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:05.632
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's really up to them.

01:40:06.693 --> 01:40:12.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't read Jack shit into that, but some people are clinging to that as, oh, it could be information about a new Majora's Mask.

01:40:12.415 --> 01:40:14.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Would it have been different if he said, I sharted?

01:40:15.336 --> 01:40:19.478
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't read into that as like, I'm just going to make the game.

01:40:19.718 --> 01:40:21.218
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of poo.

01:40:24.079 --> 01:40:25.400
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean it's bad poo.

01:40:27.389 --> 01:40:29.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

01:40:30.011 --> 01:40:35.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Stories about DJ Max Technica Q is something... Oh, I know what that is.

01:40:35.254 --> 01:40:36.054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more epic!

01:40:36.574 --> 01:40:37.175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that site.

01:40:37.195 --> 01:40:40.957
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that site was... All right, so I'll try to summarize it for you guys from what I remember.

01:40:40.997 --> 01:40:44.119
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Max Technica Q, it was announced for iOS and Android.

01:40:45.099 --> 01:40:46.800
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty much the big thing, right?

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:54.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because DJ Max, they had the PS Vita version that I liked, and I thought it did well, but I guess not well enough to necessitate future games.

01:40:55.865 --> 01:40:56.265
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sad.

01:40:56.305 --> 01:40:58.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think they're making any more on the PS Vita.

01:40:58.606 --> 01:41:00.487
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that come out over here?

01:41:00.507 --> 01:41:04.229
[SPEAKER_11]: Or was that one of those things you had to import?

01:41:04.329 --> 01:41:05.129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it did come out here.

01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:07.770
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was only available on the store.

01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:11.672
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you could get it through Amazon in really limited quantities.

01:41:13.735 --> 01:41:14.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Pinball

01:41:36.406 --> 01:41:40.672
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have to do with the reboots, so if you're not a big fan of those, you might be disappointed.

01:41:40.952 --> 01:41:42.955
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will use elements from the reboot movies.

01:41:43.015 --> 01:41:44.938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not strictly based off one or the other.

01:41:45.638 --> 01:41:46.319
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

01:41:46.339 --> 01:41:52.528
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought for a second there that we'd see Jean-Luc Picard teaching us about the quadruple take.

01:41:52.608 --> 01:41:55.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan has a friend who buys all the Stern Tables when they come out, so I'm sure I will get to see it.

01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.989
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

01:42:10.294 --> 01:42:33.310
[SPEAKER_06]: he's got the limited edition Tron table which oh my god it has like this frosted glass top on it nice oh it's beautiful I only got to play it like the one time real quick at Disneyland I want to play it again you know what else was pretty hot was playing Metallica pinball with the speaker right by me oh my god that game is awesome okay all right DarkSakura what do you have for us for rapid fire news Metallica pinball

01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:35.653
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for rapid fire news.

01:42:36.634 --> 01:42:41.197
[SPEAKER_06]: This one I brought up just because I know we have a few racing game fans out there.

01:42:41.877 --> 01:42:54.605
[SPEAKER_06]: So for anyone who is looking forward to F1 2013, the Ferrari that was driven by Niki Lauda is supposed to be in the game.

01:42:55.566 --> 01:42:59.388
[SPEAKER_06]: So for fans who are into racers, there you go.

01:42:59.448 --> 01:43:01.610
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a classic Ferrari in game.

01:43:02.871 --> 01:43:12.421
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I've also been watching a lot of Top Gear so also in this is some pretty interesting news for Ridge Racer news

01:43:13.533 --> 01:43:14.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer.

01:43:14.834 --> 01:43:15.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:43:15.795 --> 01:43:24.141
[SPEAKER_06]: There is going to be a free-to-play PC racing game called Ridge Racer Driftopia that's part of Steam's early access program, so it should already be out.

01:43:24.241 --> 01:43:33.369
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank God we finally have new Ridge Racer news, because I was like, how can it be that we have two consoles launching this year and neither one of them have Ridge Racer?

01:43:33.829 --> 01:43:34.970
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with that?

01:43:36.175 --> 01:43:36.755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame.

01:43:36.895 --> 01:43:38.996
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's a sham is what it is.

01:43:39.156 --> 01:43:41.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Driftopia beta has already been out for PS3.

01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:50.139
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a public beta, and they said that the official release in Europe is supposed to be not too much later this year, hopefully.

01:43:50.279 --> 01:43:51.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Steam, you've officially made it.

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:52.880
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a Ridge Racer game.

01:43:55.604 --> 01:44:21.334
[SPEAKER_06]: and happy happy happy Puyo Puyo Tetris I'm just trying to figure out how Puyo Puyo and Tetris would breed but apparently it's Tetris with but they're gonna try god help them I'm wondering if the little if the Tetris blocks are gonna have like little Puyos on them or something but Puyo Puyo I love Puyo Puyo so hopefully it's going to be fun and not you know utterly crappy I hope

01:44:23.815 --> 01:44:25.096
[SPEAKER_06]: You know me and my P.O.P.O.

01:44:26.117 --> 01:44:26.338
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

01:44:26.638 --> 01:44:27.639
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do love P.O.P.O.

01:44:27.999 --> 01:44:29.180
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the last big P.O.P.O.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:29.721
[SPEAKER_02]: game that came out?

01:44:29.741 --> 01:44:32.323
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the DS one, but that was the last one I really remember.

01:44:32.764 --> 01:44:34.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that, yeah, just P.O.P.O.P.?

01:44:34.406 --> 01:44:34.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:44:35.266 --> 01:44:35.787
[SPEAKER_06]: Or P.O.P.O.P.

01:44:35.807 --> 01:44:36.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Fever?

01:44:37.649 --> 01:44:40.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the foogle question of the week.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:53.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together and you get Fugle.

01:44:53.724 --> 01:44:56.526
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week we take to our social networks to ask a question.

01:44:57.206 --> 01:45:01.709
[SPEAKER_02]: And this week it has to do with something we talked about earlier in the show, the Steam family sharing.

01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:07.794
[SPEAKER_02]: This week we heard that Steam would be implementing family sharing, which was a feature that had been teased for the Xbox One.

01:45:08.354 --> 01:45:37.335
[SPEAKER_02]: many people who are critical of the Xbox One policies embrace the idea of family sharing on Steam do you think there is an unfair double standard in play in the gaming community when it comes to Steam announcing features versus Microsoft announcing Xbox One features why or why not I'm going to read just a few of the answers tonight because unfortunately the answers get very long with this but you have a lot of good stuff so I really want to encourage our community go read the answers people wrote

01:45:37.495 --> 01:45:40.196
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox One features outraged people because it meant the end of used game sales.

01:45:40.216 --> 01:45:45.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Even before Steam and other digital stores, selling and buying used PC games was not a huge market just because of the issue with CD keys.

01:46:01.327 --> 01:46:05.729
[SPEAKER_02]: even if I give you the right CD key I could still use it for myself to play online for example.

01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:12.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile there's an entire retail chain that is basically built around the idea of buying and selling used console games.

01:46:14.888 --> 01:46:15.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Critical Myth says,

01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:48.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Xiao replies and says, I think the biggest reason Steam isn't catching any crap over this is the fact that Steam doesn't use your webcam and microphone to stalk you through your gaming area yet, and offline mode is an option, even though it enjoys making me rage.

01:46:49.151 --> 01:46:53.193
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually exists unlike what the Xbox One had before it became the Xbox 180.

01:46:54.254 --> 01:46:58.037
[SPEAKER_02]: So there really isn't a double standard as much as there is a different standard.

01:46:58.577 --> 01:47:04.521
[SPEAKER_02]: Console games are easier to share but cost more, and PC games are harder to share but tend to go on sale more often.

01:47:05.421 --> 01:47:20.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Degenerate Johnny says trick question the gaming community is full of double standards but I get your point honestly it's a feature that benefits Valve's market more than Microsoft's imagine you're a business and your competitor announced a special feature for a product that competes with your products and services

01:47:20.632 --> 01:47:21.132
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com.

01:47:46.136 --> 01:48:09.419
[SPEAKER_02]: another one here on Facebook from Alan Alchemy there has always been an inferred or proven portability with console games packing up an entire system in a backpack and taking it to a friend's place loaning copies of games and so on Microsoft wanted to get rid of that with a strict licensing and killing used games with the online sharing feature being a band-aid to help soothe the burn it didn't work PCs and PC users never really had that narrative

01:48:09.719 --> 01:48:10.179
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:47.928
[SPEAKER_02]: and taking a look over on Google+, Actdeft says, I've actually seen more people complain about Steam's family sharing not being all that much rather than praising it.

01:48:48.468 --> 01:48:58.257
[SPEAKER_02]: For me personally, I praised both of the Xbox One and Steam family sharing since I have to share with my brother and these kinds of services make it a whole lot simpler and I don't have to share accounts this way.

01:48:58.997 --> 01:49:17.846
[SPEAKER_02]: and lastly Travis H says nope not one bit I think that after Microsoft flip-flopped more times than a backward ass politician they deserve every bit of bias and scrutiny they get I don't even think that they knew what they were offering when they were offering it I also think that Microsoft is way too greedy to actually follow through with something as giving as what Steam is doing

01:49:18.406 --> 01:49:21.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam never has failed to impress the hell out of anyone that is a member.

01:49:21.849 --> 01:49:24.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Daily sales, summer and winter sales, weekend deals.

01:49:24.811 --> 01:49:27.093
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, right now I can get all Tomb Raider games for $17.

01:49:28.374 --> 01:49:34.820
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention the 60 plus free games that are there for the taking by anyone who signs up for a free Steam membership.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.544
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a biased heavy PC and PlayStation gamer, I'm probably just talking crazy right now.

01:49:39.864 --> 01:49:41.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of seems like a no-brainer to me though.

01:49:42.506 --> 01:49:43.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of the answers.

01:49:43.688 --> 01:49:46.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Facebook and Google for more answers.

01:49:46.632 --> 01:49:48.054
[SPEAKER_02]: There with the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:49:48.634 --> 01:49:49.616
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:55.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a bias in the way we treat Steam announcements versus the way we treat Microsoft announcements?

01:49:56.397 --> 01:49:57.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on the precedent.

01:49:58.118 --> 01:50:00.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam has done nothing but good things for the most part.

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:02.760
[SPEAKER_06]: We expect to see good from them.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.883
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that when they are offering a service, yeah, I mean, they're a business.

01:50:06.983 --> 01:50:07.723
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to make money.

01:50:07.763 --> 01:50:17.428
[SPEAKER_06]: But we know that they really are trying to put out a service that is going to be good for their... I'm sorry.

01:50:17.628 --> 01:50:18.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Consumer?

01:50:18.509 --> 01:50:19.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for the consumer.

01:50:22.171 --> 01:50:22.291
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

01:50:22.311 --> 01:50:22.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

01:50:23.543 --> 01:50:31.466
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that it's more of like the service was good as it was, but now they're adding another feature, so that's great.

01:50:31.966 --> 01:50:48.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas Microsoft, I don't really trust them too much because of what they've done in the past as far as, first off, all these really crazy ideas, which I still don't think that they're completely against doing, like eliminating the whole retail marketplace so that they can basically control everything.

01:50:48.493 --> 01:50:49.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:50:50.573 --> 01:50:55.975
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, it's a service that if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.

01:50:56.155 --> 01:51:00.017
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like you have to share your library with other people.

01:51:00.277 --> 01:51:01.798
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just an added feature.

01:51:02.638 --> 01:51:07.160
[SPEAKER_11]: You're already doing the DRM stuff with Steam, so it's not that big of a deal.

01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:11.461
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, you're not buying games for the most part for $60 a pop.

01:51:11.681 --> 01:51:12.642
[SPEAKER_11]: You're buying them for...

01:51:14.461 --> 01:51:15.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Very slim fractions of that.

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:18.184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel so bad about it.

01:51:18.364 --> 01:51:21.006
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, one big difference.

01:51:21.467 --> 01:51:27.332
[SPEAKER_02]: I get those tweets that say, why do we always praise Steam but we cut down Microsoft?

01:51:27.912 --> 01:51:31.055
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, there was a lot of confusion with Microsoft.

01:51:31.215 --> 01:51:48.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you may have thought about Microsoft's system They were never really clear with the positives of their system The negatives ended up being pretty clear when they announced that early on But the positives were always a bit of a haze And that was one big problem But here's the other big thing to remember is that

01:51:49.432 --> 01:51:50.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam is not a console.

01:51:51.014 --> 01:51:53.996
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's rumors about the whole Steam box and everything, but Steam is not a console.

01:51:54.036 --> 01:51:55.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam is a delivery method.

01:51:55.237 --> 01:51:56.158
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam is a store.

01:51:56.739 --> 01:52:01.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam is a way of acquiring licenses to play on your PC.

01:52:01.523 --> 01:52:03.565
[SPEAKER_02]: And your PC is ultimately the device.

01:52:04.085 --> 01:52:05.286
[SPEAKER_02]: And the perception...

01:52:06.027 --> 01:52:06.928
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:33.408
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that was one big problem is that, you know, well, even if Steam were to go down or your internet goes down, at least you can still do something with your PC.

01:52:33.948 --> 01:52:44.517
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still do all the other things that are outside of Steam like Photoshop or writing, word processing or games that... Complaining about Steam being down on their... Exactly, through your cell phone or whatever.

01:52:44.937 --> 01:52:52.243
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the perception is your PC is not going to be a freaking brick if these, you know, negatives, you know, were to occur or whatever.

01:52:52.343 --> 01:52:52.503
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:52:53.644 --> 01:53:10.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't think there's any reason why Microsoft can't, and I've been hooting and hollering about this for weeks now on the show, months, is that there's no reason Microsoft can't say, okay, well, if Steam is more of a delivery method, then why don't we invoke multiple delivery methods on the Xbox One?

01:53:10.575 --> 01:53:17.340
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either go buy a disc at the store, at Amazon, at Walmart, at GameStop, whatever.

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it home, put it in your console, and it's all the restrictions and things you're used to.

01:53:21.703 --> 01:53:24.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Your disc has to be in the console for it to work, etc., etc.

01:53:25.206 --> 01:53:32.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can have the Microsoft Store that sells digital licenses that work in this whole new way, and you can family share.

01:53:33.353 --> 01:53:33.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.896
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm literally saying Microsoft should set up two different stores.

01:53:39.477 --> 01:53:40.537
[SPEAKER_02]: It could appease everybody.

01:53:40.778 --> 01:53:42.518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I would see the negative in that.

01:53:43.699 --> 01:53:46.560
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's my big thoughts on the issue.

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:51.082
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for sharing yours over at Facebook.

01:53:51.162 --> 01:53:55.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus page.

01:53:57.108 --> 01:54:06.540
[SPEAKER_02]: So, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, BlackWolf says, actually, when Lightning took out my internet for five days, my PC did feel like a brick.

01:54:07.801 --> 01:54:11.966
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, your Xbox One would have been a brick, too, especially under those old policies.

01:54:12.087 --> 01:54:12.807
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean...

01:54:13.989 --> 01:54:21.217
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, will people change their tune if the Steam Box has the same requirements and things we didn't like about the original Xbox One?

01:54:21.577 --> 01:54:23.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely, I think people wouldn't buy it.

01:54:23.319 --> 01:54:24.780
[SPEAKER_11]: The Steam Box is going to be a PC.

01:54:25.761 --> 01:54:27.443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be a PC.

01:54:27.563 --> 01:54:28.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think it will do that.

01:54:29.365 --> 01:54:29.465
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:54:30.246 --> 01:54:36.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Datatrack in chat says, as if the normal store isn't already confusing enough.

01:54:36.509 --> 01:54:37.509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I see that.

01:54:37.549 --> 01:54:40.150
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe, I mean, I don't think it's super confusing.

01:54:40.271 --> 01:54:42.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, confusing to navigate maybe.

01:54:43.272 --> 01:54:44.092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give you that.

01:54:44.632 --> 01:54:46.593
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not always easy to find what you want.

01:54:46.793 --> 01:54:48.354
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, right now it's pretty simple.

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:50.055
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the game, it's on your drive, there it is.

01:54:50.495 --> 01:54:52.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding what you want might be another problem, but...

01:54:54.767 --> 01:54:59.969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also, once again, back complaining about how it would have been.

01:55:01.809 --> 01:55:03.590
[SPEAKER_11]: Their marketplace would have been locked down.

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:09.272
[SPEAKER_11]: There's really only one place you can get your digital content from, and that's Microsoft.

01:55:09.732 --> 01:55:14.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas, if I want to get digital content from Steam, I have a ton of avenues for it.

01:55:14.213 --> 01:55:16.034
[SPEAKER_11]: I have multiple retailers out there.

01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:18.055
[SPEAKER_11]: I can buy a physical copy of it.

01:55:18.155 --> 01:55:21.816
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, you can buy a physical copy of the disc if you went to any retailer for...

01:55:22.476 --> 01:55:23.097
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.041
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

01:55:44.462 --> 01:55:47.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Because really, they're not spending that much for the packaged media.

01:55:47.245 --> 01:55:52.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, it only costs a few bucks, maybe two or three dollars to actually make that packaged media.

01:55:52.571 --> 01:55:56.675
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're even cutting back on that by not printing the manuals anymore or doing any of that stuff.

01:55:57.036 --> 01:55:57.216
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:55:58.137 --> 01:56:02.641
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to see a huge discount in games from Microsoft because they have it locked down.

01:56:02.681 --> 01:56:05.244
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, now they can keep games at a higher price.

01:56:05.304 --> 01:56:11.810
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at Vita, for example, in the digital marketplace that was on PlayStation Network for some of the older PSP titles.

01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:17.635
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't drop the digital price on them even though they're dropping price at retail for whatever reason.

01:56:18.436 --> 01:56:21.919
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just how it works when you have a single marketplace to get something.

01:56:22.557 --> 01:56:25.159
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go back into some gaming news.

01:56:25.279 --> 01:56:27.922
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, I know you teased these stories a little earlier.

01:56:28.442 --> 01:56:32.025
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so let's talk a little bit more about Ouya's Free the Games Fund.

01:56:32.065 --> 01:56:33.366
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's kind of what happened.

01:56:33.766 --> 01:56:36.909
[SPEAKER_11]: They announced the Free the Games Fund back in July.

01:56:36.949 --> 01:56:49.860
[SPEAKER_11]: It was going to be this fund that was going to match any earnings from these crowdfunded campaigns, probably through Kickstarter, if their goal was $50,000 or more.

01:56:51.281 --> 01:57:06.293
[SPEAKER_11]: and then on top of that, the game that had the largest earnings, I guess, for it through Kickstarter would get an additional $100,000 and anything else would have been backed or matched by Ouya.

01:57:06.873 --> 01:57:11.597
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at the end of August, there were two games that met that goal.

01:57:11.897 --> 01:57:16.621
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one being Elementary My Dear Homes and the second one is Gridiron Thunder.

01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:24.963
[SPEAKER_11]: Elementary My Dear Homes, as we talked about last week, was the campaign was pulled because of a bunch of fake accounts on there.

01:57:25.023 --> 01:57:37.167
[SPEAKER_11]: They had them named after fictional characters, sports celebrities, all these different people that definitely weren't actually backing the game, but they had basically put their own money into the project so that they'd meet their goal.

01:57:37.627 --> 01:57:41.989
[SPEAKER_11]: So then that way, when they make their $50,000, Ouya matches that $50,000, and then they make a profit off of it.

01:57:46.090 --> 01:57:46.911
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:18.723
[SPEAKER_11]: So, obviously there was some sort of fraud going on there because it just seems a little fishy that these few people are not even requesting any sort of... They're not selecting a $10,000 option.

01:58:18.763 --> 01:58:23.728
[SPEAKER_11]: They're selecting no prize or gift whatsoever.

01:58:23.748 --> 01:58:26.250
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just backing it with multiple thousands of dollars.

01:58:27.712 --> 01:58:46.711
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was obvious that they were doing that and in the case of Gridiron Thunder it was a really shitty looking game that they probably already had finished and in fact it is coming out at the end of this month kind of weird how all of a sudden they were able to turn that game around with over a few hundred thousand dollars in like two weeks

01:58:48.682 --> 01:58:49.563
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the plan all along.

01:58:49.603 --> 01:58:50.964
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to make anything off the game.

01:58:51.505 --> 01:58:53.266
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just going to make it off of this program.

01:58:53.927 --> 01:58:59.152
[SPEAKER_11]: So then Julie Ehrman responds back to this, basically saying that, you know...

01:59:01.282 --> 01:59:02.443
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to change the program at all.

01:59:03.383 --> 01:59:05.024
[SPEAKER_11]: We think things are good the way they are.

01:59:05.504 --> 01:59:08.986
[SPEAKER_11]: We heard your complaints that you think that these are scamming us, but we're not going to do anything.

01:59:09.286 --> 01:59:11.267
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to alter it.

01:59:11.687 --> 01:59:15.789
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of that, there's been a lot of reaction to it.

01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:21.352
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, there's even one more Kickstarter that I believe just posted.

01:59:21.372 --> 01:59:22.973
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's been funded yet.

01:59:23.813 --> 01:59:25.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Dungeons the Eye of Draconis

01:59:41.461 --> 01:59:58.275
[SPEAKER_11]: and this is basically what they said it's all dear pledgers we have been honest up front with you about our situation from the start as you can see we currently are only one quarter of the way to our goal before launching this Kickstarter basically saying let's see here where they get to the part where they're actually funding it with their

01:59:59.576 --> 02:00:14.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, he goes into saying that his father decided to give five checks for a certain amount of dollars to people in the family so that they could each back...

02:00:14.645 --> 02:00:15.785
[SPEAKER_11]: All the tiers are hereby unlocked.

02:00:36.170 --> 02:00:42.097
[SPEAKER_11]: You and previous Kickstarter pledges will receive all three episodes and will stream to you once every few weeks.

02:00:43.939 --> 02:00:45.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone wins in this situation.

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:47.082
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to make an excellent video game for $65,000.

02:00:47.503 --> 02:00:51.828
[SPEAKER_11]: It matches the funds that come in three disbursements

02:00:52.348 --> 02:00:56.751
[SPEAKER_11]: First, $12,500 at the end of the Kickstarter.

02:00:56.911 --> 02:00:59.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, $25,000 when the game is released.

02:00:59.372 --> 02:01:03.074
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, $12,500 after the six months OUYA exclusive.

02:01:03.115 --> 02:01:05.996
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to finish the game before we get the second and third payments.

02:01:06.517 --> 02:01:09.999
[SPEAKER_11]: You will receive the fully expanded trilogy and all this stuff.

02:01:11.059 --> 02:01:15.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to the OUYA funds, we'll be able to afford marketing and have a booth at PAX and all this stuff.

02:01:16.263 --> 02:01:27.261
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's he funded the game so they would get over their minimum otherwise they wouldn't have been able to do it in the first case so they funded with their own money and they're going to pay themselves back with the matched funds

02:01:29.123 --> 02:01:32.164
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I have people reacting to this, including developers.

02:01:32.684 --> 02:01:40.925
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, some people, for example, uh, Sophie Holden, who launched a game called Rose in Time on the Ouya, is going to be pulling her game for the marketplace.

02:01:41.326 --> 02:01:50.887
[SPEAKER_11]: Says basically, uh, you know, Julie's response, it became very apparent to me that the company does not support the indie developers who need the support the most, and they're incapable of correcting their mistake.

02:01:51.227 --> 02:01:53.468
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm simply no longer comfortable supporting the company.

02:01:54.669 --> 02:02:06.629
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know basically saying you know these smaller developers actually need the money and not like a hundred thousand dollars to develop a game right they're not getting the funding that they need to make this game

02:02:07.605 --> 02:02:08.225
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:02:29.358 --> 02:02:30.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:02:48.453 --> 02:03:04.623
[SPEAKER_11]: and unfortunately, that's going to kind of, I think, nix any ideas that they have as far as doing this in the future because if that's all it's going to be is a bunch of abuse from people just releasing shitty apps on the store, then, you know, they're out even more money and what's this really have gained?

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:06.064
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, negative press.

02:03:06.104 --> 02:03:09.486
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people bought Anuja to be an emulator, let's be real.

02:03:09.786 --> 02:03:16.871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that's, you know, and I think it's starting to show that a little bit now through some of the corruption going on in other places.

02:03:16.891 --> 02:03:16.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:03:17.051 --> 02:03:21.014
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and unfortunately, even a lot of these other consoles are probably getting better emulators than this thing.

02:03:33.844 --> 02:03:40.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, news came out this week that Soul Calibur Lost Swords is a free-to-play PlayStation 3 title.

02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:42.210
[SPEAKER_02]: This is according to Famitsu.

02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:44.252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's going to be coming out later this year.

02:03:44.312 --> 02:03:45.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that means in the U.S.

02:03:45.693 --> 02:03:48.135
[SPEAKER_02]: as well, but we know that's for Japan.

02:03:48.915 --> 02:03:51.317
[SPEAKER_02]: It is confirmed it will release in Europe at some point.

02:03:51.838 --> 02:04:00.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco Bandai did file a trademark for this back in July, so we knew something was coming, but I think a lot of people thought maybe like handheld game or spinoff game or something.

02:04:01.284 --> 02:04:03.085
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a free-to-play game.

02:04:03.185 --> 02:04:07.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Siegfried and Mitsurugi are the first characters that are confirmed to be playable in it, but here's the thing about it.

02:04:08.106 --> 02:04:13.327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a single-player game, not really a head-to-head fighter game.

02:04:13.347 --> 02:04:19.228
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it is a free-to-play fighter, but I don't know exactly how that's all going to work out if they say it's single-player.

02:04:20.288 --> 02:04:25.469
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only very, very low-resolution screenshots out there, thanks to Famitsu Magazine's scans right now.

02:04:25.489 --> 02:04:27.630
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wish to buy more resolution, it's going to cost you some money.

02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:29.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Listless

02:04:55.057 --> 02:04:56.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, I love hearing that music.

02:04:56.578 --> 02:04:59.040
[SPEAKER_02]: It always means we're going to have a good time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:06.184
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're going to do, we're going to put together the definitive list around a certain topic.

02:05:06.825 --> 02:05:16.050
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way Listless works, if you don't remember, is that each of us, as well as a guest, who I'll introduce here in a minute, will give our top three answers on this topic.

02:05:16.471 --> 02:05:18.492
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go around, and the tricky part is...

02:05:18.812 --> 02:05:19.372
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

02:05:47.957 --> 02:05:51.719
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's introduce our special guest tonight.

02:05:51.759 --> 02:05:58.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Since three doesn't make for a very good list list, we always like to invite a fourth person from the indie podcast community to come play with us.

02:05:59.264 --> 02:06:03.146
[SPEAKER_02]: So, tonight we have Captain Spike with us on the line.

02:06:03.186 --> 02:06:03.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there, Captain?

02:06:04.707 --> 02:06:05.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Ahoy, can you hear me?

02:06:05.648 --> 02:06:06.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can.

02:06:06.408 --> 02:06:07.129
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Spike?

02:06:07.847 --> 02:06:08.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamebuoy.org Gamebuoy.org

02:06:32.678 --> 02:06:35.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting what's going on with Capcom, isn't it?

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:39.665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really one of those things where you look at it and go, what in the hell are they thinking?

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:41.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you guys come to a different conclusion?

02:06:42.348 --> 02:06:43.349
[SPEAKER_09]: No, rather certainly.

02:06:43.469 --> 02:06:55.380
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that three of the big gems or jewels coming out of the Japanese game development scene right now are tied to stuff that they sort of brought up into the world and, you know,

02:06:56.990 --> 02:07:07.757
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really funny to see them flailing and floundering as all of these really important voices in Japanese games are coming on to sort of their big opuses, so to speak.

02:07:09.118 --> 02:07:13.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, actually, I perked up for just one moment because I thought you said R-Type.

02:07:14.321 --> 02:07:17.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh, I didn't, but... Maybe next time.

02:07:17.623 --> 02:07:20.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there'll be a Game Buoy Micro on that whole series in the future.

02:07:20.985 --> 02:07:23.787
[SPEAKER_02]: If people want to check out that discussion, where can they find that?

02:07:24.839 --> 02:07:30.602
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find that over at GameBooey.org GameBooey.org Thank you.

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:33.464
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to do that since Slidekick isn't on the show tonight, unfortunately.

02:07:34.144 --> 02:07:38.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so tonight's topic for Listless is about the Xbox One.

02:07:38.487 --> 02:07:43.609
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you the specific topic in a minute, but Spike, quickly, your thoughts in a nutshell on Xbox One.

02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:44.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have one pre-ordered?

02:07:46.211 --> 02:07:52.734
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first console in the last decade that I haven't pre-ordered, but if I can find one day one, I'll probably end up buying it.

02:07:53.475 --> 02:07:53.635
Okay.

02:07:54.345 --> 02:07:57.047
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I did with Wii U. I was like, I'm not going to buy it.

02:07:57.087 --> 02:07:57.627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy it.

02:07:57.647 --> 02:07:58.268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy it.

02:07:58.308 --> 02:07:59.449
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I look at my Target app.

02:07:59.549 --> 02:08:00.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's in stock.

02:08:00.609 --> 02:08:00.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.

02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:01.730
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought it.

02:08:02.010 --> 02:08:03.051
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

02:08:03.464 --> 02:08:07.025
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so tonight's list list is all about the Xbox One.

02:08:07.065 --> 02:08:13.306
[SPEAKER_02]: And the topic tonight is thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.

02:08:13.826 --> 02:08:21.247
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the Xbox has taken a lot of kind of kicks in the face when it comes to their DRM policy.

02:08:21.387 --> 02:08:25.008
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the whole 180 reversals they've done on other things.

02:08:25.148 --> 02:08:29.989
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this whole thing with Steam got the family sharing and everybody praised Steam again.

02:08:30.249 --> 02:08:32.693
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think about all that, Spike, before we begin?

02:08:32.733 --> 02:08:37.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think people were fair in praising what Steam was doing versus what Xbox was trying to do?

02:08:38.567 --> 02:08:52.336
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I had loaded up your Facebook for Orange Lounge Radio to comment on this, but I saw comments there that reflected exactly my thought, which is that the PC marketplaces operated so different for so long that it's really not the same thing.

02:08:52.817 --> 02:09:03.724
[SPEAKER_09]: There isn't an expectation of being able to resell and have the portability, as Alan Alkemy had called it, of your games and being able to take your software other places.

02:09:03.964 --> 02:09:05.485
[SPEAKER_09]: For PC, that's not really a thing.

02:09:06.286 --> 02:09:08.047
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think people are, you know,

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:14.751
[SPEAKER_09]: That expectation that exists in the console market for games to stay open, I don't think exists in the PC market.

02:09:15.391 --> 02:09:22.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well if you are playing along with us at live.vognetwork.com you're going to see that pop up right on your screen.

02:09:22.596 --> 02:09:25.017
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put up the board there for Listless tonight.

02:09:25.338 --> 02:09:30.041
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.

02:09:30.061 --> 02:09:33.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know, everybody just really wants to be popular at the end of the day.

02:09:34.483 --> 02:09:35.864
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to get their mojo back.

02:09:35.964 --> 02:09:36.345
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to...

02:09:37.105 --> 02:09:38.546
[SPEAKER_07]: That song just popped into my head.

02:09:38.586 --> 02:09:38.986
[SPEAKER_02]: What song?

02:09:39.006 --> 02:09:40.047
[SPEAKER_07]: The Not A Surf song.

02:09:41.068 --> 02:09:42.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Popular.

02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:45.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unfortunately, you get Come On Down as your theme song tonight.

02:09:45.391 --> 02:09:45.871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you get.

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:46.151
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:09:46.711 --> 02:09:49.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Spike, since you are our guest, we're going to let you go first tonight.

02:09:50.014 --> 02:09:56.498
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your number three answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet tonight?

02:09:56.558 --> 02:10:01.821
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, sorry, before you answer, if you want to play along in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

02:10:01.901 --> 02:10:02.442
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes...

02:10:02.822 --> 02:10:06.686
[SPEAKER_02]: We steal chat answers and replace our own with chat answers.

02:10:06.746 --> 02:10:09.669
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out your answers in chat as we go along with this.

02:10:09.689 --> 02:10:11.330
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Spike, what is your number three thing?

02:10:12.552 --> 02:10:14.834
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about popular on the internet, right?

02:10:14.874 --> 02:10:16.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Not actual popular.

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Popular on the internet was what was said.

02:10:18.758 --> 02:10:20.940
[SPEAKER_02]: So serious or funny, whatever you want to do.

02:10:21.841 --> 02:10:22.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good.

02:10:22.782 --> 02:10:25.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy Sega, rename the Xbox One as the Dreamcast 2.

02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:31.220
[SPEAKER_02]: So rename it to the Dreamcast 2.

02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:35.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't that come up as an answer in another list at some point?

02:10:36.084 --> 02:10:38.506
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was name of system maybe?

02:10:38.586 --> 02:10:39.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps, yeah.

02:10:39.606 --> 02:10:40.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing to name the system.

02:10:41.328 --> 02:10:43.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well that could do it.

02:10:43.469 --> 02:10:52.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a lot of posts on Twitter and so forth not that long ago on 9999 Remember the Dreamcast XOXO Love you 5 ever, right?

02:10:53.757 --> 02:10:58.821
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember sitting on the ground outside waiting in line at Arden Fair Mall

02:11:00.003 --> 02:11:01.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there it is up on the board.

02:11:01.404 --> 02:11:02.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Rename it to the Dreamcast 2.

02:11:03.005 --> 02:11:05.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, what is your number three answer?

02:11:06.167 --> 02:11:10.270
[SPEAKER_11]: My number three answer would be they need to drop the price of that system at least $100.

02:11:13.208 --> 02:11:13.808
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:49.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we just embrace what the people really want?

02:11:49.212 --> 02:11:49.933
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

02:11:49.993 --> 02:11:51.554
[SPEAKER_02]: It helped VHS win that war.

02:11:53.216 --> 02:11:56.798
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go on to DarkSakura, your number three answer.

02:11:56.938 --> 02:11:59.821
[SPEAKER_02]: What could the Xbox One do to be popular on the internet again?

02:12:00.261 --> 02:12:02.202
[SPEAKER_06]: A pack-in with every online order?

02:12:02.383 --> 02:12:02.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Waffle iron.

02:12:04.224 --> 02:12:05.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Free waffle iron with every online order.

02:12:08.227 --> 02:12:10.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget a game or a controller.

02:12:11.009 --> 02:12:13.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Give people what they really want and that's waffles.

02:12:13.331 --> 02:12:14.472
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already waffling.

02:12:20.051 --> 02:12:23.414
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of dumb and amazing at the same time right now.

02:12:26.656 --> 02:12:27.557
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I made a pun.

02:12:27.617 --> 02:12:28.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get it.

02:12:28.638 --> 02:12:31.140
[SPEAKER_02]: A free waffle iron because they're waffling.

02:12:32.601 --> 02:12:33.241
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good lord.

02:12:33.361 --> 02:12:43.429
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Captain Spike, I don't know how you're going to one-up that, but good luck to you as you go into your number two answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.

02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:52.207
[SPEAKER_09]: Fling Phil Fish to the moon What do you have against Phil Fish?

02:12:54.147 --> 02:12:55.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just say everything?

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:58.229
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose that's a valid response.

02:12:58.609 --> 02:13:01.111
[SPEAKER_02]: But how would that sell Xboxes?

02:13:01.291 --> 02:13:06.794
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be something that you could only watch it on the Slingshot app or something?

02:13:07.354 --> 02:13:10.856
[SPEAKER_09]: It would get the Xbox One popular on the internet.

02:13:11.256 --> 02:13:11.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.

02:13:12.036 --> 02:13:14.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Tie it to a stream on your Xbox One only.

02:13:15.218 --> 02:13:16.439
[SPEAKER_09]: People would buy it to watch that.

02:13:16.779 --> 02:13:16.979
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a

02:13:17.359 --> 02:13:19.340
[SPEAKER_02]: The pay-per-view event of the millennium.

02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:22.100
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to fling Phil Fish into the moon.

02:13:24.041 --> 02:13:24.481
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:13:25.641 --> 02:13:33.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, dare I ask, what is your number two answer tonight for a thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet?

02:13:34.204 --> 02:13:34.884
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

02:13:35.564 --> 02:13:37.265
[SPEAKER_11]: Be backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.

02:13:40.424 --> 02:13:42.325
[SPEAKER_02]: Very serious answers for me tonight, Loki.

02:13:42.385 --> 02:13:44.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is backwards compatibility... No, it's fine.

02:13:44.606 --> 02:13:46.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is backwards compatibility so important?

02:13:46.806 --> 02:13:52.149
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, but people bitch about it, so... It would make it important.

02:13:52.389 --> 02:13:55.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's about being popular on the internet when all is said and done, right?

02:13:56.110 --> 02:13:57.431
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's put that up on the board.

02:13:57.471 --> 02:14:00.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki says backwards compatibility with the 360.

02:14:01.072 --> 02:14:05.574
[SPEAKER_02]: My number two answer... My number two answer is... Okay, so...

02:14:06.594 --> 02:14:10.117
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know everybody's losing their shit about Killer Instinct, right?

02:14:10.137 --> 02:14:19.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Killer Instinct got its big remake, even though it's interesting it's only going to have six to eight characters, but I guess that's a whole nother Oprah.

02:14:19.325 --> 02:14:20.406
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said, you know what?

02:14:20.506 --> 02:14:29.313
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were being teased for so long about that Rare is going to bring back a classic franchise, I had my fingers and toes crossed for a different franchise to come back.

02:14:29.353 --> 02:14:33.556
[SPEAKER_02]: So my number two answer is give us the Rare remake we really want.

02:14:34.137 --> 02:14:35.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Anticipation.

02:14:40.974 --> 02:14:46.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I'm just going to shorten that to Make Rare Do a New Anticipation Game as my number two answer.

02:14:46.936 --> 02:14:48.016
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put that up on the board.

02:14:48.737 --> 02:14:51.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?

02:14:52.734 --> 02:15:21.974
[SPEAKER_06]: a more interactive banning system meaning like a I'm trying to remember how to phrase this like a smart list where when people get certain amounts of complaints made against them and I'm talking about real time complaining for people on Xbox Live that it puts a mark on them they get a certain number of marks they're banned or sent to a moderator review to see if they're legit or you get to sit in the chair next that flings you to the moon yes but I mean but I mean

02:15:23.414 --> 02:15:44.128
[SPEAKER_02]: either that or something that completely removes the anonymity alright you know just some way to hold people you should be publicly shamed a way to hold people accountable for being shits on Xbox Live so I did shorten that to the more interactive banning system but I honestly think maybe that should just be put DarkSakura in charge of Xbox Live

02:15:48.878 --> 02:15:51.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's recap what we have on the board so far.

02:15:51.959 --> 02:15:54.600
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.

02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:56.081
[SPEAKER_02]: Rename it to Dreamcast 2.

02:15:56.801 --> 02:15:58.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Fling Phil Fish to the moon.

02:15:58.562 --> 02:15:59.743
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop the price at least $101.

02:16:00.983 --> 02:16:02.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Backwards compatibility with 360.

02:16:03.184 --> 02:16:04.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Pornography app.

02:16:04.605 --> 02:16:06.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Make Rare do a new anticipation.

02:16:06.826 --> 02:16:08.847
[SPEAKER_02]: A free waffle iron with every order.

02:16:09.287 --> 02:16:11.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a more interactive banning system.

02:16:12.188 --> 02:16:16.689
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, boy, this elimination is going to be some of the hardest ever tonight.

02:16:16.769 --> 02:16:19.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what folks have for their number one answers tonight.

02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:26.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Spike, your number one answer for what Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.

02:16:27.352 --> 02:16:29.012
[SPEAKER_09]: I call this one the Nintendo method.

02:16:29.833 --> 02:16:38.175
[SPEAKER_09]: Money Hat, a hipster games exclusive that everyone claims to want but wouldn't actually buy, like Mega Man Legends 3 or Shenmue 3.

02:16:41.018 --> 02:16:42.322
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think how to shorten that.

02:16:42.362 --> 02:16:43.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Hipster exclusives.

02:16:46.764 --> 02:16:52.567
[SPEAKER_02]: and why would Mega Man and Shenmue more than others bring all the boys to the yard?

02:16:53.548 --> 02:17:00.912
[SPEAKER_09]: Because both of these games are games where everyone on the internet claims to have loved these games and played them and ooh, I remember that.

02:17:01.653 --> 02:17:04.854
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that many people played these games, they would have been commercial success.

02:17:06.215 --> 02:17:09.617
[SPEAKER_06]: But mind you, a lot of people pirated them on Dreamcast.

02:17:11.258 --> 02:17:11.878
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

02:17:12.058 --> 02:17:14.260
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they really loved it, they would have spent the money on it.

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:14.800
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:15.800
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:18.082
[SPEAKER_02]: You even have people in chat right now.

02:17:18.162 --> 02:17:20.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream says, Shenmue 3, motherfucker.

02:17:20.183 --> 02:17:21.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it so much.

02:17:23.544 --> 02:17:23.845
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:17:24.525 --> 02:17:25.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer, Spike.

02:17:26.006 --> 02:17:27.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what is your number one answer tonight?

02:17:28.527 --> 02:17:29.247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:53.622
[SPEAKER_02]: So the box is now an artificial kitten.

02:17:54.283 --> 02:17:54.803
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

02:17:56.044 --> 02:17:57.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Because who doesn't love cats?

02:17:57.784 --> 02:17:58.325
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

02:17:58.405 --> 02:17:59.125
[SPEAKER_11]: The internet.

02:17:59.365 --> 02:17:59.805
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't.

02:17:59.825 --> 02:18:00.166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:18:00.246 --> 02:18:01.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet loves cats.

02:18:01.566 --> 02:18:03.727
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, how do we be popular on the internet?

02:18:04.128 --> 02:18:04.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats.

02:18:04.728 --> 02:18:05.088
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats.

02:18:05.288 --> 02:18:05.628
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:18:05.828 --> 02:18:06.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent answer.

02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:07.189
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:18:07.249 --> 02:18:08.550
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one answer.

02:18:09.550 --> 02:18:14.773
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went for something serious tonight, and I'm surprised nobody said it yet, unless maybe DarkSakura was sitting on it.

02:18:14.813 --> 02:18:16.074
[SPEAKER_02]: But if so, I apologize.

02:18:16.454 --> 02:18:20.136
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the thing people want most of all, detach, connect.

02:18:21.755 --> 02:18:24.196
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:18:49.962 --> 02:18:53.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Making OLR the official voice of Microsoft.

02:18:58.755 --> 02:18:59.556
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:21.531
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're not watching.

02:19:21.651 --> 02:19:23.372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it needs to be detached.

02:19:23.452 --> 02:19:28.096
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's the porn channel.

02:19:28.316 --> 02:19:29.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's run down the list real quick.

02:19:30.017 --> 02:19:36.562
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need it up so you can choose what to eliminate, go to live.vognetwork.com Here is the list as it stands right now.

02:19:37.102 --> 02:20:04.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Rename it to Dreamcast 2 Fling Phil Fish to the moon Hipster exclusives like Mega Man Legends and Shenmue 3 Drop the price at least $101 Backwards compatibility with the 360 The box is now an artificial kitten Pornography app Make Rare do a new anticipation Detach Connect A free waffle iron with every order A more interactive banning system And OLR becomes the official voice of Microsoft That is a great list tonight This is going to be painful tonight

02:20:05.029 --> 02:20:05.549
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:20:25.214 --> 02:20:29.075
[SPEAKER_09]: Making Orange Lounge Radio the official voice of Microsoft because I don't want you to sell out.

02:20:29.235 --> 02:20:31.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay independent.

02:20:31.596 --> 02:20:33.136
[SPEAKER_02]: He did sugarcoat that in a very good way.

02:20:33.196 --> 02:20:36.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we said we'd sell out in an instant if people wanted to pay us.

02:20:37.757 --> 02:20:38.978
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

02:20:39.078 --> 02:20:43.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's just a little jealous because there was no room for GameBooey.org in that sentence.

02:20:43.799 --> 02:20:47.260
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should just put it VOG and pals.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:48.140
[SPEAKER_06]: VOG and pals.

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:48.640
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:51.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally, GameBooey would be the right voice for Microsoft.

02:20:53.584 --> 02:21:08.194
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so far up Nintendo's ass, I don't think you would know what to say They care about game design, I'm here for that It is stricken from the list Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:21:09.135 --> 02:21:17.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because it's silly and they don't really make a ton of games anymore Buying Sega and calling it the Dreamcast 2

02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're going to eliminate the Dreamcast 2.

02:21:21.262 --> 02:21:22.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:21:22.802 --> 02:21:23.362
[SPEAKER_02]: You ass.

02:21:23.463 --> 02:21:24.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's alright.

02:21:24.863 --> 02:21:26.084
[SPEAKER_02]: It is stricken from the list.

02:21:26.164 --> 02:21:27.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Rename it to Dreamcast 2.

02:21:27.544 --> 02:21:28.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.

02:21:28.785 --> 02:21:32.006
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that comes to my turn.

02:21:32.146 --> 02:21:33.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, this is so hard.

02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:44.075
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the internet's gonna totally hate me for this, but I am gonna say the box is now an artificial kitten.

02:21:44.535 --> 02:21:51.880
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, it's, it's, I like cats, don't get me wrong, but something about the eyeball, like, fucking freaks the shit out of me.

02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:54.422
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want that Xbox to turn into that.

02:21:54.442 --> 02:21:55.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ever bring over my eyeball?

02:21:55.563 --> 02:21:56.344
[SPEAKER_06]: I want an eyeball.

02:21:57.885 --> 02:22:00.547
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, I'm gonna eliminate the artificial kitten.

02:22:00.567 --> 02:22:03.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I really want an eyeball, because I want to see what Midna would do.

02:22:03.089 --> 02:22:06.992
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially now that I think of it, a box that poops is also probably not a good idea.

02:22:07.612 --> 02:22:08.713
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about it.

02:22:08.813 --> 02:22:10.374
[SPEAKER_02]: It is removed from the list.

02:22:10.894 --> 02:22:12.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Real cats are better anyway.

02:22:12.715 --> 02:22:17.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so DarkSakura, last but not least, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:22:18.098 --> 02:22:18.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Anticipation.

02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:25.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm sorry, the only anticipation I care about comes from Frank's mouth.

02:22:29.365 --> 02:22:30.206
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you did there.

02:22:30.646 --> 02:22:33.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, only because you phrased that in a great way.

02:22:33.789 --> 02:22:34.229
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

02:22:34.329 --> 02:22:36.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Make rare, do a new anticipation, is removed from the list.

02:22:36.811 --> 02:22:40.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting the way that worked out tonight because nobody got hosed with two eliminations.

02:22:40.974 --> 02:22:44.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Each host got one taken off, so fair enough, fair enough.

02:22:44.877 --> 02:22:50.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Spike, we're going to put it to a vote of the public, but hey, I want to thank you for being here tonight.

02:22:51.451 --> 02:23:21.183
[SPEAKER_09]: oh thank you so much for having me not a problem let's plug your show one more time where can folks hear you on the interwebs and what kind of fun topics do you have coming up next on your show that is GameBooey.org oh sorry it just reflects to wait for someone to repeat it oh GameBooey.org and coming up we have a researched episode on bootleg games Cheetah Man and Donkey Kong Returns 99 and that sort of thing

02:23:21.448 --> 02:23:24.170
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheetahman is awesome and horrible.

02:23:25.992 --> 02:23:31.496
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how you say it's a researched, as opposed to so much other stuff out there on the internet like this program.

02:23:32.237 --> 02:23:33.758
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob, have you ever played Cheetahman?

02:23:34.299 --> 02:23:34.599
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

02:23:34.659 --> 02:23:36.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever played Cheetahman or any of the sequels?

02:23:36.881 --> 02:23:39.443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, actually, in all honesty.

02:23:39.603 --> 02:23:40.384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was bad.

02:23:40.984 --> 02:23:42.425
[SPEAKER_02]: The music is super good, though.

02:23:42.465 --> 02:23:44.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about like Color Dreams games on the NES?

02:23:44.807 --> 02:23:45.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:23:46.330 --> 02:23:48.151
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a thing we talk about, yes.

02:23:48.372 --> 02:23:49.672
[SPEAKER_09]: And the 10-gen games.

02:23:49.813 --> 02:23:50.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

02:23:50.513 --> 02:23:51.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those were really horrible.

02:23:51.734 --> 02:23:55.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who was like the worst NES game in history.

02:23:55.616 --> 02:23:56.577
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so horrible.

02:23:57.037 --> 02:23:58.959
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Bible Adventures.

02:23:59.239 --> 02:24:00.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, awesome.

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I will say this.

02:24:02.141 --> 02:24:04.743
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are always very well-researched over there.

02:24:05.083 --> 02:24:09.186
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people may not know this about you, Captain Spike, but you're like a freaking encyclopedia when it comes to games.

02:24:09.206 --> 02:24:11.887
[SPEAKER_02]: You know an awful lot, domestic and import.

02:24:11.967 --> 02:24:15.670
[SPEAKER_02]: So people should check it out if they want to hear something really educated.

02:24:16.871 --> 02:24:17.411
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, thank you.

02:24:17.491 --> 02:24:18.932
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for your kind words.

02:24:19.092 --> 02:24:19.832
[SPEAKER_09]: I love your show.

02:24:20.272 --> 02:24:20.953
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time fan.

02:24:21.013 --> 02:24:21.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for having me.

02:24:21.773 --> 02:24:23.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're long time fans of you, Spike.

02:24:23.294 --> 02:24:24.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back and say hi in studio sometime.

02:24:25.928 --> 02:24:27.449
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, my friend.

02:24:27.810 --> 02:24:29.771
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Spike, help us out tonight.

02:24:29.811 --> 02:24:31.192
[SPEAKER_02]: We are about to make this answerable.

02:24:31.232 --> 02:24:36.897
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to remind people as they vote on this, you get to vote for your number one and your number two pick.

02:24:37.177 --> 02:24:38.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Your first click will be your number one.

02:24:39.039 --> 02:24:40.680
[SPEAKER_02]: Your second click will be your number two.

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:42.621
[SPEAKER_02]: So think before you vote.

02:24:43.002 --> 02:24:45.904
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now put to the vote of the listeners.

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:48.846
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us come up with the definitive list.

02:24:49.627 --> 02:24:52.469
[SPEAKER_02]: We will keep this open for a few minutes while we...

02:24:53.871 --> 02:24:56.554
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a mail One email tonight And apparently we can get cheap Viagra

02:25:05.856 --> 02:25:33.728
[SPEAKER_02]: yay live.vognetwork.com while we open up the mailbag and if you want to send us an email about Viagra or otherwise mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com maybe you could send us a well researched email on bootleg games and we can one up what Game Boy is doing you know what I have to make a mention of something by the way I've seen a lot of people try to do stuff on GoFundMe and I wonder if I put up a GoFundMe if people would send me to Comiket laughing

02:25:35.189 --> 02:25:36.530
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are they gonna get out of it?

02:25:37.170 --> 02:25:38.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Me at Comiket?

02:25:40.212 --> 02:25:41.352
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bring back toilet paper.

02:25:42.958 --> 02:25:45.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what's that email we got tonight, DarkSakura?

02:25:45.399 --> 02:25:48.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we got something from CatastrophicMagi, who I chat with all the time on Steam.

02:25:49.922 --> 02:25:53.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Even and all, it's your very favorite CatastrophicMagi.

02:25:53.103 --> 02:25:53.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Smile.

02:25:54.304 --> 02:25:59.507
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been pretty psyched for Telltale's new game, A Wolf Among Us, which is a prequel to the Fables comics.

02:26:00.127 --> 02:26:01.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Fables comics, for the record.

02:26:02.208 --> 02:26:06.690
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys haven't mentioned it yet, apart from Jamie, who I'm continually pestering on Steam anyway.

02:26:07.011 --> 02:26:08.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen anything about it yet?

02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:09.112
[SPEAKER_06]: And he linked us the trailer.

02:26:10.354 --> 02:26:13.931
[SPEAKER_06]: In other news, I honestly haven't seen anything on it by the way.

02:26:16.194 --> 02:26:19.055
[SPEAKER_06]: In other news, I've always wanted to go to one of the big American cons.

02:26:19.336 --> 02:26:23.999
[SPEAKER_06]: So given VOG's ties with DragonCon nowadays, I'm going to aim for that one in 2015.

02:26:24.319 --> 02:26:25.540
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd better be there, Rob.

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:25.540
2015?

02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:26.680
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:26:27.301 --> 02:26:27.441
[SPEAKER_02]: Not 14.

02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:30.203
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time to save up.

02:26:30.243 --> 02:26:30.763
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right.

02:26:30.803 --> 02:26:31.523
[SPEAKER_02]: It does take time.

02:26:31.564 --> 02:26:32.044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

02:26:33.044 --> 02:26:39.869
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have as good of a time next year as I did this year, and I don't see why I wouldn't, I would absolutely go back every year as long as I can afford it.

02:26:40.731 --> 02:26:41.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hear you later, Magi.

02:26:42.492 --> 02:26:48.898
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know how well it's going to do to play the trailer on the air.

02:26:48.938 --> 02:26:52.100
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't really want to play it on the air, but where can people look that up?

02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:52.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just on YouTube?

02:26:52.881 --> 02:26:53.661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on YouTube.

02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:54.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people can look that up on YouTube.

02:26:54.722 --> 02:26:55.883
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's A Wolf Among Us.

02:26:56.224 --> 02:26:56.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

02:26:56.984 --> 02:26:58.766
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just Google that and you'll find that.

02:26:59.166 --> 02:27:02.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, and I pretty much do kind of chat with Magi every day, come to think of it.

02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:10.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he chatted with me on Steam once in a while, too, and he was good enough to... He's the one that got me... Oh, God, and now I forgot the name of that game.

02:27:10.044 --> 02:27:10.865
[SPEAKER_02]: That other scary game.

02:27:10.885 --> 02:27:12.545
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranormal, the one that I played.

02:27:12.866 --> 02:27:15.067
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another scary game that I played a little bit.

02:27:15.367 --> 02:27:21.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Magi's been trying to get me into Shin Megami Tensei, which I probably will play it eventually.

02:27:22.051 --> 02:27:23.492
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a bunch of games on my plate, man.

02:27:25.225 --> 02:27:26.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's it.

02:27:27.789 --> 02:27:36.183
[SPEAKER_06]: One email apart from Viagra, which I don't know about you, but I have no problems with that part of anyone's anatomy.

02:27:37.819 --> 02:27:42.641
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we are going to move on with some news.

02:27:43.361 --> 02:27:47.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can vote in the list list tonight, live.vognetwork.com.

02:27:47.662 --> 02:27:52.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, before we get to the news, we have to get to the angst with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

02:27:52.944 --> 02:27:56.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we do a segment called the FUs of the Week on the video game show?

02:27:57.105 --> 02:28:02.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you were me fighting the Cerberus boss in Kingdom Hearts earlier today, there was a lot of rage.

02:28:18.874 --> 02:28:22.355
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give a big F you to anti-Semitism.

02:28:23.516 --> 02:28:32.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just because of things that happened earlier, but because it's... And this is the people who are like, oh, well, we're Christians and we're persecuted here in America.

02:28:32.939 --> 02:28:33.439
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're not.

02:28:33.719 --> 02:28:43.022
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to have the cops at your Christmas services to keep people from, you know, breaking into your cars or throwing bricks at your place of worship.

02:28:43.182 --> 02:28:45.323
[SPEAKER_06]: So, an F you to that, you know.

02:28:46.863 --> 02:28:47.983
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to intolerance in general.

02:28:48.003 --> 02:28:49.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, F you to intolerance.

02:28:50.564 --> 02:28:54.245
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just, you know, and the cops have been really good about it every year.

02:28:54.545 --> 02:28:56.906
[SPEAKER_06]: They just make a presence and we don't have any trouble.

02:28:57.506 --> 02:29:01.167
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just still think it's horrible that it's necessary.

02:29:01.807 --> 02:29:02.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

02:29:02.647 --> 02:29:04.588
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to that.

02:29:05.568 --> 02:29:06.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

02:29:08.697 --> 02:29:16.104
[SPEAKER_11]: FU2, Logan's Roadhouse, their fried cheese hamburger because it was not good.

02:29:16.905 --> 02:29:23.171
[SPEAKER_11]: You would think that a patty of fried cheese would be good on a burger, but it was not.

02:29:23.191 --> 02:29:24.772
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you need to go to Squeeze In.

02:29:26.153 --> 02:29:28.355
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been to Squeeze In, and their burgers are not good.

02:29:28.535 --> 02:29:39.882
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was sorely disappointed because, you know, it sounded awesome, like a cheese skirt, but they burn the shit out of their burgers, and they don't season the patties at all, and so they tasted like crap.

02:29:39.982 --> 02:29:46.106
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember, like, the last really good hamburger I had where I went like, mmm, that is a tasty burger!

02:29:46.166 --> 02:29:49.568
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Robin's burgers are pretty good if you put a ton of their seasoned salt on it.

02:29:50.168 --> 02:29:51.449
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes their burgers taste really good.

02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:52.090
[SPEAKER_11]: I like In-N-Out.

02:29:53.010 --> 02:29:55.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I'm going to have to take you to California Burger around my house.

02:29:55.191 --> 02:29:56.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I like Smash Burger.

02:29:56.392 --> 02:29:57.092
[SPEAKER_06]: I took Alan there.

02:29:57.493 --> 02:29:57.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

02:29:58.093 --> 02:29:58.673
[SPEAKER_06]: He really liked it.

02:29:58.793 --> 02:29:59.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

02:29:59.874 --> 02:30:03.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he sent me a picture, and I was like, that burger is drenched in mayonnaise.

02:30:03.116 --> 02:30:04.036
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks disgusting.

02:30:04.116 --> 02:30:06.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can get it without.

02:30:06.898 --> 02:30:07.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

02:30:07.478 --> 02:30:09.900
[SPEAKER_06]: They do Thousand Island dressing and other stuff, too.

02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:11.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's all the devil's work.

02:30:12.541 --> 02:30:13.601
[SPEAKER_06]: I love mayonnaise for the record.

02:30:15.062 --> 02:30:17.743
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to mayonnaise, first and foremost, every week.

02:30:18.483 --> 02:30:26.786
[SPEAKER_02]: And my other FU goes to, you know, as much as I love this time of year pumpkin everything, it's making me die.

02:30:27.346 --> 02:30:36.749
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU to all the sugar that I'm eating right now, and it's making me gain weight when I should be trying to lose it to do sexy cosplay next year at DragonCon.

02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:38.270
[SPEAKER_02]: So FU to sugar.

02:30:39.929 --> 02:30:40.890
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I add another one, Rob?

02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:41.330
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:30:41.970 --> 02:30:42.951
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next story.

02:30:43.331 --> 02:30:44.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can add another one.

02:30:44.952 --> 02:30:49.134
[SPEAKER_06]: A big F you to all of the people who are sending poor hussy death threats.

02:30:49.755 --> 02:30:52.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you don't like the... This is a Homestuck thing, by the way.

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:52.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

02:30:52.937 --> 02:30:55.618
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you don't like what happened in the last update.

02:30:55.778 --> 02:30:57.579
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of us were like, oh shit.

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:02.342
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's no reason to send somebody freaking death threats.

02:31:02.542 --> 02:31:03.603
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a story.

02:31:04.403 --> 02:31:07.225
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to commend him for being very positive about the whole thing.

02:31:09.273 --> 02:31:21.807
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very mature sign when the author who is apparently receiving said teenage crap is being very gracious and focusing on the good parts of the fandom.

02:31:23.208 --> 02:31:23.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:25.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem Forever

02:31:42.473 --> 02:31:54.589
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys remember, but a few months ago, there was this whole lawsuit with 3D Realms trying to get their royalties from Gearbox and all that stuff.

02:31:54.689 --> 02:31:57.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they were owed $2 million.

02:31:59.154 --> 02:32:01.217
[SPEAKER_11]: But apparently they've dropped the case.

02:32:01.938 --> 02:32:04.101
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if they've settled it or what the case is.

02:32:04.261 --> 02:32:13.894
[SPEAKER_11]: After reviewing evidence regarding our business affairs and without any money exchanging hands, we have satisfactorily resolved any and all differences we perceived against Gearbox.

02:32:15.095 --> 02:32:16.217
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they've apologized.

02:32:19.201 --> 02:32:22.243
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what that means, but... Boy.

02:32:22.964 --> 02:32:23.224
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:32:23.404 --> 02:32:26.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting how that all ended with an apology.

02:32:27.027 --> 02:32:28.408
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, basically, here's the press release.

02:32:28.428 --> 02:32:28.688
[SPEAKER_11]: It says,

02:32:38.155 --> 02:32:57.047
[SPEAKER_11]: In all sincerity, we regret the misunderstanding that instigated our lawsuit, and now that we better understand and appreciate the actual nature of our business matters, we have voluntarily withdrawn our claims against Gearbox with genuine apologies to Randy for any damage that our lawsuit may have caused the relationship.

02:32:57.587 --> 02:33:00.249
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Scott Miller.

02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:01.550
[SPEAKER_11]: So, in other words, they hugged it out.

02:33:02.490 --> 02:33:02.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially.

02:33:03.491 --> 02:33:03.971
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

02:33:05.112 --> 02:33:05.772
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:33:06.152 --> 02:33:06.793
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it was...

02:33:08.513 --> 02:33:10.294
[SPEAKER_11]: Tycho Drummaster Tycho Notachujen

02:33:32.766 --> 02:33:42.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Taiko Drum Master, Namco Bandai will be bringing it to the Wii U. Famitsu has mentioned that you can play Taiko Drum Master Wii U version with a Taiko Drum accessory.

02:33:42.611 --> 02:33:46.132
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be available for the Wii, Wii Remotes, or the Wii U GamePad.

02:33:47.253 --> 02:33:51.134
[SPEAKER_02]: The GamePad controls will be optimized to be simple for game players.

02:33:51.515 --> 02:33:54.256
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping you're not going to beat that GamePad with a stick.

02:33:54.316 --> 02:33:55.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's like tapping or something.

02:33:55.857 --> 02:33:56.737
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a little different.

02:33:57.357 --> 02:34:03.159
[SPEAKER_02]: Baton Change Mode is a new mode where between two to four players will work together in playing one song.

02:34:03.719 --> 02:34:11.782
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll also be Nintendo crossover content like Mario & Luigi Masks, and one of the songs that will be playable in the game, Wild Pokemon Battle Medley.

02:34:12.162 --> 02:34:17.304
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll have a little bit of that crossover there to make it even more appealing to Nintendo fans.

02:34:17.644 --> 02:34:18.624
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

02:34:19.225 --> 02:34:20.145
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on when.

02:34:20.725 --> 02:34:24.747
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just look forward to it I guess next year, I would think at this point.

02:34:25.387 --> 02:34:25.547
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

02:34:26.267 --> 02:34:26.907
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

02:34:27.888 --> 02:34:29.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys ever play Taiko no Tachigen?

02:34:30.109 --> 02:34:31.949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long time, but I like that game.

02:34:31.969 --> 02:34:38.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I played it was on PSP, so... I don't think I've played it since they originally put the US PlayStation 2 one out.

02:34:38.612 --> 02:34:40.133
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the US ones.

02:34:41.113 --> 02:34:45.895
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Dan actually, back when he got to take home Field Destroys, that's how I got mine.

02:34:46.555 --> 02:34:46.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:34:47.195 --> 02:34:47.575
[SPEAKER_06]: It worked.

02:34:47.655 --> 02:34:48.016
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:34:49.216 --> 02:34:52.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, now's the part of the show where we're going to open it up to your calls.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.024
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:57.044 --> 02:34:59.847
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give us a call to talk about whatever you'd like to.

02:35:00.728 --> 02:35:03.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps something we've talked about tonight or something that we missed.

02:35:04.511 --> 02:35:06.273
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also still vote on list lists.

02:35:06.333 --> 02:35:12.800
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll close that up at the end of the show, the very end tonight, once everybody has had a chance to call in or what have you.

02:35:16.327 --> 02:35:18.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls?

02:35:19.389 --> 02:35:20.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one, Grant, that's auto-related.

02:35:21.191 --> 02:35:42.928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been found by digging through the files of the game that it makes reference to PC and PlayStation 4 in the form of Orbis, so most likely those versions will be coming, and I would assume that an Xbox One version would be coming as well unless there's some sort of financial exclusive trickery or whatever that they're going to be pulling.

02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

02:35:44.009 --> 02:35:46.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the phones because we are getting a call.

02:35:46.451 --> 02:35:47.512
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:35:47.552 --> 02:35:47.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

02:35:48.733 --> 02:35:49.554
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, it's Shane.

02:35:49.674 --> 02:35:50.355
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shane.

02:35:50.375 --> 02:35:50.895
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

02:35:51.856 --> 02:35:54.498
[SPEAKER_02]: I am running a dungeon, so I'm doing pretty well.

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:56.640
[SPEAKER_02]: In Final Fantasy XIV, you're multitasking?

02:35:57.341 --> 02:35:59.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I might not pay attention to the phone call.

02:36:00.622 --> 02:36:03.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for calling when you had so much attention to give us tonight.

02:36:04.542 --> 02:36:06.163
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Final Fantasy XIV going for you?

02:36:06.223 --> 02:36:07.343
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all the way in Endgame, right?

02:36:08.403 --> 02:36:23.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I am actually running a dungeon that's for max level, and it seems pretty terrible so far because the tank left when the three of us that joined said we've never ran this one before, so we just auto-quit the dungeon.

02:36:24.557 --> 02:36:25.137
[SPEAKER_03]: What a jerk.

02:36:25.797 --> 02:36:26.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

02:36:26.778 --> 02:36:28.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out his name so I could publicly shame him.

02:36:29.038 --> 02:36:29.438
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

02:36:29.498 --> 02:36:30.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that in the future.

02:36:30.899 --> 02:36:37.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, I know you'll talk about some of this on Horde House this week, but what is there to do when you get to the endgame in Final Fantasy XIV?

02:36:37.581 --> 02:36:38.201
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when you get to 50?

02:36:39.141 --> 02:36:42.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Gear up for the actual endgame, because that's what I'm doing right now.

02:36:42.862 --> 02:36:49.504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running the hard mode primal battles, so I got a weapon from there already, which is pretty awesome.

02:36:49.524 --> 02:36:50.625
[SPEAKER_03]: It took only two tries.

02:36:50.945 --> 02:36:51.105
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

02:36:51.705 --> 02:36:56.789
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm running level 50 dungeons to get like currency to get better gear.

02:36:57.269 --> 02:37:00.092
[SPEAKER_03]: So after the grinding of leveling up comes more grinding?

02:37:00.732 --> 02:37:02.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's not bad.

02:37:02.533 --> 02:37:03.494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having fun with it.

02:37:03.574 --> 02:37:04.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well that's important.

02:37:04.755 --> 02:37:08.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well did you call to talk about 14 tonight or what did you want to talk about tonight?

02:37:08.678 --> 02:37:10.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I called to talk about the 2DS.

02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:12.440
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:15.822
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo 2DS was announced, what, last week?

02:37:15.862 --> 02:37:17.003
[SPEAKER_02]: About a week ago or two weeks ago?

02:37:17.203 --> 02:37:17.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks ago.

02:37:17.984 --> 02:37:23.427
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of internet anger about this thing.

02:37:23.527 --> 02:37:32.092
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare Nintendo put this thing out because it looks stupid, basically, was the verdict of the internet courtroom.

02:37:32.752 --> 02:37:33.693
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to say about it?

02:37:34.613 --> 02:37:52.882
[SPEAKER_03]: well I if you know my job I kind of get Nintendo stuff early and so I have my 2DS and I have to say that I just barely barely like it less than my 3DS XL it is a wonderful system really?

02:37:53.383 --> 02:38:01.387
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah it's comfortable to hold the way the design the slate design is awesome like

02:38:02.507 --> 02:38:03.729
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:38:03.749 --> 02:38:07.455
[SPEAKER_03]: If the screens were a little bit bigger, I probably wouldn't play my Excel at all.

02:38:08.376 --> 02:38:09.858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that nice to me.

02:38:10.639 --> 02:38:13.323
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think people on the internet are getting wrong about this thing?

02:38:14.445 --> 02:38:14.786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not...

02:38:15.779 --> 02:38:27.692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure they are, because it's geared really more towards an entry-level, first-time, current generation of Nintendo handheld experience.

02:38:27.892 --> 02:38:32.978
[SPEAKER_03]: So these people that are saying, oh, this is awful, why would anybody get this?

02:38:33.058 --> 02:38:34.360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not geared towards them.

02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's geared to the five and six-year-olds that...

02:38:37.623 --> 02:38:45.409
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have one before or the person that didn't want to shell out $170 to play the latest Mario or Pokemon.

02:38:45.449 --> 02:38:51.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can shell out $130 and you don't get the 3D features but you still get a really great experience.

02:38:52.755 --> 02:38:53.976
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a teenager who wants a 2DS.

02:38:56.003 --> 02:39:24.410
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much for that reason yeah it's great I really hope a lot of people get their hands on it if you are going out to GameStops or Walmarts or Targets this week you might run into a Nintendo app and they might be able to show you one so you can play around with it and see how you really feel about it but I love it and the little case that you can buy extra is adorable and it's also shaped like a piece of toast so it's pretty cool

02:39:25.553 --> 02:39:30.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you really have dropped the $129 or whatever the price is?

02:39:30.156 --> 02:39:32.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you really have dropped that amount of money on this device?

02:39:32.697 --> 02:39:36.399
[SPEAKER_03]: If I didn't have any form of 3DS, yes.

02:39:36.659 --> 02:39:40.361
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had a regular 3DS and then got to mess with this, yes.

02:39:40.962 --> 02:39:43.903
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I have an XL, personally, no.

02:39:44.563 --> 02:39:50.507
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just because I already have an XL, and I think this is just slightly under the XL in terms of how great it is.

02:39:53.029 --> 02:39:54.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon's almost here, right?

02:39:54.971 --> 02:39:55.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

02:39:55.712 --> 02:39:56.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited about that?

02:39:57.654 --> 02:39:57.855
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:39:57.875 --> 02:39:58.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you excited about that?

02:39:59.426 --> 02:40:01.849
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not excited whatsoever for Pokemon.

02:40:02.549 --> 02:40:04.291
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they supposed to announce something?

02:40:05.252 --> 02:40:07.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Twitter tease some type of announcement tomorrow?

02:40:07.494 --> 02:40:08.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow at 8 a.m.

02:40:08.615 --> 02:40:09.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific.

02:40:10.017 --> 02:40:15.582
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the first time in forever for some sort of announcement that I don't have to get up early for.

02:40:15.802 --> 02:40:16.303
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

02:40:16.924 --> 02:40:20.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it might be anything that's not about X and Y?

02:40:20.888 --> 02:40:22.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Like something in the future of Pokemon?

02:40:22.789 --> 02:40:22.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:23.910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

02:40:24.611 --> 02:40:25.411
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know.

02:40:25.571 --> 02:40:29.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just as excited as everybody else is.

02:40:29.814 --> 02:40:34.798
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and before we wrap up tonight, why are you so damn excited about Pokemon X and Y?

02:40:34.878 --> 02:40:36.379
[SPEAKER_02]: What about it is exciting?

02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:41.722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taking the game to the new graphical and like...

02:40:42.603 --> 02:40:45.585
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the word is I'm looking for.

02:40:46.266 --> 02:40:55.594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the evolution of Pokemon and that's exciting because black and white, it was a nice jump but it wasn't a real jump.

02:40:55.634 --> 02:40:57.775
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like a little step up.

02:40:57.855 --> 02:40:59.437
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a huge jump forward.

02:41:00.362 --> 02:41:00.682
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:41:01.283 --> 02:41:04.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Shane, if you don't have anything else, I guess we'll let you get back to your dungeon.

02:41:04.245 --> 02:41:05.326
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for calling.

02:41:05.506 --> 02:41:05.806
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:41:05.846 --> 02:41:06.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

02:41:06.647 --> 02:41:06.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

02:41:07.407 --> 02:41:09.169
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes it sound like he didn't want to call.

02:41:09.189 --> 02:41:13.472
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:13.512 --> 02:41:17.275
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call, this is also the last call to vote in listless.

02:41:17.815 --> 02:41:21.016
[SPEAKER_02]: You do need to be a registered VOG participant, but we don't charge money for that.

02:41:21.036 --> 02:41:21.656
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not like that.

02:41:22.216 --> 02:41:27.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sign up at vognetwork.com, and then you will see the board up at live.vognetwork.com.

02:41:28.398 --> 02:41:31.038
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big thanks to Bobby Blackwell for coding this little game.

02:41:31.339 --> 02:41:34.999
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had to fix it on the fly tonight because I guess it was actually broken when it went to tabulate.

02:41:35.039 --> 02:41:39.921
[SPEAKER_02]: It was taking the last list we did, which was the first one on the system, and it was combining the votes together.

02:41:40.261 --> 02:41:41.801
[SPEAKER_02]: So the wrong answer was winning.

02:41:42.521 --> 02:41:43.101
[SPEAKER_02]: But he fixed it.

02:41:43.242 --> 02:41:44.762
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have the accurate results.

02:41:45.522 --> 02:41:48.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the last time we did listless was thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.

02:41:48.945 --> 02:41:51.066
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you an idea how long ago that was.

02:41:51.567 --> 02:41:54.329
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright, so this is your last chance to vote in listless.

02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:58.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to vote for your number one and your number two answer with your first and second clicks there.

02:41:58.952 --> 02:42:01.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, again, phone lines are open if you want to give us a call.

02:42:01.174 --> 02:42:05.156
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:05.697 --> 02:42:07.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I will try to bring up the Twitter topics here real quick.

02:42:08.299 --> 02:42:09.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no other last minute stories, Loki?

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:11.361
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just...

02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:20.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking through Grand Theft Auto files now alright well we do have another we do have another call coming in so let's go to the phones and we'll take that hi you're on Orange Orange Radio who's this?

02:42:21.275 --> 02:42:23.937
[SPEAKER_10]: holy shit I got through it's Ranma hey Ranma how you doing?

02:42:24.637 --> 02:42:30.341
[SPEAKER_10]: not much the thing is I wasn't even gonna call let everybody else you know call in you know hey

02:42:31.909 --> 02:42:36.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, the phone lines haven't been lighting up as much this month as previously.

02:42:36.992 --> 02:42:39.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Like last week, I seem to remember, was really tough.

02:42:39.834 --> 02:42:41.295
[SPEAKER_02]: We barely got any calls last week either.

02:42:41.696 --> 02:42:42.136
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

02:42:43.317 --> 02:42:45.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to have another open Skype challenge?

02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:51.002
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I figure, you know, some weeks people have things to say and some weeks they don't.

02:42:51.042 --> 02:42:53.524
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a pretty slow news week, all things considered.

02:42:53.544 --> 02:42:58.047
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't really anything that really ignited passion maybe in previous weeks.

02:42:59.066 --> 02:43:00.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy Crush Saga

02:43:22.284 --> 02:43:25.206
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you've heard of the game Namco Cross Capcom, right?

02:43:25.306 --> 02:43:25.526
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:43:26.827 --> 02:43:30.149
[SPEAKER_10]: And the now spiritual actual sequel, Project Cross Zone.

02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:35.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the name of our panel at GamerX was inspired by that podcast, Cross Zone, yeah.

02:43:36.174 --> 02:43:36.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

02:43:37.034 --> 02:43:40.877
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want you to know, I have been playing this game for about three weeks straight.

02:43:40.917 --> 02:43:43.559
[SPEAKER_10]: I have almost 50 hours logged into the game.

02:43:43.579 --> 02:43:43.959
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

02:43:44.539 --> 02:43:51.264
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is like... I see my... I'm sitting here watching stuff on DVR to catch up, and I'm like, pause...

02:43:52.261 --> 02:44:04.285
[SPEAKER_10]: Go grab your 3DS, sit down, unpause, just turn the volume down on the game, start playing, and I'm like, pause DVR, put the volume back up, put the headphones on, and just keep playing.

02:44:04.585 --> 02:44:06.406
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about this game that makes it so amazing?

02:44:06.446 --> 02:44:12.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just the cutscenes and this and the way you get sucked into it that way?

02:44:12.988 --> 02:44:18.330
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's the fact that I call it, and it's not just a tactical RPG game,

02:44:18.846 --> 02:44:21.168
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an action tactical RPG.

02:44:21.468 --> 02:44:22.329
[SPEAKER_10]: Real time RPG.

02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:31.657
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas before, you know, with games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars, you set your characters and you sit there and you watch them attack each other.

02:44:32.778 --> 02:44:47.030
[SPEAKER_10]: In this, you move your character to the person you want to fight and then the screen comes up, you hold down the attack button, you do one attack, then you do another series of combinations like it could be attack and left and up and down and then right.

02:44:47.271 --> 02:44:50.402
[SPEAKER_10]: and it'll just keep doing a series of attacks right behind each other.

02:44:51.675 --> 02:44:52.576
[SPEAKER_10]: Project CrossZone

02:45:19.274 --> 02:45:21.516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hearing a lot about this game.

02:45:21.556 --> 02:45:24.338
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be a game that really is flying under the radar.

02:45:24.398 --> 02:45:26.580
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think people are missing about this game?

02:45:27.801 --> 02:45:32.264
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's because you have different gaming properties in it.

02:45:32.304 --> 02:45:42.252
[SPEAKER_10]: You have Rival Schools, you have Space Channel 5, you have .hack, Street Fighter, the Tales of series, Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Force.

02:45:42.352 --> 02:45:42.732
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like...

02:45:43.673 --> 02:45:49.498
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much Sega, Namco, Bandai, and Capcom just had a freaking gaming orgy.

02:45:51.519 --> 02:45:53.521
[SPEAKER_10]: And the storyline is just phenomenal as well.

02:45:53.561 --> 02:45:54.742
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to clean it up.

02:45:55.423 --> 02:45:55.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:45:58.345 --> 02:45:58.925
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds hot.

02:45:59.986 --> 02:46:04.530
[SPEAKER_02]: So even the storyline incorporates all this cross-IP fuckery.

02:46:05.725 --> 02:46:13.852
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I sent Jamie a screenshot or I posted it on my wall for her to look at for a little in-joke or something like that.

02:46:15.653 --> 02:46:19.736
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that you did, and I can't get onto my Facebook right now.

02:46:20.517 --> 02:46:22.038
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, something about the fantasy zone.

02:46:22.078 --> 02:46:22.518
[SPEAKER_10]: Get ready.

02:46:22.558 --> 02:46:25.401
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh, Jamie's going to love that.

02:46:25.661 --> 02:46:26.722
[SPEAKER_02]: One of Jamie's favorite quotes.

02:46:27.422 --> 02:46:27.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:46:28.283 --> 02:46:28.403
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

02:46:29.850 --> 02:46:30.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

02:46:49.899 --> 02:47:03.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan Alchemy in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, no shade, but it's a fan service game with a lot of niche franchises in a format, Strat RPG, that generally isn't a heavy hitter and only appeals to certain gamers, which of course makes it completely phenomenal.

02:47:03.905 --> 02:47:09.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this one of these hipster games that might save the Xbox One if tonight's list is to be believed?

02:47:09.448 --> 02:47:09.528
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:47:10.328 --> 02:47:19.414
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, but I was just saying to a bunch of friends of mine, if they ever did a brand new Naruto video game in this style, I would sit there and play it from start to finish.

02:47:19.674 --> 02:47:20.455
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it would fit.

02:47:22.236 --> 02:47:25.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

02:47:27.819 --> 02:47:30.141
[SPEAKER_10]: My liver will never forgive me from this past weekend.

02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:31.502
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

02:47:33.127 --> 02:47:38.973
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to Nauticon, a 21 plus anime gaming convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

02:47:39.193 --> 02:47:39.814
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my.

02:47:41.115 --> 02:47:42.777
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you have no idea, good sir.

02:47:45.199 --> 02:47:51.546
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say in one night, I drank typically what I would have drank over three nights.

02:47:52.561 --> 02:47:53.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

02:47:53.562 --> 02:47:55.263
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like me at DragonCon, though, to be honest.

02:47:56.284 --> 02:47:58.906
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't been drinking a lot lately, so I've been well-behaved.

02:48:00.147 --> 02:48:00.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:48:01.168 --> 02:48:02.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, I'm glad to hear you had fun.

02:48:02.789 --> 02:48:13.317
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear all about that con and more cons on your little program that you co-host here at VOG Network Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights, right?

02:48:13.777 --> 02:48:14.277
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:48:15.798 --> 02:48:19.900
[SPEAKER_10]: Pre-show starts around 9.15, 9.20 right after our brand new Neighbors at Electric Sisterhood.

02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:21.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.

02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:21.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care, buddy.

02:48:22.401 --> 02:48:22.781
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

02:48:22.981 --> 02:48:24.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

02:48:24.682 --> 02:48:27.844
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:27.884 --> 02:48:32.906
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about one more moment to take calls and we'll reveal the results of this list as well.

02:48:35.567 --> 02:48:39.190
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going real quick to see if we had any tweets.

02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:41.772
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did get a couple tweets from TigerClaw.

02:48:41.972 --> 02:48:44.874
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the stories he tweeted us, I remember reading about this.

02:48:45.214 --> 02:48:46.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about this on the internet this week?

02:48:46.695 --> 02:48:47.136
[SPEAKER_02]: J.J.

02:48:47.316 --> 02:48:51.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Abrams emotionally hurt by the latest Star Trek game.

02:48:51.999 --> 02:48:53.020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw that.

02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:56.462
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to post it, but I was like, that's stupid.

02:48:56.582 --> 02:48:58.404
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you guys think about that?

02:48:58.484 --> 02:49:00.425
[SPEAKER_02]: That he was so hurt about it?

02:49:00.605 --> 02:49:01.286
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that.

02:49:01.806 --> 02:49:02.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

02:49:02.066 --> 02:49:02.847
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was pretty bad.

02:49:03.367 --> 02:49:04.408
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was pretty bad, too.

02:49:04.728 --> 02:49:07.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.

02:49:07.189 --> 02:49:08.790
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this icon this guy has, too.

02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:10.011
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orgasmons Radio.

02:49:10.031 --> 02:49:10.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

02:49:11.071 --> 02:49:12.012
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Codeman.

02:49:12.052 --> 02:49:15.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Codeman, I love your little user picture.

02:49:15.334 --> 02:49:24.278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, who I envision is you and a little creeper drawn Minecraft-style with little Mickey Mouse balloons and mouse ears.

02:49:24.338 --> 02:49:29.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's the most random collage of worlds, but I love it.

02:49:29.661 --> 02:49:30.802
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make it

02:49:31.448 --> 02:49:32.209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely fantastic.

02:49:32.249 --> 02:49:32.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

02:49:50.181 --> 02:49:53.424
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I haven't played the first one in so long.

02:49:53.684 --> 02:50:00.449
[SPEAKER_04]: And bringing that back into my life, because I remember I was 17 when it came out, and I bought it on launch day.

02:50:01.289 --> 02:50:04.552
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember playing it and imagining...

02:50:05.347 --> 02:50:08.328
[SPEAKER_04]: How could any game get any better than this game?

02:50:09.268 --> 02:50:10.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm a huge Disney fan.

02:50:10.829 --> 02:50:12.029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a huge Squeenix fan.

02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:15.410
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm all over all of these games.

02:50:15.471 --> 02:50:24.674
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when they came together and made this fantastic game, I was just going crazy.

02:50:25.194 --> 02:50:28.475
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they announced that they were releasing this,

02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:29.640
[SPEAKER_04]: This is HD remix.

02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:31.601
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely went crazy.

02:50:31.641 --> 02:50:34.801
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I popped it in, I started playing it.

02:50:34.861 --> 02:50:35.782
[SPEAKER_04]: They have changed.

02:50:35.902 --> 02:50:40.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I never played the final mix because it was never released in North America.

02:50:42.763 --> 02:50:45.164
[SPEAKER_04]: But the music sounds different.

02:50:45.264 --> 02:50:45.464
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

02:50:45.544 --> 02:50:48.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the graphics are just phenomenal.

02:50:51.741 --> 02:50:52.702
[SPEAKER_04]: and just things.

02:50:52.882 --> 02:50:59.105
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's so many different things now that maybe I missed when I played it earlier or they weren't actually in there.

02:50:59.185 --> 02:50:59.645
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:50:59.985 --> 02:51:04.327
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, too, just the fact that it's been, what, 12 years since the game was first out.

02:51:04.347 --> 02:51:08.630
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you just kind of catch on to more and you're probably a different gamer now than you were then.

02:51:09.050 --> 02:51:11.031
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just kind of find different things that way.

02:51:11.391 --> 02:51:12.832
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it just me, Codeman?

02:51:12.992 --> 02:51:15.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you lose skill over 12?

02:51:15.913 --> 02:51:16.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you got better.

02:51:16.814 --> 02:51:17.214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:51:17.274 --> 02:51:21.016
[SPEAKER_02]: But why am I so bad at this kids game?

02:51:21.656 --> 02:51:24.298
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is tough as hell.

02:51:25.118 --> 02:51:30.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing on proud mode because I figured, okay, I'm going to play on proud mode.

02:51:31.002 --> 02:51:42.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I started Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and I still want to play Dream Drop Distance, but like I said in chat earlier, I don't own any Nintendo handhelds, and I'm trying to figure out...

02:51:44.676 --> 02:51:46.738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm anticipating the infamous fight with Sephiroth and I'm just like, okay...

02:52:13.942 --> 02:52:16.203
[SPEAKER_04]: I've beaten him several times when I was a kid.

02:52:16.263 --> 02:52:27.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I beat him a million times because, you know, he was a tough, you know, the platinum, I can't remember what it was called, but it was like the platinum whatever that you fought him and then you got like a special keyblade and all that stuff.

02:52:27.906 --> 02:52:30.127
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was like the hardest character in the whole game.

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:37.343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm anticipating that fight because I know now I started playing it again and I'm like, God, this game is so difficult.

02:52:38.163 --> 02:52:40.504
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't remember it being that difficult when I was a kid.

02:52:40.744 --> 02:52:41.344
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.

02:52:41.645 --> 02:52:43.445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still getting my butt whipped by servers.

02:52:43.805 --> 02:52:52.729
[SPEAKER_02]: But I seem to recall, and I think I might have had to do this the first time I played too, you can actually skip that fight and go on to the next world and then go back and do it later and it's a lot easier.

02:52:52.789 --> 02:52:54.250
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what I'm going to end up having to do.

02:52:55.491 --> 02:52:55.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

02:53:24.238 --> 02:53:28.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, because I've watched your live streams.

02:53:28.821 --> 02:53:31.723
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really get a whole lot of time to do anything, really.

02:53:31.783 --> 02:53:35.825
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to watch your live streams when you post them like a nerd.

02:53:36.465 --> 02:53:47.572
[SPEAKER_04]: But I watch your live streams and I find how hilarious it is when you play... Paranormal wasn't as bad because I don't think that game... I don't know.

02:53:47.772 --> 02:53:49.613
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's kind of cheesy to me.

02:53:49.673 --> 02:53:50.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:53:50.274 --> 02:53:53.776
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it and some of the scares were fine, but...

02:53:54.178 --> 02:53:56.800
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when you played Slender Man, that was hilarious.

02:53:56.860 --> 02:53:59.922
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm trying to figure out something in my head.

02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:13.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, okay, so what can I buy Rob to play that would be the funniest, scariest, and all-around entertaining livestream that he can play?

02:54:13.971 --> 02:54:15.613
[SPEAKER_04]: But this game, Outlast, came out.

02:54:15.633 --> 02:54:19.635
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the guys that I talked to that was on my podcast, he...

02:54:21.877 --> 02:54:24.742
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, this game is the scariest game I've ever played in my whole entire life.

02:54:24.842 --> 02:54:29.350
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was like, okay, well maybe this is the game that I should... And I never really heard a whole lot about it.

02:54:29.390 --> 02:54:29.891
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I watched...

02:54:31.645 --> 02:54:59.731
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know whatever but like I don't really play games like that so I thought okay well maybe I should gift that to him so I gifted that to you and you are in for a ride my friend I hear it's something else I'm not a big fan of the blood and gore and apparently there's plenty of that in Outlast but I will make good on a live stream at some point I'm not sure when but soon we'll see we'll see you gotta tear me away from Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts for a little bit first but I do really appreciate it you know what you're talking about

02:55:01.512 --> 02:55:07.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Code Man, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, get listless done and all that stuff, but any last quick thoughts for us?

02:55:09.337 --> 02:55:12.980
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not playing the Kingdom Hearts HD remix, you should definitely pick it up.

02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:16.783
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Rom, I gotta party with that guy sometime.

02:55:16.823 --> 02:55:18.884
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy, he sounds like a fun character.

02:55:18.964 --> 02:55:20.205
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a very fun character.

02:55:20.245 --> 02:55:23.968
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever go to New York City, you look him up and say Rob Roberts sent ya.

02:55:24.048 --> 02:55:24.929
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll show you a good time.

02:55:25.529 --> 02:55:27.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have a friend in New York that...

02:55:28.843 --> 02:55:33.144
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to speak for him you will have to just listen to Anime Jam Session to get all the latest

02:55:51.588 --> 02:55:52.029
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.609
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:52.849 --> 02:55:53.570
[SPEAKER_02]: You take care, my friend.

02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.310
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:54.351 --> 02:55:54.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

02:55:54.731 --> 02:55:55.031
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:55:55.211 --> 02:55:55.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

02:55:56.312 --> 02:55:59.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the calls, guys, but we are going to close up the Skype line for now.

02:55:59.194 --> 02:56:08.162
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had something you wanted to say and you didn't get through, you should absolutely email us, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com, or you can always tweet us.

02:56:08.722 --> 02:56:36.440
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as Tigerclaw did with one other story I want to read here real quick About the PlayStation 4 sharing options and the whole game recording Apparently, things coming out about how you're going to have to break the DRM Of the high bandwidth digital content protection If you want to stream outside of the built-in game streaming Which, as you know, could be shut off for certain games Because PlayStation 4 doesn't have component cables And that's how people were getting around it on the PlayStation 3

02:56:39.037 --> 02:56:41.118
[SPEAKER_11]: There's ways to strip that out.

02:56:42.859 --> 02:56:45.220
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like purples you can get.

02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:50.043
[SPEAKER_02]: There is apparently like a box you can get that strips it out, like an HGCP stripper.

02:56:50.063 --> 02:56:52.364
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do that, you're breaking the law.

02:56:52.764 --> 02:56:57.747
[SPEAKER_02]: You are violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it prohibits.

02:56:57.767 --> 02:57:00.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, they're going to send cops to your house right away.

02:57:00.308 --> 02:57:00.929
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

02:57:00.989 --> 02:57:02.410
[SPEAKER_02]: They will call the po-po.

02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:04.851
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like when you rip off that tag on your mattress.

02:57:05.131 --> 02:57:06.652
[SPEAKER_11]: They hear it, they're all,

02:57:07.032 --> 02:57:08.632
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's been ripping the tag.

02:57:08.692 --> 02:57:11.513
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's only if you resell it after ripping off the tag.

02:57:13.093 --> 02:57:14.874
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get arrested for ripping off the tag.

02:57:14.914 --> 02:57:17.114
[SPEAKER_02]: The seller does, just so you know.

02:57:17.554 --> 02:57:17.794
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:57:18.074 --> 02:57:22.555
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I have to read this amazing drag from Alan in chat.

02:57:22.916 --> 02:57:23.396
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

02:57:23.456 --> 02:57:24.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan Alchemy in our chat room.

02:57:24.996 --> 02:57:29.497
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in response to Tiger Claw's article earlier about how JJ Abrams was emotionally hurt by the game.

02:57:30.057 --> 02:57:33.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect way to end the show here with Alan Alchemy literally dragging this.

02:57:34.478 --> 02:57:42.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek fans are emotionally hurt by his shitshow fanfic of Wrath of Khan and saying he doesn't like pretentious intellectual Star Trek and never did.

02:57:42.688 --> 02:57:43.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about it.

02:57:46.192 --> 02:57:46.773
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record?

02:57:47.313 --> 02:57:48.695
[SPEAKER_02]: For for you, Alan Alchemy.

02:57:48.735 --> 02:57:49.876
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, Alan Alchemy.

02:57:52.339 --> 02:57:53.020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for the record?

02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:53.961
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't hurt.

02:57:56.601 --> 02:57:58.182
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, I'm the DS9 fan.

02:57:59.162 --> 02:57:59.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:58:00.803 --> 02:58:09.749
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to about do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but before we get final thoughts, we have one other thing we've got to take care of, and that is tonight's list list.

02:58:09.769 --> 02:58:10.809
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want to know what won?

02:58:11.530 --> 02:58:12.410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:13.711
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to it.

02:58:16.161 --> 02:58:25.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, the top three as voted on by you guys at live.vognetwork.com The board is now away.

02:58:25.249 --> 02:58:28.311
[SPEAKER_02]: You can no longer vote because here are the answers.

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:28.992
[SPEAKER_02]: The winners.

02:58:29.052 --> 02:58:29.832
[SPEAKER_02]: No ties tonight.

02:58:29.852 --> 02:58:32.274
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very clear top three tonight.

02:58:32.795 --> 02:58:39.440
[SPEAKER_02]: The number three answer for the thing the Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.

02:58:39.861 --> 02:58:40.901
[SPEAKER_02]: The number three answer?

02:58:41.702 --> 02:58:44.444
[SPEAKER_02]: A more interactive banning system.

02:58:44.665 --> 02:58:44.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Wooo!

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:50.604
[SPEAKER_02]: The number two answer for a thing that could make the Xbox One popular again.

02:58:51.104 --> 02:58:52.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Detach Connect.

02:58:54.425 --> 02:59:00.927
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, the number one way that you will be popular all over the internet, Microsoft.

02:59:01.167 --> 02:59:02.768
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to announce this tomorrow.

02:59:03.548 --> 02:59:08.150
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the Xbox One, a free waffle iron with every order.

02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:10.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're waffling.

02:59:12.111 --> 02:59:12.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it!

02:59:12.771 --> 02:59:15.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is.

02:59:15.852 --> 02:59:16.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number one answer.

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:18.472
[SPEAKER_02]: A free waffle iron.

02:59:18.492 --> 02:59:19.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids like waffles.

02:59:20.253 --> 02:59:21.213
[SPEAKER_02]: I like waffles!

02:59:21.973 --> 02:59:22.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Waffles!

02:59:24.133 --> 02:59:25.574
[SPEAKER_02]: A big thanks to Captain Spike.

02:59:25.654 --> 02:59:32.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, none of his answers made the top three, but I will say his answer on hipster exclusives was the number four result.

02:59:32.415 --> 02:59:32.935
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

02:59:32.955 --> 02:59:33.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man Legends of Sammoo 3.

02:59:33.975 --> 02:59:35.235
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the number four answer.

02:59:36.255 --> 02:59:38.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Followed right by Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.

02:59:38.856 --> 02:59:38.996
[SPEAKER_02]: So

02:59:39.796 --> 02:59:41.698
[SPEAKER_02]: So close yet so far, Captain Spike.

02:59:41.738 --> 02:59:42.779
[SPEAKER_02]: I did love his answers.

02:59:42.799 --> 02:59:43.980
[SPEAKER_06]: Fly, Phil, to the moon.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:44.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

02:59:44.581 --> 02:59:45.302
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that stuck.

02:59:45.462 --> 02:59:46.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm having a Bayonetta moment.

02:59:46.723 --> 02:59:49.186
[SPEAKER_06]: And let him flame among the stars.

02:59:50.267 --> 02:59:53.810
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words... Kiss my ass.

02:59:58.860 --> 03:00:03.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom saying, anticipation would have won had DarkSakura not been a meanie.

03:00:03.805 --> 03:00:09.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's... That's... Them's the breaks here on Listless.

03:00:09.611 --> 03:00:10.993
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to picture something.

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:13.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine you're standing in an open field.

03:00:14.176 --> 03:00:16.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine a world without you crying.

03:00:16.319 --> 03:00:16.620
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:19.163
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine you're standing in an open field.

03:00:19.223 --> 03:00:19.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

03:00:19.804 --> 03:00:21.907
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're looking up at the sun.

03:00:22.628 --> 03:00:31.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And then suddenly, five letters float in front of the sun, completely blocking out its light, and it's S-H-A-D-E.

03:00:36.847 --> 03:00:42.172
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.

03:00:42.893 --> 03:00:44.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll sing us out tonight.

03:00:44.354 --> 03:00:46.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Fly me to the moon.

03:00:46.857 --> 03:00:50.140
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the other half of the fans are saying Evangelion.

03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:53.883
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like 50 million versions of that song.

03:00:53.923 --> 03:00:55.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Utada Hikaru did one.

03:00:55.124 --> 03:00:56.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Utada Hikaru did one.

03:00:56.085 --> 03:00:57.447
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was on a Dance Mania album.

03:00:57.507 --> 03:00:57.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

03:00:58.488 --> 03:01:00.891
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got like the album version.

03:01:00.911 --> 03:01:02.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Next April Fools on VOG.

03:01:02.854 --> 03:01:04.696
[SPEAKER_02]: All we will do is play covers of that song.

03:01:05.196 --> 03:01:05.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Hear me out.

03:01:06.037 --> 03:01:06.338
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

03:01:09.942 --> 03:01:11.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap it up, guys.

03:01:11.144 --> 03:01:13.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:13.326 --> 03:01:14.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for participating.

03:01:14.628 --> 03:01:15.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.

03:01:15.549 --> 03:01:17.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you were here live, whether you were listening to us on the podcast.

03:01:18.092 --> 03:01:19.113
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

03:01:19.213 --> 03:01:23.055
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we ask, guys, tell a friend or two or five or seven about the show.

03:01:23.395 --> 03:01:25.797
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:25.877 --> 03:01:29.899
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are what helps our fan base grow and grows our family.

03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:32.621
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just thank you guys for your support.

03:01:32.661 --> 03:01:33.522
[SPEAKER_02]: We so appreciate it.

03:01:33.902 --> 03:01:35.603
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back next week to do it all again.

03:01:36.163 --> 03:01:39.565
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we're going to wrap up with final thoughts tonight.

03:01:39.866 --> 03:01:41.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go first with my final thought tonight.

03:01:41.847 --> 03:01:43.108
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is...

03:01:43.968 --> 03:01:50.349
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Grand Theft Auto V is probably going to do very well even though it's being released right before all these new consoles come out.

03:01:50.730 --> 03:01:57.591
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish Final Fantasy XII would have gotten the same break because Balthier and Fran are still like some of the best characters ever to come out of that series.

03:01:58.191 --> 03:02:00.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they'll do an HD remake.

03:02:00.072 --> 03:02:01.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingers and toes crossed.

03:02:01.292 --> 03:02:02.592
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that rumor some time ago.

03:02:02.692 --> 03:02:05.193
[SPEAKER_02]: So I plan to buy the X remake.

03:02:05.613 --> 03:02:07.753
[SPEAKER_02]: If the X remake is as good as Kingdom Hearts, I'm on board.

03:02:07.773 --> 03:02:09.734
[SPEAKER_11]: They still haven't announced one that's coming out yet.

03:02:09.754 --> 03:02:10.594
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still waiting.

03:02:11.758 --> 03:02:12.899
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by the end of the year, I hope.

03:02:13.139 --> 03:02:13.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hopefully.

03:02:13.479 --> 03:02:13.779
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

03:02:14.239 --> 03:02:15.319
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's my final thought.

03:02:15.539 --> 03:02:16.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:19.600
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to play lots of Grand Theft Auto V this week.

03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:20.141
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course you will.

03:02:20.161 --> 03:02:25.542
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully now that it's out there, maybe we can livestream some of it because that would be fun.

03:02:25.562 --> 03:02:26.102
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be fun.

03:02:26.582 --> 03:02:28.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

03:02:28.963 --> 03:02:30.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Fly me to the moon.

03:02:30.984 --> 03:02:31.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

03:02:31.604 --> 03:02:34.565
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me play among the stars.

03:02:35.465 --> 03:02:36.725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the singing you're going to get out of me.

03:02:37.065 --> 03:02:37.405
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
