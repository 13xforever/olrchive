27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 22nd of 2013 with the 520th episode of our show.
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games with you guys out there in internet land and my co-hosts here in studio.
51000	54000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Wark.
55000	56000	Wark.
56000	57000	Wark.
57000	58000	Que.
58000	59000	Que.
59000	62000	Tonight's presentation of OLR will be presented in the language of Chocobo.
62000	64000	Wark, wark, wark.
64000	66000	Okay.
66000	71000	That was the sound of like 500 people unsubscribing from the show all at once.
71000	73000	You mean we have that many?
73000	75000	Alright.
75000	79000	The facts are completely made up on tonight's OLR as well.
79000	81000	How you doing DarkSakura? Seriously.
81000	82000	Caffeinated, thank you.
82000	84000	No seriously. How are you?
88000	92000	It's a bummer it's a radio show because if you all could see the look she was giving me right now.
92000	94000	I think I was giving him the girl face.
94000	96000	Or how dare you cut me off.
96000	98000	But you're caffeinated, do you have your coffee?
98000	101000	I'm caffeinated. I have had healthy food today.
101000	104000	And I still have chocolate covered mints for later.
104000	105000	Ooh.
105000	106000	Ooh, yummy.
106000	107000	And I've brought delicious snacks.
107000	108000	Which I keep eating.
108000	110000	In the form of my special trail mix.
110000	112000	Made of raw almonds.
112000	114000	And raw cashews.
114000	116000	And a roasted coconut.
116000	117000	But the coconut's the best part.
117000	118000	It totally is.
118000	119000	Alright.
119000	123000	Say hello to our coconut here on the show.
123000	124000	Or just nut.
124000	125000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
125000	126000	Hi.
126000	127000	How are you Loki?
127000	128000	I'm fine.
128000	129000	Yeah?
129000	131000	My, well, throat's a little sore but I'm fine.
131000	132000	Sorry to hear it.
132000	133000	I'm having colas.
133000	135000	I caught it from my son, so.
135000	136000	Don't get me sick.
136000	137000	Yeah, don't get us sick.
137000	139000	I'm being rude, don't get me sick.
139000	141000	It's just, it's just the throat thing.
141000	145000	It could very well be also allergies because I always get, like, scratchy throat whenever
145000	148000	the weather goes wet and then dry again.
148000	150000	Well, the season's changed yesterday.
150000	152000	I don't know if you noticed, but it rained.
152000	154000	So that means summer's over and here's winter.
154000	156000	Because we don't have a fall here.
156000	157000	There's no transition.
157000	158000	It's just like, boom, done.
158000	159000	That's right.
159000	160000	Boom goes the dynamite.
160000	161000	That's it.
161000	163000	So, yeah, it rained here yesterday.
163000	168000	So, thank gosh it rained yesterday and not two days ago because I went to an outdoor
168000	171000	concert two days ago and that would have been really terrible if it was raining.
171000	172000	So, yeah.
172000	175000	Anyway, you guys are there in our chat room.
175000	178000	We always like to say hello to the fourth guest on the show, our chatters.
178000	184000	Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock
184000	187000	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network.
187000	189000	It's set in October where we record dead.
189000	192000	The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
192000	197000	And, again, that's Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
197000	198000	Show.
198000	201000	And those of you that were listening live, I'm sure were aware of this.
201000	206000	But if you're listening on the podcast, you may not be aware, our pal Bobby hit 400 episodes
206000	207000	tonight.
207000	209000	So, claps and congratulations for Bobby.
209000	211000	That's a great milestone.
211000	216000	And in true Bobby form, he had walked through the door 20 minutes before to set up in a
216000	218000	frenzy because he was working on something else for the show.
218000	220000	He was 15 minutes late with Starbucks.
220000	223000	No, that's our excuse, Dark Sakura.
223000	225000	Bobby's always hard at work.
225000	227000	So, all right.
227000	229000	We're going to get into gaming news and all that.
229000	234000	But tonight I want to start off a little bit with, you know, some sad news.
234000	239000	I'm sure this is on many people's minds this week, as you probably were following the gaming,
239000	242000	you know, the gaming press and pretty much every blog read a story on this.
242000	247000	But Hiroshi Yamauchi died this week at age 85.
247000	253000	If you don't know that name, he was basically the head of Nintendo, the Nintendo president
253000	254000	for many years.
254000	257000	That's the position that Satoru Iwata holds now.
257000	259000	And, you know, many of you know him for sure.
259000	264000	But Yamauchi ran Nintendo for 53 years.
264000	270000	So the NES, the Super NES, you know, all the stuff that led into NES because, you know,
270000	272000	they didn't start with that.
272000	273000	They were doing the watch games.
273000	276000	And even before that, it was cards and the more mechanical stuff.
276000	278000	That's how he met Gunpei Okoye, if I'm not mistaken.
278000	280000	It wasn't about games at all.
280000	283000	I think you have a mechanical.
283000	291000	But Hiroshi Yamauchi, he was a very interesting guy because he was a businessman in every sense of the word.
291000	294000	The man hardly played video games at all.
294000	300000	In fact, I believe rumor has it the first video game he ever played was when Tetris went to the Game Boy,
300000	302000	which to be fair was a lot of people.
302000	303000	I was about to say.
303000	304000	Yeah.
304000	307000	Yeah. I mean, he just knew how to make business decisions.
307000	312000	And a lot of people, of course, also know him because he owned the Seattle Mariners for quite some time.
312000	316000	And it was very controversial at the time because, you know, he was in Japan.
316000	317000	The team was here.
317000	319000	He didn't really have plans to come see the team.
319000	322000	He never came to see a game.
322000	326000	Now, he watched them on TV and things like that, but he never came over to actually see a game.
326000	328000	So it was kind of controversial in that sense.
328000	330000	But again, businessman.
330000	332000	But you also think about it.
332000	334000	Baseball is super, super huge in Japan.
334000	335000	Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.
335000	336000	A lot of makes sense.
336000	344000	And if I do remember correctly, thanks to one of our mutual friends and some of the players from the Mariners came over to play in Japan.
344000	346000	Oh, that's right.
346000	348000	So, you know, do you know who owns the Mariners now?
348000	350000	If I'm not mistaken, I have no idea.
350000	351000	Howard Phillips.
351000	354000	Remember him from the Nintendo days?
354000	355000	He was Nintendo.
355000	360000	He was he used to be the Reggie Fils-Aime back in the day, the ginger ginger president of Nintendo.
360000	366000	And most people, honestly, most people our age know him from the Howard and Nestor comics from the days of the Nintendo Power.
366000	367000	Yes.
367000	370000	So it's kind of funny how that all kind of goes together.
370000	373000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
373000	377000	Some kind words and some reminiscing about Hiroshi Yamauchi in chat.
377000	381000	Dungeon Buster says he was an uncanny judge of character and trends.
381000	385000	What Up G says hiring Miyamoto, one of his best moves ever.
386000	391000	True says TMZ even showed a bit of love to Hiroshi Yamauchi, lol.
391000	396000	Yeah, you know, the news even kind of, you know, cut through to the mainstream because, you know, not only was he the Nintendo guy,
396000	403000	which, you know, obviously he made a boatload of money from his share of Nintendo stock when it surged thanks to the Wii and all that.
403000	404000	I mean, the man had a boatload of money.
404000	410000	Many people knew that he did not accept his pension when he retired from Nintendo.
410000	412000	He said, no, Nintendo needs the money.
412000	417000	And so I believe he donated a huge amount to cancer charities as well.
417000	420000	So the man did a lot of good, which should be recognized.
420000	423000	Yes, I think you think he probably had well enough in savings to live off of.
423000	426000	I wish that, you know, CEOs over here would do that.
426000	430000	Yeah, it was a very, very humble sort of sort of thing to do.
430000	434000	And it made a lot of mainstream coverage.
434000	437000	I heard not all of it was necessarily tasteful.
437000	443000	I want to say I heard that Arsenio Hall, who I didn't even realize was back on TV with a late night show.
443000	445000	I was like, how 1992 is that?
445000	447000	But he's back on TV with a late night show.
447000	452000	And there was some type of joke in the monologue or something where, you know, Hiroshi Yamauchi died today.
452000	454000	And it sounded something like this.
454000	456000	And they played the Pac-Man.
456000	457000	Really?
457000	459000	I don't know. I'm paraphrasing the joke.
459000	464000	I don't remember the exact words, but I know it was the Pac-Man noise because it made me think,
464000	471000	Well, if you want to get technical, sir, even though your joke is in incredibly poor taste, Pac-Man was a Namco character.
471000	474000	And I think a lot of people would recognize the Mario death noise.
474000	476000	So if you had to go there, but you know what?
476000	480000	Then I'm writing people's disgusting jokes for them.
480000	482000	So whatever.
482000	484000	You know how I found out about it, actually?
484000	489000	Oddly enough, I saw his picture on the Nikkei site.
489000	494000	And then later on, I saw someone had translated from the business news that he died.
494000	496000	And that's how I found out.
496000	505000	So, you know, obviously a lot of gaming in general is to thank to this man and his guidance.
505000	510000	Even if he wasn't necessarily a gamer himself, his business guidance led Nintendo to greatness.
510000	512000	I thought maybe we could just take a minute.
512000	519000	I mean, obviously I think it goes without saying, we want to dedicate our show tonight to his memory and everything he's done for us.
519000	524000	But I thought it might be a good time to just share some Nintendo memories and maybe some early Nintendo memories.
524000	526000	So I want to go around the room.
526000	528000	I'm not playing my 3DS right now, am I?
528000	533000	Not current Nintendo memories because your 3DS is so close to the mic, they can actually hear your Animal Crossing.
533000	537000	Hey, that's actually good background music to have the island music.
537000	539000	I suppose it is somewhat appropriate.
539000	545000	But in all seriousness, Dark Sakura, what's your first memory of the Nintendo Entertainment System?
545000	547000	When did you become an NES fangirl?
547000	549000	Now, I know you were more, you know, you were Sega.
549000	551000	No, I wasn't. Dan was Sega.
551000	553000	Oh, okay. Excuse me. Okay.
553000	557000	Then when did you, I was going to say, even if you were Team Sega, you still had love for Nintendo.
557000	559000	You know, where did...
559000	561000	I was pretty damn loyal to Nintendo when I was a kid.
561000	563000	So where did it all come from? Where did it start?
563000	565000	I went over to my friend's house and played Metroid.
565000	577000	I would go hang out over at my friend's house and she had, you know, she had Super Mario Brothers and Metroid and Legend of Zelda and for that god awful game Clu Clu Fucking Land.
577000	579000	Oh my god.
579000	581000	I kind of like that game.
581000	583000	I kind of too, but I hate it too.
583000	587000	It's one of those like, it's so niche and it's so stupid, like it's kind of cool.
587000	591000	Like if you know how to play Clu Clu Land, that kind of makes you a gaming hipster.
591000	593000	Yeah.
593000	603000	Well, I would also go over to, now at the time, and I have to give a little background, my friend Catherine, who would just go by Catherine, her mother was a Cathy.
603000	605000	My mother was a Cathy. They were both Cathleens.
605000	611000	And I have an Aunt Cathy and a bunch of people, so we would always joke which Cathy am I hanging with.
611000	615000	But anyway, her brother was like super into Metroid.
615000	617000	So we would, you know, Metroid and Metal Gear.
617000	621000	So it was a lot of playing that around over at her house.
621000	627000	And then my dad finally got me mine and he got me his favorite game, which was Sky Shark.
627000	633000	So I was playing like shooting games in, you know, 1941 and 1942.
633000	643000	And my papa, when he was alive, my dad's dad, we would play Jackal on his big screen TV where you could see every damn pixel.
644000	651000	And he'd say, now Maury, because he called me Maury. My middle name is Marie. He didn't like my first name for some reason.
651000	659000	I'd say Maury, I want you to throw that grenade over the wall and then I'm going to come around and shoot him.
661000	667000	I'd be like, okay, Papa. And then playing Abadox, because for some reason he liked Abadox.
667000	671000	Your papa likes some really strange NES games.
671000	677000	I know. But he was totally into the war games and Tecmo Bowl.
677000	681000	And my little sister, for some reason, liked that stupid game Mag Max.
681000	685000	Because you could just play it in loops over and over and over again. That game was awful.
685000	689000	And then my mom's friend was getting rid of her games.
689000	699000	And she gave me the golden game that kept my love of Nintendo living longer than the Super Nintendo had been in my life.
699000	709000	And that was Guardian Legend. And I beat the shit out of that game. I couldn't do it now, but I was pretty good at it then.
713000	717000	I can't really pin it on one thing. It's just lots of good things.
717000	726000	And then having a friend set his on fire. I don't know if you thought I was joking about it before, but I really was serious.
726000	730000	He threw it down a flight of stairs and set it on fire. And it still worked.
730000	732000	That's back when they built consoles.
732000	733000	They were built tough!
733000	737000	That's right. There was none of this red ring or yellow light shit.
737000	738000	Yeah.
738000	740000	You throw them down a flight of stairs and set them on fire and they still worked.
740000	745000	It still worked. Although I don't think it would have worked had he flushed it down the toilet like he wanted to.
745000	750000	That disgusting brown color that most Super Nintendos are these days is a badge of honor.
750000	755000	And it meant your mom was a chain smoker. That's what it meant in my house.
755000	758000	Loki, what were some early NES memories for you?
758000	767000	Well, I got my first NES. My parents surprised me with it with Breakthrough, Zelda, and Bubble Bobble.
767000	772000	So, I played the crap out of that. That and my friend's house.
772000	776000	Because everyone had an NES, so I played different games.
776000	778000	That's about it.
778000	781000	What was it about the NES that made you love it so much?
781000	785000	I don't know. I just liked video games anyways. I had a ColecoVision before that, so...
785000	787000	I did too!
787000	789000	So, it was just slightly better, you know?
789000	790000	Better graphics?
790000	798000	Yeah, better graphics, better controller. Because, you know, the ColecoVision was like a numpad with a little joystick on top.
798000	803000	At least it wasn't as bad as the Atari 5200 controller, though. That was pretty bad.
803000	806000	What would you say is your favorite NES game ever?
807000	809000	Um...
809000	812000	Probably, like, um...
812000	816000	Let's see, Legend of Zelda or...
816000	818000	Blaster Master?
818000	819000	Metroid's good, too.
819000	820000	It's one of my favorites, too.
820000	826000	I don't know. I mean, I know there were some NES games that I had that I played the crap out of, but...
826000	829000	I can't really remember which ones they were.
829000	831000	Um...
831000	833000	Mega Man 2, maybe? Yeah.
834000	837000	My earliest NES memory was that, um...
837000	842000	I wanted a Nintendo real bad for kind of the same reason Loki did, is that I liked video games anyway.
842000	844000	We had an Atari 2600.
844000	849000	So, of course, when I saw that there was a Nintendo out there and I got to play it at the store, I really wanted them.
849000	851000	And I think I played it at a friend's house, too.
851000	857000	And I finally was rewarded with one for getting straight A's in the fourth grade.
857000	859000	I got my Nintendo Entertainment System.
859000	865000	We went to Sears and bought the NES that came with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt.
865000	870000	And I just played the crap out of that. I played so much Mario Brothers. It was insane.
870000	871000	Gray Gun era.
871000	873000	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and the Zapper and all that stuff.
873000	878000	One of the other early games I got was also The Legend of Zelda, because I didn't get the NES when it first came out.
878000	884000	But by the time I bought it, The Legend of Zelda was out and I had a ton of friends in school that were playing it.
884000	889000	And I remember before I had an NES, I overheard friends talking about it and I was super jealous.
889000	892000	Like, I want to play The Legend of Zelda. I want a Nintendo.
892000	894000	You know, kind of that whole jealousy.
894000	902000	So, it was really great when I did get Zelda with the NES, because I played the crap out of that game.
902000	905000	And it got to the point where people were asking me for advice.
905000	909000	I think I've told this story on the show before, but I'll kind of quickly recap.
909000	913000	You know, for somebody that was picked on a lot as a kid, which, you know, I'm sure a lot of us were,
913000	918000	but I just remember that was a really awesome turnaround where I went from the guy that's being picked on all the time
918000	922000	to the guy that will tell you how to get to whatever dungeon in the second quest,
922000	924000	so you better be nice to him type of thing.
924000	926000	So, that was always kind of nice.
926000	932000	So, my favorite NES game. See, I would have to kind of jack some of the early answers,
932000	937000	and I would say probably The Guardian Legend is honestly my favorite NES game of all time as well,
937000	939000	just because of the hybrid of it.
939000	947000	Outside of that, honestly, I know it's really cliche, but I kind of think Super Mario Bros. 2 is one of my favorite NES games,
947000	950000	just because I just have so many memories of that.
950000	954000	I remember renting that game on New Year's Eve or something,
954000	960000	and I played the crap out of that game one New Year's, and played it from start to finish.
960000	962000	And, God, I love that game so much.
962000	966000	I don't see how you could play the crap out of a crap-free game.
967000	968000	Fair enough.
968000	971000	But, I'm going to throw, you want an obscure title?
971000	973000	This is one of my other favorite NES games.
973000	974000	Make me proud.
974000	975000	Because it was such a hybrid game.
975000	978000	Did you ever play Magic of Scheherazade?
978000	979000	I did.
979000	980000	Yes.
980000	984000	Not very much of it. I rented it, but it was like during exams or something.
984000	988000	It was like a hybrid of Zelda and Final Fantasy, and it was kind of rad.
988000	993000	Now, because it kind of tried to do too much, it kind of had some flaws,
993000	996000	but when you're like ten years old, you overlook those flaws,
996000	999000	and you're like, this game's awesome. It has everything.
999000	1001000	So, there you go.
1001000	1003000	Some folks in chat, GameGuru in chat says,
1003000	1007000	as for favorites, Super Mario Bros. 3, bar none.
1007000	1010000	That was one of my all-time favorites too, and I think for a lot of us.
1010000	1014000	I remember going to one of my best friends back in the day.
1014000	1015000	His name was Devin.
1015000	1019000	I went to his house, and we stayed up until like four in the morning
1019000	1021000	playing Super Mario Bros. 3,
1021000	1023000	and we were doing the whole two-player.
1023000	1025000	Who doesn't remember playing that with another person,
1025000	1027000	and you would always fight the other person?
1027000	1031000	My sister and I were just complete bitches to each other over that game.
1031000	1033000	So, there you go.
1033000	1037000	Some NES memories from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1037000	1039000	Again, rest in peace,
1039000	1043000	and thank you for all you've done for this industry, Hiroshi Yamauchi.
1043000	1045000	Thank you.
1045000	1049000	Let's move on and get into some of our recent gaming memories,
1049000	1052000	such as the games that you've been playing this week.
1052000	1055000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1055000	1058000	I have to freaking replant one of my stupid perfect pears
1058000	1060000	because the fucking trees die.
1060000	1062000	You've got real problems, young lady.
1062000	1065000	I do have real problems. I have mental problems,
1065000	1069000	like Reginald and Nedroid, which is still my favorite webcomic.
1069000	1073000	Anyway, I've been playing Animal Crossing.
1073000	1075000	I might open my village during the show.
1075000	1076000	I'm still thinking about it.
1076000	1078000	If enough people show interest, I will open my village.
1078000	1081000	Damn, that got bit by a mosquito.
1081000	1085000	So, I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV,
1085000	1090000	and I have finally joined the Twin Adders
1090000	1096000	because, first of all, the flaming people suck.
1096000	1100000	I hate their stupid privilege 1% country,
1100000	1105000	and I refuse to be a part of their whole...
1106000	1108000	In the beta, I was with that nation,
1108000	1110000	but I changed it when the 14 came out.
1110000	1112000	You screw the Sultana, okay?
1112000	1115000	That little bitch does not get any of my money.
1115000	1119000	I'm gonna give it to the hippies because...
1119000	1122000	Occupy. Occupy Ol' Da.
1122000	1126000	Just so people kind of understand for Final Fantasy XIV,
1126000	1129000	a lot of MMOs historically have had factions,
1129000	1132000	and a lot of people break it down to good and evil,
1132000	1133000	but it's not always that way.
1133000	1136000	For instance, World of Warcraft has the Alliance and the Horde,
1136000	1140000	although the Horde is not necessarily evil or whatever.
1140000	1141000	Those are the two factions.
1141000	1142000	They're just assholes.
1142000	1146000	Final Fantasy XIV is a faction-free game.
1146000	1149000	Everybody can talk to each other,
1149000	1151000	because usually in WoW, if you play Horde,
1151000	1153000	but your friend plays Alliance, you can't talk to each other.
1153000	1155000	Unless you're through real ID or whatever.
1155000	1157000	But in Final Fantasy, that doesn't stop you.
1157000	1160000	But you will join one of three nations throughout the story.
1160000	1162000	And you don't even have to.
1162000	1163000	Yeah, technically you don't have to.
1163000	1165000	And you can switch whenever you want.
1165000	1169000	I think those allegiances will come into PvP later on,
1169000	1171000	but for right now it only has minor impacts on the story.
1171000	1173000	But I hate PvP, so that will never happen.
1173000	1176000	Right. Well, there's not even PvP in the game yet.
1176000	1177000	Well, I still hate it.
1177000	1182000	So, I've been playing that.
1182000	1184000	I've been playing more fractal,
1184000	1188000	and I have actually picked up an older game on my phone,
1188000	1190000	and I've been playing it stupidly obsessively,
1190000	1193000	for some stupid reason, because you know me in puzzle games.
1193000	1195000	I've been playing Bejeweled.
1195000	1197000	Not even Bejeweled Blitz, I haven't played that yet.
1197000	1199000	I am playing old-school Bejeweled.
1199000	1202000	I've been in Diamond Mine mode for like...
1202000	1204000	It helps me get sleepy at night,
1204000	1206000	as I have a lot of trouble sleeping,
1206000	1208000	so I play Bejeweled at night.
1208000	1210000	And, um...
1210000	1212000	Yeah.
1212000	1214000	I know I played something else,
1214000	1216000	but for the life of me, I can't remember.
1216000	1218000	You'll think of it later and then shout it out randomly
1218000	1219000	in the middle of his ass.
1219000	1220000	Yes, I will.
1220000	1221000	All right.
1221000	1223000	Loki, do I even have to ask how many hours
1223000	1225000	you sunk into Grand Theft Auto 5 this week?
1225000	1227000	I don't remember how many hours I sunk in,
1227000	1232000	but I think it's at least 16, at least.
1232000	1233000	I don't know.
1233000	1236000	I'm almost at the end of the campaign,
1236000	1238000	and it's great.
1238000	1240000	I love every second of it, so...
1240000	1242000	I even got my son to play a little bit of it.
1242000	1243000	He's been driving...
1243000	1245000	Wait! Wait a minute!
1245000	1246000	Wait a minute!
1246000	1247000	He likes driving the car.
1247000	1250000	You're letting your three-year-old son
1250000	1252000	play Grand Theft Auto 5?
1252000	1253000	He's not killing people.
1253000	1255000	He's driving back and forth on a beach.
1255000	1257000	Three-year-olds have no moral compass.
1257000	1258000	It does not matter.
1258000	1259000	No, I just...
1259000	1261000	Loki can do what he wants,
1261000	1264000	and I know he's not showing the bad parts of the game.
1264000	1265000	He's just driving a car.
1265000	1266000	You have to admit,
1266000	1268000	the initial sentence of you saying,
1268000	1270000	yeah, I'm letting my son play Grand Theft Auto 5
1270000	1271000	is kind of funny.
1271000	1273000	Well, he doesn't really know how to play.
1273000	1275000	All he can really do is just press the gas,
1275000	1277000	and I have to kind of steer for him,
1277000	1279000	and he just presses the gas,
1279000	1281000	and laughs when he hits stuff, like...
1281000	1282000	Like people?
1282000	1283000	No, like fences.
1283000	1284000	You know, not people.
1284000	1285000	And the people are all fine.
1285000	1287000	They just go to the hospital,
1287000	1289000	and they come out just fine.
1289000	1291000	It's like when he asks, like he's all...
1291000	1292000	And he even asks,
1292000	1294000	he's all, stop hitting that man.
1294000	1297000	Why'd we take that guy's car?
1297000	1300000	So he understands that it's wrong.
1300000	1301000	I'm like, it's okay.
1301000	1302000	They're just letting us borrow the car.
1302000	1303000	It's okay.
1303000	1304000	I just want to point out, Loki,
1304000	1306000	these episodes are recorded.
1306000	1307000	They're put on the internet,
1307000	1309000	and somebody will save them for a very long time.
1309000	1311000	Exactly, and I took video.
1311000	1312000	So it's all good.
1312000	1313000	I'm going to upload video.
1313000	1315000	So someday, Loki,
1315000	1318000	when your son gets busted for street racing,
1318000	1320000	all Fast and Furious style in daddy's car,
1320000	1322000	I'm going to say,
1322000	1324000	do you know why this happened?
1324000	1328000	Well, so I drove my uncle's Trans Am when I was six.
1328000	1330000	I do have video.
1330000	1332000	Do I street race?
1332000	1333000	I have lots of video, actually.
1333000	1336000	My brother tried to make me drive his car when I was like 10,
1336000	1337000	and I cried.
1337000	1339000	When I was six...
1339000	1340000	No, he had a Thunderbird.
1340000	1341000	It was great, though.
1341000	1344000	Okay, so I was trying to get some video of him yesterday,
1344000	1346000	because he did it yesterday, too.
1346000	1350000	He was driving over these hills in the middle of the desert,
1350000	1352000	and I was like, I'm going camping,
1352000	1355000	or we're going to Trader Joe's,
1355000	1358000	or I'm driving to Safeway.
1358000	1359000	Why does the middle of the desert
1359000	1361000	make your son think about Trader Joe's?
1361000	1362000	No, that was camping.
1362000	1363000	He's just pretending.
1363000	1364000	He's driving like a truck.
1364000	1367000	He's all, I'm driving the truck to Safeway,
1367000	1368000	and stuff like that,
1368000	1370000	because that's where we went today.
1370000	1372000	Yeah, it's completely harmless.
1372000	1375000	It's not like we're running through an elderly,
1375000	1378000	old folks home or something like that.
1378000	1380000	He's not murdering people with a gun.
1380000	1384000	He's just driving a car or a bus.
1384000	1387000	He thinks it's funny when you can push the Y button
1387000	1389000	to get the guy in and out of the car.
1389000	1390000	He thought that was hilarious.
1390000	1393000	And then he's like, look, it's turning the wheels.
1393000	1396000	WhatupG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,
1396000	1399000	has Loki let him fly a plane yet?
1399000	1401000	Oh, God, no, because the reason why is
1401000	1405000	he doesn't know how to even drive the car,
1405000	1409000	so flying a plane, it would just be over really fast,
1409000	1411000	and he gets frustrated.
1411000	1414000	If he hits the wall and he can't figure out how to get around it,
1414000	1416000	he just gets frustrated almost immediately.
1416000	1417000	He has no patience.
1417000	1421000	So yeah, a plane, I thought that'd be fun.
1421000	1424000	I wanted to give him a boat because it's the ocean.
1424000	1426000	He's not going to run into anything out there.
1426000	1431000	But he just wanted to drive a car, so let him drive a car.
1431000	1433000	Well, away from the stories about your son
1433000	1436000	playing the game for a minute and back to you playing the game,
1436000	1438000	what is it about the game that makes it so great
1438000	1440000	that you come through the door of the OLR Studios and go,
1440000	1442000	Rob, when are you getting Grand Theft Auto V?
1442000	1445000	Well, first off, you like the sandbox games
1445000	1446000	where you can pretty much do whatever you want,
1446000	1449000	and that's this game, and there's a lot of realism to it,
1449000	1452000	or I should say immersion to it.
1452000	1456000	For example, if I run over some dude or something in the mountains,
1456000	1459000	like some hiker, if I just plow over my car,
1459000	1462000	later on I may be driving, and I'll hear a news report on the radio
1462000	1465000	saying that a hiker has gone missing.
1465000	1468000	And then they try to get you back because they know what you did that summer.
1468000	1470000	And there's all sorts of crazy stuff.
1470000	1473000	There's a whole thing that has to do with some hidden letters
1473000	1475000	that you have to collect, and there's actually a ghost
1475000	1477000	up in the mountains and stuff.
1477000	1482000	There's all sorts of crazy acid trips that these guys can go on.
1482000	1484000	Is it really funny, though?
1484000	1486000	Because I will say, I do like sandbox games,
1486000	1488000	but part of the reason why I love Saints Row
1488000	1490000	is that it's so over-the-top.
1490000	1492000	I don't think I've laughed harder at a video game
1492000	1494000	than I did the opening to Saints Row 3.
1494000	1496000	Well, Saints Row is just kind of like,
1496000	1498000	and even playing both,
1498000	1503000	I think the best analogy I've seen was someone said,
1503000	1505000	Grand Theft Auto is a parody of reality,
1505000	1507000	and Saints Row is a parody of Grand Theft Auto,
1507000	1512000	where you can tell that they went into incredible detail
1512000	1514000	with every single thing in this game
1514000	1518000	as far as the immersion with the internet in the game,
1518000	1521000	all the different brands that are parodies of things,
1521000	1524000	whereas Saints Row 4 is making a parody of The Matrix.
1524000	1526000	I mean, come on, dude. The Matrix.
1526000	1528000	A 90s movie?
1528000	1532000	They're really cutting edge with their stuff. I don't know.
1532000	1534000	I mean, don't get me wrong, Saints Row is a fun game,
1534000	1536000	but it's just so...
1536000	1538000	When you play both, you're just like,
1538000	1540000	man, that's really just basic,
1540000	1542000	as far as what they put in there,
1542000	1544000	and even, like, it feels like the effort
1544000	1546000	was really kind of not there.
1546000	1549000	I mean, but then again, this game took five years to develop,
1549000	1551000	and Saints Row III, probably a lot less than that,
1551000	1554000	and Saints Row 4, even less than that, so...
1554000	1556000	I don't know.
1556000	1558000	I just like all the detail in the game,
1558000	1559000	and the writing's really good.
1559000	1560000	The story's really interesting.
1560000	1561000	The characters are very interesting,
1561000	1563000	especially Trevor's just nuts,
1563000	1567000	and just seeing all the things that go kind of awkward
1567000	1569000	and stuff in the game,
1569000	1571000	and all the different conflicts that are there,
1571000	1573000	it's a really interesting storyline,
1573000	1575000	so that's kind of what the draw is, I think.
1575000	1578000	What's next for Grand Theft Auto with the online component?
1578000	1580000	We were talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show,
1580000	1582000	but just to kind of retouch on it a little bit,
1582000	1584000	what do people have to look forward to in a couple weeks
1584000	1585000	when the online part opens up?
1585000	1587000	Well, first off, they said, I think there's supposed to be
1587000	1589000	about 700 missions in the game,
1589000	1590000	so you're gonna be able to pull heists
1590000	1592000	and do robberies and all sorts of stuff
1592000	1595000	on top of normal death matches and races
1595000	1596000	and that kind of thing.
1596000	1598000	Plus, there's gonna be editors in the game
1598000	1600000	to make your own custom content,
1600000	1602000	so you can make custom death match maps,
1602000	1604000	you can make custom races,
1604000	1605000	and that's just the beginning.
1605000	1607000	They're eventually gonna get it to where you can do
1607000	1611000	custom missions and all other game types.
1611000	1613000	And then, on top of that, they've built the game
1613000	1616000	in a way that it's just gonna keep expanding
1616000	1617000	beyond Grand Theft Auto 5.
1617000	1619000	You're not just gonna be stuck in San Andreas,
1619000	1621000	they're gonna have it where you can,
1621000	1623000	they can basically increase the size of the map
1623000	1626000	and add new cities and areas as time goes on.
1626000	1630000	So, it's just gonna keep building from there,
1630000	1633000	and it sounds exciting.
1633000	1635000	Plus, getting to play with people again,
1635000	1637000	because, you know, it's hard to find people
1637000	1638000	for Grand Theft Auto 4 nowadays.
1638000	1641000	And you're on both 360 and PlayStation 3?
1641000	1643000	Yeah, and I'm kind of hoping that they both tie together.
1643000	1644000	Do you have one of those little squads
1644000	1646000	I see people advertising on Twitter?
1646000	1648000	I do have a crew available.
1648000	1651000	I will link it in the chatroom.
1651000	1654000	It's the VOG Network crew,
1654000	1656000	and I'm trying to remember,
1656000	1658000	the first thing you probably want to do
1658000	1660000	is get a membership, if you don't have it already,
1660000	1663000	to the Rockstar Social Club,
1663000	1664000	which you can go to.
1664000	1667000	It's socialclub.rockstargames.com.
1667000	1669000	And so, if you have a membership there,
1669000	1671000	you know, cool.
1671000	1674000	If not, create one.
1674000	1676000	And then you can look for, I think,
1676000	1678000	well, my name on there is Loki O-L-R,
1678000	1681000	or I want to say you can search
1681000	1683000	by the name of the crew as well,
1683000	1685000	which would be VOG Network,
1685000	1687000	and then our little tag,
1687000	1689000	since you have it had the four letters,
1689000	1690000	is VOG N, so.
1690000	1692000	Okay, awesome.
1692000	1695000	Yeah, so I'm actually trying to see real quick here,
1695000	1696000	if I can probably link it.
1696000	1697000	I'll link it on,
1697000	1701000	I had it linked on Twitter at one time,
1701000	1704000	but I'll link it again,
1704000	1710000	so we can add everybody before it launches.
1710000	1712000	And I'm sure if it's anything like it has been
1712000	1714000	with the Social Club stuff so far,
1714000	1718000	it may be a little downsy by the time it launches,
1718000	1720000	because they've been having little server issues,
1720000	1721000	as with anything.
1721000	1723000	Uh-oh, all right.
1723000	1725000	Any other games besides Grand Theft Auto
1725000	1726000	you want to talk about?
1726000	1727000	Nope.
1727000	1728000	All right, then my gaming week,
1728000	1729000	pretty similar to Loki,
1729000	1730000	I've been focused on mainly one game,
1730000	1732000	and that game is Final Fantasy XIV,
1732000	1734000	which I've talked about ad nauseam in previous weeks,
1734000	1736000	so I won't really get into too much detail.
1736000	1739000	I will just say I'm a level 45 white mage,
1739000	1741000	so I'm getting a little closer to end game
1741000	1745000	and all the AK runs and Efreet hard mode and all that.
1745000	1748000	I do love how they wound the story into this game, though,
1748000	1749000	I will say that much.
1749000	1753000	You know, the story really kind of keeps you going,
1753000	1756000	and it's really interesting the way they did that,
1756000	1758000	where not a lot of MMOs have been able to kind of
1758000	1760000	make those big grandiose cut scenes
1760000	1761000	the way Final Fantasy does
1761000	1763000	that makes you really want to watch, you know,
1763000	1764000	when I was playing World of Warcraft,
1764000	1765000	I skipped most things,
1765000	1766000	unless it was a big cinematic,
1766000	1768000	I'd watch those or something else, you know,
1768000	1770000	but the Final Fantasy cut scenes are so engaging,
1770000	1772000	it really kind of keeps me like, oh.
1772000	1774000	For the record, the same thing works again.
1774000	1775000	Oh, with the screenshots?
1775000	1777000	Yeah, so you can do screenshots during cinematics.
1777000	1778000	Oh, cool.
1778000	1781000	And is it just me or is Thancred like sort of like
1781000	1783000	make you think of Tidus?
1783000	1784000	A little bit.
1784000	1786000	Don't they have similar voice actors?
1786000	1788000	No, he has the voice actor of both here, doesn't he?
1788000	1789000	I think.
1789000	1792000	But it was sort of interesting hearing Fenris' voice
1792000	1795000	coming out of the Elvin guy.
1795000	1796000	Yeah, yeah.
1796000	1798000	So I haven't heard a lot of the voice acting
1798000	1801000	because I'm on Skype a lot when I play the game with friends.
1801000	1802000	So we're just chatting through it.
1802000	1805000	So, yeah, I'll have to do some more live stream of it later.
1805000	1807000	It's just my frame rate really suffers
1807000	1809000	unless I can like get on the PlayStation 3
1809000	1812000	and get one of those boxes that streams or something.
1812000	1815000	Anyhow, I will say outside of Final Fantasy XIV,
1815000	1819000	I sort of discovered a renaissance this week for pinball games.
1819000	1822000	And I think a lot of that is because PlayStation Plus right now
1822000	1825000	is giving away Star Wars pinball with the Plus.
1825000	1827000	So I downloaded that and I was checking out those tables.
1827000	1830000	And I really like the Episode 5 table in particular.
1830000	1832000	Don't really care for the Boba Fett table.
1832000	1834000	The clones table is pretty good too.
1834000	1836000	So I was enjoying playing those tables.
1836000	1841000	And then it made me realize like why did I never get Zen Pinball 2 on PlayStation?
1841000	1843000	And then I realized that was free too.
1843000	1845000	And I had tables from one that imported.
1845000	1849000	So it's like I already had like all these tables to play in Zen Pinball 2.
1849000	1853000	So I checked that out and it came with the Vita version.
1853000	1857000	All of it did because, you know, they have that whole cross thing.
1857000	1859000	So I actually had a reason to play my Vita.
1859000	1861000	And I was playing Zen Pinball on the Vita.
1861000	1865000	And I got to say love, love, love that you can rotate the Vita
1865000	1867000	so that it's a vertical screen.
1867000	1870000	And so you have the vertical play field like you expect a pinball game to be, right?
1870000	1872000	That's nothing new.
1872000	1874000	And you use the touch screen. I know it's not new.
1874000	1876000	The WonderSwan did that.
1876000	1879000	I know it's not new, but okay, how long ago was the WonderSwan
1879000	1880000	and do we ever have it in America?
1880000	1881000	The PSP did that.
1881000	1883000	You know I'm giving you crap.
1883000	1885000	But the PSP wasn't giving me these games free either.
1885000	1889000	And the PSP did not have the touch screen on the front.
1889000	1891000	So the cool thing about the Vita is you just tap the touch screen.
1891000	1893000	Left side is left flipper, right side is right flipper.
1893000	1895000	And then you kind of drag down to do the bumper.
1895000	1896000	It makes a lot of sense.
1896000	1898000	So it's a nice little time waster in that regard.
1898000	1901000	So yeah, if you have PlayStation Plus and you have a Vita
1901000	1905000	and you like pinball, I don't know why you're not getting this game.
1905000	1907000	You should really think about doing that
1907000	1910000	because it's a great little time waster on the Vita.
1910000	1914000	And I did find the link for the crew thing.
1914000	1916000	It is just VOG Network.
1916000	1920000	So socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.
1920000	1922000	And that's how you get to it.
1922000	1924000	We already have nine people.
1924000	1926000	And once we get more people,
1926000	1929000	I'll start divvying up where people are
1929000	1932000	because you can actually have a hierarchy of players and stuff.
1932000	1935000	Well, I will briefly mention
1935000	1939000	where a lot of the VOG people are playing Final Fantasy XIV
1939000	1941000	since I know you've got your game and I've got mine.
1941000	1943000	We are on the Midgarcimer server,
1943000	1945000	and our free company is called End of Line.
1945000	1947000	We have 45 characters in our thing right now.
1947000	1950000	To be fair, a lot of it is like friends of friends.
1950000	1953000	It's not just exclusively people that listen to VOG stuff.
1953000	1955000	But it's a good group of people.
1955000	1957000	And yeah, you can check that out.
1957000	1959000	All the information is at vognetwork.com
1959000	1961000	in the Hoard House forums
1961000	1963000	because technically Hoard House is my show about online games.
1963000	1965000	So everything you need to know is in the Hoard House forums
1965000	1967000	at vognetwork.com.
1967000	1969000	And you should probably post the Grand Theft Auto stuff
1969000	1971000	to the OLR forum.
1971000	1973000	Yeah, I was going to at some point. I need to create a logo.
1973000	1975000	Oh, okay.
1975000	1977000	Well, you know you have a graphic designer right here.
1977000	1980000	Well, no, they have a little app thing in there.
1980000	1982000	So I have to create a logo.
1983000	1985000	I just haven't done it yet.
1985000	1987000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
1987000	1989000	Well, I think that's enough of our gaming week.
1989000	1991000	Housekeeping, I'll just quickly say, don't forget,
1991000	1993000	we're on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
1993000	1995000	And we are on Facebook.
1995000	1997000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1997000	1999000	Alright, enough talk. We've done a lot of reminiscing about old gaming
1999000	2001000	and new gaming. Let's get into gaming news
2001000	2003000	and what is going on in the industry this week.
2003000	2005000	Loki.
2005000	2007000	Val's going to announce something tomorrow.
2007000	2009000	It's probably going to have something to do with the Steam Box
2009000	2011000	since they were talking or
2011000	2013000	Gabe was teasing something about
2013000	2015000	a Linux. Well,
2015000	2017000	the Steam Box actually last week, so
2017000	2019000	I think that's what it is.
2019000	2021000	And it's going to
2021000	2023000	be announced 10 a.m.
2023000	2025000	Pacific time tomorrow.
2025000	2027000	Which is sad because
2027000	2029000	by the time most people hear this
2029000	2031000	because obviously we have our live audience
2031000	2033000	but the podcast people will already
2033000	2035000	know what this news is.
2035000	2037000	At least the first of the three announcements.
2037000	2039000	There's three announcements.
2039000	2041000	There's Circle. Circle in brackets.
2041000	2043000	And Circle plus Circle.
2043000	2045000	Obviously, we are having
2045000	2047000	a lot of fun with this on Bobby's show tonight.
2047000	2049000	A lot of folks going
2049000	2051000	three things. Half-Life
2051000	2053000	3. Have you ever noticed
2053000	2055000	like, I don't know, I'm sure someone's noticed this before
2055000	2057000	but like the Half-Life logo and stuff
2057000	2059000	looks like a stick figure arm holding a crowbar.
2059000	2061000	I never
2061000	2063000	really thought of that.
2063000	2065000	It's kind of funny. It actually does look like
2065000	2067000	a stick figure holding up a crowbar. So speculation
2067000	2069000	just rampant wank speculation on what these
2069000	2071000	announcements could be. I think
2071000	2073000	more information on the Steam Box is a given.
2073000	2075000	And I'm going to repeat
2075000	2077000	some of the things I said on the call on Bobby's show
2077000	2079000	because it's my guess and that hasn't changed
2079000	2081000	in 15 minutes or however long it's been.
2081000	2083000	I think Half-Life
2083000	2085000	3 is not the announcement. I think
2085000	2087000	Left 4 Dead 3 is going to be the announcement.
2087000	2089000	I think that's, you know, they will be
2089000	2091000	hyping up towards a third game in
2091000	2093000	a series but it's going to be Left 4 Dead 3. Which is not
2093000	2095000	bad news. You know, it's been
2095000	2097000	a few years since Left 4 Dead 2. I can see them doing
2097000	2099000	you know, Steam Box
2099000	2101000	Left 4 Dead 3 troll
2101000	2103000	announcement and then, you know,
2103000	2105000	Half-Life 3. No, I kind of think
2105000	2107000	the other announcement, you know, Dota 2
2107000	2109000	is so huge for Valve right
2109000	2111000	now, especially internationally.
2111000	2113000	I kind of think one of the big 3 announcements
2113000	2115000	has to be about Dota and
2115000	2117000	I would think maybe if they
2117000	2119000	announce the Steam Box, maybe there's some way that
2119000	2121000	Dota interface, like I think they're going to try
2121000	2123000	to get Dota 2 in your living room.
2123000	2125000	So maybe like, controller
2125000	2127000	support for Dota or something along those lines.
2127000	2129000	That's cool but at the same
2129000	2131000	time, the announcement
2131000	2133000	of Half-Life 3 could really throw a
2133000	2135000	monkey wrench into like next gen, you
2135000	2137000	know, consoles and stuff like that
2137000	2139000	and the people's needs for that
2139000	2141000	stuff. I'm interested in Steam Box, I mean
2141000	2143000	depending on what the specs are and what
2143000	2145000	it's able to run, I mean, because I do have my
2145000	2147000	laptop so I don't
2147000	2149000	necessarily need another gaming PC
2149000	2151000	although my first gaming
2151000	2153000	PC has kind of fallen
2153000	2155000	apart, so maybe I do need
2155000	2157000	a new gaming PC.
2157000	2159000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Rob Roberts, what if
2159000	2161000	Portal 3 is the announcement? You know,
2161000	2163000	I just,
2163000	2165000	because Valve is so allergic to the
2165000	2167000	number 3, I don't want to say I'd be
2167000	2169000	disappointed if Portal 3 is the announcement, quite
2169000	2171000	no, but I would be kind of
2171000	2173000	surprised that that's the game they're
2173000	2175000	so quick to go back and visit again.
2175000	2177000	I just would be a little bit surprised. What if it's Left
2177000	2179000	for Dead 3, Portal 3, and
2179000	2181000	Half-Life 3? I think
2181000	2183000	a lot of the internet would probably poop their
2183000	2185000	pants, and rightfully so. I think
2185000	2187000	that would be a lot of great news. Three things about
2187000	2189000	three,
2189000	2191000	you know, there's also the possibility, though,
2191000	2193000	that Valve is doing something we haven't
2193000	2195000	heard of yet, a completely new IP
2195000	2197000	and I think that would be okay too.
2197000	2199000	So, yeah, Circle, or
2199000	2201000	Bracket Circle, and Bracket
2201000	2203000	Circle, and Bracket plus Bracket, or
2203000	2205000	Circle plus Circle.
2205000	2207000	Well, Circle plus Circle, that
2207000	2209000	sounds like Portal to me. Gosh, you're talking
2209000	2211000	about Hollywood squares all of a sudden, Circle
2211000	2213000	gets the square. Alright,
2213000	2215000	um, alright.
2215000	2217000	Portal 3, I
2217000	2219000	just, it would have to be a different
2219000	2221000	test subject.
2221000	2223000	So now my brain is thinking around all of that.
2223000	2225000	Well, you know, I will say this,
2225000	2227000	speaking of Dota, which I brought up
2227000	2229000	a minute ago, there's a video circulating
2229000	2231000	where they're gonna have a, or it might be out now,
2231000	2233000	the GLaDOS Announcer Pack for Dota 2,
2233000	2235000	and it's hilarious.
2235000	2237000	I know I linked it on my Twitter earlier this week.
2237000	2239000	It's Oda, the DS Silent.
2239000	2241000	They had
2241000	2243000	some hilarious, well god, what
2243000	2245000	was one of the lines, I should try to find it on my
2245000	2247000	Twitter real quick, because one of the whole, like,
2247000	2249000	welcome to Dota things was so
2249000	2251000	funny. Um,
2251000	2253000	oh gosh, I'm gonna try and find this real quick.
2253000	2255000	Anything else you wanted to say about Portal 3,
2255000	2257000	Dark Soccer, while I try to dig this up?
2257000	2259000	Um, no, other than, it was pretty
2259000	2261000	cool hearing her in Pacific Rim.
2261000	2263000	Oh yeah?
2263000	2265000	Yeah, they actually did the
2265000	2267000	modulation effect without the flanging,
2267000	2269000	so it was sort of interesting.
2269000	2271000	Okay, I found it, I found what I was looking for.
2273000	2275000	Zanes, welcome to Dota.
2275000	2277000	Don't forget your little plastic
2277000	2279000	sword, and all your chins.
2283000	2285000	Little bit of shade from GLaDOS there.
2285000	2287000	I love that, play it again.
2287000	2289000	Play it again? Alright.
2289000	2291000	I love her, she's such a sassy bitch.
2291000	2293000	Don't forget your plastic sword and all your chins.
2293000	2295000	Here we go, one more time.
2295000	2297000	Zanes, welcome to Dota.
2297000	2299000	Don't forget your little plastic sword,
2299000	2301000	and all your chins.
2301000	2303000	This video is like 21 minutes of GLaDOS now,
2303000	2305000	so there's more.
2305000	2307000	And your giant flagon of gravy, welcome to
2307000	2309000	Medieval Times.
2309000	2311000	How many in your party tonight?
2311000	2313000	I love it.
2313000	2315000	That would make me play the game.
2315000	2317000	Doesn't that make you want to play Dota 2?
2317000	2319000	Just for that sassy bitch.
2319000	2321000	By the way, I have to sort of
2321000	2323000	derail a little bit. Did you see the person
2323000	2325000	cosplaying GLaDOS?
2325000	2327000	There was
2327000	2329000	video and pictures up of this girl.
2329000	2331000	A lot of people cosplay GLaDOS, but yes.
2331000	2333000	No, no, not doing the
2333000	2335000	whole anthropomorphic version.
2335000	2337000	Hanging from a harness.
2337000	2339000	With a mask
2339000	2341000	and everything.
2341000	2343000	And moving around and everything
2343000	2345000	and doing the voice and all that.
2345000	2347000	That was cool.
2347000	2349000	Some folks in chat
2349000	2351000	are, as far as the 3s go,
2351000	2353000	I see GameGuru says
2353000	2355000	Team Fortress 3
2355000	2357000	could be a possibility.
2357000	2359000	But Act F follows that up saying,
2359000	2361000	I don't see Valve making a Team Fortress 3 anytime soon.
2361000	2363000	It does seem like they are still adding
2363000	2365000	every day to Team Fortress 2.
2365000	2367000	It would seem a little
2367000	2369000	soon for a 3.
2369000	2371000	More hats. More tie-ins to other
2371000	2373000	products, more like.
2373000	2375000	Alright, well moving on to another company.
2375000	2377000	I want to talk a little bit about what Microsoft
2377000	2379000	talked about this week. They were
2379000	2381000	at Tokyo Game Show, believe it or not, showing off
2381000	2383000	some things going on there. One of the
2383000	2385000	things that was talked about though, that unfortunately
2385000	2387000	yet another perceived negative
2387000	2389000	for Microsoft's system
2389000	2391000	was in a quote from Albert
2391000	2393000	Pinello, who's the Senior Director of Product
2393000	2395000	Management. Quote, We don't support
2395000	2397000	vertical orientation. Do it
2397000	2399000	at your own risk. It wouldn't be
2399000	2401000	a cooling problem. We just didn't design the
2401000	2403000	drive for vertical. Because it's a slot
2403000	2405000	loading drive, we just didn't design it
2405000	2407000	for both. I don't think this is a big
2407000	2409000	deal whatsoever. I only
2409000	2411000	bring it up because I saw it all over
2411000	2413000	Twitter and Facebook and
2413000	2415000	so people are talking about this, but I
2415000	2417000	I'm going to be honest,
2417000	2419000	I kind of think if you're out there
2419000	2421000	going, oh my god, Microsoft
2421000	2423000	fucks up again, you can't have your thing vertical,
2423000	2425000	I kind of think you're looking for
2425000	2427000	a reason to dump on Microsoft at this point.
2427000	2429000	I don't think it's that big a deal.
2429000	2431000	It's not going to throw off the feng shui
2431000	2433000	of your living room cabinet or something.
2433000	2435000	Well, it's the size of a cable box anyways.
2435000	2437000	Stack your cable box. But I'm just saying
2437000	2439000	and who cares, so it doesn't
2439000	2441000	doesn't
2441000	2443000	stand up or whatever.
2443000	2445000	The whole thing is because idiots before
2445000	2447000	kept knocking it over and they had a whole issue
2447000	2449000	with that. Blaming it on the slot
2449000	2451000	loading disk drive is kind of dumb.
2451000	2453000	I would just say it's because you guys are fucking idiots
2453000	2455000	and you keep knocking that shit over. I mean, look at
2455000	2457000	the 360. You guys
2457000	2459000	doesn't the Wii have a slot drive
2459000	2461000	and most people put that vertically? The Wii has a slot
2461000	2463000	drive. The PlayStation 4 has a slot drive.
2463000	2465000	But the Wii also has that little
2465000	2467000	cradle so it's a little harder to knock it over.
2467000	2469000	Yeah, but you know,
2469000	2471000	plastic is expensive. I know. And I think
2471000	2473000	that thing probably weighs a metric ton
2473000	2475000	so, you know. But I just, I don't
2475000	2477000	I don't know. I mean, there are some people that are
2477000	2479000	legitimately like, I like to have my consoles
2479000	2481000	vertical, blah blah blah. The Xbox One is
2481000	2483000	about the size of an original Xbox
2483000	2485000	Duke controller so
2485000	2487000	it's, I can see why.
2487000	2489000	But yeah, I mean, come on. It looks
2489000	2491000	like it'd be very unstable standing up
2491000	2493000	sideways. If you want to stand
2493000	2495000	it up sideways, um, you know
2495000	2497000	assuming that it still would work
2497000	2499000	that way, um, I'm
2499000	2501000	sure that there would be a third party solution to
2501000	2503000	like, brace that thing up so that it
2503000	2505000	doesn't fall over. But, I mean, come
2505000	2507000	on. It's just, they just don't want you to
2507000	2509000	knock it off your shelf. Remember
2509000	2511000	cats are evil. They will knock that shit over.
2511000	2513000	Especially if you're not- No, they'll throw up on your rug.
2513000	2515000	Well, both. They will do both.
2515000	2517000	They will knock it over, then they'll throw up on it and on
2517000	2519000	your rug. Well, another interesting
2519000	2521000	quote from Mr. Pinello, uh, quote,
2521000	2523000	we found, interestingly enough, that 80%
2523000	2525000	of people, believe it or not, have their
2525000	2527000	Xbox 360 horizontally.
2527000	2529000	I will have you know that I'm not part of
2529000	2531000	the 80%. I have vertical
2531000	2533000	all the way. Unless it's near my cat, in which
2533000	2535000	case it's horizontal.
2535000	2537000	I have my 360 horizontal.
2537000	2539000	Most of my consoles go horizontal.
2539000	2541000	The only one that didn't was the Wii.
2541000	2543000	And that's because I sort of got
2543000	2545000	the perception that that was designed to go vertical.
2545000	2547000	But Wii U doesn't go vertical, if I
2547000	2549000	remember right. Right? It's like rounded
2549000	2551000	on the edges. You can't stand that thing.
2551000	2553000	Yes you can. Well,
2553000	2555000	with putty. You really shouldn't stand
2555000	2557000	it up. You can make a stand.
2557000	2559000	Alright, now you're making a good challenge.
2559000	2561000	Well, I'm sure it's like they're saying here
2561000	2563000	about the Xbox One. Do it at your own
2563000	2565000	risk. Throw your
2565000	2567000	Wii U down a flight of stairs and set it on
2567000	2569000	fire for all we care. You know what, mine's actually
2569000	2571000	horizontal.
2571000	2573000	Just because of how our- you've seen the shelves in
2573000	2575000	my house. That's how they're- and then the
2575000	2577000	cat sits on it.
2577000	2579000	Alright.
2579000	2581000	Ziba in chat says
2581000	2583000	mine is vertical too, so
2583000	2585000	let's see. Tigerclaw says
2585000	2587000	I remember when the PlayStation 1 had
2587000	2589000	trouble reading discs and the only fix
2589000	2591000	putting it upside down.
2591000	2593000	That's right, I remember that too. Oh yes. And then
2593000	2595000	no, no, no, no. There was the other fix.
2595000	2597000	Sideways. Mhm. When you
2597000	2599000	did have to hold that thing
2599000	2601000	vertically.
2601000	2603000	I remember people would use
2603000	2605000	paper clips or something to hold the
2605000	2607000	door open, basically.
2607000	2609000	That was for the swap trick. Oh, my bad.
2609000	2611000	Yeah. Back
2611000	2613000	in the day. Spring.
2613000	2615000	Spring.
2615000	2617000	Oh, no, no, no. We did it old school.
2617000	2619000	We had the paperclip. We figured
2619000	2621000	out the right way to bend the paperclip so that
2621000	2623000	we could just go fump. I remember when you
2623000	2625000	got me that little cartridge that plugged into
2625000	2627000	the back of the PlayStation 1. Yes, we ordered like, what, 50 of them?
2627000	2629000	Not 50, but we ordered a bunch of them.
2629000	2631000	Those things were awesome, and I never had
2631000	2633000	a problem playing import games after that. Yeah.
2633000	2635000	Those things were awesome. Anyhow, moving on.
2635000	2637000	Oh, yeah. It's my turn, isn't it?
2637000	2639000	Mhm. You know what? Put down the
2639000	2641000	Animal Crossing and get to the story. I'm busy
2641000	2643000	chatting with people. You're busy trying to
2643000	2645000	navigate the new iOS 7 over there, I see.
2645000	2647000	God, actually, yeah.
2647000	2649000	So, um,
2649000	2651000	this is slightly old news. It came out
2651000	2653000	toward the beginning of the week, but
2653000	2655000	Blizzard is going to be closing down
2655000	2657000	Diablo 3's Auction House, and that's going to
2657000	2659000	happen on March 18th next year.
2659000	2661000	Um, their
2661000	2663000	actual statement saying
2663000	2665000	that, and I'm quoting, it became increasingly
2665000	2667000	clear that despite the benefits of the
2667000	2669000	Auction House system, and the fact that
2669000	2671000	many players around the world use it, it
2671000	2673000	ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay
2673000	2675000	kill monsters and get cool loot.
2675000	2677000	With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've
2677000	2679000	decided to remove the gold and real money
2679000	2681000	Auction House system from Diablo 3.
2681000	2683000	Bravo.
2683000	2685000	So that means
2685000	2687000	it's, does that still need to be connected
2687000	2689000	online? Because, you know, people are
2689000	2691000	jumping to that conclusion that that
2691000	2693000	will be the next thing that happens, but we
2693000	2695000	don't know for sure, but that was the
2695000	2697000	crutch that they were, that was
2697000	2699000	why it had to be online, was to preserve
2699000	2701000	the integrity of the Auction House. So
2701000	2703000	now we just don't know.
2703000	2705000	But it would be logical
2705000	2707000	that in a later patch, they're going
2707000	2709000	to say, you know, we're going to patch
2709000	2711000	out the always online requirement.
2711000	2713000	That would be great. Then I'd play it again.
2713000	2715000	I wonder if that wouldn't be a quiet thing, or maybe
2715000	2717000	they'll do it under LAN play. I think
2717000	2719000	that would be huge if they were to do a patch
2719000	2721000	that not only removes the Auction House, but
2721000	2723000	then does LAN play without battle net.
2723000	2725000	I mean, that would be huge. But,
2725000	2727000	I don't know. Could they, like, add
2727000	2729000	because remember, you know, before, like, with
2729000	2731000	Starcraft 2 and stuff, well, Starcraft
2731000	2733000	2 I don't think had LAN play anyways, but
2733000	2735000	couldn't they do, like, some sort of
2735000	2737000	competitive thing then with
2737000	2739000	Diablo 3? Well, they were talking
2739000	2741000	about doing PvP, and there technically
2741000	2743000	is, like, an arena, but it's really
2743000	2745000	bare bones. It's not a
2745000	2747000	fancy PvP system like what you'd see in Warcraft
2747000	2749000	or anything. Well, they're also saying something
2749000	2751000	else, too. I'm going to read this quote.
2751000	2753000	We feel that this move, along with the Loot 2.0
2753000	2755000	system being developed concurrently with
2755000	2757000	Reaper of Souls, will result
2757000	2759000	in much more rewarding game experience
2759000	2761000	for our players. So,
2761000	2763000	I think that
2763000	2765000	they're looking to change quite a few things
2765000	2767000	about the way it plays. There's definitely kind of
2767000	2769000	a soft reboot of the game happening here.
2769000	2771000	It might be enough to make me play it again.
2771000	2773000	Well, a lot of folks were really
2773000	2775000	excited about the console versions because
2775000	2777000	well, in fact, some of the reviews of the
2777000	2779000	console versions, the PS3 and 360, say
2779000	2781000	it is the definitive version of Diablo 3.
2781000	2783000	Weren't you saying you wanted to get it? Well, yeah.
2783000	2785000	I didn't talk about it during my gaming week because
2785000	2787000	it was only a demo, but I did play the Diablo 3
2787000	2789000	demo on PlayStation, which is out there
2789000	2791000	you can download. It's
2791000	2793000	weird for me because I
2793000	2795000	did play Diablo 3 the whole way
2795000	2797000	through. I beat it. I played enough of it.
2797000	2799000	It's really weird to go from
2799000	2801000	Clicky Fest to
2801000	2803000	aiming because you don't
2803000	2805000	have a mouse. So, you aim
2805000	2807000	and it locks on to monsters.
2807000	2809000	It's just a different way of playing the
2809000	2811000	same game. It's really weird.
2811000	2813000	But I liked it, but it is just really
2813000	2815000	different. And the inventory system is completely different
2815000	2817000	too. I mean, they really had to change
2817000	2819000	everything to support the controller. Now,
2819000	2821000	what if they had a controller
2821000	2823000	version for the PC?
2823000	2825000	Like, would
2825000	2827000	you still keep playing on PC if you could
2827000	2829000	do it with a controller?
2829000	2831000	No, at this point I prefer
2831000	2833000	the mouse because that's just the way I played
2833000	2835000	the game and I think it is a different balance
2835000	2837000	between controller and mouse. I don't
2837000	2839000	see them mixing those. I don't think
2839000	2841000	they're going to mix the console version
2841000	2843000	with the PC version. But
2843000	2845000	I am interested enough in the console
2845000	2847000	version. My problem is that $60 price
2847000	2849000	tag when I already have the game
2849000	2851000	on PC no matter if I got it for
2851000	2853000	free or what have you.
2853000	2855000	You're not quite the target
2855000	2857000	audience.
2857000	2859000	Audience. I'm not. Since you already
2859000	2861000	own the PC version. You're right. I'm not the target
2861000	2863000	audience. But I will say this. I'm
2863000	2865000	very interested in PlayStation 4
2865000	2867000	version. Hopefully the
2867000	2869000	inevitable price cut
2869000	2871000	three months after it's out version. So, how does it look
2871000	2873000	visually compared to the PC version considering
2873000	2875000	that they're going to have a PlayStation 4 version? I
2875000	2877000	can't imagine that you'd be able to improve
2877000	2879000	The resolution is not quite as
2879000	2881000	crisp to me as it is on
2881000	2883000	PC. I even see that
2883000	2885000	in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit.
2885000	2887000	And I think a lot of that just depends on what video
2887000	2889000	card you're packing. I saw it a lot in Final Fantasy
2889000	2891000	14 looking at the videos.
2891000	2893000	Because I found
2893000	2895000	some high res play through
2895000	2897000	videos from the PS3.
2897000	2899000	And compared with my
2899000	2901000	but I have my maxed all the way.
2901000	2903000	And it looks amazing.
2903000	2905000	So, I mean it doesn't look bad by any means.
2905000	2907000	You have to get really nitpicky. But I would
2907000	2909000	see where they could probably make some graphical
2909000	2911000	improvements on PlayStation 4.
2911000	2913000	So.
2913000	2915000	So I'll be checking that out
2915000	2917000	later. But I'm happy to hear about the removal
2917000	2919000	of the auction house. Just that you know I don't
2919000	2921000	I don't think that many people were using it
2921000	2923000	to be honest. No. I'm totally
2923000	2925000	with that. Yeah.
2925000	2927000	Alright. Let's move on. Loki.
2927000	2929000	Alright. So let's talk
2929000	2931000	a little bit about
2931000	2933000	Blizzard again. And this
2933000	2935000	kind of ties in with
2935000	2937000	I think we were talking about it a few weeks ago.
2937000	2939000	Where they were
2939000	2941000	Vampity was trying to kind of
2941000	2943000	separate themselves from
2943000	2945000	Activision Blizzard and kind of
2945000	2947000	drum up some money I guess
2947000	2949000	by selling their shares and that kind of stuff.
2949000	2951000	However
2951000	2953000	that's been kind of halted because
2953000	2955000	there's a lawsuit
2955000	2957000	taking place in Delaware.
2957000	2959000	Apparently I guess
2959000	2961000	one of the
2961000	2963000	some of the shareholders didn't like the idea.
2963000	2965000	I think they said basically the shareholder
2965000	2967000	has sued the company to prevent
2967000	2969000	this from happening claiming that
2969000	2971000	it's a huge waste and meant to
2971000	2973000	cover a power grab.
2973000	2975000	And so because of that
2975000	2977000	the court actually
2977000	2979000	halted it right now and
2979000	2981000	basically in order for it to continue they have to
2981000	2983000	appeal and get a majority
2983000	2985000	vote from the non-Vivendi
2985000	2987000	stockholders.
2987000	2989000	So
2989000	2991000	interesting that that kind of happened.
2991000	2993000	Now I'm not really sure as far as
2993000	2995000	like a power
2995000	2997000	power grab
2997000	2999000	thing is supposed to be. I don't understand their
2999000	3001000	angle there with that.
3001000	3003000	I'm not sure I see it either and I kind of don't think this is going to go much
3003000	3005000	of anywhere.
3005000	3007000	It is interesting to bring this up immediately
3007000	3009000	after that previous story because some are
3009000	3011000	speculating tinfoil hat
3011000	3013000	that the removal of the
3013000	3015000	Diablo 3 auction house is directly tied to the fact
3015000	3017000	they're not with Vivendi anymore.
3017000	3019000	That now that they're a little more
3019000	3021000	independent per se that they dropped
3021000	3023000	it even though they are still part of Activision
3023000	3025000	but maybe Vivendi was the real
3025000	3027000	problem. Yeah see that's what
3027000	3029000	I thought with like the kind of go
3029000	3031000	completely different game different company
3031000	3033000	with Deep Silver
3033000	3035000	or I should say THQ and Saints Row
3035000	3037000	that's why I thought with all the DLC
3037000	3039000	hoaring that oh it was THQ making
3039000	3041000	the Volition do that kind of shit.
3041000	3043000	And then Saints Row 4 came
3043000	3045000	out and they hoard the DLC just as much
3045000	3047000	so I
3047000	3049000	was proven wrong there so who knows.
3049000	3051000	Although you have to admit
3051000	3053000	that free
3053000	3055000	GAT 5 DLC
3055000	3057000	on Tuesday was brilliant.
3057000	3059000	It's not brilliant. It seriously
3059000	3061000	is not. No
3061000	3063000	I understand the joke. I understand the joke.
3063000	3065000	Yeah haha it's funny you know
3065000	3067000	Gap 5
3067000	3069000	and we're going to confuse people with the hashtag
3069000	3071000	and oh it's going to be hilarious and stuff
3071000	3073000	and then the game sells 800 million
3073000	3075000	dollars worth and then they
3075000	3077000	kind of quiet and go into a corner
3077000	3079000	because you know
3079000	3081000	it's just
3081000	3083000	cool. Yeah it's
3083000	3085000	fun to poke fun at Grand Theft Auto
3085000	3087000	because your game
3087000	3089000	started off as kind of a clone of it and
3091000	3093000	the problem is
3093000	3095000	they have these little DLC packs and yeah I
3095000	3097000	understand it's free for a day and I did download it because
3097000	3099000	it's free. I'm not going to pass up some of them for free.
3099000	3101000	It's just
3101000	3103000	$2.99 here
3103000	3105000	$2.99 there $2.99 there for all
3105000	3107000	stuff that's already in the game
3107000	3109000	and just being unlocked.
3109000	3111000	Come on I mean and
3111000	3113000	I'm really waiting to see what the first DLC pack
3113000	3115000	was because if it's anything as far as
3115000	3117000	like sparse in content
3117000	3119000	like it was with the third
3119000	3121000	I'm just I may be done with the series
3121000	3123000	just because I don't like that
3123000	3125000	kind of practice where it's just
3125000	3127000	we're just not we're going to totally
3127000	3129000	just drop the ball and not give a shit and
3129000	3131000	push stuff out really fast and try to make a quick buck
3131000	3133000	because it shows.
3133000	3135000	Alright well
3135000	3137000	moving on let's go to another story
3137000	3139000	you know Grand Theft Auto 5
3139000	3141000	and Saints Row 4 will not be
3141000	3143000	on this console but maybe later we'll
3143000	3145000	see and the PlayStation 4
3145000	3147000	of course is out in a couple weeks
3147000	3149000	and some live streamers you know
3149000	3151000	the people that do Twitch TV as we've
3151000	3153000	all done in the past and what have you
3153000	3155000	were a little bit
3155000	3157000	concerned that the PlayStation 4
3157000	3159000	may not really allow you to live
3159000	3161000	stream the way you want to
3161000	3163000	now I'm not talking about the built in
3163000	3165000	live streaming but remember we heard that
3165000	3167000	prior that some
3167000	3169000	companies may actually be able to
3169000	3171000	not have you live stream certain parts
3171000	3173000	of the game or whatever we don't know
3173000	3175000	how that functionality is going to be limited
3175000	3177000	so some people want to handle it their way
3177000	3179000	and actually have the PlayStation
3179000	3181000	4 through HDMI their capture box
3181000	3183000	but there was a concern that would not
3183000	3185000	work because on the PlayStation
3185000	3187000	3 you can't do that right
3187000	3189000	now you can't capture through HDMI
3189000	3191000	unless you you know do some nefarious
3191000	3193000	you know it's component
3193000	3195000	to HDMI yeah a lot of folks do
3195000	3197000	component cables instead and capture that way
3197000	3199000	and stream that way yeah because that's what I have
3199000	3201000	to do with my Elgato you have to
3201000	3203000	they have a special adapter
3203000	3205000	that you plug in well live streamers
3205000	3207000	around the world I'm sure happy to hear this week
3207000	3209000	Brad Douglas who's the head of third party
3209000	3211000	relations at Sony said
3211000	3213000	the PlayStation 4 will support
3213000	3215000	video capture via HDMI
3215000	3217000	now my
3217000	3219000	question is I
3219000	3221000	always thought it was the Blu-rays
3221000	3223000	fault that a lot of this was blocked
3223000	3225000	on the PlayStation 3 so
3225000	3227000	have they figured out a way on the PlayStation 4
3227000	3229000	to enable the encoding when
3229000	3231000	it's in Blu-ray mode because I would think
3231000	3233000	that's a given I would think that even though this news
3233000	3235000	is out there they've got to
3235000	3237000	not allow you to put the Blu-rays up it's too easy
3237000	3239000	they probably found a way to
3239000	3241000	turn on and off the HD
3241000	3243000	encryption thing
3243000	3245000	so my real question building on that
3245000	3247000	and yes I'm being tinfoil hat again
3247000	3249000	but if they can turn it on and off
3249000	3251000	it will what's to say this is going to be
3251000	3253000	any different from the built in twitch streaming
3253000	3255000	at the end of the day
3255000	3257000	what do you mean
3257000	3259000	that
3259000	3261000	you know if they can turn it off and on won't they
3261000	3263000	be able to turn it off you know when they
3263000	3265000	want like let's say a developer doesn't want the ending of
3265000	3267000	the game broadcast can't they shut it off
3267000	3269000	maybe
3269000	3271000	I guess it's possible
3271000	3273000	so also important
3273000	3275000	to put out there one of the big reasons why
3275000	3277000	people want to do their own HDMI grabs
3277000	3279000	it's for I guess I shouldn't really say
3279000	3281000	it's more the twitch TV people but a lot
3281000	3283000	of the YouTube people who want to record
3283000	3285000	a gigantic amount of footage
3285000	3287000	and then edit through it later on
3287000	3289000	that's the real asset
3289000	3291000	there to being able to do the HDMI
3291000	3293000	just to be clear it's both
3293000	3295000	a win for live streamers and
3295000	3297000	live to tape
3297000	3299000	streamers
3299000	3301000	did you see the stupid announcement
3301000	3303000	that they did earlier this week it was
3303000	3305000	about like
3305000	3307000	yeah you'll be able to hook up your PlayStation 4
3307000	3309000	to your Xbox One's
3309000	3311000	HDMI in I'm like dude you can hook anything
3311000	3313000	up to it cause it has HDMI in
3313000	3315000	if it has HDMI out you're gonna hook it up
3315000	3317000	it's not gonna go oh no no no
3317000	3319000	sorry that's a PlayStation 4 we gonna play nice
3319000	3321000	with them I mean they're not gonna
3321000	3323000	do that it's a fucking HDMI in
3323000	3325000	that's like saying hey I just learned that
3325000	3327000	I can plug my PlayStation 4 into the wall
3327000	3329000	yes actually if you
3329000	3331000	put a PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One
3331000	3333000	Nedry will come up on the screen and go
3333000	3335000	ah ah ah you didn't say
3335000	3337000	the magic word ah ah ah
3337000	3339000	that reference straight out
3339000	3341000	of 1994 y'all look it
3341000	3343000	up hey to be fair they did a
3343000	3345000	3D re-release not too long ago so
3345000	3347000	it is somewhat rare okay okay fair
3347000	3349000	enough and there's gonna be a fourth movie
3349000	3351000	as long as we don't have any fucking
3351000	3353000	gymnastic people in that I mean
3353000	3355000	it's gonna be all good
3357000	3359000	I wanna see them go a little ridiculous with that
3359000	3361000	I want like you know raptors in trench coats
3361000	3363000	and stuff and they're like oh clever girl
3363000	3365000	obviously we're talking about Jurassic Park
3365000	3367000	so obviously we blew the cover on that I gotta say
3367000	3369000	though Jurassic Park 4
3369000	3371000	I wanted to either be like really good like the first
3371000	3373000	one was which is I enjoyed the first movie say what
3373000	3375000	you will but at the time you know when I was in high
3375000	3377000	school and that came out that movie was awesome right
3377000	3379000	or I wanted to be like over the top
3379000	3381000	show girls bad
3381000	3383000	but you know what
3383000	3385000	3 was pretty bad you know what though
3385000	3387000	I'm thinking with the technology today
3387000	3389000	we can have it both and you know why
3389000	3391000	that's because you have Jurassic Park 4
3391000	3393000	and say that'll be a great movie or something
3393000	3395000	let's just hope that is a great movie and then you have
3395000	3397000	Asylum putting out like
3397000	3399000	Cretaceous
3399000	3401000	Part 5 or something like that

3405000	3407000	or the sci-fi movie you know
3407000	3409000	Dinosaur Hurricane you know
3409000	3411000	I don't know
3411000	3413000	actdeft in chat piggybacking on this
3413000	3415000	whole not the Jurassic Park part but the whole like
3415000	3417000	Sony Playstation 4 on an Xbox
3417000	3419000	one actdeft in chat says what's
3419000	3421000	next Sony making computers with
3421000	3423000	Windows in them oh my
3423000	3425000	gosh oh my
3425000	3427000	gosh or Sony developing
3427000	3429000	apps for Microsoft Windows
3429000	3431000	no shame
3433000	3435000	alright let's move
3435000	3437000	on Dark Soccer you got a story and then release
3437000	3439000	states I might
3439000	3441000	so um
3441000	3443000	I hate mobile sites so much
3443000	3445000	I'm telling you Chrome
3445000	3447000	you can do the desktop sites on Chrome
3447000	3449000	yeah but I'm opening the links out of email
3449000	3451000	well
3451000	3453000	that's your problem
3453000	3455000	well it's going to be everyone's problem because the stupid thing doesn't want to load
3455000	3457000	can't you change your default browser
3457000	3459000	oh wait I'm sorry it's iOS
3459000	3461000	actually I think
3461000	3463000	you can in the new one can't you
3463000	3465000	I could be wrong I don't know
3465000	3467000	there we go
3467000	3469000	have you played with iOS 7 Loki?
3469000	3471000	fuck no I haven't updated my
3471000	3473000	iPod is seriously like I don't even
3473000	3475000	know if iOS 7 supports my iPod
3475000	3477000	I have an iPod touch 4 and I think
3477000	3479000	they said ah fuck you
3479000	3481000	ah fuck you
3481000	3483000	sorry Jimmy I was trying to buy you time
3483000	3485000	thank you well we did tease
3485000	3487000	this at the start of the show
3487000	3489000	and um we've talked about
3489000	3491000	before about the state of Atlas that they
3491000	3493000	filed for bankruptcy
3493000	3495000	their debt was
3495000	3497000	2.45 billion yen
3497000	3499000	which is quite a bit of money
3499000	3501000	and so um
3501000	3503000	the company that's come out
3503000	3505000	on top for the purchase
3505000	3507000	is Sega Sammy
3507000	3509000	or I just like to say
3509000	3511000	Sega because we all know who's
3511000	3513000	wearing the pants in that relationship
3513000	3515000	or as we all like to say growing up Sega
3515000	3517000	Sega pretty good
3517000	3519000	that they bought somebody because they don't have
3519000	3521000	anything fucking coming out
3521000	3523000	nothing Sega needs to buy their building
3523000	3525000	back in San Francisco like
3525000	3527000	they're the one company that sends me updates
3527000	3529000	to their release calendar like
3529000	3531000	every week on the ball you know
3531000	3533000	on Friday every week
3533000	3535000	and there's always no changes have
3535000	3537000	been made no changes have been made
3537000	3539000	nothing is coming out
3539000	3541000	well at any rate it came
3541000	3543000	out on Nikkei that
3543000	3545000	they are going to be acquiring
3545000	3547000	the whole thing for a 14
3547000	3549000	for 14 billion
3549000	3551000	yen which is
3551000	3553000	roughly 141 million dollars
3553000	3555000	to purchase the
3555000	3557000	company
3557000	3559000	so this
3559000	3561000	probably means that
3561000	3563000	we might see
3563000	3565000	them continuing with the
3565000	3567000	Shin Megami Tensei games
3567000	3569000	that's a given
3569000	3571000	but I can't wait for the crossovers
3571000	3573000	with other Sega games
3573000	3575000	you know when there's the inevitable Sega
3575000	3577000	racing
3577000	3579000	with Danica Patrick and the cast of Persona 5
3579000	3581000	that would be so weird
3581000	3583000	so
3585000	3587000	Technus in chat says
3587000	3589000	Sega Atlas
3589000	3591000	and 5th Dream says Atlas Sega
3591000	3593000	but anyway the company itself hasn't made
3593000	3595000	the announcement on it yet
3595000	3597000	but it is public on Nikkei
3597000	3599000	so take it for what you will
3599000	3601000	some folks
3601000	3603000	disappointed
3603000	3605000	I don't know how to really use that word
3605000	3607000	in this context but some folks
3607000	3609000	were disappointed slash surprised
3609000	3611000	slash I don't know that it wasn't Nintendo
3611000	3613000	who bought Atlas
3613000	3615000	thinking that Nintendo might want to grab
3615000	3617000	Persona as an exclusive for the Wii U
3617000	3619000	and DS and so forth
3619000	3621000	would have been a pretty big
3621000	3623000	thing so any thoughts on
3623000	3625000	that why maybe Nintendo didn't decide
3625000	3627000	to do it? I think Nintendo's got
3627000	3629000	their own thing going on
3629000	3631000	you know I think they're looking
3631000	3633000	if they're going to purchase a company
3633000	3635000	my thought is that they would purchase one that has
3635000	3637000	a little bit more that would
3637000	3639000	work with them and given
3639000	3641000	that Nintendo's already been working with Sega
3641000	3643000	it doesn't
3643000	3645000	mean that we're going to see any fewer
3645000	3647000	Atlas games come out on
3649000	3651000	on
3651000	3653000	Brain Fart
3653000	3655000	on Nintendo systems
3655000	3657000	I think also it's just that they don't
3657000	3659000	sell a lot of copies
3659000	3661000	people recognize it and
3661000	3663000	it's definitely a series that a lot of
3663000	3665000	hardcore gamers are into and I
3665000	3667000	mean they have a lot of series that hardcore gamers
3667000	3669000	are into but their best selling game
3669000	3671000	is just kind of moderate selling
3671000	3673000	for any other company that's the thing
3673000	3675000	and I think to
3675000	3677000	buy the company for a lot
3677000	3679000	of money doesn't make any sense because you're
3679000	3681000	not going to make your money back very fast
3681000	3683000	so that's probably
3683000	3685000	why and I mean if you think
3685000	3687000	about it it's not going to make anything
3687000	3689000	really exclusive because
3689000	3691000	most of the games come out in 3DS and stuff
3691000	3693000	anyways PlayStation 3
3693000	3695000	occasionally but I don't think
3695000	3697000	I don't know maybe it would
3697000	3699000	you know
3699000	3701000	coax them into making more
3701000	3703000	games for the Wii U or a game
3703000	3705000	for the Wii U because they don't have any
3705000	3707000	so I don't know
3707000	3709000	Alright well let's travel around the world and check out some
3709000	3711000	release dates
3711000	3713000	Okay so in the
3713000	3715000	US there's a few games coming out
3715000	3717000	they have this Batman Arkham
3717000	3719000	bundle which is you know the last two Batman
3719000	3721000	Arkham games, Arkham City and
3721000	3723000	Arkham Asylum
3723000	3725000	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 on
3725000	3727000	DS and 3DS
3727000	3729000	Did that movie necessitate a sequel?
3729000	3731000	Apparently from a small company
3731000	3733000	called Game Mill, yes it did
3733000	3735000	so you know movie tying games
3735000	3737000	do well in 3DS
3737000	3739000	Provolution Soccer 2014
3739000	3741000	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
3741000	3743000	and of course not to be left out
3743000	3745000	FIFA 14 on PlayStation 3
3745000	3747000	and Xbox 360 and Vita
3747000	3749000	well technically it's FIFA 12
3749000	3751000	but you know they've reskinned it
3751000	3753000	a few times so FIFA 14
3753000	3755000	totally brand new addition
3755000	3757000	Armored Core Verdict
3757000	3759000	Day on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
3759000	3761000	Scribblenauts Unmasked

3769000	3771000	to pick up a 3DS

3781000	3783000	those are coming out on the
3783000	3785000	27th which is Friday
3785000	3787000	Alright

3789000	3791000	together and look at some release dates there?

3797000	3799000	September 26th so here we go on the

3825000	3827000	that was a funny anime
3827000	3829000	so that well if you want
3829000	3831000	there's the HD complete box version of that
3831000	3833000	which I imagine the anime included
3833000	3835000	The anime is basically this guy
3835000	3837000	who's little sister likes to play dating sims
3837000	3839000	but the ones in particular that she likes
3839000	3841000	are big brother little sister dating sims
3843000	3845000	That sounds awkward
3845000	3847000	It is but it is hilarious
3847000	3849000	I'm also quite like I'm just blown away
3849000	3851000	for a minute by the fact that you understood me
3851000	3853000	speaking Japanese
3853000	3855000	I'm getting a little like wow
3855000	3857000	I always thought it was the big joke that I can't
3857000	3859000	pronounce any of these names but
3859000	3861000	Well it was certain things
3861000	3863000	certain parts of the
3863000	3865000	Well the moment you said Ore no Imouto
3865000	3867000	I was like oh god is he gonna say
3867000	3869000	and then the moment you said Kawaii
3869000	3871000	I was like oh yeah that's it
3871000	3873000	Fair enough
3873000	3875000	Painkiller Hell and Damnation
3875000	3877000	That sounds like a Loki kind of game there

3914000	3916000	It's a game that came out a while ago on PC

4049000	4051000	on the 27th Armored Core Verdict
4051000	4053000	today
4053000	4055000	FIFA 14
4055000	4057000	Inazuma 11-3 Lightning Bolt
4057000	4059000	slash Bomb Blast
4059000	4061000	that's it
4061000	4063000	alright just a couple more stories for you guys
4063000	4065000	and then the classic game of the week
4065000	4067000	Loki? alright so let's
4067000	4069000	talk about some Nintendo announcements
4069000	4071000	here they're bringing
4071000	4073000	Wii Sports back
4073000	4075000	as part of Wii Sports Club
4075000	4077000	it's Wii Sports
4077000	4079000	in HD
4079000	4081000	let me pause
4081000	4083000	for a second and let that sink
4083000	4085000	in because I don't really see how HD's
4085000	4087000	going to improve this but sure why not
4089000	4091000	anyways so they're going to have Wii Sports
4091000	4093000	which is not a bad thing because people play
4093000	4095000	Nintendo for Wii Sports nowadays
4095000	4097000	and it's coming to the
4097000	4099000	eShop on November 7th
4099000	4101000	and they're going to start
4101000	4103000	with a few games so they're
4103000	4105000	going to start with boxing
4105000	4107000	was it actually I'm sorry
4107000	4109000	bowling, tennis, and baseball and boxing
4109000	4111000	golf starting off with tennis and bowling
4111000	4113000	and then boxing
4113000	4115000	baseball and golf are going to be coming later on
4115000	4117000	they're going to feature enhanced controls
4117000	4119000	with Wii Motion Plus
4119000	4121000	so probably just the versions that are from Wii
4121000	4123000	Sports Resort and
4123000	4125000	online multiplayer
4125000	4127000	versus mode
4127000	4129000	that's pretty cool
4129000	4131000	Nintendo's going online
4131000	4133000	with something that's always exciting because it never
4133000	4135000	fucking happens
4135000	4137000	it says it'll allow players to register and create
4137000	4139000	state or regional clubs
4139000	4141000	so people will be able to play casually
4141000	4143000	against members of
4143000	4145000	their own club or take on rival clubs
4145000	4147000	and then Wii Sports
4147000	4149000	Club I guess they have
4149000	4151000	this weird thing that you can do as well
4151000	4153000	if you don't want to buy the games outright
4153000	4155000	they can 24 hour period
4155000	4157000	to try the games
4157000	4159000	that are available after the trial
4159000	4161000	there's a day pass available for
4161000	4163000	$1.99 or permanent purchase
4163000	4165000	for $10
4165000	4167000	per individual sport
4167000	4169000	it's a little high
4169000	4171000	if you ask me
4171000	4173000	it's what, five games?
4173000	4175000	yeah I mean when you consider that no one plays
4175000	4177000	baseball and no one really plays
4177000	4179000	well but I kind of like that
4179000	4181000	that let's be real I only want
4181000	4183000	the tennis and the bowling as I'm sure a lot
4183000	4185000	there's a few people who want the others but I only want the
4185000	4187000	tennis and the bowling and those are the ones I want to
4187000	4189000	play online so that's kind of nice that I
4189000	4191000	can only buy those
4191000	4193000	and it's really
4193000	4195000	fascinating to me that they are
4195000	4197000	basically opening up the idea of
4197000	4199000	you know people
4199000	4201000	only really play these games when other people
4201000	4203000	are over and they're having a party
4203000	4205000	so they're basically building in a rental system
4205000	4207000	on demand where it's like
4207000	4209000	you can rent the game for $2 for a day
4209000	4211000	and instant Wii tennis party
4211000	4213000	it's
4213000	4215000	interesting Nintendo is clearly
4215000	4217000	testing something here
4217000	4219000	they're testing a lot of things
4219000	4221000	testing people's patience
4221000	4223000	here's something else they're testing
4223000	4225000	so Wii Fit U is going to be available
4225000	4227000	November 1st as a download
4227000	4229000	and then later
4229000	4231000	on December 13th they'll be coming out
4231000	4233000	as like a bundle and so
4233000	4235000	November 1st
4235000	4237000	you will have one month to demo
4237000	4239000	the game and
4239000	4241000	that's if you have a Wii Balance board
4241000	4243000	and then if you decide and you
4243000	4245000	like the game then you need to
4245000	4247000	purchase a fit meter which is their
4247000	4249000	little pedometer thing that's going to tie into it
4249000	4251000	and then I guess
4251000	4253000	the fit meter is priced at $20
4253000	4255000	and that's also coming out on November 1st
4255000	4257000	and then once you
4257000	4259000	have that if you want to buy
4259000	4261000	the package that's going to be coming
4261000	4263000	I guess December 13th
4263000	4265000	and then the full game download is coming
4265000	4267000	February 1st
4267000	4269000	it's a little different I guess
4269000	4271000	so how's your Wii Fit
4271000	4273000	Wii Fit board holding up?
4273000	4275000	my Wii Fit Balance board right now true story
4275000	4277000	is propping up
4277000	4279000	the television you see over there
4279000	4281000	because you'll notice it has to be propped up a bit
4281000	4283000	to get over the sound board and we didn't have
4283000	4285000	anything that was just the right height except the
4285000	4287000	Wii Balance board mine was
4287000	4289000	under my TV like just under
4289000	4291000	I just have it stashed away down there and I put
4291000	4293000	it away I don't even know what again now I need
4293000	4295000	to see if the damn thing still works because I
4295000	4297000	have to admit I'm curious about Wii U
4297000	4299000	Plus or Wii U Fit Plus
4299000	4301000	whatever the fuck it's called
4301000	4303000	that game the fitness game
4303000	4305000	you want the thing I want the
4305000	4307000	hot new thingy that everybody's got
4307000	4309000	well and and it's it's
4309000	4311000	kind of fascinating to me that it's like alright
4311000	4313000	so here's the deal yo
4313000	4315000	if you had Wii Fit before
4315000	4317000	you get it on this day and it's like
4317000	4319000	free for a month but then if you want to keep it
4319000	4321000	you gotta buy this thing but if you don't have any
4321000	4323000	of it we'll have it all out on this day
4323000	4325000	and then you can download it on this like I'm like
4325000	4327000	I'm like
4327000	4329000	I've gone cross eyed from how
4329000	4331000	they're trying to get return customers well
4331000	4333000	yeah and I don't like I'm not saying it's necessarily
4333000	4335000	a bad idea but it's the whole
4335000	4337000	thing is just very like it's not what
4337000	4339000	I expect out of Nintendo
4339000	4341000	at all I guess that's
4341000	4343000	a good thing though because if you think about it
4343000	4345000	that means if I was a supporter of Wii Fit
4345000	4347000	I can get this upgrade
4347000	4349000	for 20 bucks and let's be real
4349000	4351000	it's probably not gonna be
4351000	4353000	much different than the Wii versions
4353000	4355000	it will be an upgrade that incorporates
4355000	4357000	the pedometer or what have you so
4357000	4359000	it's kinda refreshing that
4359000	4361000	I can get that for 20 bucks
4361000	4363000	assuming my stinkin' balance board will
4363000	4365000	still work after having a TV sitting on it for
4365000	4367000	two years um
4367000	4369000	Didn't I try to borrow it once and it didn't work?
4369000	4371000	Hey here's a fantastic idea
4371000	4373000	I mean it's just so out there and crazy
4373000	4375000	why don't they fuckin' have it tie in with
4375000	4377000	the 3DS that has a goddamn pedometer built
4377000	4379000	into it oh but that would be too
4379000	4381000	fuckin' difficult for them now would it?
4381000	4383000	I would imagine what they're really
4383000	4385000	going after are those like the what are
4385000	4387000	they called the Fitbits? The things
4387000	4389000	that people can wear on their hands like the bracelets
4389000	4391000	that's what they're going after right? That makes me think of
4391000	4393000	what was the thing they used to have
4393000	4395000	the monitor
4395000	4397000	oh hell I don't remember the Genki monitor or something
4397000	4399000	yeah something like that Genki monitor
4399000	4401000	well then there was I don't know there was that
4401000	4403000	um ridiculous game on the
4403000	4405000	that was on the DS I think that everybody
4405000	4407000	walks or whatever that was that
4407000	4409000	you put the little thing in your pocket and it would just
4409000	4411000	that was on the Wii was that on the Wii?
4411000	4413000	yeah thanks Konami
4413000	4415000	no that was on the DS
4415000	4417000	no it was on the Wii
4417000	4419000	it was a part it was a music game
4419000	4421000	that was walking
4421000	4423000	no no we're thinking of two different games
4423000	4425000	I know what you're talking about but there was another
4425000	4427000	game that like it came with two
4427000	4429000	little pedometers and you plugged it into your
4429000	4431000	DS or something and it said you walked
4431000	4433000	500 steps today let's
4433000	4435000	upload it to the internet and see how far the world
4435000	4437000	has walked to the moon would you walk
4437000	4439000	500 miles? it was like a non-game game you know what that
4439000	4441000	makes me think of oh my god it makes me think
4441000	4443000	of Noby Noby Boy on my phone
4443000	4445000	kind of because like you have to make him
4445000	4447000	grow and then he has to reach girl
4447000	4449000	or it's how long it takes girl to reach earth
4449000	4451000	or some shit
4451000	4453000	Dark Tetsuya says walk it out
4453000	4455000	that was the one that was the Konami game I believe
4455000	4457000	and then
4457000	4459000	VX Chase and XV
4459000	4461000	says I want Pokemon Pikachu
4461000	4463000	pedometer integration
4463000	4465000	that was a thing too I forgot about that
4465000	4467000	one of the Pokemon games had that thing too
4467000	4469000	I miss my Pikachu
4469000	4471000	so
4471000	4473000	alright anyhow
4473000	4475000	let's talk about this as long as we're on Nintendo
4475000	4477000	because this news gets me very excited
4477000	4479000	I want this
4479000	4481000	version of the game to happen and it's Soul Calibur
4481000	4483000	2 HD on
4483000	4485000	the Wii U sit down
4485000	4487000	it's not confirmed yet but
4487000	4489000	what is being talked about is that
4489000	4491000	GamesRadar talked to Namco Bandai
4491000	4493000	at a pre-Tokyo game
4493000	4495000	show event I believe to see
4495000	4497000	if the development team would consider
4497000	4499000	bringing Soul Calibur 2 HD to
4499000	4501000	the Wii U because as you know right now
4501000	4503000	the game is only coming out on Xbox Live Arcade
4503000	4505000	and PlayStation Network but I think
4505000	4507000	many of us remember the GameCube
4507000	4509000	version as being the definitive version because it had
4509000	4511000	Link remember
4511000	4513000	so even though it's cool that you know
4513000	4515000	Spawn and Heihachi are going to be
4515000	4517000	in the other ones we want Link
4517000	4519000	and we want it on Nintendo so
4519000	4521000	GamesRadar was told that if the game
4521000	4523000	does well it's a possibility
4523000	4525000	they even encouraged
4525000	4527000	people to spam the producer's Twitter
4527000	4529000	if they're interested
4529000	4531000	it's not, it doesn't have anything
4531000	4533000	to do with the fucking popularity of the game
4533000	4535000	it has to fucking do with the fact that
4535000	4537000	no there's not a lot of
4537000	4539000	console sales and I'm betting that
4539000	4541000	Tekken or Tekken Tag
4541000	4543000	Tournament 2 probably fucking bombed
4543000	4545000	on the Wii U that's why
4545000	4547000	it's not coming to the goddamn Wii U
4547000	4549000	it's not because they just
4549000	4551000	yeah but if they're writing it for 360
4551000	4553000	I thought the Wii U was supposed to be built
4553000	4555000	so that it could like take 360
4555000	4557000	ports really easy I understand
4557000	4559000	it could take ports really easy but the thing is
4559000	4561000	why spend the money to port a game
4561000	4563000	if you're only going to make X amount of sales
4563000	4565000	it costs money to do a port regardless of how easy
4565000	4567000	it is it's still
4567000	4569000	and my thought is you're saying that it has
4569000	4571000	to sell well in order to do the port
4571000	4573000	and I'm like well I
4573000	4575000	I don't want to buy the game twice
4575000	4577000	so if I buy it on
4577000	4579000	PlayStation that's it I'm not going to buy it again
4579000	4581000	it's free to play no you're thinking of
4581000	4583000	a different Soul Calibur game Soul Calibur HD is not
4583000	4585000	you're thinking of the new, the one we talked about
4585000	4587000	last week I thought that was the free to play one
4587000	4589000	not Soul Calibur HD
4589000	4591000	Soul Calibur HD is
4591000	4593000	that was some new game in the series
4593000	4595000	it's on PlayStation 3 it's not
4595000	4597000	no you're mixing, you're crossing your Soul Calibur
4597000	4599000	wires you're forging a new
4599000	4601000	Destiny for the game I was thinking about
4601000	4603000	the Soul Calibur 2 HD
4603000	4605000	that was, that's one of
4605000	4607000	the three import GameCube games I have
4607000	4609000	was Soul Calibur
4609000	4611000	2 just so we could have Link
4611000	4613000	so we could have it early
4613000	4615000	SSJ100Matt says
4615000	4617000	ugh I hate it when they pull that shit
4617000	4619000	quote if it makes enough money, such a cock tease
4619000	4621000	do it or don't do it, stop stringing people
4621000	4623000	along, amen
4623000	4625000	just do it
4625000	4627000	talking about fitness
4627000	4629000	and all this stuff
4629000	4631000	it's just probably people asking them about it that's all
4631000	4633000	it's not that they came out and said we have an
4633000	4635000	idea for a game we're going to make
4635000	4637000	but only if it sells well
4637000	4639000	yeah only if it sells well so everybody go buy it
4639000	4641000	I mean they're not Konami or something
4641000	4643000	we have no intention of ever making it
4643000	4645000	unless you pre-order X amount of copies
4645000	4647000	ha ha ha
4647000	4651000	alright
4651000	4653000	that definitely does it for that story
4653000	4655000	let's go back to a time
4655000	4657000	when you know it was
4657000	4659000	a whole lot easier than this
4659000	4661000	and there was really
4661000	4663000	only two consoles
4663000	4665000	either you Ninten did
4665000	4667000	or you Sega didn't
4667000	4669000	it is the classic
4669000	4671000	game of the week Dark Soccer is going to take
4671000	4673000	a trip down memory lane and find a game that she
4673000	4675000	thinks hey, you should be playing this game
4675000	4677000	forget these HD
4677000	4679000	remasters and all this shit
4679000	4681000	go back and play a classic
4681000	4683000	in 4x3, love it
4683000	4685000	I also have an announcement after this too
4685000	4687000	about the segment
4687000	4689000	okay, hmm, nevermind
4689000	4691000	I would have told you ahead of time
4691000	4693000	I was like you're going to fucking surprise me with some shit here girl
4693000	4695000	alright here it is
4695000	4697000	the classic game of the week Dark Soccer
4697000	4699000	the game of the week is Mischief Makers
4699000	4701000	the game is known in Japan
4701000	4703000	Yuke Yuke Troublemakers
4703000	4705000	or as it's known on OLR, Dark Sakura
4705000	4707000	what?
4707000	4709000	Mischief Makers, get it?
4709000	4711000	okay
4711000	4713000	anyway, it is a game
4713000	4715000	developed by Treasure
4715000	4717000	and published by Amix
4717000	4719000	in Japan and published by Nintendo
4719000	4721000	in the US
4721000	4723000	it was on the Nintendo 64
4723000	4725000	it came out in 1997
4725000	4727000	as one of the first
4727000	4729000	Nintendo 64
4729000	4731000	and so your main character is the
4731000	4733000	ultra intergalactic side-bot
4733000	4735000	G-Marina Lightyears
4735000	4737000	or as she's also known, Marina
4737000	4739000	who is a robotic maid
4739000	4741000	so you go through the game
4741000	4743000	and it's
4743000	4745000	pretty average side-scrolling
4745000	4747000	thing except it's a treasure game
4747000	4749000	so you know weirdness is going to
4749000	4751000	ensue
4751000	4753000	so she can pick up her enemies, objects, weapons
4753000	4755000	and even some energy
4755000	4757000	or projectiles
4757000	4759000	and they can be thrown or shaken depending on whatever the object is
4759000	4761000	and crystals can come out
4761000	4763000	and whenever some
4763000	4765000	other objects are shaken
4765000	4767000	there may be another effect that happens
4767000	4769000	and then
4769000	4771000	you have another character named Teron
4771000	4773000	who's able to play in other levels
4773000	4775000	and has punches
4775000	4777000	and kicks and blocks
4777000	4779000	and he can hang from the ceiling
4779000	4781000	and he can jump
4781000	4783000	three times consecutively
4783000	4785000	there's a golden gem in every level
4785000	4787000	and what it does
4787000	4789000	I don't know what is up with
4789000	4791000	OS
4791000	4793000	anyway
4793000	4795000	so if you have
4795000	4797000	the gems, they're used in the final cutscene
4797000	4799000	of the game
4799000	4801000	by adding
4801000	4803000	one to three seconds to the ending
4803000	4805000	so the extended ending
4805000	4807000	has extra
4807000	4809000	character development for the
4809000	4811000	villains and other
4811000	4813000	secrets that happen
4813000	4815000	so the way that you get the gold gem
4815000	4817000	it differs
4817000	4819000	from stage to stage
4819000	4821000	so I suggest finding a walkthrough
4821000	4823000	if you're going to play it
4823000	4825000	so you have other gems in the game
4825000	4827000	they're red, blue, green, and like I said
4827000	4829000	the gold one
4829000	4831000	and some of them give health for Marina
4831000	4833000	red giving the lowest, gold being the highest
4833000	4835000	and then each stage
4835000	4837000	is numbered like a Super Mario Brothers level
4837000	4839000	like a 1, 1, 2, you know
4839000	4841000	etc. and the worlds
4841000	4843000	have different elements like world 1
4843000	4845000	is grasslands, world 3 is snow
4845000	4847000	and you have different cutscenes
4847000	4849000	you also get a thing
4849000	4851000	called a clancer ball
4851000	4853000	where Marina can throw
4853000	4855000	herself out of it and aim
4855000	4857000	toward another ball and
4857000	4859000	these pots store
4859000	4861000	different items in it so if you get the right
4861000	4863000	items you can make very interesting things happen
4863000	4865000	so like I said it was done
4865000	4867000	by Anix and Treasure
4867000	4869000	Treasure is like
4869000	4871000	Treasure did Gunstar Heroes
4871000	4873000	they did
4873000	4875000	Silhouette Mirage
4875000	4877000	if you want your
4877000	4879000	bizarre games
4879000	4881000	and I think
4881000	4883000	that it was
4883000	4885000	also one of the last
4885000	4887000	titles they did in a cartridge
4887000	4889000	format
4889000	4891000	because
4891000	4893000	it was one of their early ones
4893000	4895000	that did not come out
4895000	4897000	on a Sega system as well
4897000	4899000	they thought that Nintendo 64
4899000	4901000	was going to be the best choice for their projects
4901000	4903000	of course we know how well that happened
4903000	4905000	you know
4905000	4907000	it's like I said
4907000	4909000	Treasure has a track record
4909000	4911000	for doing quality games
4911000	4913000	with very interesting
4913000	4915000	elements of gameplay in it so
4915000	4917000	the game got kind of
4917000	4919000	extra views I mean
4919000	4921000	it's definitely
4921000	4923000	geared toward the Treasure fans
4923000	4925000	but not many people were
4925000	4927000	too into it because of the limitations
4927000	4929000	of the Nintendo 64 in terms of
4929000	4931000	graphics and the way that the game
4931000	4933000	it was just like a very glorified
4933000	4935000	SNES game with 3D in it
4935000	4937000	however
4937000	4939000	I know I keep saying it
4939000	4941000	but it is a Treasure game
4941000	4943000	so if you like Treasure games
4943000	4945000	this will definitely be up your alley
4945000	4947000	and it's got really
4947000	4949000	fun animation and really
4949000	4951000	adorable
4951000	4953000	artwork
4953000	4955000	it's one of my favorites it's one of the
4955000	4957000	Nintendo 64 games that I still own
4957000	4959000	so that is my game
4959000	4961000	of the week is Mischief Makers
4961000	4963000	or UK UK Troublemakers
4963000	4965000	UK UK means go go
4965000	4967000	now you just love
4967000	4969000	to do these Treasure games
4969000	4971000	is there any Treasure games you haven't done yet?
4971000	4973000	I'm not saying it's a bad thing
4973000	4975000	I'm sure there's Treasure games I haven't done
4975000	4977000	I mean
4977000	4979000	I've only done
4979000	4981000	did I do Bongio?
4981000	4983000	Treasure did Bongio didn't they?
4983000	4985000	I'm trying to think if you did that
4985000	4987000	I think you did at some point
4987000	4989000	well there it is
4989000	4991000	there it is your classic game of the week
4991000	4993000	Mischief Makers by Treasure for the Nintendo 64
4993000	4995000	so now Dark Sakura
4995000	4997000	would like to make an announcement
5003000	5005000	I feel like saying
5005000	5007000	parquet
5007000	5009000	is a little crown like the 80s commercials
5009000	5011000	so many of our listeners will not understand
5011000	5013000	that is so lost
5013000	5015000	on so many
5015000	5017000	that's always what pops into my head every time
5017000	5019000	you play the stupid little fanfare
5019000	5021000	is some kid with the crown
5021000	5023000	parquet was the little thing that would talk
5023000	5025000	parquet
5025000	5027000	oh my god this show has dissolved into butter
5027000	5029000	commercials Dark Sakura what's your damn
5029000	5031000	announcement?
5031000	5033000	my announcement is that
5033000	5035000	I have
5035000	5037000	on the way here
5037000	5039000	that I am reevaluating what I do in terms
5039000	5041000	of systems for the games and I am now
5041000	5043000	going to be doing it with a year cut off
5043000	5045000	so starting
5045000	5047000	with
5047000	5049000	October I'm going to be doing
5049000	5051000	games that came up through 2003
5051000	5053000	so that
5053000	5055000	I'm keeping a consistent 10 year
5055000	5057000	gap so that's going to start bringing
5057000	5059000	in I think
5059000	5061000	later PS1 games
5061000	5063000	GameCube games
5063000	5065000	the end of the Dreamcast cycle
5065000	5067000	and I believe PS2
5067000	5069000	we're going to start seeing PS2 games
5069000	5071000	come in for classic games I seem to remember
5071000	5073000	about a year ago you did an early
5073000	5075000	PlayStation 2 game and a lot of people
5075000	5077000	were like that's not classic
5077000	5079000	no y'all we're getting older
5079000	5081000	because these games are 10 years old
5081000	5083000	I think that's fair so I'm
5083000	5085000	on top of that I have to say
5085000	5087000	that no I'm not doing Halo
5087000	5089000	chatters
5089000	5091000	chatters are trolling
5091000	5093000	what started
5093000	5095000	the thought in my head
5095000	5097000	it took a while to develop you know the entire
5097000	5099000	drive here I was looking back
5099000	5101000	at my shelves going
5101000	5103000	oh my god some of this is
5103000	5105000	crap
5105000	5107000	we do have a lot of shit games
5107000	5109000	I mean for all of the
5109000	5111000	you know 300 plus worth
5111000	5113000	dollar games that we own we have
5113000	5115000	some shit and I have some games
5115000	5117000	that are kind of shit that I have just because I
5117000	5119000	fucking wanted them like Gatchamon
5119000	5121000	and the shooting I got it because
5121000	5123000	it was Gatchamon game shut up I have
5123000	5125000	Kitty the Cool which I got so
5125000	5127000	I could burn you a copy
5127000	5129000	if you will remember that
5129000	5131000	somebody bought me the Hello Kitty GameCube
5131000	5133000	game and it's not that great
5133000	5135000	so you know what's funny
5135000	5137000	with you setting your
5137000	5139000	10 year limit I want to really
5139000	5141000	explain to you what this means
5141000	5143000	because you are doing games
5143000	5145000	that are 10 years or older
5145000	5147000	you could feasibly be
5147000	5149000	doing games that we
5149000	5151000	talked about their launch on this
5151000	5153000	program I was
5153000	5155000	thinking about that and maybe I should
5155000	5157000	you know put it at our launch date
5157000	5159000	and earlier but I think 10 years
5159000	5161000	is a good limit and it opens up
5161000	5163000	I'm just thinking like oh my god she could
5163000	5165000	now granted I love you SSJ 100
5165000	5167000	Matt for linking the Parquet commercial
5167000	5169000	granted we didn't
5169000	5171000	expand from the music games only
5171000	5173000	to all games until about what
5173000	5175000	2004, 2005
5175000	5177000	so we still have a few years
5177000	5179000	to go before you really hit that mark
5179000	5181000	where yes we talked about these games when they first came out
5181000	5183000	but the whole thing
5183000	5185000	I'm thinking of is that now we talk about some of
5185000	5187000	these games and
5187000	5189000	they are classic we're seeing
5189000	5191000	HD remakes because
5191000	5193000	they are classic oh god Rob
5193000	5195000	sorry this is linked by SSJ
5195000	5197000	100 Matt in chat finish your thought and then I'll play this
5197000	5199000	ok but
5199000	5201000	by now they are classic
5201000	5203000	and you know we have to stay
5203000	5205000	and it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing
5205000	5207000	only games from 10 years ago
5207000	5209000	I still have a shit ton
5209000	5211000	of Cliccovision games and
5211000	5213000	Intellivision to be fair you've
5213000	5215000	been doing this segment since episode I mean
5215000	5217000	this segment has evolved since the early days
5217000	5219000	of the show because it used to be what it used to be your advice
5219000	5221000	column you had your link and then the website of the
5221000	5223000	yeah so now you have your classic so you've only been doing
5223000	5225000	classic games since what episode 250 yeah
5225000	5227000	but that's still 270
5227000	5229000	games but that's that you've covered
5229000	5231000	exactly it's not even at a
5231000	5233000	halfway point anymore that I
5233000	5235000	started doing this and for the record
5235000	5237000	I do kind of miss the website of the week just because
5237000	5239000	the guy from
5239000	5241000	Weebil and
5241000	5243000	Bob messaged us
5243000	5245000	that was pretty cool
5245000	5247000	that was like a nerdgasm
5247000	5249000	in my book ok now if I
5249000	5251000	get you know a shout out from
5251000	5253000	you know
5253000	5255000	from Homestuck people or from
5255000	5257000	the guy the person that does Nedroid
5257000	5259000	Diary I would be even happier
5259000	5261000	because those are
5261000	5263000	my favorites but
5263000	5265000	yeah I figured by now it's time
5265000	5267000	it's time to grow up
5267000	5269000	it's time to acknowledge that I don't want
5269000	5271000	to grow up I'm an O.L.R.
5271000	5273000	kid there's a million games O.L.R.
5273000	5275000	that I can play with
5275000	5277000	Lord but
5277000	5279000	I'm thinking at this
5279000	5281000	point enough of our listeners
5281000	5283000	who might have been
5283000	5285000	a little too young for us back in the
5285000	5287000	day yes might
5287000	5289000	appreciate something that's a little bit more
5289000	5291000	in their realm of experience from
5291000	5293000	time to time fair enough fair enough
5293000	5295000	black wolf is trying he says
5295000	5297000	in our chat room halo classic game
5297000	5299000	of the week let's make it happen
5299000	5301000	you know Bobby it will happen
5301000	5303000	if you send me a $25 gift card
5303000	5305000	to California Pizza Kitchen
5307000	5309000	you too can bribe dark soccer

5425000	5427000	and Loki did my intro for that
5427000	5429000	to everybody knows because it was used
5429000	5431000	in the movie and he said
5431000	5433000	tune in and give her a dollar

5521000	5523000	with the 520th
5523000	5525000	episode of our show
5525000	5527000	September 22nd
5527000	5529000	2013 and uh
5529000	5531000	a big thanks of course to everybody who turns up
5531000	5533000	to listen to the show live
5533000	5535000	and in podcast form
5535000	5537000	uh I know for live tonight
5537000	5539000	we're going up against what the Emmys are tonight
5539000	5541000	although I mean I don't know why these award
5541000	5543000	shows are such a big deal but maybe I'm just
5543000	5545000	jaded from doing this on Sunday night for so long
5545000	5547000	but I know the Breaking Bad finale
5547000	5549000	is tonight too and I'm sure a lot of people
5549000	5551000	are excited about that
5551000	5553000	but that's why they have DVR
5553000	5555000	that's why you tape it and watch it later
5555000	5557000	but speaking of recording
5557000	5559000	speaking of recording and watching it
5559000	5561000	later I know a lot of people listen to us on the podcast
5561000	5563000	feed uh be it through Stitcher
5563000	5565000	or iTunes or whatever
5565000	5567000	I mean there's a lot of ways to know
5567000	5569000	some people might still be rocking this on the PSP
5569000	5571000	which does remind me to also
5571000	5573000	say um olrpsp.com
5573000	5575000	has closed
5575000	5577000	uh I think well I think it was
5577000	5579000	this week that it finally was turned back over
5579000	5581000	to GoDaddy who I'm sure has a spam site up
5581000	5583000	in its place um so
5583000	5585000	that is no longer accessible
5585000	5587000	at that website but if you do have a PSP
5587000	5589000	and you have badly
5589000	5591000	you're like oh what was I missing at olrpsp.com
5591000	5593000	even though it's so out of date
5593000	5595000	I don't even think it ever it still tries to access
5595000	5597000	the stream at our old network
5597000	5599000	but not even their current stream
5599000	5601000	like an old stream at the old network
5601000	5603000	uh you can still visit the graphics
5603000	5605000	Loki did do a bang up job on the site
5605000	5607000	orangeloungeradio.com
5607000	5609000	slash psp you just have to do it the long way
5609000	5611000	and I'm pretty sure the old games radio
5611000	5613000	streamer does not work anymore
5613000	5615000	I'm pretty sure it goes to their old feed
5615000	5617000	because I think it had broke it had been broke
5617000	5619000	at one point when they switched servers and
5619000	5621000	everybody was like Loki update it Loki update it
5621000	5623000	and you were like no
5623000	5625000	I have an updated site here
5625000	5627000	I'm not gonna start now
5627000	5629000	the studio points out there's also a bitly
5629000	5631000	so bit.ly slash
5631000	5633000	olrpsp will also get you there
5633000	5635000	so there you go
5635000	5637000	um anyhow uh
5637000	5639000	thanks again to all you guys who listen and participate with the show
5639000	5641000	speaking of live participators
5641000	5643000	uh it was brought to our attention
5643000	5645000	during the release date segment that we go over
5645000	5647000	that we missed one big release
5647000	5649000	that's coming out this week probably because
5649000	5651000	it's in the download space but
5651000	5653000	some of our chatters namely Alan Alchemy
5653000	5655000	and ActDeft very excited about
5655000	5657000	Pac-Man Championship Edition
5657000	5659000	Deluxe Plus which is
5659000	5661000	on PC I know they've been hoarding it
5661000	5663000	on Steam uh Wednesday September
5663000	5665000	25th uh and then
5665000	5667000	also the DLC pack for
5667000	5669000	consoles will be the same day because I believe
5669000	5671000	it's new to PC I don't think it's been out on PC
5671000	5673000	yet so it'll be on Steam 9.25
5673000	5675000	and then the DLC upgrade
5675000	5677000	uh will hit consoles on September 25th
5677000	5679000	so that's it sounds like they're adding a lot
5679000	5681000	to it like they probably could have done a third
5681000	5683000	game out of it but they're not so
5683000	5685000	just wanted to throw that out there because after
5685000	5687000	all they could have done a third game
5687000	5689000	but they didn't they could have
5689000	5691000	not unlike
5691000	5693000	another company we know right
5695000	5697000	Half Life 2 DLC
5697000	5699000	episode confirmed they need to talk to Capcom
5699000	5701000	and learn about counting to three
5701000	5703000	pretty much the third game for Pac-Man
5703000	5705000	3 on Steam
5705000	5707000	Half Life 3 confirmed
5707000	5709000	maybe that's one of the big announcements who knows
5709000	5711000	alright uh let us get into
5711000	5713000	some rapid fire news some quick
5713000	5715000	news it's funny when you
5715000	5717000	some of you guys in chat are like I'm surprised they haven't
5717000	5719000	mentioned this yet well that's

5739000	5741000	finally be able to get your Tron stuff in the
5741000	5743000	toy box mode which is pretty fantastic
5743000	5745000	um

5779000	5781000	they're teasing you into thinking it is
5781000	5783000	yes they know what they're doing
5783000	5785000	they know what they're doing um

5801000	5803000	soon yeah

5807000	5809000	Gravity Rush
5809000	5811000	is getting a sequel and
5811000	5813000	um I believe that's still coming to the Vita
5813000	5815000	and they were kinda they teased it
5815000	5817000	with a trailer that came out
5817000	5819000	of um
5819000	5821000	uh what was it uh
5821000	5823000	what the fuck was this weekend
5823000	5825000	or this week Tokyo Game Show
5825000	5827000	hello thank you um
5827000	5829000	um so yeah so far confirmed
5829000	5831000	for the Vita but um no word yet on
5831000	5833000	when um if that's gonna be other
5833000	5835000	systems PlayStation 4 that kind of stuff
5835000	5837000	I would think keep it on the Vita it was a pretty good
5837000	5839000	Vita exclusive game although
5839000	5841000	I mean they practically well they still give it away
5841000	5843000	if you well if you have PlayStation Plus you know
5843000	5845000	you have to be on board with that but yeah so
5845000	5847000	that's pretty cool um it's worth your time
5847000	5849000	though yeah and uh
5849000	5851000	no word on when that's
5851000	5853000	coming out and then last but not least one of the
5853000	5855000	cool pieces of integration
5855000	5857000	for Grand Theft Auto
5857000	5859000	5 is this iFruit companion
5859000	5861000	app that you can get on iOS
5861000	5863000	um very disappointing that it's not an
5863000	5865000	Android yet but with it you can do a bunch
5865000	5867000	of cool stuff including customizing your car
5867000	5869000	you can customize the license plates that are on your
5869000	5871000	car and they actually appear in game
5871000	5873000	as well oh that's kinda cool um
5873000	5875000	you can even raise Chop which
5875000	5877000	is the dog that Franklin
5877000	5879000	um ends up getting and
5879000	5881000	uh you can train him and stuff
5881000	5883000	and walk him just like you can with
5883000	5885000	intent dogs except you know with a little bit
5885000	5887000	of a twist including um
5887000	5889000	you know he'll fetch
5889000	5891000	grenades and severed hands and stuff
5891000	5893000	like that um and they're gonna be adding apps
5893000	5895000	to it as well so um
5895000	5897000	it's pretty cool and it's free
5897000	5899000	so if you have you know an iOS device
5899000	5901000	then pick it up
5901000	5903000	if you have an Android device don't
5903000	5905000	download any ones that are out there because they're all scam
5905000	5907000	apps they're all scam right now
5907000	5909000	I love that they have that tie in
5909000	5911000	though that's awesome they have a lot of ties that it actually
5911000	5913000	goes in your game yeah they have that and social
5913000	5915000	club stuff you know there's actual real
5915000	5917000	websites you can visit you get in game
5917000	5919000	discounts and stuff with and
5919000	5921000	just all sorts of crazy stuff Final Fantasy
5921000	5923000	14 has an app but it doesn't like it's
5923000	5925000	it's like the Warcraft armory you can like
5925000	5927000	look up characters and stuff in game but you can't really
5927000	5929000	do anything with it otherwise but
5929000	5931000	kinda neat I like seeing the
5931000	5933000	whole tie in there now that's second screen right
5933000	5935000	alright sort of yeah
5935000	5937000	alright speaking of second screen
5937000	5939000	something on the Wii U popped up
5939000	5941000	a message mentioning
5941000	5943000	that Mario and Sonic at the Sochi
5943000	5945000	2014 Winter Games will be available
5945000	5947000	on the eShop on November 8th
5947000	5949000	all controversy
5949000	5951000	about the Winter Games and where it's being held
5951000	5953000	aside these Mario
5953000	5955000	and Sonic games have done very
5955000	5957000	very well a lot of you guys
5957000	5959000	probably really
5959000	5961000	I mean cause they're not really for hardcore gamers
5961000	5963000	they're really geared for casual gamers and
5963000	5965000	kids but these games do insanely
5965000	5967000	well like it's one of the biggest properties
5967000	5969000	on the Wii so this is
5969000	5971000	a pretty big deal this is happening on the Wii U
5971000	5973000	there was a reveal
5973000	5975000	trailer if you think back to the Nintendo Direct
5975000	5977000	then there was another trailer
5977000	5979000	that said there will be 16 events in the game
5979000	5981000	Wii Motion Plus Wii U gamepad
5981000	5983000	both being used some will use both
5983000	5985000	the biathlon uses the Wii
5985000	5987000	remote for skiing and then the gamepad for the sniping
5987000	5989000	so there you go that will
5989000	5991000	all be out November 8th
5991000	5993000	so uh
5993000	5995000	Wii balance board support I see
5995000	5997000	no probably not probably a little soon
5997000	5999000	for that I don't know so
5999000	6001000	there you go
6001000	6003000	I'm
6003000	6005000	as much as I don't want to get too political on this show
6005000	6007000	obviously you all know I have some strong opinions
6007000	6009000	on certain subjects and so
6009000	6011000	you know obviously I can't
6011000	6013000	condone some of these laws
6013000	6015000	that we've heard about in Russia
6015000	6017000	that are just back in the stone age
6017000	6019000	so is Birdo not gonna be
6019000	6021000	allowed to play in these games?
6023000	6025000	I was gonna
6025000	6027000	say something serious but we'll just leave it at that
6027000	6029000	fair enough
6029000	6031000	you play PC 4.0
6031000	6033000	I didn't even realize Uplay was a thing on PC
6033000	6035000	I knew it was on the consoles
6035000	6037000	I guess Ubisoft wants their buy to
6037000	6039000	the PC gaming market as well
6039000	6041000	there will be a new version of it in October
6041000	6043000	and it will have new features including
6043000	6045000	Twitch TV integration
6045000	6047000	well it's something that's bundled with
6047000	6049000	all the Ubisoft games so if you have it on Steam
6049000	6051000	you still have to log into your fucking Uplay
6051000	6053000	bullshit yeah
6053000	6055000	I must not own any Ubisoft games on PC
6055000	6057000	I have on consoles
6057000	6059000	I have a couple Just Dance games
6059000	6061000	and Zombie You
6061000	6063000	and Blood Dragon
6063000	6065000	I don't remember if Far Cry 2 did
6065000	6067000	but yeah
6067000	6069000	well there you go
6069000	6071000	Uplay will also be available on the Xbox One and the
6071000	6073000	PlayStation 4 when those consoles make their retail
6073000	6075000	debuts but I don't know
6075000	6077000	like I imagine
6077000	6079000	those consoles are already streaming anyway
6079000	6081000	so whatever
6081000	6083000	and then last but not least
6083000	6085000	for all two of you
6085000	6087000	at Orange Lawns Radio that will care about this news
6087000	6089000	La Mulana 2
6089000	6091000	it is out there
6091000	6093000	folks no all kidding aside
6093000	6095000	this is an indie game that gets a lot of attention
6095000	6097000	partially for
6097000	6099000	its throwback to the retro days partially because
6099000	6101000	of how difficult it is but
6101000	6103000	La Mulana 2 apparently
6103000	6105000	not available on PC until next year
6105000	6107000	but it was
6107000	6109000	spotted at Tokyo Game Show 2013
6109000	6111000	and there's even like a little
6111000	6113000	logo out there La Mulana 2
6113000	6115000	the zeroth body the night spirit
6115000	6117000	I don't know how else to read that the zeroth body
6117000	6119000	sounds right there it is
6119000	6121000	and you will probably die
6121000	6123000	many more times than
6123000	6125000	zero playing La Mulana 2
6125000	6127000	I think Dark Tetsuya
6127000	6129000	needs new underwear now he might
6129000	6131000	so in other news
6131000	6133000	speaking of people who need new underwear
6133000	6135000	I'm thinking of my husband now
6135000	6137000	Strider HD
6137000	6139000	this is
6139000	6141000	did you watch the trailer Rob?
6141000	6143000	yes I did
6143000	6145000	it is hot
6145000	6147000	it's supposed to be a Metroidvania
6147000	6149000	type game
6149000	6151000	which people are a little bit sort of
6151000	6153000	back and forth on but for the most part
6153000	6155000	it's gotten some really positive reviews
6155000	6157000	and so I'm looking forward to it coming out
6157000	6159000	but I just wanted to mention
6159000	6161000	that it is getting really good reviews
6161000	6163000	previews I guess would be really
6163000	6165000	yeah but
6165000	6167000	I think that everyone owes it to themselves
6167000	6169000	to dedicate themselves to the religion
6169000	6171000	of Hiryu
6171000	6173000	and definitely check out the
6173000	6175000	you know think about it
6175000	6177000	think about it this way Loki hasn't
6177000	6179000	shut up about Grand Theft Auto 5
6179000	6181000	I haven't shut up about Final Fantasy 14
6181000	6183000	Dark Sakura will have her day when this
6183000	6185000	game comes out
6185000	6187000	I need a moment
6187000	6189000	I need a moment
6189000	6191000	I'm a little warm
6191000	6193000	I'm a little warm
6193000	6195000	do I need to get some paper towels
6195000	6197000	this is getting gross
6197000	6199000	someone fetch a towel
6199000	6201000	Austin now this is a cool game
6201000	6203000	and I was watching a little bit of the play on this
6203000	6205000	it was one of the fastest
6205000	6207000	greenlit games ever
6207000	6209000	and it went in five
6209000	6211000	days
6211000	6213000	a game by Polish developer Blue Brick
6213000	6215000	called Superhot
6215000	6217000	and basically what it is
6217000	6219000	it's
6219000	6221000	basically your characters are like
6221000	6223000	black outlines against
6223000	6225000	all white but normally
6225000	6227000	shaded environment
6227000	6229000	with lots and lots of red blood
6229000	6231000	the thing about this is that time
6231000	6233000	only moves when you move
6233000	6235000	so if someone shoots at you
6235000	6237000	you can stop walking
6237000	6239000	and the bullets stop
6239000	6241000	and you can dodge them
6241000	6243000	dodge them
6243000	6245000	so it just seemed like a really neat concept
6245000	6247000	and we've seen something like this done with
6247000	6249000	you know bullet time and max pain
6249000	6251000	but nothing to the extent of
6251000	6253000	actually having it stop
6253000	6255000	so the only way to win is not to play the game
6257000	6259000	yes
6259000	6261000	you have to
6261000	6263000	you definitely have a goal within the game
6263000	6265000	but
6265000	6267000	you can move around the things that are in your way
6267000	6269000	Loki you just lost the game
6271000	6273000	and last but never least
6273000	6275000	and I'm looking forward to this as well
6275000	6277000	Bayonetta actually is
6277000	6279000	having a theatrical release
6279000	6281000	an animated theatrical release
6281000	6283000	that will be out in November in Japan
6283000	6285000	and I will have to talk to people who live there
6285000	6287000	to tell me
6287000	6289000	how it is
6289000	6291000	Krista go watch the movie for me
6291000	6293000	so
6293000	6295000	it's named Bayonetta
6295000	6297000	Bloody Fate and it will be out on November 23rd
6297000	6299000	you know it's gonna be out
6299000	6301000	and people will fan sub it
6301000	6303000	of course
6303000	6305000	fan subbers gonna sub
6305000	6307000	alright
6307000	6309000	are we ready to get to the foogle
6309000	6311000	question of the week? I sure hope so
6311000	6313000	because if not
6313000	6315000	you're gonna check out for a minute
6315000	6317000	I guess
6317000	6319000	we love to hear from listeners
6323000	6325000	so every week we ask a
6325000	6327000	question at facebook.com
6327000	6329000	slash orange lounge radio and our google plus
6329000	6331000	page available for a search
6331000	6333000	available when you search for orange
6333000	6335000	lounge radio a lot of comments
6335000	6337000	this week I'm not gonna be able to read them all
6337000	6339000	I'm so sorry but
6339000	6341000	a lot of great feedback on the question this week
6341000	6343000	let me tell you what the question is
6343000	6345000	it was announced this week that Wii Sports would become the
6345000	6347000	latest game to get an HD version or
6347000	6349000	remaster if you will
6349000	6351000	this is in addition to other HD remakes
6351000	6353000	we've seen this year Kingdom Hearts for example
6353000	6355000	and even previously with God of War
6355000	6357000	and so forth so what's your opinion
6357000	6359000	on HD remakes? Do you enjoy
6359000	6361000	them or do you think it's not a good use of
6361000	6363000	developer resources?
6363000	6365000	Redertainment on google plus says
6365000	6367000	HD remaster or remake might be good if
6367000	6369000	the game is a revered classic but Wii Sports
6369000	6371000	come on what's next
6371000	6373000	Golf for the NES? Wait
6373000	6375000	I've played Golf for the NES it's the
6375000	6377000	Grand Theft Auto 5 mini game
6377000	6379000	E3
6379000	6381000	VL or Evel says
6381000	6383000	I think it gives the new generation of gamers
6383000	6385000	a chance to experience past games who are
6385000	6387000	put off by older graphics
6387000	6389000	gamers who missed old gems in the past
6389000	6391000	like Shadow of the Colossus are
6391000	6393000	able to experience the game now due
6393000	6395000	to wider availability without paying the high
6395000	6397000	eBay cost. Personally
6397000	6399000	I'll pay for the game again if they add
6399000	6401000	new content along with the updated
6401000	6403000	visuals like the Wind Waker HD with its
6403000	6405000	gameplay tweaks and the gamepad support
6405000	6407000	or have additional bonus content
6407000	6409000	all DLC in the Resident Evil HD
6409000	6411000	games which could cost
6411000	6413000	which would cost more if obtained
6413000	6415000	separately. Good thoughts
6415000	6417000	you know though if somebody is really
6417000	6419000	going to ignore a classic game because of
6419000	6421000	graphics though I really think
6421000	6423000	they're missing out I mean there's just some
6423000	6425000	classic games you can't really HD
6425000	6427000	like Kaboom on the Atari
6427000	6429000	2600 that is a classic
6429000	6431000	game but you can't like yeah
6431000	6433000	I mean there's some they tried Tetris
6433000	6435000	right? The only thing that did
6435000	6437000	kicks right was Miss New World
6437000	6439000	and
6439000	6441000	to be fair the Tetris on the Game Boy
6441000	6443000	or I think the DS Tetris was
6443000	6445000	amazing that was a great version
6445000	6447000	of Tetris. And let's not forget Gals Panic
6447000	6449000	is awesome. Of course of course
6449000	6451000	so those are some of the answers from Google Plus
6451000	6453000	let's get to some of the answers from
6453000	6455000	Facebook
6455000	6457000	Andrew S says I wouldn't mind a Tony Hawk
6457000	6459000	Underground or as my friend and I
6459000	6461000	refer to it as Thug Remaster
6461000	6463000	it would bring
6463000	6465000	it would bring it out of PS2 graphics
6465000	6467000	Renee our buddy
6467000	6469000	from Koopa Club says
6469000	6471000	to HD or not to HD
6471000	6473000	that is the question
6473000	6475000	whether it is nobler the developer
6475000	6477000	to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged
6477000	6479000	reviewers for not offering new
6479000	6481000	and instead recycling the same game format
6481000	6483000	and content or to take arms against
6483000	6485000	a sea of troubles from development, programming
6485000	6487000	and marketing and by providing new content
6487000	6489000	either limited or a completely
6489000	6491000	new game altogether and by
6491000	6493000	opposing end them to try to
6493000	6495000	release an HD version in timely fashion
6495000	6497000	I see what you did there
6497000	6499000	and you get a slow clap
6503000	6505000	it is a tough
6505000	6507000	question that they have to ask
6507000	6509000	Red the Haze says I like
6509000	6511000	HD remakes as it lets people try
6511000	6513000	out older games they may have missed
6513000	6515000	with updated graphics and performance
6515000	6517000	as much as I think Wii Sports HD
6517000	6519000	is a good idea for new Wii U owners to
6519000	6521000	try out Wii Sports it just feels
6521000	6523000	icky for them to try something like this for what
6523000	6525000	was a free pack-in title
6525000	6527000	especially with the lack of unified account system
6527000	6529000	on with Nintendo consoles
6529000	6531000	other than that HD remakes are great
6531000	6533000	Degenerate Johnny
6533000	6535000	says the fact of the matter is that
6535000	6537000	many of us gamers cling to the memories
6537000	6539000	and experiences of the games we have played earlier
6539000	6541000	in our lives an HD remake
6541000	6543000	offers the chance for us to relive those
6543000	6545000	memories with a fresher feel to it
6545000	6547000	that is part of the answer I am going to
6547000	6549000	cut the rest of it for time
6549000	6551000	For the Fallen Dreams 13 says
6551000	6553000	I enjoy HD remakes of games because
6553000	6555000	it's just about making a game I was already in love
6555000	6557000	with bigger, brighter, and more
6557000	6559000	aesthetically pleasing given the
6559000	6561000	developer does it justice
6561000	6563000	also not everyone's older consoles
6563000	6565000	still work dot dot dot
6565000	6567000	that's an answer I personally agree with
6567000	6569000	unless you're me
6569000	6571000	Dart Charger says
6571000	6573000	as someone who has invested in a lot of HD
6573000	6575000	remakes I feel they sound cooler
6575000	6577000	than they actually end up being
6577000	6579000	the nostalgia is often
6579000	6581000	fleeting with few exceptions
6581000	6583000	Scott W says
6583000	6585000	I enjoy HD remakes as long as they bring something
6585000	6587000	extra like Final Fantasy 10 HD
6587000	6589000	with the international content included
6589000	6591000	Kingdom Hearts looks great too
6591000	6593000	Ziba says I enjoy the HD remakes
6593000	6595000	definitely the nostalgia feeling that's best
6595000	6597000	it's even better when they add some special things
6597000	6599000	to keep interest going
6599000	6601000	Eddie K says it's a lazy but effective
6601000	6603000	way to make money
6603000	6605000	nostalgia sells huge in the
6605000	6607000	video game industry
6607000	6609000	Virtual Phil also
6609000	6611000	from Koopa Club says I guess if you have the money
6611000	6613000	to burn then it's cool but like
6613000	6615000	DuckTales HD was fun for 10 seconds
6615000	6617000	and now everyone is all over the next
6617000	6619000	HD remake they tend to be
6619000	6621000	a bit gimmicky
6621000	6623000	and that was followed by the colon x face
6623000	6625000	you know what
6625000	6627000	Dan is still playing that game
6627000	6629000	because he's achievement hunting on it
6629000	6631000	Tiger Claw
6631000	6633000	says an HD remake of a game would be worth
6633000	6635000	it if they add some new content to it
6635000	6637000	the problem is they tend to be a shot for shot
6637000	6639000	remake of the original game where you
6639000	6641000	know where all the items are located
6641000	6643000	and how to beat the levels
6643000	6645000	I'm down for an HD version of Wii Sports as long as
6645000	6647000	they add online multiplayer to it
6647000	6649000	and lastly
6649000	6651000	Gamer Girl says don't know if this counts
6651000	6653000	but I am really loving DuckTales
6653000	6655000	Remastered I think they should come out with
6655000	6657000	more because a lot of the younger generation
6657000	6659000	doesn't even know the mind blown
6659000	6661000	that they're missing out on
6661000	6663000	again some of the answers I'm so sorry I had to cut some of those for time
6663000	6665000	Facebook.com slash orange launch radio
6665000	6667000	if you want to read all of the answers in their entirety
6667000	6669000	a big thank you to all of you that
6669000	6671000	took the time to answer that I did read them all
6671000	6673000	so what are your guys thoughts
6673000	6675000	quickly on HD remasters
6675000	6677000	I think they're great I agree with the guy
6677000	6679000	that said you know what the old consoles don't
6679000	6681000	always work I like the stuff like
6681000	6683000	trophy support and so on and
6683000	6685000	it's just icing on the cake when they go back and make
6685000	6687000	it a little bit better
6687000	6689000	I'm kind of
6689000	6691000	I don't know how
6691000	6693000	I feel about it to be honest because
6693000	6695000	I hardly ever go back and buy them
6695000	6697000	except for the ones that are like super
6697000	6699000	nostalgic that really
6699000	6701000	are a true update like you know like
6701000	6703000	DuckTales was you know that was a big
6703000	6705000	nostalgic kick I have it Dan
6705000	6707000	has it I'm not
6707000	6709000	getting the Final Fantasy
6709000	6711000	X set because
6711000	6713000	I already have X, X-2
6713000	6715000	and I have X
6715000	6717000	International so
6717000	6719000	no I have X-2 International
6719000	6721000	so sort of like what's the point
6721000	6723000	I actually have the Japanese version of X
6723000	6725000	I'm a sheep I'm totally getting X
6725000	6727000	I want it really bad
6727000	6729000	that being said
6729000	6731000	I kind of want the HD
6731000	6733000	Kingdom Hearts but I'm probably just going to wait and play yours
6733000	6735000	an effective
6735000	6737000	solution because I'm
6737000	6739000	unemployed so I have
6739000	6741000	to measure frugality
6741000	6743000	and realism versus
6743000	6745000	you know
6745000	6747000	needs
6747000	6749000	versus wants
6749000	6751000	Final Fantasy 14 I bought the collector's edition
6751000	6753000	that was my anniversary
6753000	6755000	present Grand Theft Auto 5
6755000	6757000	is my anniversary present to my husband
6757000	6759000	because I am an awesome wife
6759000	6761000	so
6761000	6763000	we make it for occasion so if
6763000	6765000	it came out if a really awesome
6765000	6767000	HD remake came out and it's a round
6767000	6769000	like Strider well Strider's not really
6769000	6771000	a remake though we're fucking getting that you know that
6771000	6773000	but it falls in the
6773000	6775000	same category as DuckTales but also Strider
6775000	6777000	is Dan's favorite
6777000	6779000	game in the fucking universe
6779000	6781000	for Strider you'll eat ramen for a week
6781000	6783000	he made me play through the
6783000	6785000	Genesis version when I moved out here to see
6785000	6787000	if he wanted to bury me
6787000	6789000	well he didn't say that aloud
6789000	6791000	but I have a feeling that my ability to beat
6791000	6793000	Strider was one of the requirements
6793000	6795000	of marriage and what did he have to do for you
6795000	6797000	fair is fair right?
6797000	6799000	what did he have to do for me?
6799000	6801000	not irritate me?
6801000	6803000	I don't know
6803000	6805000	he kept me supplied in video games
6805000	6807000	for the last 15 years so I feel good about that
6807000	6809000	fair enough he hasn't kicked me
6809000	6811000	out for being a shiftless layabout for the
6811000	6813000	last two years it's not my fault
6813000	6815000	I'm not employed but still fair
6815000	6817000	enough alright let's talk about some other
6817000	6819000	gaming news and what else is going on in the industry
6819000	6821000	Loki why don't you start us off
6821000	6823000	okay so let's talk some more Grand Theft
6823000	6825000	Auto it sold
6825000	6827000	one billion dollars
6827000	6829000	worth of copies in the first
6829000	6831000	three days and
6831000	6833000	that's a
6833000	6835000	record in fact it broke
6835000	6837000	a record for day one sales too
6837000	6839000	800 million dollars
6839000	6841000	the previous
6841000	6843000	landmark I think was
6843000	6845000	Call of Duty Black Ops 2 which only
6845000	6847000	did I want to say 450
6847000	6849000	million
6849000	6851000	and also
6851000	6853000	it hit a billion dollars faster in Call of Duty
6853000	6855000	Black Ops 2 as well they hit a billion dollars
6855000	6857000	in 15 days instead of
6857000	6859000	three
6859000	6861000	so yes it's the largest entertainment
6861000	6863000	launch in history
6863000	6865000	not bad
6865000	6867000	fun fact
6867000	6869000	in the history of films
6869000	6871000	only
6871000	6873000	17 movies
6873000	6875000	have grossed a billion dollars
6875000	6877000	worldwide and that's total
6877000	6879000	17 movies total now
6879000	6881000	the oldest one of the 17
6881000	6883000	is
6883000	6885000	1993
6885000	6887000	this is like the Jurassic Park episode because
6887000	6889000	the movie is the oldest
6889000	6891000	one on the list there because you know it costs more to see
6891000	6893000	a movie these days than it used to if you were to change
6893000	6895000	for inflation
6895000	6897000	like Gone with the Wind or something would probably be up there but
6897000	6899000	yeah only 17 movies have ever done a billion
6899000	6901000	dollars worth of business and that was over
6901000	6903000	the course of being in the theater
6903000	6905000	for what we Titanic the number
6905000	6907000	two grossing movie of all time two billion
6907000	6909000	dollars done but that was
6909000	6911000	what that was in theaters for like six months
6911000	6913000	and then re-released in the
6913000	6915000	whole IMAX thing right
6915000	6917000	so I mean this is huge that a video game did that
6917000	6919000	practically overnight no movies done it
6919000	6921000	overnight or three days
6921000	6923000	still
6923000	6925000	even can some
6925000	6927000	folks guess some of the other movies the top 17
6927000	6929000	on the list just for fun
6929000	6931000	well I know the top grossing movie
6931000	6933000	for 24 hours was Harry Potter
6933000	6935000	and the
6935000	6937000	it was Harry Potter and the
6937000	6939000	Deathly Hallows part 2 is number
6939000	6941000	four on the all time list it was 91 million
6941000	6943000	dollars in 24 hours that
6943000	6945000	was the the video
6945000	6947000	or DVD I'm sorry the
6947000	6949000	movie record for top grossing
6949000	6951000	24 hours I can tell you what the top two were no fair
6951000	6953000	peaking but okay well I haven't because my
6953000	6955000	glasses because
6955000	6957000	I remember the news past when avatars are past
6957000	6959000	Titanic avatar is the number one movie of all time
6959000	6961000	and Titanic would be number two Titanic would be
6961000	6963000	number two correct just quickly
6963000	6965000	Marvel's the Avengers number three
6965000	6967000	because of Jaws Iron Man
6967000	6969000	three number five Transformers
6969000	6971000	Dark of the Moon number six that surprised
6971000	6973000	me Lord of the Rings The Return
6973000	6975000	of the King number seven Skyfall
6975000	6977000	number eight The Dark Knight
6977000	6979000	Rises number nine that
6979000	6981000	surprised me too because I always thought The Dark Knight
6981000	6983000	did better but I guess with the year difference
6983000	6985000	and then lastly number ten I
6985000	6987000	won't read the whole list but Pirates of the Caribbean Dead
6987000	6989000	Man's Chest is number ten so just
6989000	6991000	kind of a fun little comparison those are the movies
6991000	6993000	that have raked a billion dollars
6993000	6995000	so
6995000	6997000	neat and they're just getting started
6997000	6999000	mm-hmm
6999000	7001000	alright
7001000	7003000	well moving on to a game
7003000	7005000	that will sadly probably not to break a billion
7005000	7007000	dollars because we're just not sure if the game is ever
7007000	7009000	going to come out here or not it was
7009000	7011000	spotted on Steam Greenlight this week
7011000	7013000	Ghosts and Goblins Online
7013000	7015000	you know how they can get that to break a billion dollars
7015000	7017000	charge one dollar for every life
7017000	7019000	hahaha
7019000	7021000	good work
7021000	7023000	dead
7023000	7025000	Ghosts and Goblins Online this has a long history
7025000	7027000	you want to talk about an old game it was originally
7027000	7029000	supposed to be a multi-platform release in 2003
7029000	7031000	but then development
7031000	7033000	stopped before it was completed
7033000	7035000	then there was a second attempt that was also
7035000	7037000	canned C9
7037000	7039000	did the whole Steam Greenlight
7039000	7041000	campaign and they were bringing back
7041000	7043000	Ghosts and Goblins Online with co-op platforming
7043000	7045000	PVP combat and frequent
7045000	7047000	updates that do new items and upgrades
7047000	7049000	but
7049000	7051000	I say was because then
7051000	7053000	it got pulled
7053000	7055000	Capcom actually had this pulled
7055000	7057000	and we're not totally sure on what it was
7057000	7059000	but their statement was quote
7059000	7061000	the Steam Greenlight page for Ghosts and Goblins Online
7061000	7063000	that went live yesterday was wrongly
7063000	7065000	posted by the game's Korean
7065000	7067000	developer C9 and the page has
7067000	7069000	now been removed. Ghosts and Goblins
7069000	7071000	was released last year in
7071000	7073000	Korea, China and Taiwan and I seem to
7073000	7075000	remember that now that there was the
7075000	7077000	Ghosts and Goblins because I remember we talked about it on the show
7077000	7079000	we were like oh of course we don't get it
7079000	7081000	here but they get it over there and there are
7081000	7083000	no plans for the title to be
7083000	7085000	released in Europe or North America
7085000	7087000	hmm but
7087000	7089000	very strange that that
7089000	7091000	showed up on Steam Greenlight I mean
7091000	7093000	that's more than just one person pushing a button
7093000	7095000	accidentally you know what I mean? That's very
7095000	7097000	strange to me
7097000	7099000	but honestly the game
7099000	7101000	itself looks very different
7101000	7103000	than what you guys remember from
7103000	7105000	you know the classic
7105000	7107000	days of gaming when that was on the early
7107000	7109000	consoles and the arcades and so forth
7109000	7111000	so I kind of think
7111000	7113000	as much as this sounds great on paper
7113000	7115000	it's probably not
7115000	7117000	a game to really
7117000	7119000	look forward to big time
7119000	7121000	so alright
7121000	7123000	let's move on. DarkSaga
7123000	7125000	Do I gotta? Of course I do
7125000	7127000	well
7127000	7129000	this is something that
7129000	7131000	you know we've seen
7131000	7133000	the Kickstarter on it
7133000	7135000	was Mighty No. 9 well guess what
7135000	7137000	it is heading to the Wii U
7137000	7139000	it reached its
7139000	7141000	goal of 2.2 million on Kickstarter
7141000	7143000	which also means that it's going to be on
7143000	7145000	PS3, Xbox 360
7145000	7147000	as well as Wii U
7147000	7149000	there's still 14 days left on it
7149000	7151000	and if they hit 2.4 million by
7151000	7153000	October 1st it's going to have a challenge
7153000	7155000	mode I want to see it on PC
7155000	7157000	that'd be nice
7157000	7159000	but you know what
7159000	7161000	fuck it I want this game
7161000	7163000	I might who doesn't?
7163000	7165000	well I guess we found
7165000	7167000	out in the Fookle question the other week not everybody
7167000	7169000	does I suppose if it wasn't that
7169000	7171000	$20 could buy
7171000	7173000	me probably a week of food
7173000	7175000	I'd probably put the money on the game just saying
7175000	7177000	I thought they were releasing it on PC
7177000	7179000	I mean I don't know why
7179000	7181000	they are now
7181000	7183000	and they're doing that oh no yeah I'm sorry PC was
7183000	7185000	the original sorry PC was the original
7185000	7187000	and then the console was added which was
7187000	7189000	the 360 the Wii U they were doing it through Steam
7189000	7191000	that was it but now right
7191000	7193000	yeah but now the Playstation 4 is
7193000	7195000	the stretch goal or did they hit that too
7195000	7197000	see that it just says PS3
7197000	7199000	I don't know why I said PC
7199000	7201000	they just said
7201000	7203000	PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U
7203000	7205000	the next
7205000	7207000	goal is challenge mode
7207000	7209000	they are up to 2.4 million
7209000	7211000	so they just hit challenge mode they just hit that today
7211000	7213000	oh they did? they just hit it today
7213000	7215000	end stage boss
7215000	7217000	end stage boss is the next one they have to hit
7217000	7219000	if they can get all the way to 3.3 million
7219000	7221000	they'll be a Playstation 4 and Xbox One
7221000	7223000	version it could happen
7223000	7225000	they've got 8 days to go
7225000	7227000	so it's got to happen
7227000	7229000	pretty quick I kind of don't think it's going to make
7229000	7231000	the Playstation 4 and Xbox One
7231000	7233000	I think we'll be lucky if we get to this beck and call
7233000	7235000	online however
7235000	7237000	if it still sells enough copies
7237000	7239000	of it outside of their
7239000	7241000	Kickstarter true it could happen anyway
7241000	7243000	that's very true I mean it's coming out next year
7243000	7245000	it just might happen it might
7245000	7247000	we'll see
7247000	7249000	alright well let's
7249000	7251000	move on Loki a few more stories
7251000	7253000	here and then the mailbag
7253000	7255000	so with all this talk about next
7255000	7257000	gen stuff we've talked a little bit about
7257000	7259000	this whole upgrade program that they're supposed
7259000	7261000	to have for Xbox
7261000	7263000	One and Playstation 4 well here's
7263000	7265000	how it's going to work a little bit on the Playstation 4
7265000	7267000	to play a
7267000	7269000	digital Playstation 4 version
7269000	7271000	of an eligible retail
7271000	7273000	Playstation 3 game you have to redeem a
7273000	7275000	code that comes with the game
7275000	7277000	if you buy it on the Playstation store
7277000	7279000	so if you buy like say a digital copy
7279000	7281000	of you know battlefield
7281000	7283000	or something like that it
7283000	7285000	will automatically unlock
7285000	7287000	the game on Playstation 4
7287000	7289000	when you play it if
7289000	7291000	you happen to use that code to download
7291000	7293000	I think the digital version it will require you to still
7293000	7295000	have the disc and the drive and they're
7295000	7297000	saying that the next gen versions
7297000	7299000	of the games
7299000	7301000	will appear for like 10 bucks
7301000	7303000	I guess if you have that code as well
7305000	7307000	and then
7307000	7309000	one game though that isn't
7309000	7311000	going to require an additional fee to upgrade
7311000	7313000	it is Final Fantasy 14
7313000	7315000	you will get a free transfer
7315000	7317000	from Playstation 3 to Playstation 4
7317000	7319000	however it is a one time transfer
7319000	7321000	so once you've done it you lose rights to
7321000	7323000	your Playstation 3 game unless of course
7323000	7325000	you buy another copy that part was weird
7325000	7327000	to me because I don't understand you know in Final Fantasy 11
7327000	7329000	you had all of it
7329000	7331000	if you had like a 360 disc you could
7331000	7333000	sign on with your PC account
7333000	7335000	I mean granted you had to
7335000	7337000	people still got a code because they bought the game on
7337000	7339000	360 or whatever but it was just I don't know
7339000	7341000	it's kind of like you could do all of it
7341000	7343000	but yeah
7343000	7345000	well I'm
7345000	7347000	still excited at least that you know I'll have the
7347000	7349000	Playstation 4 version because I plan on getting a
7349000	7351000	Playstation 4 and it will be nice to have Final Fantasy 14
7351000	7353000	on it so why play it on
7353000	7355000	Playstation 3 when I have the Playstation 4
7355000	7357000	and that will be I don't understand why they I mean
7357000	7359000	it's not like you can
7359000	7361000	play the game
7361000	7363000	you know for free or something
7363000	7365000	like you can play on two systems
7365000	7367000	at the same time or something
7367000	7369000	we're running out of space on this TV to hook
7369000	7371000	in a new console so if we plug in a new console
7371000	7373000	something's getting moved to the bedroom
7373000	7375000	and so the thought is that obviously
7375000	7377000	like oh we're getting the Playstation 4 let's put the
7377000	7379000	Playstation 3 well technically
7379000	7381000	Alan has both consoles there on the
7381000	7383000	bedroom TV but we'll move the PS3
7383000	7385000	with all our save files on it to the bedroom
7385000	7387000	but I'm actually kind of thinking
7387000	7389000	the 360 might be the one to get
7389000	7391000	exiled to the bedroom
7391000	7393000	so we'll see I don't know
7393000	7395000	what the Wii U
7395000	7397000	I mean the Wii U you don't need that screen you can play
7397000	7399000	second screen you technically don't even need
7399000	7401000	it hooked up to anything honestly though I'm
7401000	7403000	playing more Wii U than I'm playing Xbox 360
7403000	7405000	these days truth
7405000	7407000	system selector
7407000	7409000	is that true facts? true facts
7409000	7411000	that reminds me I need to get on virtual
7411000	7413000	console and get Super Mario Brothers for a dollar
7413000	7415000	or whatever they're charging for it you know
7415000	7417000	what I probably have like five copies
7417000	7419000	of Super Mario Brothers but not on
7419000	7421000	two screens at the same time you know
7421000	7423000	what Rob you're spoiled
7423000	7425000	and she does if she has a
7425000	7427000	DS copy of the game or a 3DS
7427000	7429000	copy of a game true that's true which
7429000	7431000	I think I do true I don't
7431000	7433000	know what I have you know since we were talking
7433000	7435000	about NES memories and I
7435000	7437000	know I've told this story on the show many
7437000	7439000	times but I don't care I'm telling it again
7439000	7441000	one of my earliest memories
7441000	7443000	of Dark Sakura was when I
7443000	7445000	was when I went to her house that she
7445000	7447000	had with Dan out in a
7447000	7449000	city or part of town oh
7449000	7451000	the hood house I walked
7451000	7453000	in the house and Dan had
7453000	7455000	all these guys over all his guy friends
7455000	7457000	were over and there were TVs all
7457000	7459000	over the house every
7459000	7461000	single person was playing I
7461000	7463000	believe it was The Legend of Zelda
7463000	7465000	it was everybody was playing Zelda
7465000	7467000	with Nintendo so I took it to
7467000	7469000	TVs and I was like Jamie you've got
7469000	7471000	like 10 copies of
7471000	7473000	The Legend of Zelda all going at the same time
7473000	7475000	what the hell's going on here and she said
7475000	7477000	it's our land party it's our local area
7477000	7479000	Nintendo party they all started
7479000	7481000	Zelda at the same time and they're trying to see
7481000	7483000	who's gonna beat it first and Dan's currently in
7483000	7485000	the lead that's why I married him
7487000	7489000	you know they still do that right
7489000	7491000	or no you hadn't married him yet but he was you know
7491000	7493000	that's why it took us a while to get married but
7493000	7495000	you know he still does stuff like that
7495000	7497000	or he'll have Jeff over
7497000	7499000	and they'll take turns
7499000	7501000	playing through a game just to see how
7501000	7503000	they can speed run it together now that
7503000	7505000	is Nintendo gaming on
7505000	7507000	two screens at once or in that case
7507000	7509000	god there was literally there's like a TV
7509000	7511000	on the dining room table a TV in the living
7511000	7513000	room a TV in the back room
7513000	7515000	like any place they could put a fucking
7515000	7517000	TV with Nintendo it was
7517000	7519000	in that house I'm like your electric
7519000	7521000	bill must be scary that was back when we
7521000	7523000	were happy to have our 60 megahertz processor
7523000	7525000	computer well yeah it was
7525000	7527000	over 10 years it was before OLR started
7527000	7529000	it was a while ago and there was his
7529000	7531000	friend that had the PC
7531000	7533000	built into a old metal
7533000	7535000	toolbox nice that was pretty cool
7535000	7537000	yeah that was that was pretty
7537000	7539000	fun all right anyhow
7539000	7541000	sorry to digress there a little bit
7541000	7543000	but let's talk about let's talk about a
7543000	7545000	classic game of sorts from
7545000	7547000	another day here at Orange Laundry
7547000	7549000	we used to talk about a lot pop
7549000	7551000	in music remember pop in music
7551000	7553000	if you haven't seen this game
7553000	7555000	you know you know the board game
7555000	7557000	trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble right
7557000	7559000	imagine a music
7559000	7561000	game controlled with nine of those
7561000	7563000	pop-o-matic bubbles that is what pop in music
7563000	7565000	basically is and
7565000	7567000	you might have seen this like it sometimes shows up in
7567000	7569000	like if see Japanese arcades like there's a very
7569000	7571000	famous scene in Lost in Translation that movie
7571000	7573000	with Bill Murray that had pop
7573000	7575000	in music in it I did that a couple weeks ago
7575000	7577000	so yeah pop in music
7577000	7579000	out there and it is coming to iOS
7579000	7581000	that is the news
7581000	7583000	Konami has announced an iOS version
7583000	7585000	of pop in music we don't know much more than that
7585000	7587000	we're all just kind of crossing our
7587000	7589000	fingers and our toes that it's not based
7589000	7591000	off the Nintendo Wii U version
7591000	7593000	and that it is far better
7593000	7595000	than beat and groovy on the 360
7595000	7597000	which was I want pop in music
7597000	7599000	I want pop in music
7599000	7601000	I hope it's good I hope it has the Goonies
7601000	7603000	theme in it that's one game I will not get rid of
7603000	7605000	I had so much fun because you know what I played
7605000	7607000	it was pop in music what's the last one
7607000	7609000	Party I got to play
7609000	7611000	the gachamon theme and I was
7611000	7613000	singing along with it and the lady
7613000	7615000	running the place was like we're giving
7615000	7617000	me a look because I knew the lyrics
7617000	7619000	hey shut up I like gachamon
7619000	7621000	I remember there was
7621000	7623000	a pop in music machine that was all anime
7623000	7625000	music and they used to have it on arcade infinity
7625000	7627000	yeah arcade infinity had that and then
7627000	7629000	I was playing cat's eye
7629000	7631000	yeah nice
7631000	7633000	that's right I forgot that there were
7633000	7635000	licensed songs in pop in music at one point
7635000	7637000	yeah it was really fun
7637000	7639000	and oh the Yamato theme
7639000	7641000	song
7641000	7643000	well it came out over here
7643000	7645000	wasn't the star trek theme in there
7645000	7647000	randomly too? I think it was
7647000	7649000	everything's been in that game
7649000	7651000	everything's been in that game but I freaking love pop
7651000	7653000	in music
7653000	7655000	just traveling back
7655000	7657000	through the past and so forth
7657000	7659000	I could do pop in music as a classic
7659000	7661000	you could yeah I could
7661000	7663000	but will I? I don't know I did DDR
7663000	7665000	wait till we get to episode 573
7665000	7667000	you need to hold off a little bit
7667000	7669000	maybe alright
7669000	7671000	let's see if our
7671000	7673000	emailers take us to memory lane this week

7699000	7701000	priorities, priorities
7701000	7703000	dark soccer can I still cut a bitch?
7703000	7705000	of course mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
7705000	7707000	well this person is not a bitch
7707000	7709000	so it's uh
7709000	7711000	it's not exactly about games
7711000	7713000	but it's up our alley Rob definitely up our
7713000	7715000	alley hey OLR crew
7715000	7717000	AZHP here I have a question that's not
7717000	7719000	quite gaming related but that I
7719000	7721000	know is not allowed
7721000	7723000	hey hush you
7723000	7725000	but I know is a topic near and dear
7725000	7727000	to many of the OLR hosts heart
7727000	7729000	many as in two of us
7729000	7731000	you're not so into the Disney
7731000	7733000	land no
7733000	7735000	okay
7735000	7737000	but it's not like you hate Disneyland no I don't hate
7737000	7739000	Disneyland I'm talking of course about
7739000	7741000	Disneyland I am thinking
7741000	7743000	of taking my girlfriend to Disneyland for
7743000	7745000	anniversary in late November do it
7745000	7747000	I was wondering if you guys had
7747000	7749000	any recommendation for how many days we should spend
7749000	7751000	one or two two and whether or not
7751000	7753000	we should get a park cop or pass or just go
7753000	7755000	in one of the parks get to
7755000	7757000	get your park
7757000	7759000	offer trust me because yeah
7759000	7761000	get it and which
7761000	7763000	park is better in your opinion is
7763000	7765000	quote better
7765000	7767000	the main park if you have
7767000	7769000	to pick one but California
7769000	7771000	adventure has tons of fun stuff and the good thing
7771000	7773000	is that when one side is
7773000	7775000	busier usually the other side is a
7775000	7777000	lot less busy and you can drink in California
7777000	7779000	adventure which sometimes you need
7779000	7781000	to get through the other park
7781000	7783000	my honest my honest advice
7783000	7785000	if your girlfriend's never been to Disneyland is that
7785000	7787000	did I catch that in the email that the girlfriend had never
7787000	7789000	been or hadn't been in a long time it doesn't say
7789000	7791000	if either of you have not been to Disneyland
7791000	7793000	in a very long time or
7793000	7795000	you know you've never been
7795000	7797000	take the two days to go so
7797000	7799000	that way you can spend one day in each
7799000	7801000	park type of thing Disney does have a deal
7801000	7803000	it's not a park hopper per se but it's one
7803000	7805000	day one park for like two days
7805000	7807000	you know but again just kind of
7807000	7809000	I think the park hoppers are a little better for what
7809000	7811000	Jamie said you can hop literally hop from one
7811000	7813000	park to the other but don't forget the California
7813000	7815000	adventure ever since they finished their
7815000	7817000	remodel with Cars Land
7817000	7819000	and you know redoing some of the rides
7819000	7821000	it is a premium it's not a joke
7821000	7823000	anymore it's a premier park it's a
7823000	7825000	fun place to go you can spend an entire
7825000	7827000	day there easy the next thing in the email takes
7827000	7829000	me to that point we are from San Francisco
7829000	7831000	so the draw of an authentic northern California
7831000	7833000	experience from Disney's California adventure is not
7833000	7835000	a factor for us they're changing it well
7835000	7837000	that's gone yeah don't worry about it because
7837000	7839000	that I mean well like they have a
7839000	7841000	Ghirardelli shop in the wharf area
7841000	7843000	but I mean they completely change like the thing to

7851000	7853000	world's largest ceramic mural
7853000	7855000	the Whoopi Goldberg movie is gone

7873000	7875000	no you should be used to that
7875000	7877000	back and forward motion just

7879000	7881000	isn't it let's keep going with the email
7881000	7883000	la la la la la
7883000	7885000	and I like the one roller coaster
7885000	7887000	that's in the dark and stuff oh there's a lot of
7887000	7889000	easy ways to practice I mean
7889000	7891000	you know what
7891000	7893000	anyway I'd like to hear the host's thoughts
7893000	7895000	and recommendation tell your girlfriend
7895000	7897000	she might need to practice
7897000	7899000	only if she's in to reach around
7901000	7903000	stand across the room this poor emailer
7903000	7905000	was not anyway I'd like
7905000	7907000	to hear the host's thoughts and recommendations so I can
7907000	7909000	start budgeting and planning this thanks and
7909000	7911000	keep up the great work yours truly
7911000	7913000	AZHP
7913000	7915000	yes we actually
7915000	7917000	I took Dan to see Aladdin
7917000	7919000	and I saw Bobby saying that you
7919000	7921000	took him to see I did when we went
7921000	7923000	after E3 I took Dan
7923000	7925000	and I went to see Aladdin and we sat next to an
7925000	7927000	Australian guy and his son and his son
7927000	7929000	was so adorable but we kept chatting with the guy and
7929000	7931000	told him places to eat and that type of thing
7931000	7933000	see Bobby and I did both
7933000	7935000	parks in one day but he's been before
7935000	7937000	and there's a lot of things that Bobby's
7937000	7939000	like I don't need to do that
7939000	7941000	I don't need to do that like Bobby didn't want to do
7941000	7943000	like the upside down roller coaster
7943000	7945000	you know there's certain things on his list
7945000	7947000	so there wasn't an upside down one
7947000	7949000	at California Adventure there is oh yeah
7949000	7951000	California but it's not even that bad
7951000	7953000	it's so smooth
7953000	7955000	my other suggestion would be if you and your girlfriend
7955000	7957000	can kind of put out a list and you kind of find that
7957000	7959000	you know there's
7959000	7961000	some rides we don't really want to do
7961000	7963000	maybe you can do them both in a day
7963000	7965000	but I would say take the time to take it slow
7965000	7967000	if you want to make it
7967000	7969000	really romantic dude
7969000	7971000	get some reservations at Carthay Circle
7971000	7973000	or Blue Bayou
7973000	7975000	I think Carthay Circle is
7975000	7977000	really good
7977000	7979000	the food's really good
7979000	7981000	Blue Bayou is a classic you have to kind of decide
7981000	7983000	if you really want to get laid do both
7983000	7985000	well you know
7985000	7987000	I typically do Blue Bayou when I'm there for my birthday
7987000	7989000	and lunch is cheaper and still
7989000	7991000	romantic
7991000	7993000	yeah and you get free desserts if it's your birthday
7993000	7995000	at any rate
7995000	7997000	actually
7997000	7999000	this is what you should do
7999000	8001000	get dessert reservations
8001000	8003000	for Fantasmic
8003000	8005000	have you ever done that?
8005000	8007000	not for Fantasmic I've done World of Color dinners
8007000	8009000	but for Fantasmic you basically have a big dessert bar
8009000	8011000	and you get to sit
8011000	8013000	and getting to sit during Fantasmic
8013000	8015000	is the best part
8015000	8017000	but you get like
8017000	8019000	really good ice cream desserts
8019000	8021000	and cake and stuff
8021000	8023000	I went with Kristin and Megzy for that
8023000	8025000	and it was fun
8025000	8027000	alright we could have a Disneyland podcast but we better move on to the next email
8027000	8029000	just talk to us later trust me
8029000	8031000	SSJ100Matt in chat says
8031000	8033000	OLR helping you get laid for
8033000	8035000	520 episodes and counting
8035000	8037000	last email
8037000	8039000	greetings OLR
8039000	8041000	I decided to send you guys an email
8041000	8043000	since you have been getting very few recently
8043000	8045000	I'm a long time listener and a second time emailer
8045000	8047000	I wanted to share my thoughts
8047000	8049000	on Grand Theft Auto 5 and the PS3
8049000	8051000	with you the game looks great and I have enjoyed
8051000	8053000	the past games ever since GTA 1
8053000	8055000	on the PC however I don't own
8055000	8057000	a PS3 or Xbox 360
8057000	8059000	so I cannot currently play Grand Theft Auto 5
8059000	8061000	with the recent price drop of the PS3
8061000	8063000	I am tempted to pick up one
8063000	8065000	and it's 199 euro
8065000	8067000	the one with the 12 gigabyte
8067000	8069000	and flash storage but I am not
8069000	8071000	sure if this is a wise purchase
8071000	8073000	with the new consoles coming out the system is
8073000	8075000	dying and money is tight as I'm
8075000	8077000	saving it for a new PC for work
8077000	8079000	do you think it is worth
8079000	8081000	waiting for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5
8081000	8083000	is there any indication
8083000	8085000	that this time around there won't be a PC
8085000	8087000	version they've already seen coding for the PC
8087000	8089000	I think there's going to be a PC version it's just
8089000	8091000	not going to be right now
8091000	8093000	on top of that you won't have to worry about graphics
8093000	8095000	since you're saving up for a new PC right
8095000	8097000	it would be
8097000	8099000	interesting to hear your thoughts on the purchase of a console
8099000	8101000	near the end of its life cycle but with new machines
8101000	8103000	on the horizon is it still worth
8103000	8105000	it because it is a blu ray player
8105000	8107000	and does Netflix and all that
8107000	8109000	I mean yeah it's fairly cheap
8109000	8111000	I mean it depends on what
8111000	8113000	your needs are you know you can build a PC
8113000	8115000	that has a blu ray player in it too and does Netflix
8115000	8117000	we have a PC hooked up to our
8117000	8119000	TV right now at my house
8119000	8121000	the only thing that we do not do
8121000	8123000	on that thing is watch blu rays
8123000	8125000	which we use our PS3 for
8125000	8127000	so it's just a matter
8127000	8129000	and you might even find system refurbs
8129000	8131000	that are even cheaper
8131000	8133000	so you'd have to check
8133000	8135000	I'm not sure that you've got craigslist
8135000	8137000	but I'm sure that you've got
8137000	8139000	thrift stores and the equivalent
8139000	8141000	of flea markets
8141000	8143000	places like that
8143000	8145000	so you might even look into finding one
8145000	8147000	at any other place
8147000	8149000	I would say too don't forget that this generation
8149000	8151000	of consoles will not be backwards compatible
8151000	8153000	with the upcoming
8153000	8155000	you know what I mean the PS4 will not play
8155000	8157000	PS3 games and the Xbox One will not play
8157000	8159000	360 games I know there's
8159000	8161000	the Gaikai rumblings out there and so forth
8161000	8163000	but we haven't really seen that gel together yet
8163000	8165000	we don't know what that's going to look like right now
8165000	8167000	so you know something to consider
8167000	8169000	if there are a lot of console games you do want to play
8169000	8171000	out of this generation then go ahead and take the plunge
8171000	8173000	and get one of the consoles because
8173000	8175000	this is your chance although PC
8175000	8177000	certainly there's a lot on
8177000	8179000	you know of the stuff on PC I think you really
8179000	8181000	have to evaluate where are the
8181000	8183000	games I want to play
8183000	8185000	and I think in that it's okay to assume
8185000	8187000	in that case I will be able to play Grand Theft Auto
8187000	8189000	5 on PC in a year
8189000	8191000	can you wait an entire year?
8191000	8193000	I'm almost certain it's going to be less
8193000	8195000	than that but
8195000	8197000	we'll see
8197000	8199000	I guess it does come down
8199000	8201000	to in the end how badly do you want it
8201000	8203000	and how quickly can you recover the
8203000	8205000	money that you spend on it
8205000	8207000	me personally
8207000	8209000	if something was coming out
8209000	8211000	well you know what I'm not actually going to
8211000	8213000	say that I've done it
8213000	8215000	I got a 3DS
8215000	8217000	because I wanted to fucking play Animal Crossing
8217000	8219000	and what did I do?
8219000	8221000	I asked around on the internet
8221000	8223000	if anyone was selling their 3DS
8223000	8225000	and lo and behold
8225000	8227000	uh, sidekick was
8227000	8229000	and so I
8229000	8231000	bought his for two
8231000	8233000	shout out for gamebooey.org
8233000	8235000	two network cards
8235000	8237000	and then we went right out and bought Animal Crossing
8237000	8239000	and then Dan picked up
8239000	8241000	the last
8241000	8243000	fire emblem for the Wii
8243000	8245000	so
8245000	8247000	I'm not one to talk
8247000	8249000	freaking buy it
8249000	8251000	you really do
8251000	8253000	have to weigh out how badly
8253000	8255000	do you want it and I'll tell you this
8255000	8257000	I've played Animal Crossing every day
8257000	8259000	since I bought it
8259000	8261000	which is saying something for me playing
8261000	8263000	a game every day
8263000	8265000	so if you're going to play Grand Theft Auto 5
8265000	8267000	every day then you know
8267000	8269000	it's probably a worthwhile purchase
8269000	8271000	um
8271000	8273000	and yeah you do get the benefit
8273000	8275000	of a blu-ray player it's probably still a cheaper
8275000	8277000	blu-ray player I think when Becky bought
8277000	8279000	hers, my best friend
8279000	8281000	when she bought her actual
8281000	8283000	dedicated blu-ray player
8283000	8285000	it cost her about maybe
8285000	8287000	150 something
8287000	8289000	dollars which would
8289000	8291000	probably be less in euros
8291000	8293000	but it only plays blu-rays and you're
8293000	8295000	getting a game system out of it that does Netflix
8295000	8297000	and does all this other stuff
8297000	8299000	and like Rob said there's no backwards compatibility
8299000	8301000	so
8301000	8303000	weigh that and decide what you will
8303000	8305000	so to continue with the
8305000	8307000	end of this email
8307000	8309000	I love listening to this show on my commute to work keep it up
8309000	8311000	thank you

8343000	8345000	Europe we could go talk
8345000	8347000	to our official Swede

8395000	8397000	will only get angstier
8397000	8399000	FUs of the week
8401000	8415000	I'm fairly pissy Rob
8415000	8417000	why? cause of stuff
8417000	8419000	ok so I have a list
8419000	8421000	fuck you to my air conditioner
8421000	8423000	because when I turn on the air conditioner
8423000	8425000	I don't want a face full of the inferno
8425000	8427000	I want a face full of cold
8427000	8429000	thankfully it's cool enough outside
8429000	8431000	FU I'm not gonna say FU
8431000	8433000	because the rain made today a lot nicer
8433000	8435000	but it rained for Sacramento
8435000	8437000	for this time of year
8437000	8439000	and we're going into our rainy season
8439000	8441000	but it freaking rained and I was at Apple Hill
8441000	8443000	I was trying to enjoy myself
8443000	8445000	instead I'm having to slog up
8445000	8447000	a red muddy hill
8447000	8449000	and then
8449000	8451000	I thought I was taking a picture
8451000	8453000	of a pig's cute little tail
8453000	8455000	no I took a picture of a pig taking a piss
8455000	8457000	it's on my tumbler for any reason
8457000	8459000	also FU to
8459000	8461000	guys who want their woman to take care of them
8461000	8463000	and not do anything to contribute
8463000	8465000	of course FU to the other way around
8465000	8467000	it takes an equal fucking partnership
8467000	8469000	it takes two to make a thing
8469000	8471000	go right
8471000	8473000	well true
8473000	8475000	if you are in a relationship
8475000	8477000	don't expect a free ride
8477000	8479000	do your fucking part
8479000	8481000	I'm not gonna say FU
8481000	8483000	I'm gonna say FU
8483000	8485000	I'm gonna say FU
8485000	8487000	if you are in a relationship
8487000	8489000	don't expect a free ride
8489000	8491000	do your fucking part
8491000	8493000	okay
8493000	8495000	it takes two to make it out of sight
8495000	8497000	just
8497000	8499000	FU to my throat hurting
8499000	8501000	I hate that
8501000	8503000	that's annoying
8503000	8505000	my FU of the week
8505000	8507000	goes to
8507000	8509000	Thunder Valley Casino
8509000	8511000	in Lincoln California
8511000	8513000	fuck them
8513000	8515000	and one of their machines ate it whole
8515000	8517000	but here was the best part
8517000	8519000	I took my mother to go see Kathy Griffin
8519000	8521000	at Thunder Valley Casino because my mom
8521000	8523000	loves Kathy Griffin
8523000	8525000	by the way FU to Kathy Griffin sorry honey
8525000	8527000	you just weren't that funny
8527000	8529000	like you're funnier in your bravo specials
8529000	8531000	I could tell we were being workshopped
8531000	8533000	sorry hun just wasn't working for me
8533000	8535000	you know the one time I saw George Carlin
8535000	8537000	was on one of his workshops too
8537000	8539000	I've seen Margaret Cho on a workshop tour
8539000	8541000	and it was like half and half you know
8541000	8543000	so where was I
8543000	8545000	oh yes my mom loves Kathy Griffin right
8545000	8547000	so I want to take my mom out to something she enjoys
8547000	8549000	and she gave me $20
8549000	8551000	because she's like I want to help pay for the ticket
8551000	8553000	even though the ticket was like $70
8553000	8555000	so I want to help pay for the ticket I'm like okay
8555000	8557000	so I took her $20 put it in a slot machine
8557000	8559000	right in front of her
8559000	8561000	and I was like your $20 is gone
8561000	8563000	mom she's like Rob
8563000	8567000	that's why you don't gamble Rob
8567000	8569000	you should know better than to gamble
8569000	8571000	you know what though I'm very sad
8571000	8573000	that the buffet wasn't open for you guys
8573000	8575000	it was open it was just very crowded
8575000	8577000	the buffet there
8577000	8579000	and for me who's not a huge buffet fan
8579000	8581000	their buffet is fucking good
8581000	8583000	but the coffee shop was good too
8583000	8585000	Alan took a picture of that burger
8585000	8587000	and you know they do have fatburger there
8587000	8590000	but my mom didn't want to go to fatburger
8590000	8592000	my mom wanted to go
8592000	8594000	and you know Rob
8594000	8597000	I don't want to eat at the buffet Rob
8598000	8602000	people just cough and sneeze on everything
8602000	8604000	that's how you get sick
8604000	8606000	buffets give you diarrhea Rob
8608000	8610000	I adore your mom you know
8610000	8612000	and your impersonation is hilarious
8612000	8615000	did you see the vine I posted of my mom
8615000	8617000	I had to delete the tweet
8617000	8621000	Rob I didn't say you could put that on the internet Rob
8621000	8623000	put it on tumblr
8623000	8626000	she didn't say I couldn't play it on my show though
8627000	8629000	I'll have to bring that up
8629000	8631000	I'll bring that up later
8631000	8633000	let's do a news story
8633000	8635000	and then I'll come back to this topic
8635000	8637000	let's talk about the ever
8637000	8639000	continuing saga
8639000	8642000	and the Ouya Frida Games program
8642000	8646000	well Ouya has removed one of the games
8646000	8648000	from the Frida Games program
8648000	8650000	and that would have been the one that was
8650000	8653000	Dungeons the Eye of Drakonas
8653000	8655000	you know the one that they
8655000	8658000	blatantly admitted that their family paid for
8658000	8660000	you know the back
8660000	8662000	or the backing of that kickstarter
8662000	8664000	so they have been removed
8664000	8667000	and you know they of course
8667000	8670000	saying oh appears we were thrown under the Frida Games bus
8670000	8674000	Ouya gets their fall guy and Gridiron keeps their money
8674000	8676000	but the thing was though
8676000	8678000	Gridiron I don't believe
8680000	8683000	I believe they dropped out of the whole Frida Games thing
8683000	8686000	they said they cancelled the kickstarter project
8688000	8691000	or yeah they have no plans to develop
8691000	8694000	I guess on the Ouya or something like that
8697000	8700000	because I remember they said they made a ton of
8700000	8702000	they got a ton of backers as it was
8702000	8704000	so they didn't need to develop exclusively on the Ouya anymore
8704000	8706000	and also on top of this
8706000	8709000	the whole Frida Games fund has been tweaked
8709000	8711000	now no longer will
8711000	8713000	the games have to be
8713000	8715000	Ouya exclusive
8715000	8717000	instead
8717000	8721000	they are saying for every $10,000 in rewards issued by Ouya
8721000	8724000	in matching crowd funding efforts
8724000	8726000	developers will need to agree
8726000	8728000	in one month of exclusivity
8729000	8733000	but they could still publish on PC at the same time
8733000	8736000	so they don't have to just launch on the Ouya
8737000	8742000	and then also they are saying that instead of $50,000 as a minimum
8742000	8745000	the requirement is now $10,000
8745000	8749000	so $10,000 and then for every $10,000 raised after that
8749000	8751000	they will be backed
8751000	8753000	another $10,000 I guess
8753000	8757000	and they also have to have a minimum of 100 backers to be eligible
8759000	8761000	is this going to fix the problem
8761000	8765000	that this thing has been having or is this too little too late
8765000	8767000	I think it's too little too late
8767000	8770000	and at the same time I still think people will try to game it
8770000	8772000	I mean because
8772000	8775000	you know the gridiron thunder thing
8775000	8778000	I don't think the whole reason that they are saying
8778000	8781000	oh we need funding to finish this game
8781000	8785000	but the game is literally coming out in like two weeks after it's done
8785000	8788000	I'm sorry I just don't buy for
8788000	8791000	oh we need that $100,000 to finish the game in two weeks
8791000	8794000	I could see like a game that's coming out like
8794000	8796000	a year from now or something
8796000	8798000	ok then you need the funding
8798000	8801000	but if a game that's already pretty much done
8801000	8803000	and they are just putting it out two weeks later
8803000	8805000	I think it was just to make up some money
8805000	8808000	ok we have this really shitty game we made
8808000	8810000	it's going to be an exclusive the Ouya
8810000	8812000	but who gives a shit because we made our money back anyways
8812000	8815000	from them matching our funding
8815000	8817000	so I think that's what the scam was there
8817000	8819000	and I still think that you can see that
8820000	8822000	someone has a game that's ready to go
8822000	8824000	and why not let's put it on Kickstarter
8824000	8826000	put the goal at $10,000
8826000	8828000	and if they can hit it
8828000	8830000	they make another $10,000 on top of it
8830000	8832000	and it could be a good game
8832000	8834000	at the same time I think it could help indie guys
8834000	8837000	but it's been exploited three times already
8837000	8839000	so you know
8839000	8841000	I don't know
8841000	8844000	I noticed that you are selling your Ouya on eBay
8844000	8846000	at this point and do you want to give a quick plug
8846000	8848000	how somebody can get a hold of that
8849000	8851000	you can follow me on Twitter
8851000	8854000	it's just on eBay
8854000	8856000	$32 right now
8856000	8858000	yeah BlackWolf points that out in our chatroom
8858000	8860000	at live.vognetwork.com
8860000	8862000	Loki's Ouya is only $32 on eBay right now
8862000	8864000	and $32 with a
8864000	8866000	there's still the unused code
8866000	8868000	remember they did that stupid thing
8868000	8870000	you're our elite
8870000	8872000	you Kickstarter backers and we're going to give you
8872000	8874000	$13.37
8874000	8876000	store credit on the Ouya shop
8876000	8878000	but they didn't use that store credit
8878000	8880000	so that code is in there
8880000	8882000	so really it can track about $13 off that
8882000	8884000	so it's still a pretty good deal
8884000	8886000	and it works
8886000	8888000	once again
8888000	8890000	I don't have time for all this stuff
8890000	8892000	and I need to slim down
8892000	8894000	you know
8894000	8896000	money is tight of course
8896000	8898000	it happens
8898000	8900000	especially this time of year
8900000	8902000	alright can we go back to stories about my mom
8902000	8904000	alright so we're at the Kathy Griffin concert
8904000	8906000	and they're playing pop music
8906000	8908000	and my mom doesn't listen to pop music right
8908000	8910000	so she hears this song
8910000	8912000	by Will.I.Am and Britney Spears
8912000	8914000	have you heard this song?
8914000	8916000	this is what's playing
8916000	8918000	my mom hears this
8924000	8926000	so my mom can hear this
8926000	8928000	in the lyrics and she's looking at me
8928000	8930000	because Alan's sitting in between us
8930000	8932000	she leans over and she looks at me
8932000	8934000	and she gives me that look
8934000	8936000	Rob, what is this song Rob?
8936000	8938000	like you wrote the song?
8938000	8940000	like I wrote the song
8940000	8942000	and then there's a later part in the song
8942000	8944000	where it goes
8944000	8946000	you are now now
8946000	8948000	it's this part
8952000	8954000	oh shit
8954000	8956000	live radio
8956000	8958000	just play the part
8962000	8964000	and when that came up
8964000	8966000	my mom looked at me and goes
8966000	8968000	Rob did Britney Spears just call herself
8968000	8970000	a bitch?
8970000	8972000	I think that was Britney comma bitch
8972000	8974000	if it works like a duck
8974000	8976000	right? so I decided
8976000	8978000	so what do you do? you have to capture the moment live
8978000	8980000	so I whip out my cell phone
8980000	8982000	and I make a vine
8982000	8984000	what do you think of this song?
8984000	8986000	I think Britney Spears is a skank
8986000	8988000	what's vine?
8988000	8990000	oh you don't know vine?
8990000	8992000	it's like twitter but with videos
8992000	8994000	you can only do 6 second videos
8994000	8996000	and they loop
8996000	8998000	so that's the vine I made
8998000	9000000	is my mom's opinion
9000000	9002000	on will.i.am and Britney bitch
9002000	9004000	what do you think of this song?
9004000	9006000	I think Britney Spears is a skank
9006000	9008000	if she knew I was playing that on the internet
9008000	9010000	right now she would kill me
9010000	9012000	she was so pissed that I uploaded that to twitter
9012000	9014000	she was so mad
9014000	9016000	she was so mad
9016000	9018000	that I uploaded that to twitter
9018000	9020000	no this was literally her concern
9020000	9022000	Rob
9022000	9024000	I don't want Britney Spears to see that
9024000	9026000	like Britney follows
9026000	9028000	like Britney follows my mom
9028000	9030000	I'm like Britney doesn't follow you
9030000	9032000	well one of her friends
9032000	9034000	might tell her
9034000	9036000	I think that she's been called worse
9036000	9038000	right?
9038000	9040000	and let's be real
9040000	9042000	she is kind of a skank
9042000	9044000	but she is entitled to be a skank
9044000	9046000	if she chooses that
9046000	9048000	it is her choice as a woman to be a skank
9048000	9050000	to be free with her love
9050000	9052000	she's also a mother
9054000	9056000	and that's what feminism is all about
9056000	9058000	the right to make choices
9058000	9060000	and not be judged by the man
9060000	9062000	or whatever
9062000	9064000	I wish I could show my mom
9064000	9066000	all the love she's getting in chat right now
9066000	9068000	Act F says love Rob's mom
9068000	9070000	gamer girl says hahaha
9070000	9072000	Rob's mom rocks
9072000	9074000	she does rock
9074000	9076000	I hope we can get her on the show in the future
9076000	9078000	I adore your mom
9078000	9080000	but I don't think your mom and my mom should ever be in the same room
9080000	9082000	no they should not
9082000	9084000	especially when my mom's on one of her pissy rants
9084000	9086000	alright
9086000	9088000	one more story tonight
9088000	9090000	and then we're going to open up the skype line
9090000	9092000	at 1877 game OLR
9092000	9094000	or our username on skype orange lounge radio
9094000	9096000	and this last story has to do about a game
9096000	9098000	I don't think we've talked about this a lot on OLR
9098000	9100000	but I know a lot of you guys have played this
9100000	9102000	here too
9102000	9104000	it's called slender the arrival
9104000	9106000	have you played slender man at all?
9106000	9108000	you may have seen my livestream
9108000	9110000	I did on twitch right
9110000	9112000	I remember them in super mario galaxy
9112000	9114000	no no no no no
9114000	9116000	this game is scary as hell
9116000	9118000	and I literally screamed
9118000	9120000	while playing this game
9120000	9122000	actually I think slender the arrival is the sequel
9122000	9124000	that has whatever
9124000	9126000	well here's the thing guys
9126000	9128000	it's about to get support officially
9128000	9130000	for the oculus rift
9130000	9132000	as if the game wasn't
9132000	9134000	scary enough
9134000	9136000	now you can immerse yourself in the world
9136000	9138000	and become best friends with the fence like I did
9138000	9140000	in slender the arrival
9140000	9142000	yep it is
9142000	9144000	officially getting oculus rift support
9144000	9146000	apparently this was actually teased at pax 2013
9146000	9148000	but this is something that is actually happening
9148000	9150000	in a patch
9150000	9152000	that just came out for the game
9152000	9154000	it's like a beta mode there
9154000	9156000	good luck with that
9156000	9158000	so all I'm hoping is that maybe bobby
9158000	9160000	maybe in a years time bobby
9160000	9162000	will be a little more willing to
9162000	9164000	subject his oculus rift to
9164000	9166000	some other things
9166000	9168000	so before I have the gummy bears
9168000	9170000	maybe I can play a little slender man in oculus rift
9170000	9172000	I'm still waiting he got a youtube of me playing
9172000	9174000	the oculus rift
9174000	9176000	and I'm sure it's funny
9176000	9178000	fifth dream
9178000	9180000	to my bff friends
9180000	9182000	it wasn't me it was my mom

9293000	9295000	game show 2013
9295000	9297000	telling people I meet in line about

9319000	9321000	let's see
9321000	9323000	act deft sends us a tweet
9323000	9325000	developer way forward
9325000	9327000	wants to make a my little pony game
9327000	9329000	and rallies bronies

9335000	9337000	what they made contra 4
9337000	9339000	some of their games have been a little hit and miss
9339000	9341000	but more so probably hits than misses
9341000	9343000	talk to act division because I think they're the one that has a hasbro license
9343000	9345000	do they?
9345000	9347000	least they do for transformers
9347000	9349000	and they

9351000	9353000	stuff or was that no no it was like characters
9353000	9355000	made by the same person
9355000	9357000	it wasn't skull girls it was that
9357000	9359000	the fighting is magic thing
9359000	9361000	where they now it's something different
9361000	9363000	yeah
9363000	9365000	I don't remember who has like the family party
9365000	9367000	games now because it used to be
9367000	9369000	I thought it was act division
9369000	9371000	then it was or EA
9371000	9373000	and now it's Ubisoft
9373000	9375000	maybe I don't know that keeps getting tossed around
9375000	9377000	wow I've never seen quite a
9377000	9379000	more polarizing tweet in our chat room
9379000	9381000	blackwool says don't do it way forward
9381000	9383000	spend your time on better projects
9383000	9385000	and rama says fuck yes way forward
9385000	9387000	it will happen mark my words
9387000	9389000	and act dev says game loft
9389000	9391000	has the mlp game
9391000	9393000	you know what
9393000	9395000	if they can make
9395000	9397000	mick kids they can make
9397000	9399000	a fucking my little pony game I don't even care
9399000	9401000	I don't care there's been a my little
9401000	9403000	pony game and I think it was on the Nintendo
9403000	9405000	back in the day and it was the good
9405000	9407000	my little pony the kind I
9407000	9409000	I grew up with so fuck it
9409000	9411000	if they can make sneak king
9411000	9413000	you go ahead with your bad self and make my pony
9413000	9415000	where the fuck are my goddamn new 360
9415000	9417000	connect games for burger king
9417000	9419000	seriously that was promised to me like
9419000	9421000	five years no not five years ago but like
9421000	9423000	a few years ago
9423000	9425000	I'm very disappointed that there's not a follow up
9425000	9427000	to sneak king because that was a fucking
9427000	9429000	brilliant shit right there
9429000	9431000	all right uh tiger claw says it's an
9431000	9433000	interesting tweet uh Lucasfilm
9433000	9435000	will combine video games and movies
9435000	9437000	to act the post production
9437000	9439000	process kind of
9439000	9441000	interesting there I'm kind of reading
9441000	9443000	into this too it's uh coming from
9443000	9445000	a website he links us to the enquirer
9445000	9447000	not to be confused with the trash you see at the
9447000	9449000	checkout counter uh but this
9449000	9451000	says video game engines will be
9451000	9453000	used in filmmaking with the two disciplines
9453000	9455000	combining to eliminate the
9455000	9457000	movie post production process
9457000	9459000	well this actually kind of makes sense you
9459000	9461000	know video games are getting so realistic
9461000	9463000	these days that I'm sure
9463000	9465000	they can probably mix in
9465000	9467000	you know some of the stuff
9467000	9469000	they do with movies like in the engines
9469000	9471000	really kind of ramp up the process
9471000	9473000	with uh making some of this that'd be fun
9473000	9475000	like you can move characters around
9475000	9477000	in the movie and stuff interactive
9477000	9479000	movies it's like using
9479000	9481000	the force for real uh tiger claw
9481000	9483000	also sends his tweet the playstation 4
9483000	9485000	exclusive deep down
9485000	9487000	set to be free to play
9487000	9489000	or wouldn't it be even funnier if you could
9489000	9491000	reskin the characters that are in the movie
9491000	9493000	or something like that anything's possible
9493000	9495000	I want Jar Jar to look stupider
9495000	9497000	uh more stupid
9497000	9499000	quickly before I go to the phones capcom
9499000	9501000	announced to Tokyo game show 2013 that the
9501000	9503000	playstation 4 exclusive deep down will be
9503000	9505000	free to play uh you might remember
9505000	9507000	this had come out at uh what was it E3
9507000	9509000	or something they were showing that off so that's kind of
9509000	9511000	surprising yeah so very cool
9511000	9513000	uh more on that in a minute but first we're gonna go to
9513000	9515000	the phone lines and take a call hi you're on
9515000	9517000	Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey
9517000	9519000	this is Agdeft. Hey Agdeft how you doing?
9519000	9521000	pretty good despite uh
9521000	9523000	people hating on the MLP game
9523000	9525000	but okay I know it's
9525000	9527000	it's tough to be a brony
9527000	9529000	yeah yeah well I'm not gonna
9529000	9531000	talk about that I wanna talk about another thing
9531000	9533000	alright something a little less controversial
9533000	9535000	that's fine what's up Agdeft?
9535000	9537000	kinda controversial uh
9537000	9539000	but still
9539000	9541000	uh people selling humble
9541000	9543000	bundle games fuck those people
9543000	9545000	fuck em
9545000	9547000	oh that annoys me so
9547000	9549000	bad especially when it's sorry
9549000	9551000	Agdeft I know it's your call but you got me
9551000	9553000	going especially when it's
9553000	9555000	oh man when it was all charity
9555000	9557000	like that EA bundle was all charity
9557000	9559000	those people that were buying the codes and
9559000	9561000	selling them on eBay scum
9561000	9563000	and then what when they got confronted it was just like
9563000	9565000	well you know the demands out there so
9565000	9567000	you know we're just you know people don't have to buy em
9567000	9569000	bleh
9569000	9571000	yeah I really hate those people
9571000	9573000	I even uh
9573000	9575000	there's a Facebook group I follow
9575000	9577000	uh it's a local group
9577000	9579000	that sells or resells games
9579000	9581000	and anime stuff and all that
9581000	9583000	and there was
9583000	9585000	one people there was a person that sold
9585000	9587000	the origin bundle
9587000	9589000	and like
9589000	9591000	maybe four times
9591000	9593000	the price he paid uh
9593000	9595000	for all the games and I was
9595000	9597000	like dude seriously
9597000	9599000	those games were sold like
9599000	9601000	for a fraction of the price
9601000	9603000	you paid and they were
9603000	9605000	especially they were all
9605000	9607000	for charity so it's like
9607000	9609000	what the fuck
9609000	9611000	and now the same thing happened
9611000	9613000	with another person
9613000	9615000	in the same group
9615000	9617000	she's selling the humble bundle
9617000	9619000	the nine games
9619000	9621000	and other
9621000	9623000	bundles for like
9623000	9625000	the original price and I'm like
9625000	9627000	seriously what the fuck
9627000	9629000	yeah I'm gonna admit Agdeft and I know
9629000	9631000	some people do this but I'm just
9631000	9633000	gonna say it even makes me uncomfortable
9633000	9635000	when people just give away one or
9635000	9637000	two codes you know I don't
9637000	9639000	and I've called out other
9639000	9641000	podcasts not by name but I've called out
9641000	9643000	shows, podcasts,
9643000	9645000	websites, blogs that
9645000	9647000	give away bundle codes
9647000	9649000	that are piecemealed from
9649000	9651000	somebody else's bundle the games they didn't
9651000	9653000	want and like it's
9653000	9655000	one thing when it's between friends
9655000	9657000	and so forth but you know
9657000	9659000	let's not forget
9659000	9661000	a lot of this money goes to charity
9661000	9663000	and it goes to the developers
9663000	9665000	when you piecemeal it like that you're
9665000	9667000	kind of taking it away from them
9667000	9669000	and it's like these bundles are such a great
9669000	9671000	deal like it's just I don't know like I
9671000	9673000	I get really bothered by it
9673000	9675000	I play devil's advocate though I mean sometimes like
9675000	9677000	especially with humble bundle nine I know I have some extra
9677000	9679000	games I need to give away I already
9679000	9681000	have those games and like
9681000	9683000	I'm buying the bundle and I'm getting it anyways
9683000	9685000	like and I can't I can't
9685000	9687000	redeem it twice you know what I mean
9687000	9689000	again it's one thing if you're giving it to a
9689000	9691000	friend or you know somebody like
9691000	9693000	even somebody like a Twitter follower that you know for
9693000	9695000	a long time I mean that's kind of one thing
9695000	9697000	but it's just like another to like use
9697000	9699000	it to profit yourself
9699000	9701000	and your own brand
9701000	9703000	if that makes sense what I'm saying because I'm still like
9703000	9705000	like follow this website and
9705000	9707000	get a chance to blah blah blah
9707000	9709000	you might you know you might
9709000	9711000	still be like oh okay I'm unloading my free
9711000	9713000	codes but if you think about it
9713000	9715000	that why doesn't your friend that wants to
9715000	9717000	take the code just pay five dollars
9717000	9719000	to the site and have the
9719000	9721000	four bucks go to charity or whatever you know
9721000	9723000	I don't see a problem if it's already over like
9723000	9725000	that bundle is already done
9725000	9727000	yeah yeah I'm I'm it's it's not
9727000	9729000	as bad let me just let me just put this away
9729000	9731000	I don't mean to be all like if you do this I hate
9731000	9733000	you I'm not saying that at all
9733000	9735000	I'm just saying you know think about it
9735000	9737000	shouldn't we be encouraging
9737000	9739000	people to go buy the bundle themselves
9739000	9741000	because eventually the money
9741000	9743000	does go to charity right
9743000	9745000	and especially in the case of the EA bundle
9745000	9747000	I mean one can argue like
9747000	9749000	you know and I think Act Deft you had a funny story
9749000	9751000	about this like you know I bought a bundle
9751000	9753000	but I don't fucking want Fez
9753000	9755000	I am staying a hundred miles away from Fez
9755000	9757000	it's that's
9757000	9759000	kind of a different set than what I'm
9759000	9761000	I'm talking about you know what I mean
9761000	9763000	that the irony part of that is
9763000	9765000	that I that I that I gave money to
9765000	9767000	the developers and forgot to take
9767000	9769000	out the uh the part of Fez
9769000	9771000	so oh well no well
9771000	9773000	yeah I don't think you can piecemeal it that way
9773000	9775000	I do get uh what you're
9775000	9777000	saying because I I did it
9777000	9779000	uh with my
9779000	9781000	uh separate codes but I
9781000	9783000	gave it to people that maybe wanted the game
9783000	9785000	and I didn't uh like profit
9785000	9787000	from it I didn't
9787000	9789000	want more followers I didn't want
9789000	9791000	more people to follow me on
9791000	9793000	Twitter or Facebook I guess
9793000	9795000	hey who wants a code for
9795000	9797000	this game and this game oh yeah
9797000	9799000	I want one and and
9799000	9801000	some were uh close friends so
9801000	9803000	I don't mind that
9803000	9805000	but yeah like you said like
9805000	9807000	oh follow me and
9807000	9809000	get a code or something like that yeah that's
9809000	9811000	that's pretty shit I don't mean to be
9811000	9813000	like calling people out or whatever maybe
9813000	9815000	maybe a little bit but because Bobby's in chat going
9815000	9817000	I shouldn't give away my bastion code on the show
9817000	9819000	Rob hates me and I'm like no that's not what
9819000	9821000	it is I don't hate you I'm just saying
9821000	9823000	think about it this way
9823000	9825000	think about it this way shouldn't we
9825000	9827000	really be encouraging people to go buy the bundles
9827000	9829000	and give the money to charity and so forth
9829000	9831000	and then maybe after the fact you know a long
9831000	9833000	time when when that's no longer an option
9833000	9835000	maybe give away the the
9835000	9837000	bastion code or whatever it is that I think
9837000	9839000	is acceptable yeah you know if you're
9839000	9841000	I've got probably got duplicate codes for some
9841000	9843000	games because I bought multiple bundles
9843000	9845000	and I don't mind if it's a friend of mine
9845000	9847000	giving away a code yeah and me neither
9847000	9849000	I usually just give them to Dan
9849000	9851000	there you go so anyway
9851000	9853000	sorry active I just want to clarify
9853000	9855000	before the hate mail started rolling in
9857000	9859000	oh well that that's pretty much
9859000	9861000	it like I said
9861000	9863000	even then I don't
9863000	9865000	mind people giving away the codes
9865000	9867000	it's selling them yeah for a profit
9867000	9869000	that's yeah that's
9869000	9871000	the really bad stuff if you're selling these on
9871000	9873000	eBay if you're flipping this on eBay then
9873000	9875000	I hate you then it's okay to say that
9875000	9877000	Rob hates you I would I would absolutely
9877000	9879000	hate you if you flip these on eBay for a profit

9973000	9975000	give you guys a shout um I've been
9975000	9977000	listening for
9977000	9979000	about I would say six seven years
9979000	9981000	now wow I think the reason why
9981000	9983000	I remember is cause um just
9983000	9985000	one podcast I listened to and I don't know why
9985000	9987000	I remember this but it was like
9987000	9989000	y'all's fourth birthday
9989000	9991000	and uh
9991000	9993000	I think at a certain point um
9993000	9995000	Dark Soccer had said like
9995000	9997000	we're this many and they like
9997000	9999000	held up a certain amount of fingers and you were just like

10005000	10007000	forever that's that's it she does that every year
10007000	10009000	too except now she couldn't do it
10009000	10011000	this year cause she'd have to put up a toe
10011000	10013000	as well
10013000	10015000	I stick my nose in the air
10015000	10017000	right so that's just how I keep tabs on

10071000	10073000	kind of chosen to boycott any
10073000	10075000	type of Xbox related

10101000	10103000	that looks amazing um
10103000	10105000	but just the one game isn't enough for me

10137000	10139000	CPK I haven't had
10139000	10141000	California Pizza Kitchen in like forever
10141000	10143000	do you wanna go to CPK sometime this weekend
10143000	10145000	or something I do I just have to have
10145000	10147000	a good week and then I can go alright we'll
10147000	10149000	figure something out because honestly I'm in love with
10149000	10151000	a pair of Gorgonzola pizza I
10151000	10153000	like um
10153000	10155000	I like the barbecue chicken pizza
10155000	10157000	but you can kinda get that at the grocery store I know it's not
10157000	10159000	the same thing the Jamaican Jerk is pretty good yeah
10159000	10161000	but but I'd say when I'm feeling extra
10161000	10163000	trafe it's the shrimp scampi
10163000	10165000	pizza with extra garlic
10165000	10167000	alright now you're making me hungry
10167000	10169000	damn you alright 1877
10169000	10171000	game OLR our username on skype is
10171000	10173000	orange lounge radio we can probably squeeze in one more call
10173000	10175000	and you know I love the long time listener
10175000	10177000	first time caller calls like yes
10177000	10179000	sort of I think he said he called in once before but
10179000	10181000	I still love it's been a little while
10181000	10183000	by the way but I love the regular
10183000	10185000	if I said how many we were now I'd have to drop
10185000	10187000	the mic there I'll do this
10187000	10189000	we're this many
10189000	10191000	I put it on the table they can't see you
10191000	10193000	so unless I take a picture
10193000	10195000	and then you'll get mad at me for taking a picture
10195000	10197000	no then I'll channel your mom
10197000	10199000	ah but I want that on the internet Britney Spears
10199000	10201000	might see it
10205000	10207000	I don't want Britney's friends to post it
10207000	10209000	as if Britney Spears gives two shits
10209000	10211000	about orange lounge radio you know I had a friend
10211000	10213000	that went to high school with Britney Spears really
10213000	10215000	he said she was a total bitch
10217000	10219000	alright I got a few more tweets
10219000	10221000	here uh SSG100 Matt
10221000	10223000	sent us a tweet about this I want to get your
10223000	10225000	thoughts on these all in one
10225000	10227000	classic gaming machines like the
10227000	10229000	Retro N5
10229000	10231000	gaming purist friendly?
10231000	10233000	I've seen reviews
10233000	10235000	of some of those the key word is
10235000	10237000	purist and I'm going to say if the word is purist
10237000	10239000	then no they're not gaming
10239000	10241000	purist friendly because pretty much these
10241000	10243000	things are emulators in a box
10243000	10245000	and so they are going to have the slightest
10245000	10247000	things wrong with them but if you
10247000	10249000	just want shit tons of games
10249000	10251000	in a box to play on the TV
10251000	10253000	99.9% of people don't really care
10253000	10255000	and so whatever go for it
10255000	10257000	with the big problem with some of those
10257000	10259000	by the way in reviews that I've watched cause Dan and I
10259000	10261000	watch reviews for a number of those things
10261000	10263000	typically it's sound cause keep in mind
10263000	10265000	especially with the Super Nintendo it had that
10265000	10267000	Sony sound processor you're
10267000	10269000	not going to get the same quality
10269000	10271000	it'll come out sounding it'll
10271000	10273000	miss sounds or something you'll be wrong with it
10273000	10275000	just so you guys know on the
10275000	10277000	Retro N5 if you hadn't heard of this
10277000	10279000	it has five cartridge slots
10279000	10281000	look at that the NES
10281000	10283000	the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom
10283000	10285000	the Genesis and Mega Drive
10285000	10287000	the Famicom so you can play
10287000	10289000	not only NES games but Famicom games and then
10289000	10291000	they have a GBA, GBC,
10291000	10293000	GB slot that plays all those
10293000	10295000	games so Game Boy games on that
10295000	10297000	as well and you can hook that up to the tele
10297000	10299000	and play those games
10299000	10301000	HDMI output that's pretty cool
10301000	10303000	that makes me think of is there's
10303000	10305000	this person Dan watches a lot
10305000	10307000	of this one
10307000	10309000	Engineer
10309000	10311000	who basically just like tries to build
10311000	10313000	smaller portable versions of systems
10313000	10315000	I forgot what his name is but there was another
10315000	10317000	link from that channel of a person who
10317000	10319000	built a
10319000	10321000	like a 30 game system
10321000	10323000	just by using the parts
10323000	10325000	out of their old systems
10325000	10327000	you know use the CDX bit to build
10327000	10329000	all the Genesis bits and
10329000	10331000	and had like this series
10331000	10333000	to have it run off of one power
10333000	10335000	supply and one hookup cable
10335000	10337000	so they got
10337000	10339000	I think one successfully working version
10339000	10341000	of it but it ended up being some
10341000	10343000	prohibitively expensive thing but it legit runs
10343000	10345000	on the actual hardware
10345000	10347000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room
10347000	10349000	at live.vognetwork.com says if you're really
10349000	10351000	a purist you'll play your original game
10351000	10353000	carts on a 300 pound 22 inch
10353000	10355000	CRT TV from 1993
10355000	10357000	you know what though
10357000	10359000	Alan brings up a good point with that and that
10359000	10361000	is the one plus side about these
10361000	10363000	systems is that it plays
10363000	10365000	through HDMI port
10365000	10367000	let's be real a lot of modern TVs
10367000	10369000	you can't hook up classic game
10369000	10371000	consoles to them you cannot hook up
10371000	10373000	an Atari 2600 to an HDTV
10373000	10375000	without some mega converters
10375000	10377000	that will cause loss of quality
10377000	10379000	that's why things like game room were so awesome
10379000	10381000	I thought they had RF adapters for that stuff
10381000	10383000	yeah but you're having to you have to change
10383000	10385000	RF adapter into RCA
10385000	10387000	you have to run it through a converter which in those
10387000	10389000	things can sometimes be expensive
10389000	10391000	I don't have systems I can't play anymore
10391000	10393000	but the Nintendo you can still use like even the
10393000	10395000	original NES had RCA plugs
10395000	10397000	but it was only yellow
10397000	10399000	that's why you buy an old ass VCR
10399000	10401000	and you hook it up through that
10401000	10403000	well they actually
10403000	10405000	do have a number of adapters now
10405000	10407000	Dan gets them at Radio Shack
10407000	10409000	that are RF converters
10409000	10411000	because that's how he
10411000	10413000	gets his
10413000	10415000	Intellivision, not Intellivision I'm saying
10415000	10417000	the Atari 5200 to play on
10417000	10419000	flat screen monitors
10419000	10421000	by using the HDMI hook up with an RF converter
10421000	10423000	but we have one system that
10423000	10425000	will not play on anything new
10425000	10427000	and that's our Odyssey 2
10427000	10429000	it is so old
10429000	10431000	For the Fallen Dreams is in our chat room as well
10431000	10433000	it says remember when channel 3 and 4 was the game input channel
10433000	10435000	Pepperidge Farm remembers
10435000	10437000	I remember well because
10437000	10439000	in Sacramento you had to use channel 4
10439000	10441000	because channel 3 is a legit
10441000	10443000	channel here, it's NBC here
10443000	10445000	so you have to use channel 4 because
10445000	10447000	you could never get a signal on channel 3
10447000	10449000	it's noisy because of the
10449000	10451000	KCRA
10451000	10453000	3 was a used channel in Mobile
10453000	10455000	but I would still use it because it would actually be clearer
10455000	10457000	for my screen signal
10457000	10459000	yes it's true
10459000	10461000	there's a channel 4 in the Bay Area but the signal is very weak
10461000	10463000	here in Sacramento
10463000	10465000	but I would always get pissed off because
10465000	10467000	my brothers would try to steal the remote
10467000	10469000	and they were little brats
10469000	10471000	well they're still brats
10471000	10473000	but they're older brats
10473000	10475000	I will never
10475000	10477000	forget being young
10477000	10481000	and trying to get the channels
10481000	10483000	from San Francisco
10483000	10485000	I don't remember why I was doing this
10485000	10487000	but one time there was something
10487000	10489000	I really wanted to watch that the CBS channel
10489000	10491000	here wasn't airing
10491000	10493000	so I had to try and get the
10493000	10495000	antenna just right
10495000	10497000	I could get channel 12 out of Chico
10497000	10499000	just right
10499000	10501000	and it's like don't let go of it
10501000	10503000	you won't be able to see the Charlie Brown special
10503000	10505000	or whatever stupid thing channel 12 was airing
10505000	10507000	I had a fun day when I was sick
10507000	10509000	and staying home
10509000	10511000	now keep in mind the town I was born in
10511000	10513000	is Dothan Alabama
10513000	10515000	which is a good 4 hours away if you drive through Alabama
10515000	10517000	it's like 3 and a half if you go through Florida
10517000	10519000	so I was sitting
10519000	10521000	going through the static channels
10521000	10523000	because I would do that for fun
10523000	10525000	don't ask I was weird
10525000	10527000	porn
10527000	10529000	no I was 8
10529000	10531000	it doesn't matter
10531000	10533000	and so one day
10533000	10535000	I managed the Dothan channel
10535000	10537000	came through
10537000	10539000	and I was sitting watching WGN
10539000	10541000	that was the Chicago station that would get through
10541000	10543000	cable but it was like
10543000	10545000	whatever the Dothan station
10545000	10547000	that I used to watch soaps with my granny
10547000	10549000	I was watching TV
10549000	10551000	all day on the static ass Dothan channel
10551000	10553000	and then figured out
10553000	10555000	that if you put tin foil on your rabbit ears
10555000	10557000	you can get a really
10557000	10559000	good signal
10587000	10589000	because at night they're allowed to increase the power
10589000	10591000	so you can get stations from
10591000	10593000	all the way to the midwest
10593000	10595000	I think we can get stations
10595000	10597000	I know we can get them from Colorado, Seattle
10597000	10599000	we can get them on AM
10599000	10601000	and I know where I get that from is my dad
10601000	10603000	because I remember growing up my dad had one of those
10603000	10605000	it was a radio that did the shortwave
10605000	10607000	and he used to listen to stations
10607000	10609000	out of the Netherlands
10609000	10611000	and things like that
10611000	10613000	not that he could understand it
10613000	10615000	now we have internet radio for that
10615000	10617000	well remember when OLR started
10617000	10619000	on Live 365
10619000	10621000	and we went to that award ceremony
10621000	10623000	when they were kind enough to nominate us that one year
10623000	10625000	and then forget to read our name
10625000	10627000	a lot of the people we met
10627000	10629000	in that community were all guys
10629000	10631000	and girls that used to do like ham radio
10631000	10633000	and that type of
10633000	10635000	I never realized until that day
10635000	10637000	how many people
10637000	10639000	from the ham radio, shortwave radio
10639000	10641000	kind of just naturally fell into
10641000	10643000	internet broadcasting
10643000	10645000	as a natural place
10645000	10647000	well you know some of those stations
10647000	10649000	that do the weird signals
10649000	10651000	I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking about
10651000	10653000	there's one that's out of Russia
10653000	10655000	that every so often
10655000	10657000	dialogue would come across
10657000	10659000	and it sounded like someone was just holding up
10659000	10661000	a microphone to a machine that was going beep
10661000	10663000	all day at a certain signal
10663000	10665000	I listen to that because sometimes
10665000	10667000	it's pretty fun and you can hear
10667000	10669000	odd things going on in the background
10669000	10671000	or the ones that give the weird frequencies
10671000	10673000	or the ones that I'm interested in
10673000	10675000	and every so often you can pick those up on shortwave
10675000	10677000	as well
10677000	10679000	alright, well that's going to do it
10679000	10681000	nobody else is giving us a call
10681000	10683000	and we are through all of our tweets tonight
10683000	10685000	so I want to thank both our callers tonight
10685000	10687000	and if somebody else had something to say
10687000	10689000	be it live or podcast
10689000	10691000	don't forget you can always email us
10691000	10693000	mailbag at orangelandradio.com
10693000	10695000	or you can tweet us like some of our listeners did tonight
10695000	10697000	at twitter.com
10697000	10699000	twitter.com
10699000	10701000	it is definitely time to wrap up
10701000	10703000	the show here
10703000	10705000	I don't listen to the radio anymore
10705000	10707000	in my car
10707000	10709000	I miss DJs
10709000	10711000	I think AM is still a good way to get traffic
10711000	10713000	I know we have it on iPhones
10713000	10715000	and all that, but I still
10715000	10717000	on the phones, all you can see is it's red
10717000	10719000	and it's not always accurate
10719000	10721000	because I think a lot of them are running off Caltrans
10721000	10723000	reports, but when you listen to traffic
10723000	10725000	on AM radio, they'll tell you
10725000	10727000	we're flying over the bridge and it is backed
10727000	10729000	up all the way to this point
10729000	10731000	I like being able to hear that
10731000	10733000	so when we drive to the Bay Area
10733000	10735000	you better break out the Travel Connect 4
10735000	10737000	you're going to be here a while
10737000	10739000	Alan and I listen to 740 a lot when driving to the Bay Area
10739000	10741000	to get their traffic updates
10741000	10743000	and I use my cell phone to listen to
10743000	10745000	music for the most part because I have an iPhone
10745000	10747000	yeah, I love Stitcher
10747000	10749000	and all that stuff and podcasts
10749000	10751000	I just play my own stuff
10751000	10753000	I actually have a playlist called Random Mix
10753000	10755000	that's video game music
10755000	10759000	anime, J-pop, and all the other weird crazy stuff I listen to
10759000	10761000	well you know they are saying, it's funny we bring up AM radio
10761000	10763000	they're saying that AM radio
10763000	10765000	I saw a story on this this week or last
10765000	10767000	on one of the big websites like Google or Yahoo
10767000	10769000	that AM radio is kind of dying
10769000	10771000	it's a dying art form
10771000	10773000	because so many people have switched to internet
10773000	10775000	and iPod and running that in their cars
10775000	10777000	and so forth, which is great news for us
10777000	10779000	and what we do
10779000	10781000	but kind of a sad day
10781000	10783000	it's the same thing that I run into
10783000	10785000	being that when I
10785000	10787000	picked my major
10787000	10789000	my focus was print media
10789000	10791000	as far as design for print
10791000	10793000	when it's all
10793000	10795000	really now print design is
10795000	10797000	more of a
10797000	10799000	special field now
10799000	10801000	it's dying too, it's just sad
10801000	10803000	because nothing smells as good as a print shop
10803000	10805000	alright, we need to wrap up
10805000	10807000	we can reminisce all freaking night
10807000	10809000	and some of you might like that
10809000	10811000	but I think it is time to wrap up the show
10811000	10813000	thank you guys again for downloading Orange Launch Radio
10813000	10815000	and checking out our show, we really appreciate it
10815000	10817000	and you know what we say, if you like the show

10819000	10821000	or five about the show
10821000	10823000	talk about us in a convention line
10823000	10825000	like somebody on Twitter did there this week
10825000	10827000	help spread the word because that's all we've got
10827000	10829000	we don't have an AM radio station
10829000	10831000	backing us and putting ads out there
10831000	10833000	or anything like that, so word of mouth
10833000	10835000	is all we got, thank you guys as always
10835000	10837000	for your support of the show, let's go around
10837000	10839000	and get everybody's final thoughts tonight
10839000	10841000	we'll start with you, your final thought tonight
10841000	10843000	my final thought
10843000	10845000	is I'm going to play more
10845000	10847000	Grand Theft Auto
10847000	10849000	that's a good final thought
10849000	10851000	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight
10851000	10853000	I hate Dreamweaver
10853000	10855000	and my final thought tonight is that
10855000	10857000	if you are in the Sacramento area
10857000	10859000	you need to make plans on October 12th
10859000	10861000	to come see the Rocky Horror Picture Show
10861000	10863000	at the Colonial, starring yours truly
10863000	10865000	well, co-starring me, but I will be in it
10865000	10867000	so, there you go
10867000	10869000	that's it
10869000	10871000	we're done, we're out of here
10871000	10873000	we'll see you next week, right?
10873000	10875000	I sure hope so, have a great week everybody
10875000	10877000	happy gaming, and we'll be back in 7 days to do it all again
10877000	10879000	good night
