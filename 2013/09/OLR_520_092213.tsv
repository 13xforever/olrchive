13901	15703	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Mighty No.
15963	18306	9 surpasses its stretch goals and will try heading to consoles.
18566	24893	Diablo 3 will lose its auction house next year, more of Imani heads to iOS, and the tributes and memorials to Hiroshi Yamauchi begin.
31564	36265	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36325	44767	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 22nd of 2013 with the 520th episode of our show.
45127	51509	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here to talk about video games with you guys out there in internet land and my co-hosts here in studio.
51869	54209	Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
54849	55109	Work.
55670	55990	Work.
56390	56630	Work.
56730	57010	Work.
58630	62371	Tonight's presentation of OLR will be presented in the language of Chocobo.
68053	71714	That was the sound of like 500 people unsubscribing from the show all at once.
71734	72875	You mean we have that many?
76436	78857	The facts are completely made up on tonight's OLR as well.
79697	80537	How you doing, DarkSakura?
80817	81198	Seriously.
81818	82658	Caffeinated, thank you.
82678	83278	No, seriously.
83638	83998	How are you?
88655	92436	It's a bummer it's a radio show because if y'all could see the look she was giving me right now.
92536	94536	I think I was giving him the girl face.
94556	95776	Or how dare you cut me off.
97217	97937	But you're caffeinated.
97977	98517	Do you have your coffee?
98537	99177	I'm caffeinated.
99457	101257	I have had healthy food today.
102278	104618	And I still have chocolate-covered mints for later.
105038	105638	Ooh, yummy.
105978	107398	And I've brought delicious snacks.
107739	108439	Which I keep eating.
108519	115320	In the form of my special trail mix made of raw almonds and raw cashews and roasted coconut.
115940	116860	But the coconut's the best part.
117060	117621	It totally is.
118041	118301	All right.
119361	124162	Say hello to our coconut here on the show, or just nut.
124202	125443	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
125603	125903	Hi.
126103	126643	How are you, Loki?
127223	127843	I'm fine.
128303	128603	Yeah?
129263	131224	Well, throat's a little sore, but I'm fine.
131324	132944	Oh, sorry to hear it.
133284	136605	I caught it from my son, so... Don't get me sick.
136625	137326	Yeah, don't get us sick.
137346	137986	I'm being rude.
138026	138666	Don't get me sick.
138686	138926	It's just...
140157	141438	It's just the throat thing.
141538	147843	It could very well be also allergies because I always get like scratchy throat whenever the weather goes wet and then dry again.
148123	150025	Well, the seasons changed yesterday.
150065	151666	I don't know if you noticed, but it rained.
151866	152106	Yeah.
152126	156009	So that means summer's over and here's winter because we don't have a fall here.
156029	157010	There's no transition.
157030	158571	It's just like boom, done.
158691	159092	That's right.
159192	160473	Boom goes the dynamite.
160753	161213	That's it.
161774	163635	So yeah, it rained here yesterday.
163755	164436	So thank...
164796	171080	Thank gosh it rained yesterday and not two days ago because I went to an outdoor concert two days ago and that would have been really terrible if it was raining.
171581	172381	So, yeah.
172541	174803	Anyway, you guys are there in our chat room.
175123	178626	We always like to say hello to the fourth guest on the show, our chatters.
178746	186951	Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network.
187111	188892	Except in October where we record dead.
188913	189373	Yeah.
189793	192754	The Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network dot com.
193254	197815	And again, that's Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
198276	200816	And those of you that were listening live, I'm sure we're aware of this.
201156	203157	But if you're listening on the podcast, you may not be aware.
203477	206458	Our pal Bobby hit 400 episodes tonight.
206518	208839	So claps and congratulations for Bobby.
208859	210019	That's a great milestone.
211580	218026	and in true Bobby form, he had walked through the door 20 minutes before to set up in a frenzy because he was working on something else for the show.
218046	219787	Because he was 15 minutes late with Starbucks.
221088	222830	No, that's our excuse, DarkSakura.
223531	224511	Bobby's always hard at work.
225072	226093	So, all right.
227714	230277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
243610	247292	Hiroshi Yamauchi died this week at age 85.
248052	254055	If you don't know that name, he was basically the head of Nintendo, the Nintendo president for many years.
254875	259237	That's the position that Satoru Iwata holds now, and many of you know him for sure.
259897	264619	But Yamauchi ran Nintendo for 53 years.
265099	271921	So the NES, the Super NES, all the stuff that led into NES, because they didn't start with that.
272021	275822	They were doing the watch games, and even before that it was cards and the more mechanical stuff.
276062	278163	That's how he met Gunpei Yokoi, if I'm not mistaken.
278723	279763	It wasn't about games at all.
280463	282044	I think you have a mechanical...
283745	291011	But Hiroshi Yamauchi, he was a very interesting guy because he was a businessman in every sense of the word.
291072	293894	The man hardly played video games at all.
294835	301981	In fact, I believe rumor has it the first video game he ever played was when Tetris went to the Game Boy, which, to be fair, was a lot of people's interest.
302041	302922	I was about to say.
302982	303122	Yeah.
303642	306825	But yeah, he just knew how to make business decisions.
307125	311948	And a lot of people, of course, also know him because he owned the Seattle Mariners for quite some time.
311968	319374	And it was very controversial at the time because he was in Japan, the team was here, he didn't really have plans to come see the team.
319634	321936	He never came to see a game.
322436	326299	Now, he watched them on TV and things like that, but he never came over to actually see a game.
326619	328261	So it was kind of controversial in that sense.
328961	329922	But again, businessman.
330359	330839	DarkSakura.com
344394	345415	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
366229	391208	Yes So just kind of funny how that all kind of goes together Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Some kind words and some reminiscing about Hiroshi Yamauchi in chat Dungeon Buster says he was an uncanny judge of character and trends WhatUpG says hiring Miyamoto, one of his best moves ever True says TMZ even showed a bit of love to Hiroshi Yamauchi, lol
391601	403170	Yeah, you know, the news even kind of, you know, cut through to the mainstream because, you know, not only was he the Nintendo guy, which, you know, obviously he made a boatload of money from his share of Nintendo stock when it surged thanks to the Wii and all that.
403210	404371	I mean, the man had a boatload of money.
404852	410036	Many people knew that he did not accept his pension when he retired from Nintendo.
410096	411597	He said, no, Nintendo needs the money.
412878	417241	And so I believe he donated a huge amount to cancer charities as well.
417642	420324	So the man did a lot of good, which should be recognized.
420544	423906	And he also, you think he probably had well enough in savings to live off of.
424006	426908	I wish that CEOs over here would do that.
426968	430050	Yeah, it was a very humble sort of thing to do.
431030	434573	And it made a lot of mainstream coverage.
434633	436854	I heard not all of it was necessarily tasteful.
437614	440136	I want to say I heard that Arsenio Hall...
440356	444781	Who I didn't even realize was back on TV with a late night show I was like, how 1992 is that?
445201	454671	But he's back on TV with a late night show And there was some type of joke in the monologue or something Where, you know, Hiroshi Yamauchi died today And it sounded something like this And they played the Pac-Man
456692	457013	Really?
457373	457633	I don't know.
457913	458973	I'm paraphrasing the joke.
459033	475979	I don't remember the exact words, but I know it was the Pac-Man noise because it made me think, well, if you want to get technical, sir, even though your joke is in incredibly poor taste, Pac-Man was a Namco character, and I think a lot of people would recognize the Mario death noise, so if you had to go there, but you know what?
476559	480941	Then I'm writing people's disgusting jokes for them, so whatever.
482241	483902	You know how I found out about it, actually?
483922	484182	Mm-hmm.
484943	488727	Oddly enough, I saw his picture on the Nikkei site.
489748	494493	And then later on I saw someone had translated from the business news that he died.
494733	495554	And that's how I found out.
496535	501401	So obviously a lot of gaming in general...
502081	525947	is to thank to this this man and his guidance even if he wasn't necessarily a gamer himself his business guidance led Nintendo to greatness um I thought maybe we could just take a minute I mean obviously I think it goes without saying we want to you know kind of dedicate our show tonight to his memory and everything he's done for us but I thought it might be a good time to kind of just share some Nintendo memories and maybe some early Nintendo memories so I want to go around the room here
526247	528388	I'm not playing my 3DS right now, am I?
528428	533751	Not current Nintendo memories because your 3DS is so close to the mic they can actually hear your Animal Crossing going.
533851	537233	Hey, that's actually good background music to have the island music.
537834	539615	I suppose it is somewhat appropriate.
539955	545038	But in all seriousness, DarkSakura, what's your first memory of the Nintendo Entertainment System?
545078	547539	When did you become an NES fangirl?
547599	548720	Now, I know you were Sega.
548740	549140	No, I wasn't.
549180	549801	Dan was Sega.
552182	553943	I was pretty damn loyal to Nintendo when I was a kid.
554243	555923	I went over to my friend's house and played Metroid.
555983	559184	I would go hang out over at my friend's house and she had Super Mario Bros.
559204	559764	and Metroid and...
574168	578051	Legend of Zelda and for that god-awful game Clue Clue fucking Land.
578511	579272	Oh my god.
579552	581073	I kind of like that game.
581333	583115	I kind of too but I hate it too.
583335	591581	It's one of those like it's so niche and it's so stupid like it's kind of cool like if you if you know how to play Clue Clue Land that kind of makes you a gaming hipster.
592181	599086	Yeah well I would also go over to now at the time and I have to give a little background my friend Catherine.
600440	601761	Who would just go by Catherine?
602081	603062	Her mother was a Cathy.
603102	604062	My mother was a Cathy.
604082	605043	They were both Cathleens.
606344	608465	And I have an Aunt Cathy and a bunch of people.
608505	610766	So we would always joke, which Cathy am I hanging with?
610827	614989	But anyway, her brother was like super into Metroid.
615069	617551	So we would, you know, Metroid and Metal Gear.
617651	621093	So it was a lot of playing that around over at her house.
621233	627356	And then my dad finally got me mine and he got me his favorite game, which was Sky Shark.
628818	633501	I was playing shooting games in 1941 and 1942.
635043	643550	My papa, when he was alive, my dad's dad, we would play Jackal on his big screen TV where you could see every damn pixel.
644811	648654	And he'd say, now Maury, because he called me Maury.
648694	649555	My middle name is Maury.
649875	651237	He didn't like my first name for some reason.
652117	652798	I'd say Maury.
652818	652918	Maury.
654145	658867	I want you to throw that grenade over the wall, and then I'm going to come around and shoot him.
661709	664410	I'd be like, okay, Papa, and then playing Abadox.
665310	667572	Because for some reason, he liked Abadox.
668532	670573	Your Papa likes some really strange NES games.
670593	670733	I know!
670753	672714	That's cool, though.
672834	675615	But he was totally into the war games and Tecmo Bowl.
676916	680578	And my little sister, for some reason, liked that stupid game MagMax.
680998	683799	I beat the shit out of that game I couldn't do it now but I was pretty good at it then so yeah
711824	729313	I can't really pin it on one thing it's just lots of good things and that and having a friend set his on fire I don't know if you thought I was joking about it before but I really was serious he threw it down a flight of stairs and set it on fire and it still worked
729873	731455	That's back when they built consoles.
731916	732817	They were built tough.
732877	733437	That's right.
734098	736501	There was none of this red ring or yellow light shit.
736961	737362	Yeah.
737382	740265	You'd throw them down a flight of stairs and set them on fire and they still worked.
740625	741326	It still worked.
741566	744650	Although I don't think it would have worked had he flushed it down the toilet like he wanted to.
744790	749996	That disgusting brown color that most Super Nintendos are these days is a badge of honor.
750678	752459	And that meant your mom was a chain smoker.
753499	754360	That's what it meant in my house.
755500	757641	Loki, what were some early NES memories for you?
758462	759963	Well, I got my first NES.
761183	767086	My parents surprised me with Breakthrough, Zelda, and Bubble Bobble.
768126	769747	So I played the crap out of that.
770287	771448	That and my friend's house.
772068	775610	Because everyone had an NES, so we played different games.
776751	777231	That's about it.
777859	780861	What was it about the NES that made you love it so much?
780881	783183	I don't know, I just like video games anyways.
783363	786386	I had a ColecoVision before that, so... I did too!
786786	788267	So it was just slightly better, you know?
788988	789568	Better graphics?
790609	797314	Yeah, better graphics, better controller, because, you know, the ColecoVision is like a numpad with a little joystick on top.
798735	801437	At least it wasn't as bad as the Atari 5200 controller, though.
802218	802778	That was pretty bad.
803358	805420	What would you say is your favorite NES game ever?
809830	831686	probably like let's see Legend of Zelda or Blaster Master Metroid's good too it's one of my favorites too I don't know I mean there was I know there was some NES games I had that I played the crap out of but I can't really remember which ones they were Mega Man 2 maybe yeah
834228	849234	um my earliest NES memory was that um I I wanted a Nintendo real bad for kind of the same reason Loki did is that I liked video games anyway we had an Atari 2600 so of course when I saw that there was a Nintendo out there and I got to play it at the store I really wanted them
849814	851355	I think I played it at a friend's house too.
851956	856699	And I finally was rewarded with one for getting straight A's in the fourth grade.
857179	859101	I got my Nintendo Entertainment System.
859141	864684	We went to Sears and bought the NES that came with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt.
865325	867546	And I just played the crap out of that.
867586	868907	I played so much Mario Brothers.
869207	869988	It was insane.
870168	870889	GreyGunEra
889002	890243	I want to play Legend of Zelda.
890263	891684	I want a Nintendo.
909295	909735	Thanks for watching!
927362	938931	My favorite NES game, see, I would have to kind of jack some of the early answers, and I would say probably The Guardian Legend is honestly my favorite NES game of all time as well, just because of the hybrid of it.
939771	944995	Outside of that, honestly, I know it's really cliche, but I kind of think Super Mario Bros. 2...
946236	950039	is one of my favorite NES games just because I just have so many memories with that.
950059	959826	I remember renting that game on New Year's Eve or something, and I played the crap out of that game one New Year's and played it from start to finish.
960586	962068	And God, I love that game so much.
962128	962308	It was...
962748	963429	Magic of Scheherazade
978949	979510	I did.
979730	979970	Yes.
980030	980951	Not very much of it.
981031	983854	I rented it, but it was like during exams or something.
983974	988258	It was like a hybrid of Zelda and Final Fantasy, and it was kind of rad.
988679	992743	Now, because it kind of tried to do too much, it kind of had some flaws.
993223	997828	But when you're like 10 years old, you overlook those flaws and you're like, this game's awesome.
997868	998809	It has everything.
999289	1000410	So there you go.
1001791	1031055	some folks in chat GameGuru in chat says as for favorites Super Mario Brothers 3 bar none that was one of my all-time favorites too and I think for a lot of us I remember going to one of my best friends back in the day his name was Devin I went to his house and we played we stayed up until like 4 in the morning playing Super Mario Brothers 3 and we were doing the whole like two player like who doesn't remember playing that with another person and you would always fight the other person oh my sister and I were just complete bitches to each other over that game mm-hmm
1031215	1034398	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1055074	1057936	I have to freaking replant one of my stupid perfect pears.
1058596	1060257	Because the fucking trees die.
1060537	1062218	You've got real problems, young lady.
1062278	1063479	I do have real problems.
1063499	1064639	I have mental problems.
1065360	1069342	Like Reginald in Nedroid, which is still my favorite webcomic.
1069882	1070162	Anyway.
1071683	1073144	I've been playing Animal Crossing.
1073604	1075445	I might open my village during the show.
1075545	1076446	I'm still thinking about it.
1076526	1078747	If enough people show interest, I will open my village.
1079207	1080388	Damn, I got bit by a mosquito.
1081088	1081168	Um...
1082749	1089853	So, I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV, and I have finally joined the Twin Adders.
1091314	1096337	Because, first of all, the flaming people suck.
1097378	1100319	I hate their stupid, privileged 1% country.
1101040	1104622	And I refuse to be a part of their whole...
1106576	1110826	In the beta, I was with that nation, but I changed it when the full game came out.
1110866	1112129	Screw the Sultana, okay?
1112530	1114253	That little bitch does not get any of my money.
1115660	1142596	I'm gonna give it to the hippies because Occupy just so people just so people kind of understand for Final Fantasy 14 you know a lot of MMOs historically have had factions and you know a lot of people break it down to good and evil but it's not always that way for instance World of Warcraft has the Alliance and the Horde although the Horde is not necessarily evil or whatever it's just you know those are the two factions they're just assholes
1143456	1147539	Final Fantasy XIV is a faction-free game.
1148560	1149740	Everybody can talk to each other.
1149760	1152983	Because usually in WoW, if you play Horde but your friend plays Alliance, you can't talk to each other.
1153883	1155164	Unless you're through a real idea or whatever.
1155184	1156745	But in Final Fantasy, that doesn't stop you.
1157205	1160888	But you will join one of three nations throughout the story.
1160968	1161849	And you don't even have to.
1162449	1163430	Yeah, technically you don't have to.
1163450	1165232	And you can switch whenever you want.
1166293	1171659	I think those allegiances will come into PvP later on, but for right now it only has minor impacts on the story.
1171679	1173361	But I hate PvP, so that will never happen.
1173501	1174482	Right.
1174622	1176124	Well, there's not even PvP in the game yet.
1176424	1177225	Well, I still hate it.
1177245	1178206	So, I...
1181690	1193297	I've been playing that, I've been playing Warfractal, and I have actually picked up an older game on my phone, and I've been playing it stupidly obsessively for some stupid reason, because you know me and puzzle games.
1193737	1194618	I've been playing Bejeweled.
1195258	1197499	Like, not even Bejeweled Blitz, I haven't played that yet.
1198260	1199761	I am playing old school Bejeweled.
1199881	1207966	I've been in Diamond Mine mode for like... It helps me get sleepy at night, as I have a lot of trouble sleeping, so I play Bejeweled at night.
1209326	1209987	And, um...
1211721	1215654	Yeah, I know I played something else, but for the life of me, I can't remember
1216328	1218530	You'll think of it later and then shout it out randomly in the middle of a sentence.
1218550	1218990	Yes, I will.
1219230	1219530	All right.
1220471	1224514	Loki, do I even have to ask how many hours you sunk into Grand Theft Auto V this week?
1224754	1231278	I don't remember how many hours I sunk in, but I think it's at least 16, at least.
1232179	1232499	I don't know.
1233140	1237703	I'm almost at the end of the campaign, and it's great.
1237863	1239024	I love every second of it.
1239184	1241465	So I even got my son to play a little bit of it.
1241866	1242446	He's been driving.
1242706	1243107	Wait!
1243347	1243967	Wait a minute!
1243987	1244428	What?
1245248	1245968	Wait a minute!
1246029	1247009	He likes driving the car.
1247029	1251432	But you're letting your three-year-old son play Grand Theft Auto V?
1251452	1252652	He's not killing people.
1252692	1254534	He's driving back and forth on a beach.
1254774	1256795	Three-year-olds have no moral compass.
1256955	1257876	It does not matter.
1258456	1263759	No, I just... Loki can do what he wants, and I know he's not showing the bad parts of the game.
1263839	1264820	He's just driving a car.
1264840	1270483	You have to admit, the initial sentence of you saying, yeah, I'm letting my son play Grand Theft Auto V is kind of funny.
1270683	1271843	Well, he doesn't really know how to play.
1272323	1274424	All he can really do is just press the gas.
1274564	1279965	So I have to kind of steer for him, and he just presses the gas and laughs when he hits stuff.
1280045	1281325	Like people.
1281385	1283226	No, like fences, not people.
1283726	1284946	And the people are all fine.
1284986	1287707	They just go to the hospital, and they come out just fine.
1288627	1293368	It's like when he asks, he's all... And he even asks, he's all, stop hitting that man.
1293708	1295909	Why did we take that guy's car?
1295929	1296049	Yeah.
1297149	1303013	So someday, Loki, when your son gets busted for street racing all Fast and Furious style in daddy's car, I'm gonna say, do you know why this happened?
1324721	1327943	Well, so I drove my uncle's Trans Am when I was six.
1329044	1330065	I do have a video.
1330105	1330966	Do I street race?
1332467	1333507	I have lots of video, actually.
1333567	1336930	My brother tried to make me drive his car when I was like 10 and I cried.
1337870	1340431	When I was six, no, he had a Thunderbird.
1340672	1341512	It was great, though.
1341552	1345574	Okay, so I was trying to get some video of him yesterday because he did it yesterday, too.
1346715	1351858	He was driving over these hills in the middle of the desert and was like, I'm going camping.
1352698	1354379	Or we're going to Trader Joe's.
1355640	1357961	Or I'm driving to Safeway.
1358101	1360922	Why does the middle of the desert make your son think about Trader Joe's?
1361023	1361863	No, that was camping.
1362263	1362543	Outro Music
1383289	1383750	or Bus.
1384751	1388435	He thinks it's funny when you can push the Y button to get the guy in and out of the car.
1389436	1390397	He thought that was hilarious.
1390517	1392539	And then he's like, look, it's turning the wheels.
1393900	1398662	WhatUpG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks, Has Loki let him fly a plane yet?
1399443	1399983	Oh, God, no.
1400003	1404986	Because the reason why is he doesn't know how to even drive the car.
1406106	1409468	So flying a plane, it would just be over really fast.
1409528	1410808	And he gets frustrated.
1411589	1416531	If he hits the wall and he can't figure out how to get around it, he just gets frustrated almost immediately.
1416551	1417312	He has no patience.
1417392	1419433	So, yeah, a plane just...
1420393	1421234	I thought that'd be fun.
1421314	1423916	I wanted to give him a boat because, you know, it's the ocean.
1423936	1425197	He's not going to run into anything out there.
1425697	1429960	But he just wanted to drive a car, so let him drive a car.
1431481	1442009	Well, away from the stories about your son playing the game for a minute and back to you playing the game, what is it about the game that makes it so great that you come through the door of the OLR studios and go, Rob, when are you getting Grand Theft Auto V?
1442717	1447921	Well, first off, you like the sandbox games where you can pretty much do whatever you want, and that's this game.
1448322	1452085	And there's a lot of realism to it, or I should say immersion to it.
1452385	1459351	Like, for example, if I run over some dude or something in the mountains, like some hiker, if I just plow over my car.
1459991	1464695	Later on, I may be driving, and I'll hear a news report on the radio saying that a hiker has gone missing.
1464995	1468378	And then they try to get you back because they know what you did that summer.
1469028	1492922	and and there's all sorts of crazy stuff there is a whole thing that has to do with like some hidden letters that you have to collect and there's actually a ghost up in the mountains and stuff and you know there's you know all sorts of crazy acid trips that these guys can go on and is it really funny though because I will say I do like sandbox games but part of the reason why I love Saints Row is that it's so over the top like I don't think I've laughed harder at a video game than I did the opening to Saints Row 3
1493917	1506808	Saints Row is just kind of like, and even playing both, I think the best analogy I've seen was someone said Grand Theft Auto is a parody of reality and Saints Row is a parody of Grand Theft Auto.
1508929	1517036	You can tell that they went into incredible detail with every single thing in this game as far as the immersion with the
1517336	1518778	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1532233	1534294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1554642	1554982	I don't know.
1556503	1558625	I just like all the detail in the game and the writing is really good.
1558705	1559885	The story is really interesting.
1559925	1561486	The characters are very interesting.
1561506	1562967	Especially Trevor is just nuts.
1563688	1571012	And just seeing all the things that go kind of awkward and stuff in the game and all the different conflicts that are there.
1571372	1573093	It's a really interesting storyline.
1573154	1575475	So that's kind of what the draw is, I think.
1575655	1578216	What's next for Grand Theft Auto with the online component?
1578237	1585521	We were talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show, but just to kind of retouch on it a little bit, what do people have to look forward to in a couple weeks when the online part opens up?
1585541	1595726	Well, first off, they said I think there's supposed to be about 700 missions in the game, so you're going to be able to pull heists and do, you know, robberies and all sorts of stuff on top of normal deathmatches and races and that kind of thing.
1596007	1603551	Plus, there's going to be editors in the game to make your own custom content, so you can make custom deathmatch maps, you can make custom races...
1604391	1631834	and that's just the beginning they're eventually going to get it to where you can do custom missions and all other game types and then on top of that they've built the game in a way that it's just going to keep expanding beyond Grand Theft Auto 5 you're not just going to be stuck in San Andreas they're going to have it where you can they can basically increase the size of the map and add new cities and areas as time goes on so it's just going to keep building from there and it sounds exciting
1633803	1635224	Plus getting to play with people again.
1636304	1638325	It's hard to find people for Grand Theft Auto 4 nowadays.
1638665	1640666	And you're on both 360 and PlayStation 3.
1640706	1643207	Yeah, and I'm kind of hoping that they both tie together.
1643227	1644488	Do you have one of those little squads?
1644768	1645888	I see people advertising on Twitter.
1645908	1648249	I do have a crew available.
1648389	1649930	I will link it in the chat room.
1651771	1653291	It's the VOG Network crew.
1655812	1661635	The first thing you probably want to do is get a membership, if you don't have it already, to the Rockstar Social Club.
1662655	1663135	and so on.
1692047	1692248	Awesome.
1693189	1695231	Yeah, so I'm actually trying to see real quick here.
1695892	1696873	I can probably link it.
1696913	1708587	I'll link it on... I had it linked on Twitter at one time, but I'll link it again so we can add everybody before it launches.
1710029	1725521	and I'm sure if it's anything like it has been with the social club stuff so far it may be a little downsy by the time it launches because they've been having little server issues as with anything Any other games besides Grand Theft Auto you want to talk about?
1725621	1725761	Nope
1726561	1728123	Alright, the My Gaming Week.
1728143	1736389	Pretty similar to Loki, I've been focused on mainly one game, and that game is Final Fantasy XIV, which I've talked about ad nauseum in previous weeks, so I won't really get into too much detail.
1736429	1744495	I will just say I'm a level 45 white mage, so I'm getting a little closer to endgame and all the AK runs and Ifrit hard mode and all that.
1745696	1748398	I do love how they wound the story into this game, though.
1748418	1749238	I will say that much.
1750079	1753462	The story really kind of keeps you going, and it's
1754022	1754643	Final Fantasy Cutscenes
1774639	1775840	Fenerus' voice coming out of the Eleven guy.
1797241	1801022	I haven't heard a lot of the voice acting because I'm on Skype a lot when I play the game with friends.
1801202	1802262	So we're just chatting through it.
1803162	1805063	I'll have to do some more live stream of it later.
1805083	1811185	It's just my frame rate really suffers unless I can get on the PlayStation 3 and get one of those boxes that streams or something.
1812746	1819630	Anyhow, I will say outside of Final Fantasy XIV, I sort of discovered a renaissance this week for pinball games.
1819750	1825314	And I think a lot of that is because PlayStation Plus right now is giving away Star Wars pinball with the Plus.
1825354	1827735	So I downloaded that and I was checking out those tables.
1827835	1830457	And I really like the Episode 5 table in particular.
1830657	1831137	Thank you for watching!
1854039	1857161	All of it did because, you know, they had that whole cross thing.
1857461	1861543	So I actually had a reason to play my Vita and I was playing Zen Pinball on the Vita.
1861583	1867086	And I got to say, love, love, love that you can rotate the Vita so that it's a vertical screen.
1867386	1870728	And so you have the vertical play field like you expect a pinball game to be, right?
1870908	1872009	That's nothing new.
1872149	1873470	And you use the touch screen.
1873531	1873991	I know it's not new.
1874011	1875653	The WonderSwan did that.
1876013	1880337	I know it's not new, but okay, how long ago was the WonderSwan and do we ever have it in America?
1880397	1881378	You know I'm giving you crap.
1881598	1885342	I know they did, but the PSP wasn't giving me these games free either.
1885622	1886583	But, well, and...
1886863	1887624	Thanks for watching!
1912085	1914846	And I did find the link for the crew thing.
1915067	1916267	It is just VOG Network.
1916307	1920929	So socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.
1921389	1922510	And that's how you get to it.
1922770	1923870	We already have nine people.
1924270	1931874	And once we get more people, I'll start divvying up where people are because you can actually have a hierarchy of players and stuff.
1933595	1940400	Well, I will briefly mention where a lot of the VOG people are playing Final Fantasy XIV, since I know you've got your game and I've got mine.
1940940	1944483	We are on the Midgarcimer server, and our free company is called End of Line.
1944843	1947085	We have 45 characters in our thing right now.
1947165	1949807	To be fair, a lot of it is like friends of friends.
1949867	1955151	It's not just exclusively people that listen to VOG stuff, but it's a good group of people.
1955712	1957073	And yeah, you can check that out.
1957413	1959735	All the information is at vognetwork.com in the
1960055	1985050	Horde House forums because technically Horde House is my show about online games so everything you need to know is in the Horde House forums at vognetwork.com and you should probably post the Grand Theft Auto stuff to the OLR forum that would be great yeah I was going to at some point I need to create a logo so you know okay once I do that well you know you have a graphic designer right here well no they have a little like app thing so I have to create a logo you have to use their stuff like I just have haven't done it yet fair enough fair enough
1985530	1987072	Alright, well I think that's enough of our gaming week.
1987472	1995360	Housekeeping, I'll just quickly say, don't forget we're on Twitter, twitter.com.com.com and we are on Facebook, facebook.com.com.com Alright, enough talk.
1995380	1998503	We've done a lot of reminiscing about old gaming and new gaming.
1998543	2002326	Let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the industry this week.
2002386	2002627	Loki.
2003187	2006070	Val's going to announce something tomorrow.
2006751	2008913	It's probably going to have something to do with the Steam Box.
2011115	2016040	Gabe was teasing something about a Linux Steam Box last week.
2018285	2019165	I think that's what it is.
2019666	2022928	And it's going to be announced 10 a.m.
2023108	2024729	Pacific time tomorrow.
2026129	2034054	Which is sad because by the time most people hear this, because obviously we have our live audience, but the podcast people will already know what this news is.
2034974	2036695	At least the first of the three announcements.
2036835	2038536	Yes, there's three announcements.
2038696	2042298	There's Circle, Circle in brackets, and Circle plus Circle.
2042919	2043159	So...
2043579	2044259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2059858	2061860	I never really thought of that.
2062700	2063221	It's kind of funny.
2063281	2065683	It actually does look like a stick figure holding up a crowbar.
2065823	2069826	So speculation, just rampant wank speculation on what these announcements could be.
2070586	2073188	I think more information on the Steam box is a given.
2074289	2080434	And I'm going to repeat some of the things I said on the Call on Bobby show because it's my guess and that hasn't changed in 15 minutes or however long it's been.
2082014	2084535	I think Half-Life 3 is not the announcement.
2084555	2087076	I think Left 4 Dead 3 is going to be the announcement.
2087196	2093478	I think that's, you know, they will be hyping up towards a third game in a series, but it's going to be Left 4 Dead 3, which is not bad news.
2094298	2096239	You know, it's been a few years since Left 4 Dead 2.
2096319	2103301	I can see them doing, you know, Steam Box, Left 4 Dead 3 troll announcement, and then, you know, hey, Half-Life 3.
2103721	2111145	No, I kind of think the other announcement, you know, Dota 2 is so huge for Valve right now, especially internationally.
2111205	2114547	I kind of think one of the big three announcements has to be about Dota.
2114907	2122571	And I would think maybe if they announce the Steam Box, maybe there's some way that Dota interface, like, I think they're going to try to get Dota 2 in your living room.
2123712	2127595	So maybe like controller support for Dota or something along those lines?
2127615	2139346	That's cool, but at the same time, the announcement of Half-Life 3 could really throw a monkey wrench into next-gen consoles and stuff like that, and the people's needs for that stuff.
2139446	2145792	I'm interested in a Steam box, depending on what the specs are and what it's able to run, because I do have my laptop, so...
2146693	2155704	I don't necessarily need another gaming PC although my first gaming PC has kind of fallen apart so maybe I do need a new gaming PC.
2156691	2160154	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Rob Roberts, what if Portal 3 is the announcement?
2160655	2168661	You know, I just... Because Valve is so allergic to the number 3, I don't want to say I'd be disappointed if Portal 3 is the announcement.
2168701	2174986	Quite no, but I would be kind of surprised that that's the game they're so quick to go back and visit again.
2175386	2176708	I just would be a little bit surprised.
2176728	2179870	What if it's Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, and Half-Life 3?
2180611	2183253	I think a lot of the internet would probably poop their pants.
2183633	2203684	and rightfully so I think that would be a lot of great news three things about three you know there's also the possibility though that Valve is doing something we haven't heard of yet a completely new IP and I think that would be okay too so yes circle or bracket circle and bracket circle and bracket plus bracket circle plus circle
2205045	2206306	Well, Circle plus Circle.
2206866	2208007	That sounds like Portal to me.
2208467	2210728	Gosh, you're talking about Hollywood squares all of a sudden.
2210768	2211669	Circle gets the square.
2212289	2212569	All right.
2216131	2220213	Portal 3, it would have to be a different test subject.
2221214	2222955	See, now my brain is thinking around all of that.
2223550	2224932	Well, you know, I will say this.
2225693	2232942	Speaking of Dota, which I brought up a minute ago, there's a video circulating where they're going to have a, or it might be out now, the GLaDOS announcer pack for Dota 2.
2233663	2234885	And it's hilarious.
2235626	2237368	I know I linked it on my Twitter earlier this week.
2237388	2238550	It's Oda, the DS silent.
2240892	2243694	They had some hilarious... Oh, God, what was one of the lines?
2244055	2249439	I should try to find it on my Twitter real quick because one of the whole, like, welcome to Dota things was so funny.
2251480	2252961	Oh, gosh, I'm going to try and find this real quick.
2253361	2256304	Anything else you want to say about Portal 3, DarkSakura, while I try to dig this up?
2257464	2260807	No, other than it was pretty cool hearing her in Pacific Rim.
2261980	2262501	Welcome to Dota.
2262761	2265884	Don't forget your little plastic sword and all your chins.
2265924	2267686	A little bit of shade from GLaDOS there.
2285174	2285734	I love that.
2285794	2286194	Play it again.
2287515	2288115	Play it again?
2288135	2288975	Yeah, play it again.
2289496	2289956	I love her.
2290036	2290676	She's such a sassy bitch.
2290696	2292457	Don't forget your plastic sword and all your chins.
2292497	2292777	Hold on.
2292817	2293097	Here we go.
2293157	2293737	One more time.
2294037	2295218	Welcome to Dota.
2296138	2299599	Don't forget your little plastic sword and all your chins.
2300619	2303060	This video is like 21 minutes of GLaDOS.
2303080	2303501	There's more.
2303761	2305461	And your giant flagon of gravy.
2305781	2307862	Welcome to Medieval Times.
2308382	2309863	How many in your party tonight?
2311751	2313072	I love it.
2313092	2314413	That would make me play the game.
2314433	2316134	Doesn't that make you want to play Dota 2?
2316234	2318496	Yes, just for that sassy bitch.
2318916	2321498	By the way, I have to sort of derail a little bit.
2322099	2323860	Did you see the person cosplaying GLaDOS?
2325841	2328864	There was video and pictures up of this girl.
2329084	2330685	A lot of people cosplay GLaDOS, but yes.
2330845	2334848	No, no, not doing the whole anthropomorphic version.
2335248	2336589	Hanging from a harness.
2338271	2340073	With the mask and everything.
2341414	2344217	And moving around and everything and doing the voice and all that.
2344618	2345118	That was cool.
2348003	2356706	Some folks in chat are, as far as the threes go, I see GameGuru says Team Fortress 3 could be a possibility.
2356766	2361167	But Actdeft follows that up saying, Guru, I don't see Valve making a Team Fortress 3 anytime soon.
2361487	2364168	It does seem like they are still adding every day to Team Fortress 2.
2364608	2367349	It would seem a little soon for a three.
2368889	2372533	More hats, more tie-ins to other products, more like.
2372933	2377657	All right, well, moving on to another company, I want to talk a little bit about what Microsoft talked about this week.
2378338	2382002	They were at Tokyo Game Show, believe it or not, showing off some things going on there.
2382702	2393633	One of the things that was talked about, though, that unfortunately yet another perceived negative for Microsoft's system was in a quote from Albert Piniello, who's the Senior Director of Product Management.
2393693	2393973	Quote,
2394293	2396614	We don't support vertical orientation.
2396734	2398135	Do it at your own risk.
2398616	2399976	It wouldn't be a cooling problem.
2399996	2401837	We just didn't design the drive for vertical.
2402178	2405399	Because it's a slot loading drive, we just didn't design it for both.
2406080	2408101	I don't think this is a big deal whatsoever.
2408521	2412503	I only bring it up because I saw it all over Twitter and Facebook.
2413124	2416706	So people are talking about this, but I'm going to be honest.
2417466	2433003	I kind of think if you're out there going oh my god Microsoft fucks up again you can't have your thing vertical kind of think you're looking for a reason to dump on Microsoft at this point I don't think it's that big a deal it's not going to throw off the feng shui of your living room cabinet or something
2433303	2434804	Well, it's the size of a cable box anyways.
2434864	2436145	I mean, you'll stack your cable box.
2436166	2438367	But I'm just saying, you know, and who cares?
2438427	2442271	So it doesn't stand up or whatever.
2443372	2447595	The whole thing is because idiots before kept knocking it over and they had a whole issue with that.
2448136	2450878	Blaming it on the slot-loading disk drive is kind of dumb.
2451138	2454421	I would just say it's because you guys are fucking idiots and you keep knocking that shit over.
2454441	2455101	I mean, look at the 360.
2455142	2455402	You guys...
2457563	2460344	Doesn't the Wii have a slot drive and most people put that vertically?
2460364	2463165	The Wii has a slot drive, the PlayStation 4 has a slot drive.
2463465	2466506	But the Wii also has that little cradle so it's a little harder to knock it over.
2467447	2469887	Yeah, but you know, plastic's expensive.
2470087	2470428	I know.
2470468	2473749	And I think that thing probably weighs a metric ton, so you know.
2473949	2475609	But I just, I don't, I don't know.
2475689	2479731	I mean, there are some people that are legitimately like, I like to have my consoles vertical, blah, blah, blah.
2479771	2485353	The Xbox One is about the size of an original Xbox Duke controller, so it's...
2486773	2487333	I can see why.
2487394	2488694	But yeah, come on.
2488834	2491716	It looks like it'd be very unstable standing up sideways.
2491977	2503805	If you want to stand it up sideways, assuming that it still would work that way, I'm sure that there would be a third-party solution to brace that thing up so that it doesn't fall over.
2504685	2508347	They just don't want you to knock it off your shelf.
2508787	2509828	Remember, cats are evil.
2509868	2511008	They will knock that shit over.
2511028	2512909	No, they'll throw up on your rug.
2513570	2514030	Well, both.
2514090	2514750	They will do both.
2514790	2517412	They will knock it over, then they'll throw up on it and on your rug.
2518012	2519893	Well, another interesting quote from Mr. Piniello.
2520293	2524095	Quote, we found, interestingly enough, that 80% of people, believe it or not,
2524460	2526941	have their Xbox 360 horizontally.
2527301	2529081	I will have you know that I'm not part of the 80%.
2529161	2534003	I have vertical all the way, unless it's near my cat, in which case it's horizontal.
2534983	2536744	I have my 360 horizontal.
2537124	2538864	Most of my consoles go horizontal.
2538884	2545106	The only one that didn't was the Wii, and that's because I sort of got the perception that that was designed to go vertical.
2545406	2548247	But Wii U doesn't go vertical, if I remember right, right?
2548407	2549667	It's like rounded on the edges.
2549707	2550648	You can't stand that thing.
2550668	2551248	That sounds like a challenge.
2551268	2551688	Yes, you can.
2552388	2552928	Well, okay.
2552949	2553549	With putty.
2553669	2555390	You really shouldn't stand it up.
2555710	2556590	You can make a stand.
2557791	2558932	Alright, now you're making it a challenge.
2559232	2562053	Well, I'm sure it's like they're saying here about the Xbox One.
2562353	2564555	Do it at your own risk.
2564755	2567976	Throw your Wii U down a flight of stairs and set it on fire for all we care.
2567996	2568317	You know what?
2568357	2570078	Mine's actually horizontal.
2571498	2573499	Just because of how... You've seen the shelves in my house.
2573880	2575861	That's how they... And then the cat sits on it.
2579194	2579594	All right.
2580275	2582495	Ziba in chat says, mine is vertical too.
2582755	2584176	So let's see.
2584216	2590697	Tiger Claw says, I remember when the PlayStation 1 had trouble reading discs and the only fix, putting it upside down.
2590717	2591298	That's right.
2591318	2591918	I remember that too.
2592058	2592378	Oh, yes.
2592758	2593658	And then, no, no, no, no.
2593698	2594559	There was the other fix.
2595139	2595659	Sideways.
2596819	2600160	When you did have to hold that thing vertically.
2601380	2606942	I remember people would use paper clips or something to hold the door open, basically.
2607302	2608383	That was for the swap trick.
2608523	2609083	Oh, my bad.
2609583	2610024	Yeah.
2610844	2612465	Back in the day.
2613346	2614306	Oh, boy.
2614326	2614827	Spring.
2615787	2616228	Oh, no, no.
2616248	2617208	We did it old school.
2617228	2618249	We had the paperclip.
2618629	2622011	We figured out the right way to bend the paperclip so that we could just go thump.
2622311	2625653	I remember when you got me that little cartridge that plugged into the back of the PlayStation 1.
2625693	2627194	Yes, we ordered like, what, 50 of them?
2627494	2628975	Not 50, but we ordered a bunch of them.
2628995	2632557	Those things were awesome, and I never had a problem playing import games after that.
2632637	2634038	Yeah, those things were awesome.
2634278	2634919	Anyhow, moving on.
2635956	2637838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2652715	2658978	But Blizzard is going to be closing down Diablo 3's auction house and that's going to happen on March 18th next year.
2660299	2674326	Their actual statement saying that, and I'm quoting, it became increasingly clear that despite the benefits of the auction house system and the fact that many players around the world use it, it ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay, kill monsters and get cool loot.
2675106	2680669	With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've decided to remove the gold and real money auction house system from Diablo 3.
2684533	2687515	So that means it's... Does that still need to be connected online?
2687535	2694019	Because, you know... People are jumping to that conclusion that that will be the next thing that happens, but we don't know for sure.
2694099	2700922	But that was the crutch that they were... That was why it had to be online, was to preserve the integrity of the auction house.
2700963	2702403	So now we just don't know.
2702964	2710548	But it would be logical that in a later patch, they're going to say, you know, we're going to patch out the Always Online requirement.
2710988	2711869	That would be great.
2711889	2712810	Then I'd play it again.
2712910	2714311	I wonder if that wouldn't be a quiet thing.
2714491	2716672	Or maybe they'll do it under LAN play.
2716792	2722837	I think that would be huge if they were to do a patch that not only removes the auction house, but then does LAN play without Battle.net.
2723037	2723878	I mean, that would be huge.
2724698	2725619	But I don't know.
2726169	2728370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2748121	2749562	They're also saying something else, too.
2749582	2750483	I'm going to read this quote.
2751104	2759851	We feel that this move, along with the Loot 2.0 system being developed concurrently with Reaper of Souls, will result in much more rewarding game experience for our players.
2760591	2766056	So I think that they're looking to change quite a few things about the way it plays.
2766176	2769178	There's definitely kind of a soft reboot of the game happening here.
2769959	2771180	It might be enough to make me play it again.
2771380	2772020	Diablo 3, Diablo 3, Diablo 3
2790713	2795416	It's weird for me because I did play Diablo 3 like the whole way through.
2795496	2795977	I beat it.
2796077	2796917	I played enough of it.
2797338	2803942	It's really weird to go from clicky fest to like aiming because like you don't have a mouse.
2804362	2805103	So you aim.
2805843	2807304	and it locks on to monsters.
2807684	2809566	It's just a different way of playing the same game.
2809606	2810787	It's really weird.
2811107	2811847	But I liked it.
2812268	2813288	But it is just really different.
2813308	2815230	And the inventory system is completely different too.
2815250	2818592	I mean, they really had to change everything to support the controller.
2818812	2823436	Now, what if they had a controller version for the PC?
2824136	2828159	Like, would you still keep playing on PC if you could do it with a controller?
2828659	2836768	Um, no, at this point I prefer the mouse because that's just the way I played the game and I think it is a different balance between controller and mouse.
2836849	2838370	I don't see them mixing those.
2838791	2843296	I don't think they're going to mix the console version with the PC version, but, um,
2843616	2845477	I am interested enough in the console version.
2845517	2852482	My problem is that $60 price tag when I already have the game on PC, no matter if I got it for free or what have you.
2854123	2860007	You're not quite the target audience since you already own the PC version.
2860027	2860427	You're right.
2860467	2861508	I'm not the target audience.
2861948	2862949	But I will say this.
2863029	2865491	I'm very interested in PlayStation 4 version.
2866151	2870452	and hopefully the inevitable price cut three months after it's out version.
2870492	2874933	How does it look visually compared to the PC version considering that they're going to have a PlayStation 4 version?
2874973	2877194	I can't imagine that you'd be able to improve.
2877414	2881555	The resolution's not quite as crisp to me as it is on PC.
2882415	2887576	I even see that in Final Fantasy XIV a little bit and I think a lot of that just depends on what video card you're packing.
2887936	2891279	I saw it a lot in Final Fantasy XIV looking at the videos.
2891979	2898564	Because I found some high-res playthrough videos from the PS3.
2898964	2900545	But I have my maxed all the way.
2900565	2902187	And it looks amazing.
2903506	2904787	It doesn't look bad by any means.
2905068	2911273	You have to get really nitpicky, but I would see where they could probably make some graphical improvements on PlayStation 4.
2914295	2918018	I'll be checking that out later, but I'm happy to hear about the removal of the Auction House.
2918979	2921801	I don't think that many people were using it, to be honest.
2922082	2923543	No, I'm totally with that.
2925383	2926063	All right, let's move on.
2926423	2926663	Loki.
2927424	2927724	All right.
2928484	2932386	So let's talk a little bit about Blizzard again.
2932766	2949134	And this kind of ties in with, I think we were talking about it a few weeks ago, where they were, Vividi was trying to kind of separate themselves from Activision Blizzard and kind of drum up some money, I guess, by selling their shares and that kind of stuff.
2950114	2956899	Um, however, that's been kind of halted because there's a lawsuit taking place in Delaware.
2957759	2962882	Apparently, I guess one of the, some of the shareholders didn't like the idea.
2962962	2969987	I think they said basically the shareholder has sued the company to prevent this from happening, claiming that it's a huge waste and
2970367	3000022	and meant to cover a power grab and so because of that the court actually halted it right now and basically in order for it to continue they have to appeal and get a majority vote from the non-Vivendi stockholders so interesting that that kind of happened now I'm not really sure what as far as like a power like power grab thing supposed to be I don't understand their angle there with that
3000563	3003604	I'm not sure I see it either, and I kind of don't think this is going to go much of anywhere.
3005525	3017689	It is interesting to bring this up immediately after that previous story, because some are speculating, tinfoil hat, that the removal of the Diablo 3 auction house is directly tied to the fact they're not with Vivendi anymore.
3017749	3025312	Now that they're a little more independent, per se, that they dropped it, even though they are still part of Activision, but maybe Vivendi was the real problem.
3025512	3035237	Yeah, see, that's what I thought with, like, you know, the kind of go completely different game, different company, with Deep Silver, or I should say THQ and Saints Row.
3035477	3041120	That's what I thought with all the DLC whoring, that, oh, it was THQ making the, you know, Volition do that kind of shit.
3041960	3045542	And then Saints Row 4 came out, and they whored the DLC just as much, so...
3047168	3049109	I was proven wrong there, so who knows.
3049889	3056873	Although you have to admit, that free GAT5 DLC on Tuesday was brilliant.
3057814	3058474	It's not brilliant.
3058614	3059415	It seriously is not.
3061095	3062356	No, I understand the joke.
3062416	3063217	I understand the joke.
3063277	3064617	Yeah, haha, it's funny.
3064677	3071281	It's GAT5, and we're going to confuse people with the hashtag, and oh, it's going to be hilarious and stuff, and then...
3071641	3090019	and then the game sells 800 million dollars worth and then they kind of quiet and go into a corner because you know it's just cool yeah cool it's fun to poke fun at Grand Theft Auto you know because your game started off as kind of a clone of it and um
3092340	3095864	The problem is they have these little DLC packs and I understand it's free for a day.
3095984	3097306	And I did download it because it's free.
3097606	3098948	I'm not going to pass up some of them for free.
3100249	3107076	It's just $2.99 here, $2.99 there, $2.99 there for all stuff that's already in the game.
3107136	3108358	It's just being unlocked.
3109058	3109458	Come on.
3109658	3132807	I mean, and I'm really waiting to see what the first DLC pack was because if it's anything as far as like sparse and content like it was with the third, I'm just, I may be done with the series just because I don't like that kind of practice where it's just, we're just not, we're going to totally just drop the ball and not give a shit and push stuff out really fast and try to make a quick buck because it shows.
3133747	3148340	Alright, well moving on, let's go to another story, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5 and Saints Row 4 will not be on this console, but maybe later, we'll see, and the PlayStation 4, of course, is out in a couple weeks, and some live streamers
3148800	3149240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3177998	3187343	have the PlayStation 4 through HDMI, their capture box, but there was a concern that would not work because on the PlayStation 3, you can't do that right now.
3187403	3191906	You can't capture through HDMI unless you do some nefarious HDMI.
3192266	3193787	It's component to HDMI.
3194007	3197849	Yeah, a lot of folks do component cables instead and capture that way and stream that way.
3197869	3200750	Yeah, because that's what I have to do with my Elgato.
3201931	3203572	They have a special adapter that you plug in.
3203877	3206961	Well, live streamers around the world, I'm sure happy to hear this week.
3207302	3215473	Brad Douglas, who's the head of third-party relations at Sony, said the PlayStation 4 will support video capture via HDMI.
3216314	3217956	Now, my question is...
3219017	3223939	I always thought it was the Blu-ray's fault that a lot of this was blocked on the PlayStation 3.
3224859	3230041	So have they figured out a way on the PlayStation 4 to enable the encoding when it's in Blu-ray mode?
3230061	3231642	Because I would think that's a given.
3231682	3236704	I would think that even though this news is out there, they've got to not allow you to put the Blu-rays up.
3236744	3237564	It's too easy.
3237644	3241425	They probably found a way to turn on and off the HD encryption thing.
3243166	3253612	So my real question, building on that, and yes, I'm being tinfoil hat again, but if they can turn it on and off at will, what's to say this is going to be any different from the built-in Twitch streaming at the end of the day?
3255493	3259596	What do you mean?
3259616	3263318	If they can turn it off and on, won't they be able to turn it off when they want?
3263378	3266840	Let's say a developer doesn't want the ending of the game broadcast, can't they shut it off?
3267737	3269198	Hmm, maybe.
3269859	3271320	I guess it's possible.
3272541	3287973	Also important to put out there, one of the big reasons why people want to do their own HDMI grabs, it's for, I guess I shouldn't really say it's the Twitch TV people, but a lot of the YouTube people who want to record a gigantic amount of footage and then edit through it later on, that's the real thing.
3288753	3289174	and DarkSakura.
3304967	3305408	DarkSakura,
3319904	3321426	I mean, they're not going to do that.
3321486	3322707	It's a fucking HDMI in.
3322887	3327072	That's like saying, hey, I just learned that I can plug my PlayStation 4 into the wall.
3327192	3335962	Yes, actually, if you put a PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One, Nedry will come up on the screen and go, ah, ah, ah, you didn't say the magic word.
3336322	3337083	Ah, ah, ah.
3337984	3339346	That reference straight out of 1994, y'all.
3339366	3339626	Look it up.
3341468	3346151	Hey, to be fair, they did a 3D re-release not too long ago, so it is somewhat rare.
3346832	3347272	Fair enough.
3347372	3348593	And there's going to be a fourth movie.
3348793	3352355	As long as we don't have any fucking gymnastic people in that.
3352796	3353476	It should be all good.
3356789	3358831	I wanna see them go a little ridiculous with that.
3358871	3362734	I want, like, you know, raptors in trench coats and stuff, and they're like, oh, clever girl.
3362794	3365976	Okay, obviously we're talking about Jurassic Park, so obviously we blew the cover on that.
3366296	3376424	I gotta say, though, Jurassic Park 4, I wanted to either be, like, really good like the first one was, which is, I enjoyed the first movie, say what you will, but at the time, you know, when I was in high school and that came out, that movie was awesome, right?
3377005	3379707	Or I wanted to be, like, over-the-top showgirls bad.
3379727	3380027	Yeah.
3381877	3383958	but you know what?
3384858	3388859	I'm thinking with the technology today, we can have it both and you know why?
3389159	3410264	It's because you have Jurassic Park 4 and say that'll be a great movie or something, let's just hope that it is a great movie and then you have Asylum putting out like Cretaceous Park 5 or something like that and that'll be fucking terrible Okay, good point Or the sci-fi movie Dinosaur Hurricane I don't know
3410952	3417233	Actdeft in chat, piggybacking on this whole, not the Jurassic Park part, but the whole Sony PlayStation 4 on an Xbox One.
3417634	3419434	Actdeft in chat says, what's next?
3419674	3421795	Sony making computers with Windows in them?
3422775	3423475	Oh my gosh.
3424755	3425175	Oh my gosh.
3425535	3428916	Or Sony developing apps for Microsoft Windows?
3429316	3429556	No.
3430236	3430676	Shame.
3434277	3435318	All right, let's move on.
3435358	3437278	DarkSakura, you got a story and then release dates.
3437972	3439933	I might.
3440173	3442234	I hate mobile sites so much.
3443814	3444775	I'm telling you, Chrome.
3444795	3446215	You can do the desktop sites on Chrome.
3446676	3448776	Yeah, but I'm opening the links out of email.
3449797	3451337	Well, that's your problem.
3452318	3455299	Well, it's going to be everyone's problem because the stupid thing doesn't want to load.
3455679	3457140	Can't you change it to default browser?
3457340	3457620	Oh, wait.
3457680	3458040	I'm sorry.
3458080	3458600	It's iOS.
3460781	3462482	I think you can in the new one, can't you?
3463222	3463883	I could be wrong.
3464603	3464903	I don't know.
3465856	3466356	There we go.
3466717	3468038	Have you played with iOS 7, Loki?
3468678	3469799	Fuck no, I haven't updated.
3470079	3474582	My iPod is seriously like... I don't even know if iOS 7 supports my iPod.
3474602	3475343	I have an iPod Touch 4.
3475403	3476804	No, it won't.
3476844	3478986	I think they said, Ah, fuck you!
3479506	3480827	Ah, fuck you!
3480987	3481447	Sorry, Jamie.
3481467	3482468	I was trying to buy you time.
3482828	3483149	Thank you.
3483909	3486130	Well, we did tease this at the start of the show.
3486830	3491752	And we've talked about before about the state of Atlas that they filed for bankruptcy.
3493433	3498675	Their debt was 2.45 billion yen, which is quite a bit of money.
3499236	3499676	And so...
3501701	3506283	The company that's come out on top for the purchase is Sega Sammy.
3507224	3509605	Or, I just like to say Sega.
3510065	3512306	Because we all know who's wearing the pants in that relationship.
3512887	3514848	Or as we all like to say growing up, Sega!
3516601	3520504	Pretty good that they bought somebody because they don't have anything fucking coming out.
3521005	3521425	Nothing.
3521726	3524428	Sagan needs to buy their building back in San Francisco.
3524448	3532375	They're the one company that sends me updates to their release calendar every week on Friday.
3532495	3532915	Every week.
3533296	3535258	And there's always, no changes have been made.
3535638	3536719	No changes have been made.
3537099	3538000	Nothing is coming out.
3539068	3551579	Well, at any rate, it came out on Nikkei that they are going to be acquiring the whole thing for 14 billion yen, which is roughly 141 million dollars to purchase the company.
3557066	3566651	So, this probably means that we might see them continuing with the Shin Megami Tensei games.
3567851	3568471	That's a given.
3568852	3569092	Yeah.
3569472	3572993	But I can't wait for the crossovers with other Sega games.
3573254	3579036	You know, when there's the inevitable Sega racing with Danica Patrick in the cast of Persona 5.
3579837	3580897	That would be so weird.
3582378	3582578	So...
3586222	3590906	Technus in chat says Sega Atlas, and Fifth Dream says Atlas Sega.
3591107	3599314	But anyway, the company itself hasn't made the announcement on it yet, but it is public on Nikkei, so take it for what you will.
3600475	3610924	Some folks disappointed, I don't know how to really use that word in this context, but some folks were disappointed slash surprised slash I don't know that it wasn't Nintendo that
3611164	3612084	Who bought Atlus?
3613365	3621368	Thinking that Nintendo might want to grab Persona as an exclusive for the Wii U and DS and so forth would have been a pretty big thing.
3621448	3623308	So any thoughts on that?
3623388	3625389	Why maybe Nintendo didn't decide to do it?
3626127	3631189	I think Nintendo's got their own thing going on.
3631909	3637731	If they're going to purchase a company, my thought is that they would purchase one that has a little bit more that would work with them.
3638331	3646734	And given that Nintendo's already been working with Sega, it doesn't mean that we're going to see any fewer Atlus games come out on...
3652955	3654475	Brain Fart, and Nintendo Systems.
3655556	3658596	I think also it's just that they don't sell a lot of copies.
3659816	3664137	People recognize it and it's definitely a series that a lot of hardcore gamers are into.
3665178	3672119	They have a lot of series that hardcore gamers are into but their best selling game is just kind of moderate selling for any other company.
3672179	3673679	That's the thing.
3673919	3681021	I think to buy the company for a lot of money doesn't make any sense because you're not going to make your money back very fast.
3681881	3709376	so that's probably why and I mean if you think about it it's not going to make anything really exclusive because most of the games come out on 3DS and stuff anyways PlayStation 3 occasionally but I don't think I don't know maybe it would you know coax them into making more games for the Wii U or a game for the Wii U because they don't have any so I don't know alright well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
3711088	3714450	Okay, so in the U.S., there's a few games coming out.
3715050	3721693	They have this Batman Arkham bundle, which is the last two Batman Arkham games, Arkham City and Arkham Asylum.
3722634	3726015	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 on DS and 3DS.
3726196	3728497	Did that movie necessitate a sequel?
3728957	3731538	Apparently from a small company called GameMill.
3731618	3732198	Yes, it did.
3732639	3732859	Okay.
3733840	3735701	Movie tie-in games do well in 3DS.
3735982	3742107	Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and of course not to be left out.
3743068	3751637	FIFA 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Vita, well technically it's FIFA 12 but they've re-skinned it a few times.
3752117	3752877	So, FIFA 14.
3752917	3755058	Totally brand new edition.
3756098	3759419	Armored Core Verdict Day on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3759959	3764561	Scribblenauts Unmasked, a DC Comics adventure on Wii U and 3DS.
3765801	3778025	And last but not least, if you are looking to pick up a 3DS XL system, there is one for Pokemon X and Y. Or, I should say two.
3779065	3780326	One blue and one red.
3780886	3784387	Those are coming out on the 27th, which is Friday.
3786108	3786488	All right.
3787789	3790990	Shall we travel to Japan together and look at some release dates there?
3791170	3791750	I wish.
3791790	3793731	There's a lot coming out on the 26th.
3793911	3795011	I hope you all are ready.
3795292	3797672	There's a heck of a lot of games on September 26th.
3797732	3799253	So here we go on the PlayStation 3.
3800273	3806016	Arcadius no Ikashuhime, Armored Core Verdict Day and Regular and Collector's Edition.
3806756	3810558	Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kiseke comes out in regular and limited edition.
3811558	3814319	Iu Sen Hime comes out in regular and limited edition.
3815000	3817821	Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate in regular and premium box.
3818501	3822843	And Ore no Emoto ga Kona ni Kawaii Waka no Nai.
3822883	3824924	Oh, I can't believe my sister's that cute.
3825484	3827145	That was a funny anime.
3827745	3832371	So that, well, if you want, there's the HD Complete Box version of that, which I imagine the anime included.
3832531	3836797	The anime is basically this guy whose little sister likes to play dating sims.
3837378	3841102	But the ones in particular that she likes are Big Brother Little Sister Dating Sims.
3843085	3844126	That sounds awkward.
3844307	3845969	It is, but it is hilarious.
3846309	3851892	I'm also quite, like, I'm just, like, blown away for a minute by the fact that, like, you understood me speaking Japanese.
3851992	3854633	Like, I'm getting a little, like, wow.
3854753	3869380	Like, I always thought it was the big joke that I can't pronounce any of these names, but... Well, it was certain things, certain parts of the... Well, when I heard... The moment you said Ore no Emoto, I was like, oh, God, is he going to say... And then the moment you said Kawaii, I was like, oh, yeah, that's it.
3870380	3870761	Fair enough.
3871001	3871181	Yeah.
3871281	3873542	All right, Painkiller Hell and Damnation...
3874520	3877121	That sounds like a Loki kind of game there on PlayStation.
3877161	3880362	These are all still PlayStation 3 and all on September 26th.
3881082	3887844	Ruha Tomo Wo Yobu in regular and limited and Shutsu Geki Otometashi no Senjo 2.
3887944	3891285	That's a price reduction, however, so don't get too excited about that.
3893649	3899150	To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase TOWER.
3899950	3902551	On the Xbox 360, far less to look forward to.
3902771	3907552	Armored Core Verdict Day and Painkiller Hell and Damnation come out there.
3908192	3912113	I'm trying to see if Painkiller is a riff on a franchise we have here.
3912273	3913273	I don't recognize this.
3913293	3916034	No, Painkiller is a game that came out a while ago on PC.
3916354	3920515	Painkiller Hell and Damnation also came out as well.
3921495	3924736	It's a really hard game, like, first-person shooter in hell.
3925317	3927297	And you have, like, all sorts of crazy weapons and stuff.
3927898	3934140	But, yeah, it's also out here on PlayStation 3 at some point as well.
3934920	3936541	All right, we'll go into the PlayStation Vita.
3936721	3939502	DJ Max Technica Toon gets a price reduction in Japan.
3939562	3940842	That's the Japanese version.
3940902	3944124	Those of you interested in importing it, though, might want to take the opportunity.
3944844	3947305	Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate in regular and premium.
3947885	3949946	Ruha Tomo Wo Yobu.
3950826	3962910	comes out as well, and Io Densetsu Sin no Kiseke comes out, and there's a bunch of little things, like the stickers for the Vita and those types of things, to celebrate the release of that game.
3963510	3969512	On the Wii U this week, Dragon Quest X has a new version, like a new price version out this week.
3970132	3978395	Epic Mickey 2 Futsatsu no Shikara, that's their version of Epic Mickey 2, but of course localized for Japan, is out there, and then The Legend of Zelda 2,
3978775	3983537	Kazeno Takuto HD, which of course is... Anybody?
3983957	3985978	Wind... Wind Waker?
3986098	3986878	Wind Waker.
3987318	3988259	I just knew wind.
3989559	3993041	And on the Nintendo 3DS, again, a lot of games this week in Japan.
3993061	3994881	We've gone through like three weeks of a dry spell, though.
3995622	4006146	Epic Mickey on the 3DS, Gardening Mama on the 3DS, Makai Oji Dario no Hiho comes out in regular and limited edition, and...
4006906	4008587	some Puyo Puyo stickers.
4008967	4011348	There's no game, just stickers.
4012328	4013168	Thought you'd enjoy that.
4014429	4016970	How about Tokimeki Memorial Girls Side Triple Pack?
4017230	4021292	It has all three Tokimeki Memorial games on the 3DS all in one.
4022252	4023493	All the girls side games.
4025733	4026174	That's it.
4027194	4028314	How about the UK, Loki?
4029475	4029855	Loki?
4030795	4031476	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
4031496	4032696	I don't look like her, I'm sorry.
4033436	4034337	Jeez, Rob.
4035703	4037664	I just wanted to hear about more shooters in hell.
4037744	4038065	Sorry.
4038765	4041847	Well, on the 24th, we have Alien Rage.
4042868	4048291	And on the 26th, there's Shadow Warrior on PC and Train Simulator 2014.
4049152	4058838	On the 27th, Armored Core Verdict Today, FIFA 14, and Inazuma 11-3 Lightning Bolt slash Bomb Blast.
4059659	4060099	That's it.
4061445	4061745	WeSports in HD
4080445	4085969	Let me pause for a second and let that sink in because I don't really see how Ichi is going to improve this.
4086069	4088030	But sure, why not?
4089211	4094415	Anyways, so they're going to have Wii Sports, which is not a bad thing because people play Nintendo for Wii Sports nowadays.
4095175	4099098	And it's coming to the eShop on November 7th.
4099958	4102300	And they're going to start with a few games.
4102580	4104942	And so they're going to start with Boxing.
4105743	4106564	WeSportsResort.com
4122484	4126748	and online multiplayer versus mode.
4126948	4128009	Okay, that's pretty cool.
4128990	4131692	Nintendo's going online with something.
4131733	4133795	That's always exciting because it never fucking happens.
4134595	4139000	It says it'll allow players to register and create state or regional clubs.
4139020	4145306	It says people will be able to play casually against members of their own club or take on rival clubs.
4146126	4172614	and then Wii Sports Club I guess they have this weird thing that you can do as well if you don't want to buy the games outright they can 24 hour period to trial or try the games that are available after the trial there's a day pass available for $1.99 or permanent purchase for $10 per individual sport it's a little high if you ask me well it's what five games
4173427	4180472	Yeah, I mean, when you consider that no one plays baseball and no one really plays... Well, I kind of like that, that, you know, let's be real.
4180572	4185696	I only want the tennis and the bowling, as I'm sure a lot... There's a few people who want the others, but I only want the tennis and the bowling.
4186136	4187618	And those are the ones I want to play online.
4187658	4190700	So that's kind of nice that I can only buy those.
4191480	4197245	And it's really fascinating to me that they are basically opening up the idea of...
4197625	4198025	and DarkSakura.com.
4220587	4221788	Here's something else they're testing.
4222128	4227090	Wii Fit U. So Wii Fit U is going to be available November 1st as a download.
4228690	4232131	And then later on, December 13th, they'll be coming out as a bundle.
4232692	4238094	And so November 1st, you will have one month to demo the game.
4238594	4241095	And that's if you have a Wii Balance board.
4241515	4248998	And then if you decide and you like the game, then you need to purchase a Fit Meter, which is their little pedometer thing that's going to tie into it.
4250358	4268546	and then I guess the fit meter is priced at 20 bucks and that's also coming out on November 1st and then once you have that if you want to buy the package you know that's going to be coming I guess December 13th and then the full game download is coming February 1st it's a little different I guess
4270123	4272224	So how's your Wii Fit board holding up?
4272424	4281969	Yeah, my Wii Fit balance board right now, true story, is propping up the television you see over there because you'll notice it has to be propped up a bit to get over the sound board.
4282369	4286051	We didn't have anything that was just the right height except the Wii balance board.
4286351	4286971	Thanks for watching!
4307543	4312425	Well, and it's kind of fascinating to me that it's like, all right, so here's the deal, yo.
4313346	4319968	If you had Wii Fit before, you get it on this day, and it's like free for a month, but then if you want to keep it, you've got to buy this thing.
4320349	4324010	But if you don't have any of it, we'll have it all out on this day, and then you can download it on this.
4324310	4328552	I'm like, I've gone cross-eyed from how weird.
4328572	4329993	They're trying to get return customers.
4330529	4356979	well yeah and I don't like I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad idea but it's the whole thing is just very like it's not what I expect out of Nintendo at all I guess that's a good thing though because if you think about it that means if I was a supporter of Wii Fit I can get this upgrade for 20 bucks and let's be real it's probably not going to be much different than the Wii versions it will be an upgrade that incorporates the pedometer or what have you so it's
4357459	4365402	It's kind of refreshing that I can get that for $20, assuming my stinking balance board will still work after having a TV sitting on it for two years.
4366603	4368323	Didn't I try to borrow it once and it didn't work?
4368823	4370784	Hey, here's a fantastic idea.
4370964	4373145	I mean, it's just so out there and crazy.
4373525	4377607	Why don't they fucking have it tie in with the 3DS that has a goddamn pedometer built into it?
4378047	4380648	Oh, but that would be too fucking difficult for them now, would it?
4381488	4385412	I would imagine what they're really going after are those like the, what are they called?
4385432	4385993	The Fitbits?
4386714	4389136	The things that people can wear on their hands like the bracelets?
4389317	4390218	That's what they're going after, right?
4390238	4392880	That makes me think of, what was the thing they used to have?
4393021	4393881	The monitor?
4394782	4395543	Oh hell, I don't remember.
4395563	4396464	The Genki monitor or something?
4396504	4397265	Yeah, something like that.
4398246	4399387	Yankee Monitor?
4399447	4400067	I don't know.
4423620	4432307	I know what you're talking about, but there was another game that came with two little pedometers and you plugged it into your DS or something and it said, you walked 500 steps today.
4432687	4435869	Let's upload it to the internet and see how far the world has walked to the moon.
4436090	4437311	Would you walk 500 miles?
4437371	4438331	It was like a non-game game.
4438551	4439812	You know what that makes me think of?
4439912	4440373	Oh my God.
4440593	4442634	It makes me think of Noby Noby Boy on my phone.
4443075	4443535	Kind of.
4443615	4449760	Because you have to make him grow and then he has to reach girl or it's how long it takes girl to reach earth or some shit.
4450750	4452432	DarkTetsuya says, walk it out.
4452673	4454414	That was the one that was the Konami game, I believe.
4456156	4462563	And then VXChaseXV says, I want Pokemon Pikachu pedometer integration.
4463324	4464245	That was a thing too.
4464285	4465066	I forgot about that.
4465126	4466708	One of the Pokemon games had that thing too.
4466728	4468750	I miss my Pikachu.
4470712	4477179	Alright, anyhow, let's talk about this as long as we're on Nintendo because this news gets me very excited.
4478120	4486168	I want this version of the game to happen and it's Soul Calibur 2 HD on the Wii U. Sit down, it's not confirmed yet.
4486548	4504216	But what is being talked about is that GamesRadar talked to Namco Bandai at a pre-Tokyo Game Show event, I believe, to see if the development team would consider bringing Soul Calibur 2 HD to the Wii U. Because as you know right now, the game is only coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
4504657	4509559	But I think many of us remember the GameCube version as being the definitive version because it had Link.
4510399	4510760	Remember?
4511320	4515702	So even though it's cool that, you know, Spawn and Heihachi are going to be in the other ones...
4515962	4516583	We want Link!
4517083	4518185	And we want it on Nintendo.
4518585	4523751	So GamesRadar was told that if the game does well, it's a possibility.
4524352	4528236	They even encouraged people to spam the producers' Twitter if they're interested.
4530474	4532896	It doesn't have anything to do with the fucking popularity of the game.
4532917	4537602	It has to fucking do with the fact that there's not a lot of console sales.
4537742	4548615	And I'm betting that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 probably fucking bombed on the Wii U. That's why it's not coming to the goddamn Wii U. It's not because they just...
4549256	4556198	Yeah, but if they're writing it for 360, how hard... I thought the Wii U was supposed to be built so that it could take 360 ports really easy.
4556558	4562779	I understand it could take ports really easy, but the thing is, why spend the money to port a game if you're only going to make X amount of sales?
4562819	4565560	It costs money to do a port, regardless of how easy it is.
4566280	4574222	It's still... And my thought is, you're saying that it has to sell well in order to do the port, and I'm like, well, I don't want to buy the game twice.
4575903	4578045	So if I buy it on PlayStation, that's it.
4578125	4578966	I'm not going to buy it again.
4578986	4579707	It's free to play.
4580527	4581969	No, you're thinking of a different Soul Calibur game.
4582009	4583030	Soul Calibur HD is not.
4583490	4585472	You're thinking of the one we talked about last week.
4585813	4587114	I thought that was the free to play one.
4588035	4588916	Not Soul Calibur HD.
4588936	4590357	Soul Calibur HD is... That was...
4591198	4592759	That was some new game in the series.
4592799	4593479	It's on PlayStation 3.
4593779	4597801	It's not... No, you're crossing your Soul Calibur wires.
4598461	4600082	You're forging a new destiny for the game.
4600142	4604363	I was thinking about the Soul Calibur 2 HD.
4604503	4612227	That's one of the three import GameCube games I have, was Soul Calibur 2, just so we could have Link, so we could have it early.
4612527	4612747	Mm-hmm.
4613967	4616488	SSJ100Matt says, ugh, I hate it when they pull that shit.
4616589	4617869	Quote, if it makes enough money.
4618149	4619050	Such a cock tease.
4619250	4620210	Do it or don't do it.
4620290	4621771	Stop stringing people along.
4622251	4622571	Amen.
4623972	4624652	Just do it.
4626393	4628234	Talking about fitness and all this stuff.
4628414	4630095	It's just probably people asking them about it.
4630115	4630595	That's all.
4630695	4636478	It's not that they came out and said, we have an idea for a game we're going to make, but only if it sells well.
4636558	4638419	Only if it sells well, so everybody go buy it.
4638619	4640200	I mean, they're not Konami or something.
4640440	4642101	We have no intention of ever making it.
4642121	4645563	I'm sorry, we're not going to put that game out unless you pre-order X amount of copies.
4650687	4653328	Alright, that definitely does it for that story.
4654029	4658471	Let's go back to a time when, you know, it was a whole lot easier than this.
4660653	4662254	And there was really only two consoles.
4663410	4666311	I also have an announcement after this too, about the segment.
4686801	4688303	DarkSakura.com
4705618	4706458	Mischief Makers.
4706919	4707259	Get it?
4707979	4708399	Okay.
4709660	4710140	Anyway.
4711180	4719824	It is a game developed by Treasure and published by Amix in Japan and published by Nintendo in the U.S.
4720164	4720764	It was on the Nintendo 64.
4722305	4727889	It came out in 1997 as one of the first 2D side-scrollers on the Nintendo 64.
4728550	4738037	And so your main character is the ultra-intergalactic cybot J. Marina Lightyears, or as she's also known, Marina, who is a robotic maid.
4739702	4766726	so you go through the game and it's pretty average side-scrolling thing except it's a treasure game so you know weirdness is going to ensue so she can pick up her enemies, objects, weapons and even some energy projectiles and they can be thrown or shaken depending on whatever the object is and crystals can come out and whenever some other objects are shaken there may be another effect that happens
4768658	4783506	And then you have another character named Teron who's able to play in other levels and has punches and kicks and blocks and he can hang from the ceiling and he can jump three times consecutively.
4784006	4790609	There's a golden gem in every level and what it does... God, I don't know what is up with OS.
4791450	4791650	Anyway...
4792430	4803733	Um, so if you have, um, the gems, they're used in the final cutscene of the game by, um, adding, uh, one to three seconds to the ending.
4804093	4811956	So the extended ending has, uh, extra, uh, character development for the villains and other secrets that happen.
4813076	4821458	So the way that you get the gold gem, it differs from stage to stage, so I suggest finding a walkthrough if you're going to play it.
4822659	4827320	So you have other gems in the game, they're red, blue, green, and like I said, the gold one.
4828100	4832941	And some of them give health for Marina, red giving the lowest, gold being the highest.
4833561	4836582	And then each stage is numbered like a Super Mario Bros.
4836662	4837562	level, like a 1-1, 2-1, 2, etc.,
4840403	4869368	and the worlds have different elements like world 1 is grasslands world 3 is snow and you have different cutscenes you also get a thing called a clancer ball where Marina can throw herself out of it and aim toward another ball and these pots store different items in it so if you get the right items you can make very interesting things happen so like I said it was done by Anex and Treasure and Treasure is like
4871238	4872822	Treasure did Gunstar Heroes, okay?
4873243	4876890	They did, um, uh, Silhouette Mirage.
4876931	4880618	You know, if you want your, uh, you know, bizarre games.
4882060	4907235	and I think that it was also one of the last titles they did in a cartridge format because it was one of their early ones that did not come out on a Sega system as well they thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be the best choice for their projects of course we know how well that happened you know
4908812	4916518	It's like I said, Treasure has a track record for doing quality games with very interesting elements of gameplay in it.
4917118	4919120	The game got kind of mixed reviews.
4919260	4925125	I mean, it's definitely geared toward the Treasure fans.
4925685	4933871	But not many people were too into it because of the limitations of the Nintendo 64 in terms of graphics and the way that the game looked.
4933891	4938235	It was just like a very glorified SNES game with 3D in it.
4938895	4943758	However, I know I keep saying it, but it is a treasure game.
4944578	4947780	So if you like treasure games, this will definitely be up your alley.
4947840	4953704	And it's got really fun animation and really adorable artwork.
4954264	4955325	It's one of my favorites.
4955365	4957766	It's one of the Nintendo 64 games that I still own.
4958887	4964330	So that is my game of the week is Mischief Makers or UK UK Troublemakers.
4964570	4965691	UK UK means go go.
4966952	4970275	Now you just love to do these treasure games.
4970375	4972637	Is there any treasure games you haven't done yet?
4972918	4973698	I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
4973758	4975901	I'm sure there's treasure games I haven't done.
4975921	4976501	Alright.
4976881	4981526	I mean, what I've only done... Did I do Bungaio?
4981666	4982667	Treasure did Bungaio, didn't they?
4983827	4984948	I'm trying to think if you did that.
4984968	4986008	I think you did at some point.
4986469	4986749	All right.
4987069	4987449	Well, there it is.
4987529	4988629	And I know I've done Gunstar Heroes.
4988690	4993772	There it is, your classic game of the week, Mischief Makers by Treasure for the Nintendo 64.
4994372	4996813	So now DarkSakura would like to make an announcement.
4996833	5005597	I feel like saying parquet.
5006437	5008418	So I have a little crown like the 80s commercials.
5009255	5011836	So many of our listeners will not understand that.
5011896	5014398	That is so lost on so many.
5014418	5018299	That's always what pops into my head every time you play the stupid little fanfare.
5018319	5020120	It's some kid with the crown.
5020140	5020741	That's the Imperial.
5020781	5021021	No, I know.
5021221	5023282	Parquet was the little thing that would top Parquet.
5023322	5023722	Parquet.
5023842	5024262	Parquet.
5024723	5025223	Oh my God.
5025743	5027504	This show has dissolved into butter commercials.
5027950	5029471	DarkSakura, what's your damn announcement?
5029611	5030411	It's not butter.
5031931	5042995	My announcement is that I have, and I decided this on the way here, that I am reevaluating what I do in terms of systems for the games, and I am now going to be doing it with a year cut off.
5043895	5050197	So starting with October, I'm going to be doing games that came up through 2003.
5052499	5055301	so that I'm keeping a consistent 10-year gap.
5055782	5067051	So that's going to start bringing in, I think, later PS1 games, GameCube games, the end of the Dreamcast cycle, and I believe PS2.
5067472	5069914	We're going to start seeing PS2 games come in for classic games.
5070214	5076620	I seem to remember about a year ago you did an early PlayStation 2 game and a lot of people were like, that's not classic.
5077300	5080443	No, y'all, we're getting older because these games are 10 years old.
5081464	5082105	I think that's fair.
5083406	5085247	On top of that, I have to say that
5086028	5087229	No, I'm not doing Halo.
5089471	5090072	Chatters.
5090132	5091493	Chatters are trolling.
5091653	5097559	What started the thought in my head, and it took a while to develop the entire drive here.
5098299	5103464	I was looking back at my shelves going, oh my god, some of this is crap.
5103484	5104305	Yeah.
5105264	5128660	we do we do have a lot of shit games I mean for all of the you know 300 plus worth dollar games that we own we have some shit and I have some games that are kind of shit that I have just because I fucking wanted them like Gatchaman the shooting I got it because it was Gatchaman game shut up I have Kitty the cool which I got so I could burn you a copy if you will remember that
5129255	5134177	Somebody bought me the Hello Kitty GameCube game and it's not that great.
5134257	5134997	You know what's funny?
5136297	5139999	With you setting your 10-year limit, I want to really explain to you what this means.
5140259	5140479	What?
5140859	5145201	Because you are doing games that are 10 years or older.
5145841	5151803	You could feasibly be doing games that we talked about their launch on this program.
5152703	5166850	I was thinking about that and maybe I should put it at our launch date and earlier but I think 10 years is a good limit and it opens up I'm just thinking like oh my god I love you SSJ100 Matt for linking the Parquet commercial
5167775	5173060	Granted, we didn't expand from the music games only to all games until about, what, 2004, 2005?
5173961	5182267	So we still have a few years to go before you really hit that mark where, yes, we talked about these games when they first came out, but this is funny.
5182288	5188272	But the whole thing I'm thinking of is that now we talk about some of these games and they are classic.
5188313	5192096	We're seeing HD remakes because they are classic.
5192176	5192976	Oh, God, Rob.
5193457	5193677	Sorry.
5194057	5196118	This is linked by SSJ100Matt in chat.
5196158	5197219	Finish your thought and then I'll play this.
5197239	5197459	Okay.
5198299	5201340	But by now they are classic.
5201520	5202641	And, you know, we have to stay.
5203241	5207163	And it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing only games from 10 years ago.
5207663	5211845	I still have a shit ton of Clicovision games and Intellivision games.
5212505	5229095	to be fair you've been doing this segment since episode I mean this segment has evolved since the early days of the show because it used to be what it used to be your advice column you had your link and then the website of the yeah so now you have your classic so you've only been doing classic games since what episode 250 yeah but but that's still 270 games but that's that you've covered
5229475	5229876	Exactly.
5230196	5233879	It's not even at a halfway point anymore that I started doing this.
5234400	5242867	And for the record, I do kind of miss the website of the week just because the guy from Weeble and Bob messaged us.
5244489	5245169	That was pretty cool.
5245209	5247751	That was like a nerdgasm in my book.
5247852	5248072	Okay.
5248412	5251395	Now if I get, you know, a shout out from, you know,
5253004	5258907	from Homestuck People or from the person that does Nedroid Diary, I would be even happier.
5260668	5261529	Because those are my favorites.
5262910	5264931	But yeah, I figured by now it's time.
5265471	5266692	It's time to grow up.
5267212	5269713	It's time to acknowledge that some... I don't want to grow up.
5270154	5271414	I'm an OLR kid.
5271474	5274056	There's a million games of OLR that I can play with.
5274836	5275436	Oh, Lord.
5276377	5281000	But I'm thinking at this point enough of our listeners...
5282395	5285296	Who might have been a little too young for us back in the day.
5285316	5285857	Yes, yes.
5286837	5291639	Might appreciate something that's a little bit more in their realm of experience from time to time.
5291839	5292820	Fair enough, fair enough.
5293680	5294620	Blackwolf is trying.
5294660	5298182	He says in our chat room, Halo Classic Game of the Week, let's make it happen.
5299811	5304434	Bobby, it will happen if you send me a $25 gift card to California Pizza Kitchen.
5307615	5310196	You too can bribe DarkSakura for the classic game of the week.
5310997	5317700	Okay, so for you youngins that didn't catch DarkSakura's reference earlier, here you go, courtesy of SSJ100 Matt.
5326623	5328084	Oh my god, that font!
5353101	5357105	That came through really quiet, so sorry to the live... Atari commercials!
5357205	5361508	I will have to bump that in post-production to make it actual volume for the podcast listeners.
5361608	5363210	Yeah, that did not come through very well for live.
5363250	5363730	Sorry about that.
5363870	5364851	It's very, very quiet.
5364971	5372718	The Imperial commercials where the kids would take a bite of their toast with their Imperial butter on it, and they'd get a little crown and go, do-do-do-do!
5372738	5372778	So...
5375737	5376077	All right.
5377098	5377658	I'm old.
5377758	5378238	Shut up.
5378359	5382741	By the way, I want to point out in chat room, SHJ100Matt says, I'm putting in five bucks.
5382861	5384782	Brad says, I'm putting in five bucks.
5385222	5389945	Dude, if you guys totally buy me CPK, I'll fucking do it two weeks in a row.
5394247	5396989	Using this show for your own nefarious purposes.
5397969	5398570	Boy, oh boy.
5398630	5398890	All right.
5399570	5400151	You know what?
5400251	5400411	Hmm.
5401653	5403254	I've been doing this for a long time
5419543	5421005	Tune in and give her a dollar.
5421025	5421905	Someone sent me a dollar.
5435618	5436900	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5452854	5454355	Oh, dude, are you guys serious?
5454456	5454756	Fuck.
5454776	5455397	I love you guys.
5455417	5456498	I have OTB.
5456578	5457919	That must be outside the box.
5457979	5458961	I have the intro for that.
5459081	5461684	I don't know if I have the... I probably have it somewhere.
5462364	5470954	But, you know, it started off with the, you know, Leonard Cohen singing Everybody Knows and then it had Loki speaking...
5471895	5473396	DDR Freak Radio Bumpers
5494415	5497756	Loki has an excuse to talk more Grand Theft Auto 5, but for a good reason.
5498217	5500137	It's always a good reason.
5500157	5502338	We'll talk about another game we've been talking about for a few weeks.
5502658	5504579	Also a good reason to talk about Mighty No.
5504599	5505419	9 and what's going on with that.
5505759	5510061	So plenty more to come when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5516673	5517033	and DarkSakura.
5535784	5552583	I know for live tonight we're going up against what the Emmys are tonight although I mean I don't know why these award shows are such a big deal but maybe I'm just jaded from doing this on Sunday night for so long but I know the Breaking Bad finale is tonight too and I'm sure a lot of people are excited about that but that's why they have DVR
5553784	5554405	That's why you tape it.
5554605	5555085	I'll watch it later.
5555105	5557247	That's what Hulu Plus is for.
5557627	5565193	Speaking of recording and watching it later, I know a lot of people listen to us on the podcast feed, be it through Stitcher or iTunes or whatever.
5565313	5566894	I mean, there's a lot of ways to know.
5566934	5576281	Some people might still be rocking this on the PSP, which does remind me to also say olrpsp.com has closed.
5576701	5581705	I think it was this week that it finally was turned back over to GoDaddy, who I'm sure has a spam site up in its place.
5582385	5609124	um so that is no longer accessible at that website but if you do have a PSP and you badly you're like oh what was I missing at olrpsp.com even though it's so out of date uh I don't even think it it still tries to access the stream in our old network but not even their current stream like an old stream at the old network uh you can still visit the graphics Loki did do a bang-up job on the site orangeloungeradio.com slash PSP you just have to do it the long way
5609304	5612766	And I'm pretty sure the All Games radio streamer does not work anymore.
5612946	5614887	I'm pretty sure it goes to their old feed.
5614907	5618449	Because I think it had been broke at one point when they switched servers.
5619009	5621070	And everybody was like, Loki, update it, Loki, update it.
5621090	5621690	And you were like, no.
5622511	5624292	I haven't updated it in seven years.
5624472	5625532	I'm not going to start now.
5626573	5628954	DarkTetsuya points out there's also a bit.ly.
5629034	5632996	So bit.ly slash O-L-R-P-S-P will also get you there.
5633617	5634117	So there you go.
5635698	5639121	Anyhow, thanks again to all you guys who listen and participate with the show.
5639521	5660038	Speaking of live participators, it was brought to our attention during the release date segment that we go over that we missed one big release that's coming out this week, probably because it's in the download space, but some of our chatters, namely AlanAlchemy and Actdeft, very excited about Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe Plus, which is on PC.
5660118	5663440	I know they've been whoring it on Steam Wednesday, September 25th.
5664741	5692542	and then also the DLC pack for consoles will be the same day because I believe it's new to PC I don't think it's been out on PC yet so it'll be on Steam 9.25 and then the DLC upgrade will hit consoles on September 25th so that's it sounds like they're adding a lot to it like they probably could have done a third game out of it but they're not so just wanted to throw that out there because after all they could have done a third game but they didn't they could have not unlike another company we know right yes
5695305	5697827	Half-Life 2 DLC episode confirmed.
5697847	5700288	They need to talk to Capcom and learn about counting to three.
5701089	5704651	Pretty much the third game for Pac-Man 3 on Steam.
5705132	5706412	Half-Life 3 confirmed.
5706753	5708274	Maybe that's one of the big announcements.
5708314	5708594	Who knows?
5709274	5709595	All right.
5710115	5713837	Let us get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news.
5713977	5715138	It's funny.
5715218	5717720	Some of you guys in chat are like, I'm surprised they haven't mentioned this yet.
5717800	5720222	Well, stay tuned in this rapid-fire news.
5720242	5721222	Give us a chance.
5721322	5721583	Yeah.
5722043	5723003	Jeez, people.
5723084	5724805	Hurry up and wait, Loki.
5725665	5745007	so Disney Infinity is getting some free toy boxes as part of DLC and the first one or I should say one of them is going to be the Tron Highway so yes you're going to finally be able to get your Tron stuff in the toy box mode which is pretty fantastic heck yes
5745647	5748489	And I guess it's going to offer some cool stuff.
5748649	5750710	Racing, I guess, along tracks and stuff.
5751310	5752771	Some of the other ones are coming out too.
5753191	5754072	Sugar Mania.
5754532	5755172	So there you go.
5755252	5758054	There's your Sugar Rush stuff right there.
5758294	5761035	Monster Rally and Cosmic Platformer.
5763136	5764037	And I like this one.
5765598	5768939	It's a Trap is one that's also being released.
5768959	5771821	Because, you know, Disney owns Lucas now.
5771861	5773482	Wow.
5773582	5773802	Funny.
5775191	5776131	Star Wars Star Wars Star Wars
5795576	5796076	It's kind of cool.
5797056	5798037	Hey, you know what?
5798097	5801418	You may be able to just pick up Disney Infinity because I may be selling them on eBay soon.
5802298	5803978	Yes, because I don't have time to play it.
5804078	5805719	Granted, I'll be taking it up my entire life.
5807079	5809960	Gravity Rush is getting a sequel.
5810660	5812721	And I believe that's still coming to the Vita.
5813401	5820183	And they teased it with a trailer that came out of... What was it?
5820303	5820363	Uh...
5821920	5823041	What the fuck was this weekend?
5823201	5824001	Or this week?
5824041	5824842	Tokyo Game Show.
5824942	5825642	Hello, thank you.
5827683	5834888	So yeah, so far confirmed for the Vita, but no word yet on when, if that's going to be other systems, PlayStation 4, that kind of stuff.
5835248	5836449	I would think keep it on the Vita.
5836469	5838230	It was a pretty good Vita-exclusive game.
5838610	5840931	Although, I mean, they still give it away.
5841392	5843873	Well, if you have PlayStation Plus, you have to be on board with that.
5844073	5846214	Yeah, so that's pretty cool.
5846374	5847175	It's worth your time, though.
5847595	5848496	Yeah, and...
5850267	5851288	and the Warden one that's coming out.
5851468	5860853	And then last but not least, one of the cool pieces of integration for Grand Theft Auto 5 is this iFruit companion app that you can get on iOS.
5861913	5866996	Very disappointed that it's not on Android yet, but with it you can do a bunch of cool stuff, including customizing your car.
5867016	5871478	You can customize the license plates that are on your car, and they actually appear in-game as well.
5871498	5872139	Oh, that's kind of cool.
5873039	5878142	You can even raise Chop, which is the dog that Franklin ends up getting.
5879062	5906332	and you can train him and stuff and walk him just like you can with Nintendogs except with a little bit of a twist including he'll fetch grenades and severed hands and stuff like that and they're going to be adding apps to it as well so it's pretty cool and it's free so if you have an iOS device then pick it up if you have an Android device don't download any of the ones that are out there because they're all scam apps they're all scam right now
5907532	5907872	DarkSakura,
5929821	5930262	Kind of neat.
5930422	5931803	I like seeing the whole tie-in there.
5931883	5934325	Now that's second screen, right?
5934366	5935707	Sort of, yeah.
5935747	5938349	Speaking of second screen, something on the Wii U popped up.
5939090	5946717	A message mentioning that Mario and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games will be available on the eShop on November 8th.
5948518	5955681	All controversy about the Winter Games and where it's being held aside, these Mario and Sonic games have done very, very well.
5956381	5965544	A lot of you guys probably really, I mean, because they're not really for hardcore gamers, they're really geared for casual gamers and kids, but these games do insanely well.
5965624	5967485	Like, it's one of the biggest properties on the Wii.
5967985	5969685	So, this is a pretty big deal.
5969725	5970886	This is happening on the Wii U.
5972406	5975128	There was a reveal trailer, if you think back to the Nintendo Direct.
5975769	5978871	Then there was another trailer that said there will be 16 events in the game.
5979251	5982013	Wii Motion Plus, Wii U GamePad, both being used.
5982353	5983274	Some will use both.
5983814	5987216	The Biathlon uses the Wii Remote for skiing and then the GamePad for the sniping.
5987576	5988237	So, there you go.
5988657	5990659	That will all be out November 8th.
5990859	5994341	No Wii Balance Board support, I see.
5994961	5997263	No, probably a little soon for that.
5997403	5997763	I don't know.
5998324	5999564	So, there you go.
6002586	6016954	As much as I don't want to get too political on this show, obviously you all know I have some strong opinions on certain subjects, and so obviously I can't condone some of these laws that we've heard about in Russia that are just back in the Stone Age.
6017054	6020315	So is Birdo not going to be allowed to play in these games?
6024497	6024957	Thanks for watching!
6043490	6044872	Twitch TV integration.
6044932	6047975	Well, it's something that's bundled with all the Ubisoft games.
6047995	6052059	So if you have it on Steam, you still have to log into your fucking Uplay bullshit.
6052299	6052800	Oh, wow.
6052940	6055883	I must not own any Ubisoft games on PC.
6056424	6057585	Far Cry 3.
6058226	6059807	I have a couple just dance games.
6059907	6061569	And Blood Dragon.
6061889	6063972	I don't remember if Far Cry 2 did.
6065613	6065954	But yeah.
6067338	6067898	Well, there you go.
6068758	6073580	Uplay will also be available on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 when those consoles make their retail debuts.
6073600	6074100	Hooray.
6074400	6075200	But I don't know.
6075521	6079922	I imagine those consoles are already streaming anyway, so whatever.
6081122	6088505	And then last but not least, for all two of you at Orange Lounge Radio that will care about this news, La Mulana 2.
6090365	6091486	It is out there, folks.
6091566	6100272	No, all kidding aside, this is an indie game that gets a lot of attention, partially for its throwback to the retro days, partially because of how difficult it is.
6100732	6108738	But La Mulana 2, apparently not available on PC until next year, but it was spotted at Tokyo Game Show 2013.
6110079	6114442	And there's even like a little logo out there, La Mulana 2, the zeroth body, the ninth spirit.
6114962	6116683	I don't know how else to read that, the zeroth body.
6117444	6117964	Sounds right.
6118084	6118465	There it is.
6119305	6124507	and you will probably die many more times than Zero playing La Mulana 2.
6126227	6127868	I think D'Artesia needs new underwear now.
6128168	6128528	He might.
6130249	6134930	So in other news, and this is speaking of people who need new underwear, I'm thinking of my husband now.
6136831	6137631	Strider HD.
6139031	6141072	This is, did you watch the trailer Rob?
6143082	6143682	Yes, I did.
6144063	6144844	It is hot.
6145124	6151931	It's supposed to be a Metroidvania type game, which people are a little bit sort of back and forth on.
6152591	6155494	But for the most part, it's gotten some really positive reviews.
6155654	6157116	And so I'm looking forward to it coming out.
6157176	6160739	But I just wanted to mention that it is getting really good reviews.
6161460	6163401	Previews, I guess would be really, yeah.
6163781	6169603	But I think that everyone owes it to themselves to dedicate themselves to the religion of Hiryu.
6170743	6174845	And definitely check out the... You know, think about it.
6175045	6175725	Think about it this way.
6176265	6181007	Loki hasn't shut up about Grand Theft Auto V. I haven't shut up about Final Fantasy XIV.
6181507	6183648	DarkSakura will have her day when this game comes out.
6188419	6189259	I need a moment.
6189979	6191440	I need a moment.
6192640	6193540	I'm a little warm.
6195401	6196981	Do I need to get some paper towels?
6197301	6198162	This is getting gross.
6198342	6199522	Someone fetch a towel!
6201003	6204744	Also, now this is a cool game and I was watching a little bit of the play on this.
6205304	6208285	It was one of the fastest greenlit games ever.
6209445	6211685	And it went in five days.
6212746	6216607	A game by Polish developer Blue Brick called Superhot.
6217387	6229871	and basically what it is, it's basically your characters are like sort of black outlines against, you know, all white but normally shaded, you know, environment with lots and lots of red blood.
6230412	6234593	The thing about this is that time only moves when you move.
6235808	6239929	So if someone shoots at you, you can stop walking and the bullets stop.
6240349	6241770	And you can dodge them.
6242850	6245271	So it just seemed like a really neat concept.
6245631	6252853	And we've seen something like this done with Bullet Time and Max Payne, but nothing to the extent of actually having it stop.
6252953	6254754	So the only way to win is not to play the game?
6257355	6257555	Yes.
6259904	6267387	You definitely have a goal within the game, but you can move around the things that are in your way.
6267627	6268907	Loki, you just lost the game.
6271868	6283152	And last but never least, and I'm looking forward to this as well, Bayonetta actually is having a theatrical release, an animated theatrical release that will be out in November in Japan.
6283813	6287494	And I will have to talk to people who live there to tell me how it is.
6288717	6290338	Krista, go watch the movie for me.
6293359	6297180	It's named Bayonetta Bloody Fate and it will be out on November 23rd.
6297200	6299521	You know it's going to be out over here.
6299981	6301302	And people will fansub it.
6301982	6302442	Of course.
6303623	6304803	Fansubbers gonna sub.
6306484	6310185	Alright, are we ready to get to the foogle question of the week?
6310265	6315687	I sure hope so because if not, you're going to check out for a minute, I guess.
6316828	6317748	We love to hear from listeners.
6323917	6333702	So every week we ask a question at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page available when you search for Orange Lounge Radio.
6334142	6335583	A lot of comments this week.
6335623	6336823	I'm not going to be able to read them all.
6336863	6337524	I'm so sorry.
6338464	6340965	But a lot of great feedback on the question this week.
6341005	6341946	Let me tell you what the question is.
6342426	6348309	It was announced this week that Wii Sports would become the latest game to get an HD version or remaster, if you will.
6348909	6351691	This is an addition to other HD remakes we've seen this year.
6352131	6355794	Kingdom Hearts, for example, and even previously with God of War and so forth.
6356134	6358336	So what's your opinion on HD remakes?
6358736	6362158	Do you enjoy them or do you think it's not a good use of developer resources?
6363239	6369443	Redertainment on Google Plus says, an HD remaster or remake might be good if the game is a revered classic, but Wii Sports?
6369964	6371085	Come on, what's next?
6371225	6372325	Golf for the NES?
6372726	6374507	Wait, I've played Golf for the NES.
6374547	6376288	It's the Grand Theft Auto V minigame.
6378109	6378850	E3VL says,
6396502	6413550	Personally, I'll pay for the game again if they add new content along with the updated visuals like the Wind Waker HD with its gameplay tweaks and the gamepad support or have additional bonus content, all DLC in the Resident Evil HD games which would cost more if obtained separately.
6414550	6415091	Good thoughts.
6415451	6421915	You know, though, if somebody is really going to ignore a classic game because of graphics, though, I really think they're missing out.
6421955	6427398	I mean, there's just some classic games you can't really HD, like Kaboom on the Atari 2600.
6428459	6429680	That is a classic game.
6429860	6430380	Kicks.
6430700	6431501	Yeah.
6431521	6432401	They tried.
6432521	6433622	Tetris, right?
6434363	6436644	The only thing that did kicks right was Miss New World.
6438785	6443768	And to be fair, the Tetris on the Game Boy, or I think the DS Tetris was amazing.
6444268	6445709	That was a great version of Tetris.
6445789	6447610	And let's not forget Galspanic is awesome.
6447910	6448890	Of course, of course.
6449310	6451211	So those are some of the answers from Google+.
6451872	6454353	Let's get to some of the answers from Facebook.
6454973	6461016	Andrew S. says, I wouldn't mind a Tony Hawk Underground, or as my friend and I refer to it as Thug Remaster.
6461516	6462057	It would bring...
6463177	6466039	It would bring it out of PS2 graphics.
6466199	6471163	Renee, our buddy from Koopa Club says, To HD or not to HD?
6471303	6472504	That is the question.
6473224	6487374	Whether tis nobler the developer to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged reviewers for not offering new and instead recycling the same game format and content, or to take arms against a sea of troubles from development, programming, and marketing, and by providing new content...
6487614	6489576	I see what you did there, and you get a slow clap.
6489596	6491317	It is a tough question that they have to ask.
6507078	6514661	RedTheHaze says, I like HD remakes as it lets people try out older games they may have missed with updated graphics and performance.
6515081	6529085	As much as I think Wii Sports HD is a good idea for new Wii owners to try out Wii Sports, it just feels icky for them to try something like this for what was a free pack-in title, especially with the lack of unified account system on with Nintendo consoles.
6529445	6531206	Other than that, HD remakes are great.
6532562	6547997	Degenerate Johnny says The fact of the matter is that many of us gamers cling to the memories and experiences of the games we've played earlier in our lives An HD remake offers the chance for us to relive those memories with a fresher feel to it That's part of the answer I'm gonna cut the rest of it for time
6548838	6558069	ForTheFallenDreams13 says, I enjoy HD remakes of games because it's just about making a game I was already in love with bigger, brighter, and more aesthetically pleasing.
6558429	6560531	Given the developer does it justice.
6561012	6563835	Also, not everyone's older consoles still work.
6565057	6566779	That's an answer I personally agree with.
6568300	6589819	unless you're me DarkCharger says as someone who is invested in a lot of HD remakes I feel they sound cooler than they actually end up being the nostalgia is often fleeting with few exceptions Scott W says I enjoy HD remakes as long as they bring something extra like Final Fantasy X HD with the international content included Kingdom Hearts looks great too
6590880	6592842	Ziba says I enjoy the HD remakes.
6592942	6594984	It's definitely the nostalgia feeling that's best.
6595364	6598126	It's even better when they add some special things to keep interest going.
6598847	6601869	Eddie K says it's a lazy but effective way to make money.
6602250	6605833	Nostalgia sells huge in the video game industry.
6607174	6607894	Virtual Phil says
6608795	6628183	also from Koopa Club says I guess if you have the money to burn then it's cool but like DuckTales HD was fun for 10 seconds and now everyone is all over the next HD remake they tend to be a bit gimmicky and that was followed by the colon X face you know what Dan is still playing that game because he's achievement hunting on it
6630644	6647057	TigerClaw says an HD remake of a game would be worth it if they add some new content to it the problem is they tend to be a shot for shot remake of the original game where you know where all the items are located and how to beat the levels I'm down for an HD version of Wii Sports as long as they add online multiplayer to it
6648318	6674983	and lastly Gamer Girl says don't know if this counts but I am really loving DuckTales Remastered I think they should come out with more because a lot of the younger generation doesn't even know the mind blown that they're missing out on again some of the answers I'm so sorry I had to cut some of those for time but facebook.com slash orange launch radio if you want to read all of the answers in their entirety a big thank you to all of you that took the time to answer that I did read them all so what are you guys thoughts quickly on HD remasters I'm
6675123	6688825	I think they're great I agree with the guy that said you know what the old consoles don't always work I like the stuff like trophy support and so on and it's just icing on the cake when they go back and make it a little bit better I'm kind of uh
6690310	6690851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6706698	6715540	I'm not getting the Final Fantasy X set because I already have X, X-2, and I have X International.
6716660	6718660	No, I have X-2 International.
6719180	6720581	So sort of like, what's the point?
6720941	6723061	I actually have the Japanese version of X. I'm a sheep.
6723101	6725602	I'm totally getting X. I want it really bad.
6725622	6732983	But that being said, I kind of want the HD Kingdom Hearts, but I'm probably just going to wait and play yours.
6734628	6735548	An effective solution.
6735748	6737349	Because I'm unemployed.
6738489	6747773	So I have to measure frugality and realism versus needs versus wants.
6748593	6751294	Final Fantasy XIV, I bought the collector's edition.
6751995	6753755	That was my anniversary present.
6754395	6758357	Grand Theft Auto V is my anniversary present to my husband because I am an awesome wife.
6759877	6762498	So we make it for occasion.
6762558	6763779	So if it came out
6764119	6765220	and DarkSakura.com
6787814	6793563	Well, he didn't say that aloud, but I have a feeling that my ability to beat Strider was one of the requirements of marriage.
6793703	6794785	And what did he have to do for you?
6795406	6796087	Fair is fair, right?
6796808	6797709	What did he have to do for me?
6799452	6800153	Not irritate me.
6802555	6803156	I don't know.
6803236	6806880	He kept me supplied in video games for the last 15 years, so I feel good about that.
6807701	6808302	Fair enough.
6808342	6811726	He hasn't kicked me out for being a shiftless layabout for the last two years.
6812246	6814168	It's not my fault I'm not employed, but still.
6814789	6815230	Fair enough.
6815310	6819174	All right, let's talk about some other gaming news and what else is going on in the industry.
6819274	6820295	Loki, why don't you start us off?
6821096	6823378	Okay, so let's talk some more Grand Theft Auto.
6823718	6829624	It sold $1 billion worth of copies in the first three days.
6830564	6833387	And that's a record.
6833847	6836570	In fact, it broke a record for day one sales, too.
6836770	6837370	$800 million.
6839232	6846238	The previous landmark, I think, was Call of Duty Black Ops 2, which only did, I want to say, $450 million.
6849981	6854083	and also it hit a billion dollars faster in Call of Duty Black Ops 2 as well.
6854163	6857405	They hit a billion dollars in 15 days instead of three.
6859066	6861907	So yes, it's the largest entertainment launch in history.
6864108	6865169	Not bad.
6865249	6875394	Fun fact, in the history of films, only 17 movies have grossed a billion dollars worldwide.
6875984	6877364	And that's total.
6877384	6878325	17 movies, total.
6878705	6883186	Now, the oldest one of the 17 is 1993.
6883786	6887567	This is like the Jurassic Park episode because that is the movie.
6888147	6892429	It's the oldest one on the list there because it costs more to see a movie these days than it used to.
6892489	6896810	If you were to change for inflation, something like Gone with the Wind or something would probably be up there.
6897370	6900231	Yeah, only 17 movies have ever done a billion dollars worth of business.
6900291	6903572	And that was over the course of being in the theater for what?
6904012	6907673	Titanic, the number two grossing movie of all time, $2 billion done.
6907693	6909194	But that was what?
6909234	6910774	That was in theaters for like six months.
6911774	6914795	And then re-released in the whole IMAX thing, right?
6915375	6918096	So, I mean, this is huge that a video game did that practically overnight.
6918196	6919437	No movie's done it overnight.
6920497	6921697	Or three days.
6921717	6922417	Still, still.
6923098	6923298	Even...
6924738	6926338	Can some folks guess some of the other movies?
6926479	6927979	The top 17 on the list?
6928559	6929039	Just for fun?
6929679	6938161	Well, I know the top grossing movie for 24 hours was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
6938681	6940382	It's number four on the all-time list.
6940462	6942942	It was $91 million in 24 hours.
6942982	6949104	That was the movie record for top grossing 24 hours.
6949124	6950164	I can tell you what the top two were.
6950584	6951205	No fair peeking.
6951705	6953287	Well, I haven't because my glasses.
6953507	6957211	Because I remember the news passed when Avatar surpassed Titanic.
6957311	6959233	Avatar is the number one movie of all time, correct?
6959253	6960194	And Titanic would be number two.
6960354	6961755	Titanic would be number two, correct.
6962135	6964598	Just quickly, Marvel's The Avengers, number three.
6965168	6966008	Because of Joss!
6966389	6967929	Iron Man 3, number 5.
6968269	6970490	Transformers, Dark of the Moon, number 6.
6970550	6971411	That surprised me.
6971891	6974152	Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, number 7.
6974592	6975513	Skyfall, number 8.
6976213	6978274	The Dark Knight Rises, number 9.
6978854	6982736	That surprised me too, because I always thought The Dark Knight did better, but I guess with the year difference.
6983656	6984817	And then lastly, number 10.
6984957	6987958	I won't read the whole list, but Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest is number 10.
6988939	6990299	Just kind of a fun little comparison.
6990339	6993000	Those are the movies that have raked a billion dollars.
6993721	6993861	So...
6995547	6996688	And they're just getting started.
7000912	7008299	Alright, well moving on to a game that will sadly probably not break a billion dollars because we're just not sure if the game is ever going to come out here or not.
7008779	7013363	It was spotted on Steam Greenlight this week, Ghosts and Goblins Online.
7013483	7015225	You know how they can get that to break a billion dollars?
7015605	7017166	Charge one dollar for every life.
7019348	7019769	Good work.
7021310	7021570	Dead.
7022530	7025052	Ghosts and Goblins Online, this has a long history.
7025092	7026293	You want to talk about an old game.
7026533	7033037	It was originally supposed to be a multi-platform release in 2003, but then development stopped before it was completed.
7033338	7035659	Then there was a second attempt that was also canned.
7036159	7047267	Seed9 did the whole Steam Greenlight campaign, and they were bringing back Ghosts and Goblins Online with co-op platforming, PvP combat, and frequent updates that do new items and upgrades.
7049188	7052093	I say was because then it got pulled.
7052639	7067970	Capcom actually had this pulled and we're not totally sure on what it was but their statement was quote the Steam Greenlight page for Ghosts and Goblins Online that went live yesterday was wrongly posted by the game's Korean developer Seed9 and the page has now been removed.
7068370	7079899	Ghosts and Goblins was released last year in Korea, China, and Taiwan and I seem to remember that now that there was the Ghosts and Goblins because I remember we talked about it on the show and we were like oh of course we don't get it here but they get it over there.
7080700	7085306	And there are no plans for the title to be released in Europe or North America.
7086107	7090512	Hmm, it's very strange that that showed up on Steam Greenlight.
7090532	7094037	I mean, that's more than just one person pushing a button accidentally, you know what I mean?
7094297	7096820	That's very strange to me.
7098202	7109214	Honestly, the game itself looks very different than what you guys remember from the classic days of gaming when that was on the early consoles and the arcades and so forth.
7110054	7118623	I kind of think as much as this sounds great on paper, it's probably not a game to really look forward to big time.
7120104	7121745	Alright, let's move on.
7122265	7122725	DarkSakura.
7123225	7123845	Do I gotta?
7124185	7124725	Of course I do.
7125625	7133947	Well, this is something that we've seen the Kickstarter on it was Mighty No.
7134187	7133947	9.
7134547	7135228	Well, guess what?
7135808	7144370	It is heading to the Wii U. It reached its goal of 2.2 million on Kickstarter, which also means that it's going to be on PS3, Xbox 360, as well as Wii U.
7147030	7153394	Um, there's still 14 days left on it, and if they hit 2.4 million by October 1st, it's gonna have a challenge mode.
7153494	7154455	I wanna see it on PC.
7156596	7157197	That'd be nice.
7158197	7158858	But you know what?
7159838	7160218	Fuck it.
7160579	7161159	I want this game.
7161980	7162440	Who doesn't?
7163020	7166622	Well, I guess we found out in the Fugle question the other week.
7166702	7167863	Not everybody does, I suppose.
7167923	7172106	If it wasn't that $20 could buy me probably a week of food...
7173112	7174353	I'd probably put the money on the game.
7174753	7175114	Just saying.
7175254	7176855	I thought they were releasing it on PC.
7178056	7179097	I mean, I don't know why.
7179898	7182520	They are now, and they're doing that... Oh, no, yeah, I'm sorry.
7182560	7183661	PC was the original.
7183701	7183961	Sorry.
7184021	7189025	PC was the original, and then the console was added, which was the 360, the Wii U. We were doing it through Steam.
7189065	7189545	That was it.
7189746	7191187	But now... Right, yeah.
7191387	7193689	But now the PlayStation 4 is the stretch goal.
7193729	7194650	Or did they hit that, too?
7195270	7196551	See, that just says PS3.
7196571	7197812	I don't know why I said PC.
7197892	7198092	PC.
7200129	7206017	They just said PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. The next goal is challenge mode.
7207045	7210287	They are up to 2.4 million, so they just hit Challenge Mode.
7210307	7211067	They just hit that today.
7211087	7211507	Oh, they did?
7211527	7211747	Okay, sweet.
7211767	7212528	They just hit it today.
7213848	7214669	End Stage Boss.
7214849	7216630	End Stage Boss is the next one they have to hit.
7217070	7221312	If they can get all the way to 3.3 million, there'll be a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version.
7221793	7222353	It could happen.
7222813	7227455	Well, they've got eight days to go, so it's got to happen pretty quick.
7227615	7230337	I kind of don't think it's going to make the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7230817	7233338	I think we'll be lucky if we get to this beck and call online club.
7233358	7233779	However...
7234779	7240927	If it still sells enough copies of it outside of their Kickstarter, it could happen anyway.
7241027	7242629	I mean, it's coming out next year.
7242770	7243571	It just might happen.
7243711	7244372	It might.
7244953	7245253	We'll see.
7247185	7249446	All right, well, let's move on.
7249727	7251828	Loki, a few more stories here and then the mailbag.
7252468	7262474	All right, so with all this talk about next-gen stuff, we've talked a little bit about this whole upgrade program that they're supposed to have for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
7262534	7265176	Well, here's how it's going to work a little bit on the PlayStation 4.
7266256	7274199	To play a digital PlayStation 4 version of an eligible retail PlayStation 3 game, you have to redeem a code that comes with the game.
7275359	7287623	If you buy it on the PlayStation Store, so if you buy a digital copy of Battlefield or something like that, it will automatically unlock the game on PlayStation 4 when you play it.
7288483	7303520	um if you happen to use that code to download I think the digital version it will require you to still have the disc and the drive and they're saying that on the next gen versions of the games um will appear for like 10 bucks I guess if you have that code as well um
7305422	7323589	and then one game though that isn't going to require an additional fee to upgrade it is Final Fantasy XIV you will get a free transfer from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4 however it is a one time transfer so once you've done it you lose rights to your PlayStation 3 game unless of course you buy another copy
7324042	7325842	That part was weird to me because I don't understand.
7325882	7329063	You know, in Final Fantasy XI, you had all of it.
7329283	7332404	If you had, like, a 360 disc, you could sign on with your PC account.
7333044	7338765	I mean, granted, you had to... Most people still got a code because they bought the game on 360 or whatever, but it was just... I don't know.
7339445	7341006	It's kind of like you could do all of it.
7341486	7342506	But, yeah.
7343206	7344566	That square's a little backwards like that sometimes.
7344586	7351408	Well, I'm still excited at least that, you know, I'll have the PlayStation 4 version because I plan on getting a PlayStation 4 and it'll be nice to have Final Fantasy XIV on it, so...
7352288	7362896	Why play it on PlayStation 3 when I have the PlayStation 4 and that'll be... I don't understand why they... I mean, it's not like you can play the game, you know, for free or something.
7362936	7366278	Like you can play on two systems at the same time or something.
7366539	7369681	We're running out of space on this TV to hook in a new console.
7369721	7372263	So if we plug in a new console, something's getting moved to the bedroom.
7372963	7389735	and so the thought is that obviously like oh we're getting the PlayStation 4 let's put the PlayStation 3 and well technically we already Alan has both consoles they're on the bedroom TV but we'll move the PS3 with all our save files on it to the bedroom but I'm actually kind of thinking the 360 might be the one to get exiled to the bedroom
7391243	7391723	So we'll see.
7392103	7392423	I don't know.
7393424	7394144	What about the Wii U?
7394664	7396325	I mean, the Wii U, you don't need that screen.
7396345	7397225	You can play second screen.
7397265	7398025	That's true.
7398065	7400086	You technically don't even need it hooked up to anything.
7400186	7403627	Honestly, though, I'm playing more Wii U than I'm playing Xbox 360 these days.
7404988	7405288	Truth.
7406388	7407068	System selector.
7407088	7407869	Is that true facts?
7408109	7408849	True facts.
7408869	7410270	That reminds me.
7410290	7412630	I need to get on Virtual Console and get Super Mario Brothers for a dollar.
7413231	7414371	Or whatever they're charging for it.
7414747	7415187	You know what?
7415247	7418129	I probably have like five copies of Super Mario Brothers.
7418329	7420750	But not on two screens at the same time.
7420810	7421631	You know what, Rob?
7421931	7422691	You're spoiled.
7423591	7427734	She does if she has a DS copy of the game or a 3DS copy of the game.
7427834	7429695	That's true, which I think I do.
7430715	7431696	I don't know what I have.
7432336	7438201	Since we were talking about NES memories, and I know I've told this story on the show many times, but I don't care.
7438261	7439142	I'm telling it again.
7439743	7448030	One of my earliest memories of DarkSakura was when I went to her house that she had with Dan out in a seedier part of town.
7448710	7450171	Oh, the hood house.
7450492	7454155	I walked in the house, and Dan had all these guys over.
7454195	7456597	All his guy friends were over, and there were TVs all...
7457017	7457937	All over the house.
7458758	7460718	Every single person was playing.
7460878	7462999	I believe it was The Legend of Zelda.
7463199	7463619	It was.
7463699	7467260	Everybody was playing Zelda with Nintendo TVs.
7467300	7473022	And I was like, Jamie, you've got like 10 copies of The Legend of Zelda all going at the same time.
7473082	7474222	What the hell's going on here?
7474262	7476302	And she said, it's our LAN party.
7476342	7478123	It's our local area Nintendo party.
7478183	7478403	Yes.
7478443	7480504	They all started Zelda at the same time.
7480524	7482184	And they're trying to see who's going to beat it first.
7482224	7483525	And Dan's currently in the lead.
7483885	7484825	That's why I married him.
7487952	7489273	You know they still do that, right?
7489593	7491854	Or no, you hadn't married him yet, but that's why he's my man.
7491894	7495215	It took us a while to get married, but he still does stuff like that.
7495616	7502439	Or he'll have Jeff over, and they'll take turns playing through a game just to see how they can speedrun it together.
7502619	7506581	Now that is Nintendo gaming on two screens at once, or in that case.
7507141	7515345	God, literally, there's a TV on the dining room table, a TV in the living room, a TV in the back room, any place they could put a fucking TV...
7516005	7516826	with Nintendo.
7516926	7517607	It was in that house.
7517827	7520290	I'm like, your electric bill must be scary.
7520390	7523594	That was back when we were happy to have our 60 megahertz processor computer.
7524324	7525565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7548482	7549682	POP in Music
7565288	7566069	You might have seen this.
7566249	7568690	It sometimes shows up in Japanese arcades.
7568710	7573453	There's a very famous scene in Lost in Translation, that movie with Bill Murray, that had poppin' music in it.
7573473	7574754	I did that a couple weeks ago.
7575454	7579176	So, yeah, poppin' music's out there, and it is coming to iOS.
7579576	7580177	That is the news.
7581157	7583779	Konami has announced an iOS version of poppin' music.
7583819	7585140	We don't know much more than that.
7585500	7592604	We're all just kind of crossing our fingers and our toes that it's not based off the Nintendo Wii U version, and that it is far better.
7593447	7594928	I want poppin' music, I want poppin' music
7617683	7628845	Hey, shut up, I like Gatchaman I remember, there was a pop-up music machine that was all anime music And they used to have it on Arcade Infinity And then I was playing Cat's Eye
7629554	7630275	Yeah, nice.
7631275	7631956	That's right.
7631996	7634758	I forgot that there were licensed songs in poppin' music at one point.
7635118	7636780	Yeah, it was really fun.
7636840	7639342	I had a good... And, oh, the Yamato theme song.
7639742	7640242	Mm-hmm.
7640503	7643365	The old... Well, it came out over here, Starblazers.
7643405	7645527	Wasn't the Star Trek theme in there randomly, too?
7645567	7646447	I think it was.
7646647	7647928	It's like everything's been in that game.
7647948	7648609	It was the old school one, yeah.
7648889	7651551	Everything's been in that game, but I freaking love poppin' music.
7652152	7656195	Oh, just going back, just traveling back through the past and so forth.
7656235	7656495	All right.
7656575	7658537	I could do poppin' music as a classic.
7658957	7659377	You could.
7659898	7660398	Yeah, I could.
7660558	7661499	But will I?
7661599	7662119	I don't know.
7662179	7662679	I did DDR.
7662800	7664360	Wait till we get to episode 573.
7665601	7665901	Maybe.
7665941	7666562	Hold off a little bit.
7666602	7667002	Maybe.
7667142	7667462	Maybe.
7667923	7668923	All right.
7669103	7669704	Let's go.
7669924	7672606	Let's see if our emailers take us to memory lane this week.
7673524	7679689	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
7679989	7686974	And every week, DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails that hopefully do not have anthrax in them.
7687694	7689456	Or are written in Mandarin.
7689716	7691877	Oh, those freaking spam emails.
7691997	7694099	We need to... Hurt you all.
7694219	7694739	No, I know.
7694879	7696060	I'm gonna cut all those bitches.
7696100	7698262	Somebody was helping me get set up with that and all that, too.
7698282	7699383	I just... Priorities.
7699643	7700063	Priorities.
7700784	7701244	DarkSakura.
7701284	7702105	Can I still cut a bitch?
7703225	7704546	Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com
7732378	7732558	No.
7733219	7733519	Okay.
7734920	7736422	But it's not like you hate Disneyland.
7736502	7737483	No, I don't hate Disneyland.
7737943	7739344	I'm talking, of course, about Disneyland.
7740545	7743928	I am thinking of taking my girlfriend to Disneyland for our anniversary in late November.
7744088	7744489	Do it!
7745550	7749613	I was wondering if you guys had any recommendation for how many days we should spend one or two.
7750534	7753737	And whether or not we should get a park cop or pass or just go in one of the parks.
7753757	7753877	Get to...
7756039	7757480	Get your park hopper, trust me.
7757740	7759362	Because, yeah, get it.
7760743	7764826	And which park is better, in your opinion, is quote, better?
7766027	7767548	The main park, if you have to pick one.
7768308	7770230	But California Adventure has tons of fun stuff.
7770350	7775834	And the good thing is that when one side is busier, usually the other side is a lot less busy.
7776014	7777596	And you can drink in California Adventure.
7778036	7780038	Which sometimes you need to get through the other park.
7780058	7780438	Yeah.
7781178	7786122	My honest advice, if your girlfriend's never been to Disneyland, did I catch that in the email?
7786162	7788283	That the girlfriend had never been or hadn't been in a long time?
7788303	7788944	It doesn't say.
7789284	7799852	If either of you have not been to Disneyland in a very long time or you've never been, take the two days to go so that way you can spend one day in each park type of thing.
7800152	7801193	Disney does have a deal.
7801253	7804575	It's not a park hopper per se, but it's one day, one park for like two days.
7806296	7809517	I think the park hoppers are a little better for what Jamie said.
7809537	7811619	You can literally hop from one park to the other.
7811979	7813860	But don't forget the California Adventure.
7814040	7821384	Ever since they finished their remodel with Cars Land and redoing some of the rides, it's not a joke anymore.
7821424	7822364	It's a premier park.
7822804	7823985	It's a fun place to go.
7824085	7825786	You can spend an entire day there easy.
7825846	7827767	The next thing in the email takes me to that point.
7828267	7833810	We are from San Francisco, so the draw of an authentic Northern California experience from Disney's California Adventure is not a factor for us.
7834210	7835530	The Whoopi Goldberg Movie is Gone
7856519	7858240	But definitely go see the Aladdin thing.
7858300	7858680	Trust me.
7858960	7859700	Go see the Aladdin thing.
7859720	7860560	The thing's awesome.
7860620	7861000	See you, lad.
7862701	7866542	I do like the Toy Story roller coaster shooter, Midway Madness.
7866822	7867682	That's super fun.
7868082	7870483	Just make sure to bring Advil because your arm will hurt when you're done.
7871303	7872604	Not if you're a guy.
7874136	7876657	No, you should be used to that back and forward motion.
7877017	7877737	Just maybe not.
7878178	7879538	No, it is kind of low, isn't it?
7879678	7880718	Let's keep going with the email.
7880878	7882919	La, la, la, la, la.
7883279	7886140	And I like the one roller coaster that's in the dark and stuff.
7886260	7887161	Oh, there's a lot of dark rides.
7887181	7888161	That's an easy way to practice, I mean.
7889702	7890282	You know what?
7890982	7893983	Anyway, I'd like to hear the host's thoughts and recommendation.
7894283	7896164	Tell your girlfriend she might need to practice.
7897565	7898645	Only if she's into reach arounds.
7901158	7901959	Stand across the room.
7902039	7904540	This poor emailer was not anticipating this.
7904560	7908423	Anyway, I'd like to hear the host's thoughts and recommendations so I can start budgeting and planning this.
7908603	7909804	Thanks and keep up the great work.
7909844	7911665	Yours truly, AZHP.
7913086	7913387	Yes.
7914307	7915948	Actually, I took Dan to see Aladdin.
7917069	7920051	And I saw Bobby saying that you took him to see.
7920111	7921492	I did when we went after E3.
7921592	7922173	I took Dan.
7922953	7926536	Dan and I went to see Aladdin and we sat next to an Australian guy and his son.
7926596	7930439	And his son was so adorable but we kept chatting with the guy and told him places to eat and that type of thing.
7931639	7938024	See, Bobby and I did both parks in one day, but he's been before, and there's a lot of things that Bobby's like, I don't need to do that.
7938704	7940025	I don't need to do that.
7940045	7943287	Bobby didn't want to do the upside-down roller coaster.
7943407	7945128	There's certain things on his list.
7945809	7947090	There wasn't an upside-down one.
7947530	7948531	At California Adventure, there is.
7948911	7949932	Oh, yeah.
7950172	7951212	But it's not even that bad.
7951292	7952033	It's so smooth.
7952513	7962757	My other suggestion would be if you and your girlfriend can put out a list and you find that there's some rides we don't really want to do, maybe you can do them both in a day.
7963237	7965497	But I would say take the time to take it slow.
7966438	7972000	If you want to make it really romantic, dude, get some reservations at Carthay Circle or Blue Bayou.
7972280	7972840	Do Blue Bayou.
7973920	7975761	I think Carthay Circle's really good.
7976361	7977461	The food's really good.
7977481	7978821	But Blue Bayou is the classic.
7978941	7979822	Blue Bayou is the classic.
7979842	7980662	You have to kind of decide.
7981342	7982882	If you really want to get laid, do both.
7984343	7987263	Well, you know, I typically do Blue Bayou when I'm there for my birthday.
7987844	7989884	And lunch is cheaper and still romantic.
7990084	7992065	Yeah, and you get free desserts if it's your birthday.
7994385	7997946	At any rate, actually this is what you should do.
7998566	8001407	Get dessert reservations for Fantasmic.
8002505	8003065	Have you ever done that?
8024136	8027397	All right, we could have a Disneyland podcast, but we better move on to the next email.
8027717	8029258	Just talk to us later, trust me.
8029638	8034479	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, OLR, helping you get laid for 520 episodes and counting.
8035980	8036740	Last email.
8036800	8038681	Greetings, Orange Lodge Radio.
8039481	8042942	I decided to send you guys an email since you have been getting very few recently.
8043422	8045723	I'm a long-time listener and a second-time emailer.
8046463	8047144	Thanks for watching!
8063662	8068046	and it's €199 with the one with the 12 gigabyte and flash storage.
8068446	8070568	But I am not sure if this is a wise purchase.
8070988	8076413	With the new consoles coming out, the system is dying and money is tight as I'm saving up for a new PC for work.
8077974	8081157	Do you think it is worth waiting for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V?
8081658	8085581	Is there any indication that this time around there won't be a PC version?
8085661	8087002	They've already seen coding for the PC.
8087202	8088564	I think there's going to be a PC version.
8088584	8089965	It's just it's not going to be right now.
8090760	8094801	And on top of that, you won't have to worry about graphics since you're saving up for a new PC, right?
8096501	8101883	It would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the purchase of a console near the end of its life cycle, but with new machines on the horizon.
8102243	8106364	Is it still worth it because it is a Blu-ray player and does Netflix and all that?
8106804	8108924	I mean, yeah, it's fairly cheap.
8109204	8111485	I mean, it depends on what your needs are.
8111525	8115246	You know, you can build a PC that has a Blu-ray player in it too and does Netflix.
8115606	8118808	We have a PC hooked up to our TV right now at my house.
8119428	8123951	The only thing that we do not do on that thing is watch Blu-rays, which we use our PS3 for.
8124651	8130134	So it's just a matter... You might even find system refurbs that are even cheaper.
8130254	8132615	So you'd have to check.
8133156	8139979	I'm not sure that you've got Craigslist, but I'm sure that you've got thrift stores and the equivalent of flea markets.
8140059	8140279	You know...
8141420	8141741	DarkSakura.com
8146798	8153622	I would say, too, don't forget that this generation of consoles will not be backwards compatible with the upcoming... You know what I mean.
8153662	8157544	The PS4 will not play PS3 games, and the Xbox One will not play 360 games.
8158544	8162586	I know there's the Gaikai rumblings out there and so forth, but we haven't really seen that gel together yet.
8162606	8164487	We don't know what that's going to look like right now.
8164587	8166528	Something to consider.
8166568	8171731	If there are a lot of console games you do want to play out of this generation, then go ahead and take the plunge and get one of the consoles.
8172111	8173412	because this is your chance.
8173572	8178493	Although PC, certainly there's a lot of the stuff on PC.
8178533	8189077	I think you really have to evaluate where are the games I want to play, and I think it's okay to assume in that case I will be able to play Grand Theft Auto V on PC in a year.
8189697	8191138	Can you wait an entire year?
8191898	8195479	I'm almost certain it's going to be less than that, but we'll see.
8195499	8195980	I don't think so.
8196000	8196400	We'll see.
8197937	8204159	I guess it does come down to, in the end, how badly do you want it and how quickly can you recover the money that you spend on it.
8205199	8212000	Me, personally, if something was coming out, well, you know what, I'm not actually going to say that I've done it.
8213241	8216922	I got a 3DS because I wanted to fucking play Animal Crossing.
8217262	8217962	And what did I do?
8219662	8227008	I asked around on the internet if anyone was selling their 3DS and lo and behold, Slidekick was.
8228109	8232533	And so I bought his for two... Shout out for Gamebuoy.org.
8232613	8233634	Two network cards.
8234134	8236216	And then we went right out and bought Animal Crossing.
8237176	8242521	And then Dan picked up the last Fire Emblem for the Wii.
8243562	8243762	So...
8245568	8246369	I'm not one to talk.
8246749	8250072	Freaking buy it.
8250733	8253536	You really do have to weigh out how badly do you want it.
8253696	8257919	And I'll tell you this, I've played Animal Crossing every day since I bought it.
8259060	8262323	Which is saying something for me playing a game every day.
8263084	8268969	So if you're going to play Grand Theft Auto V every day, then it's probably a worthwhile purchase.
8271551	8273673	and yeah, you do get the benefit of a Blu-ray player.
8273733	8275534	It's probably still a cheaper Blu-ray player.
8275834	8296508	I think when Becky bought hers, my best friend, when she bought her actual dedicated Blu-ray player, it cost her about maybe $150 something dollars, which would probably be less in euros, but it only plays Blu-rays and you're getting a game system out of it that does Netflix and does all this other stuff.
8297288	8299070	And like Rob said, there's no backwards compatibility.
8300911	8302152	Way that and decide what you will.
8302912	8308436	So to continue with the end of this email, I love listening to the show on my commute to work.
8308496	8308936	Keep it up.
8309336	8309677	Thank you.
8310357	8311037	Thank you.
8311578	8315080	This email is brought to you by Belgium, the fairytale land of waffles, chocolate, and beer.
8315600	8315941	Martin.
8316861	8317262	P.S.
8317302	8319463	You should have Jim Sally as a regular guest on the show.
8319523	8320584	He is hilarious.
8321044	8321404	Grin.
8321804	8323125	He's welcome anytime.
8323345	8325505	And you know how to sell your country, sir.
8326286	8327986	Waffles and beer and chocolate.
8328006	8329527	I want to go to Belgium.
8329547	8330787	I want to go to Belgium, too.
8331607	8334188	You know what else we could do, though, if we were in Belgium, Rob?
8334308	8336069	Broadcast live from that emailer's house?
8336749	8343231	Besides that, we could actually cheaply travel and meet all of our friends that live in Europe.
8343251	8343791	That would be awesome.
8343811	8346912	We could go talk to our official Swede.
8348434	8349837	We could go hang out with Syl.
8349957	8351600	We haven't heard from Ake Ripper in forever.
8351720	8353584	I would love to do an OLR episode with Syl.
8353604	8354686	It would be amazing.
8355214	8357796	And then we can go find Mr. Kidman.
8357956	8363719	Didn't they used to have those contests for MTV or whatever back in the day where MTV would broadcast at your house if you won a contest?
8364159	8367301	We need to have an OLR comes to your house contest.
8367742	8370143	Whoever pays the most wins.
8372625	8373665	I'll be a fun Kickstarter thing.
8373705	8376007	I want to go to Europe.
8376027	8377067	Let's do a GoFundMe.
8377147	8378088	OLR goes to Europe.
8380329	8380770	Alright.
8381830	8382711	If that's it for emails...
8384647	8385729	All two of them!
8385829	8388653	I will tell you to send more next time.
8389314	8396784	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com And if we don't get enough emails, this next segment will only get angstier.
8397605	8398046	FUs of the Week!
8413450	8414691	I'm fairly pissy, Rob.
8415252	8415532	Why?
8415872	8417314	Because of stuff.
8417334	8418334	Okay.
8418374	8419315	So I have a list.
8419856	8421137	Fuck you to my air conditioner.
8421717	8425381	Because when I turn on the air conditioner, I don't want a face full of the inferno.
8426181	8427603	I want a face full of cold.
8428163	8429925	Thankfully, it's cool enough outside.
8431474	8438957	FU, I'm not going to say FU because the rain made today a lot nicer, but it rained for Sacramento for this time of year.
8439057	8442478	And we're going into our rainy season, but it freaking rained and I was at Apple Hill.
8443639	8444899	I was trying to enjoy myself.
8445099	8449461	Instead, I'm having to schlog up a red, muddy hill.
8449981	8454783	And then I thought I was taking a picture of a pig's cute little tail.
8455243	8457144	No, I took a picture of a pig taking a piss.
8457924	8459785	It's on my Tumblr for anyone who wants to see it.
8462093	8471056	Also, F you to guys who want their woman to take care of them and not do anything to contribute.
8471876	8473537	Of course, F you to the other way around.
8473977	8476517	It takes an equal fucking partnership.
8477518	8480619	It takes two to make a thing go right.
8480639	8481279	Well, true.
8482059	8485620	If you are in a relationship, don't expect a free ride.
8485740	8486541	Do your fucking part.
8488621	8488921	Loki!
8489621	8491202	It takes two to make it out of sight.
8493940	8521795	just F you to my throat hurting or being sore I hate that, it's annoying that's it my F you of the week goes to the casino my F you of the week goes to Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln, California fuck them they took $20 out of my pocket and one of their machines ate it whole but here was the best part I took my mother to go see Kathy Griffin at Thunder Valley Casino because my mom loves Kathy Griffin
8522595	8524237	By the way, F you to Kathy Griffin.
8524297	8524818	Sorry, honey.
8524958	8525879	You just weren't that funny.
8526560	8528242	Like, you're funnier in your Bravo specials.
8528622	8530164	I could tell we were being workshopped.
8531005	8531506	Sorry, hon.
8531546	8532527	Just wasn't working for me.
8532547	8535610	You know, the one time I saw George Carlin was on one of his workshops, too.
8535651	8535991	Yeah.
8536411	8537092	You gotta be careful.
8537292	8539996	I've seen Margaret Cho on a workshop tour, and it was like half and half, you know?
8540436	8542436	But anyway, so where was I?
8542456	8542776	Let's see.
8542856	8544717	Oh, yes, my mom loves Kathy Griffin, right?
8544737	8546837	So I want to take my mom out to something she enjoys.
8547217	8551698	And she gave me $20 because she's like, I want to help pay for the ticket, even though the ticket was like $70.
8551758	8553578	So I want to help pay for the ticket.
8553598	8554158	I'm like, okay.
8554438	8557579	So I took her $20, put it in a slot machine right in front of her.
8559579	8561540	And I was like, your $20 is gone, Mom.
8562100	8566280	She's like, Rob, that's why you don't gamble.
8566481	8568741	Rob, you should know better than to gamble.
8569574	8570255	You know what, though?
8570335	8573238	I'm very sad that the buffet wasn't open for you guys.
8573298	8574840	It was open, it was just very crowded.
8575881	8576622	The buffet there?
8577002	8581347	And for me, who's not a huge buffet fan, their buffet is fucking good.
8581507	8583028	But the coffee shop was good, too.
8583048	8583949	That's good.
8584270	8585691	Alan took a picture of that burger and put it on Twitter.
8585711	8586953	And you know they do have Fat Burger there.
8588694	8590076	But my mom didn't want to go to Fat Burger.
8591454	8594256	My mom wanted to go and, you know, Rob.
8595236	8596817	I don't want to eat at the buffet, Rob.
8598999	8601681	People just cough and sneeze on everything.
8602861	8603922	That's how you get sick.
8604623	8606284	Buffets give you diarrhea, Rob.
8609467	8610468	I adore your mom, you know.
8611089	8613071	And your impersonation is hilarious.
8613091	8615053	Did you see the Vine I posted of my mom?
8616895	8619117	I had to delete the tweet because my mom... Rob!
8619257	8620698	I didn't say you could put that on the internet.
8620798	8621119	Rob!
8621789	8622909	Put it on Tumblr.
8623650	8626510	She didn't say I couldn't play it on my show, though.
8626871	8628951	I'll have to bring that up.
8629111	8629951	I'll bring that up later.
8631892	8634273	Let's do a news story and then I'll come back to this topic.
8634633	8641955	Alright, let's talk about the ever continuing saga in the Ouya Free-to-Games program.
8642495	8651238	Well, Ouya has removed one of the games from the Free-to-Games program and that would have been the one that was Dungeons...
8651798	8662440	The Eye of Draconis, you know, the one that they blatantly admitted that their family paid for, you know, the backing of that Kickstarter.
8662480	8663480	So they have been removed.
8664360	8670481	And, you know, they, of course, saying, oh, it appears we were thrown under the Free to Games bus.
8670521	8673902	We get their fall guy and Gridiron keeps their money.
8674942	8677823	But the thing was, though, Gridiron, I don't believe...
8680465	8683489	I believe they dropped out of the whole 3D games thing.
8683529	8686753	They said they cancelled the Kickstarter project.
8689136	8694063	They have no plans to develop on the OUYA or something like that.
8698444	8704409	I remember they said they got a ton of backers as it was so they didn't need to develop exclusively on the Ouya anymore.
8704929	8709433	And also, on top of this, the whole free games fund has been tweaked.
8709913	8715057	Now no longer will the games have to be Ouya exclusive.
8716158	8719960	Instead, they are saying for every $10,000 in rewards issued by Ouya...
8722722	8728246	Matching crowdfunding efforts, developers will need to agree in one month of exclusivity.
8730207	8733128	But they could still publish on PC at the same time.
8733829	8735810	So they don't have to just launch on the OUYA.
8738863	8744084	and then also they're saying that instead of $50,000 as a minimum the requirement is now $10,000.
8744164	8752886	So $10,000 and then for every $10,000 raised after that they will be backed another $10,000 I guess.
8753226	8756627	And they also have to have a minimum of 100 backers to be eligible.
8760208	8764409	Is this going to fix the problem that this thing has been having or is this too little too late?
8765546	8769929	I think it's too little too late, and at the same time, I still think people will try to game it.
8770069	8784941	I mean, because, you know, the Gridiron Thunder thing, I don't think the whole reason that they're saying, oh, we need funding to finish this game, but the game is literally coming out in like two weeks after it's done.
8785361	8789644	I'm sorry, I just don't buy for, you know, oh, we need $100,000 to finish the game in two weeks.
8791165	8796309	I could see a game that's coming out a year from now or something.
8796389	8797670	Okay, then you need the funding.
8797710	8804615	But if a game that's already pretty much done and they're just putting it out two weeks later, I think it was just to make up some money.
8805596	8807657	Okay, we have this really shitty game we made.
8807998	8815043	It's going to be exclusive to OUYA, but who gives a shit because we made our money back anyways from them matching our funding.
8815223	8817425	So I think that's what the scam was there.
8817465	8819006	And I still think you can see that where...
8819386	8820967	Someone has a game that's ready to go.
8821787	8822327	And why not?
8822407	8823647	Let's put it on Kickstarter.
8823727	8824588	Put the goal at $10,000.
8825048	8829729	And if they can hit it, they make another $10,000 on top of it.
8830570	8831610	And it could be a good game.
8831870	8833851	At the same time, I think it could help indie guys.
8833931	8836712	But it's been exploited three times already.
8836892	8840153	So, you know, I don't know.
8841073	8844594	I noticed that you are selling your Ouya on eBay at this point.
8844814	8847235	And do you want to give a quick plug how somebody can get a hold of that?
8847657	8850460	I just... You can follow me on Twitter.
8851101	8853844	It's just on eBay.
8853964	8855645	I mean, $32 right now.
8856546	8859249	Yeah, BlackWolf points that out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
8859289	8862172	Loki's Ouya is only $32 on eBay right now.
8862372	8866056	And $32 with a... There's still the unused code.
8866116	8867638	Remember they did that stupid thing, the...
8867998	8875487	You're our elite, you Kickstarter backers, and we're going to give you $13.37 store credit on the OUYA shop.
8875587	8878170	Well, I haven't used that store credit, so that code is in there.
8878490	8882475	So really, you can subtract about $13 off that, and so it's still a pretty good deal.
8883336	8897933	and it works I mean it's just once again just like why maybe getting rid of Disney Infinity next week just I don't have time for all this stuff and I need to slim down you know because you know money money is tight of course for with everybody it happens especially this time of year
8898914	8900294	Alright, can we go back to stories about my mom?
8900414	8900754	Yeah, sure.
8900834	8901955	Alright.
8902155	8907136	Alright, so we're at the Kathy Griffin concert and they're playing pop music and my mom doesn't listen to pop music, right?
8907556	8911157	So she hears this song by Will.i.am and Britney Spears.
8911177	8911837	Have you heard this song?
8912237	8913037	This is what's playing.
8913117	8914358	Do I listen to crap?
8914418	8915358	My mom hears this.
8915718	8918578	When you hear this in the club, you're gonna turn this shit up.
8918598	8920299	You're gonna turn this shit up.
8924319	8924879	Oh, shit.
8924939	8925059	Shit.
8954979	8955642	Live radio.
8955682	8956526	Just play them hard.
8957216	8961118	This part, here we go.
8963180	8968783	And when that came up, my mom looked at me and goes, Rah, did Britney Spears just call herself a bitch?
8970264	8971985	I think that was Britney comma bitch.
8972005	8973166	If it quacks like a duck.
8973806	8974106	Right?
8974466	8976308	So I decided, so what do you do?
8976368	8978049	You have to capture the moment live.
8978409	8980950	So I whip out my cell phone and I make a vine.
8981831	8982872	What do you think of this song?
8984272	8986113	I think Britney Spears is a skank.
8986534	8986654	What?
8989876	8990897	What's Vine?
8990997	8991757	Oh, you don't know Vine?
8991777	8993999	It's like Twitter, but with videos.
8994019	8996841	You can only do six-second videos, and they loop, and they loop.
8996901	9001984	So that's the Vine I made is my mom's opinion on Will.i.am and Britney, bitch.
9003530	9004550	What do you think of this song?
9004570	9007711	I think Britney Spears is a scam.
9025356	9037126	Like Britney follows you Like Britney follows my ma And I even said, I'm like, Britney doesn't follow you on Twitter Well, one of her friends might tell her I think that she's been called worse Right?
9038627	9052619	And let's be real, she is kind of a skank Alright, we love her But she is entitled to be a skank if she chooses that That's right, that is her choice It is her choice as a woman to be a skank To be free with her love She's also a mother
9055074	9057356	And that's what feminism is all about, the right to make choices.
9059177	9060658	And not be judged by the man.
9062219	9063340	Or whatever.
9063420	9065761	I wish I could show my mom all the love she's getting in chat right now.
9066001	9067882	Actdeft says, love Rob's mom.
9068383	9071045	GamerGirl says, ha ha ha, oh my god, Rob's mom rocks.
9071705	9075107	She does rock, and I hope maybe we can get her on the show in the future.
9075347	9079690	I adore your mom, but I don't think that your mom and my mom should ever be in the same room.
9079710	9080431	No, they should not.
9080451	9081091	That would be frightening.
9081211	9082212	No, they should not.
9082412	9084954	especially when my mom's on one of her pissy rants
9108934	9111136	I remember them in Super Mario Galaxy.
9130968	9140491	As if the game wasn't scary enough, now you can immerse yourself in the world and become best friends with the fence like I did in Slender The Arrival.
9155075	9155975	Oh, good luck with that.
9156056	9164839	So all I'm hoping is that maybe Bobby, maybe in a year's time, Bobby will be a little more willing to subject his Oculus Rift to some other things.
9165539	9169281	So before I have the gummy bears, maybe I can play a little Slenderman and Oculus Rift.
9169601	9170221	I'm still waiting.
9170461	9174843	He got a YouTube of me playing the Oculus Rift, and I'm sure it's funny.
9175592	9191233	5th Dream Tattles on Rob Roberts to my BFF It wasn't me, it was my mom Yeah, but you made it where Brittany can see it, Rob Not anymore, I had to delete the tweet We need to get my mom on the show It's still out there if you know where to look
9191613	9191893	All right.
9193854	9194295	So there it is.
9194335	9195695	Slenderman on Oculus Rift.
9197577	9202739	I know a lot of folks here on OLR don't know my friend Gemet, which if you listen to Horde House, I'm sure you've heard him.
9203240	9204701	He's contributed to the show a number of times.
9205001	9207963	He hosts his own show, except it is also live on Sunday night.
9208003	9209123	So unfortunately, we're up against each other.
9209503	9212765	But Gemet does some amazing live streams of Oculus Rift.
9213446	9216628	If you think I scream like crazy, you should see Gemet.
9216848	9219689	I'm just going to give him some props and a shout out.
9220310	9220430	So...
9221192	9222153	All right, that's it.
9222213	9223354	That's it for stories.
9224514	9229838	It's time to go to Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and more importantly, the Skype line.
9230819	9233461	I love Twitter, too, but I like the live calls a lot.
9233501	9238925	So Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9239305	9243067	While I bring up those tweets, Loki, did you have any last-minute stories for us tonight?
9243608	9250333	No, but I'm working on researching vacuum forming for a custom case mod.
9250353	9250413	Wow.
9251115	9251515	Okay.
9251535	9257037	Remember I told you I was going to make like a... Remember that thing that is the cross plane or whatever?
9257317	9257477	Yeah.
9257537	9265159	It's funny enough, actually, the website that I was looking up the method for doing some vacuum forming stuff is actually the guy that is doing the cross plane.
9265579	9271561	I didn't realize because I immediately clicked his other links and stuff.
9271621	9273281	And then I'm like, oh, hey, scroll down a little bit.
9273361	9275122	Oh, there's a whole bunch of stuff with the cross plane here.
9275282	9277523	Oh, it's his device.
9277543	9278643	Okay.
9279031	9286058	Alright, again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9286619	9288821	Let me get to some tweets while we wait for the calls to come in.
9289762	9299612	JMO1986 sent a tweet that said, Currently at Tokyo Game Show 2013, telling people I meet in line about OLR and VOG Network and spreading the word.
9300373	9302215	You sir get a fast clap.
9303996	9307680	We ask at the end of every show, if you like what you hear, tell a friend or two about the show.
9307740	9308540	You are doing that.
9309161	9310062	You are a good man.
9310082	9311443	You get love and a gold star.
9311503	9311863	Yes, you do.
9311923	9314986	You get the official OLR gold star tweet of the week.
9316187	9317448	We just made that up, but you get it.
9319610	9320051	Let's see.
9320891	9322132	Actdeft sends us a tweet.
9322873	9331195	Developer WayForward wants to make a My Little Pony game and rallies bronies to tell Hasbro to make it a reality.
9332321	9335763	WayForward, of course, made DuckTales, what, they made Contra 4.
9336364	9340107	Some of their games have been a little hit and miss, but more so probably hits than misses.
9340127	9343949	Talk to Activision, because I think they're the one that has a Hasbro license.
9344169	9344450	Do they?
9344470	9349233	At least they do for Transformers, and they, no.
9349253	9354497	Wasn't Skullgirls able to get some My Little Pony stuff, or was that, no, no, it was like characters made by the same person.
9354537	9361662	Yeah, that was, it wasn't Skullgirls, it was that, um, the Fighting is Magic thing, where they, now it's something different, but, um...
9362582	9391101	yeah I don't remember who has like the family party games now because it used to be I thought it was Activision then it was or EA and now it's Ubisoft maybe I don't know that keeps getting tossed around wow I've never seen quite a more polarizing tweet in our chat room BlackWolf says don't do it way forward spend your time on better projects and Ranma says fuck yes way forward it will happen mark my words and ActDev says Gameloft has the MLB game
9392983	9393563	You know what?
9394323	9398245	If they can make Mick kids, they can make a fucking My Little Pony game.
9398285	9398866	I don't even care.
9399546	9400266	I don't care.
9400367	9403708	There's been a My Little Pony game, and I think it was on the Nintendo back in the day.
9404449	9405809	And it was the good My Little Pony.
9406590	9407891	The kind I grew up with.
9408071	9409532	If they can make Sneak King...
9410612	9437604	you go ahead with your bad self and make my where the fuck are my goddamn new 360 connect games for Burger King seriously that was promised to me like five years no not five years ago but like a few years ago I'm very disappointed that there's not a follow-up to Snake King because that was a fucking brilliant shit right there all right uh Tiger Claw says it's an interesting tweet uh Lucasfilm will combine video games and movies to act the post-production process
9438564	9444587	Video game engines will be used in filmmaking with the two disciplines combining to eliminate the movie post-production process.
9457014	9486361	well this actually kind of makes sense you know video games are getting so realistic these days that I'm sure they can probably mix in you know some of the stuff they do in movies like in the engines really kind of ramp up the process with making some of this that'd be fun if like you can move characters around in the movie and stuff interactive movies it's like using the force for real Tiger Claw also sends his tweet the PlayStation 4 exclusive Deep Down set to be free to play
9487423	9492005	Or wouldn't it be even funnier if you could reskin the characters that are in the movie or something like that?
9492305	9493106	Anything's possible.
9493366	9495247	I want Jar Jar to look stupider.
9496267	9496988	Or stupid.
9497048	9504151	Quickly, before I go to the phones, Capcom announced at Tokyo Game Show 2013 that the PlayStation 4 exclusive Deep Down will be free to play.
9504711	9507493	You might remember this had come out at, what was it, E3 or something?
9507513	9509474	They were showing that off, so that's kind of surprising.
9509554	9509794	Yeah.
9509914	9510854	So, very cool.
9511435	9514436	More on that in a minute, but first we're going to go to the phone lines and take a call.
9514496	9515517	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9515537	9515857	Who's this?
9516823	9517744	Hey, this is Actdeft.
9517804	9518984	Hey, Actdeft, how you doing?
9520025	9524688	Pretty good, despite people hating on the MLP game, but okay.
9525068	9526329	It's tough to be a brony.
9527189	9527609	Yeah, yeah.
9527829	9529711	Well, I'm not going to talk about that.
9529991	9531091	I want to talk about another thing.
9531372	9533333	All right, something a little less controversial.
9533353	9533753	That's fine.
9533793	9534714	What's up, Actdeft?
9535214	9538456	Kind of controversial, but still.
9539676	9541998	People selling humble bundle games.
9542318	9543358	Fuck those people!
9543938	9544478	Fuck them!
9545019	9547339	Oh, that annoys me so bad!
9547719	9551240	Especially when it's... Sorry, Actdeft, I know it's your call, but you got me going.
9551900	9560581	Especially when it's... Oh, man, when it was all charity, like that EA bundle was all charity, those people that were buying the codes and selling them on eBay, scum.
9561042	9561482	And then what?
9561522	9566863	When they got confronted, it was just like, well, you know, the demand's out there, so, you know, we're just... People don't have to buy them.
9566883	9567063	Blah.
9568883	9571944	Yeah, I really hate those people.
9572804	9575625	There's a Facebook group I follow.
9576346	9581447	It's a local group that resells games and anime stuff and all that.
9582167	9586449	And there was one person that sold the Origin Bundle.
9587529	9612046	and like maybe four times the price he paid for all the games and I was like dude seriously those games were sold like for a fraction of the price you paid and they were especially they were all for charity so it's like what the fuck and now the same thing happened with another person
9612907	9613087	Actdeft
9636357	9658472	and I've called out other podcasts, not by name, but I've called out shows, podcasts, websites, blogs that give away bundle codes that are piecemealed from somebody else's bundle, the games they didn't want and it's one thing when it's between friends and so forth, but let's not forget
9659332	9662494	A lot of this money goes to charity and it goes to the developers.
9663014	9666717	When you piecemeal it like that, you're kind of taking it away from them.
9667277	9669438	And it's like these bundles are such a great deal.
9669538	9670559	Like it's just – I don't know.
9671480	9672440	I get really bothered by it.
9672460	9673561	I play devil's advocate though.
9673601	9678204	I mean sometimes like especially with Humble Bundle 9, I know I have some extra games I need to give away.
9678644	9680185	I already have those games.
9680425	9683487	And like I'm buying the bundle and I'm getting it anyways.
9684087	9685828	And I can't redeem it twice.
9685848	9686008	I mean –
9687311	9693474	Again, it's one thing if you're giving it to a friend or, you know, somebody like even somebody like a Twitter follower that you know for a long time.
9693534	9694675	I mean, that's kind of one thing.
9695035	9701098	But it's just like another to like use it to profit yourself and your own brand.
9701138	9708662	If that makes sense what I'm saying because I'm still like – Like follow this website and get a chance to blah, blah, blah.
9708722	9711383	You might still be like, oh, okay, I'm unloading my free codes.
9711423	9712524	But if you think about it,
9713544	9720649	Why doesn't your friend that wants to take the code just pay $5 to the site and have the $4 go to charity or whatever?
9720669	9724612	I don't see a problem if it's already over, like that bundle is already done.
9724632	9725713	Yeah, yeah.
9726693	9727534	It's not as bad.
9727574	9728654	Let me just put it this way.
9728835	9731256	I don't mean to be all like, if you do this, I hate you.
9731336	9732637	I'm not saying that at all.
9733218	9735099	I'm just saying, you know, think about it.
9735679	9738781	Shouldn't we be encouraging people to go buy the bundle themselves?
9739362	9742284	Because eventually the money does go to charity, right?
9743204	9760162	and especially in the case of the EA bundle I mean one can argue like you know and I think Actdeft you had a funny story about this like you know I bought a bundle but I don't fucking want Fez I am staying 100 miles away from Fez it's that's kind of a different set than what I'm talking about you know what I mean
9761824	9769233	The irony part of that is that I gave money to the developers and forgot to take out the part of the fest.
9769334	9770034	Oh well.
9770335	9770735	No well.
9771777	9773359	I don't think you can piecemeal it that way.
9773619	9778406	I do get what you're saying because I did it with my...
9780968	9786494	I gave it to people that maybe wanted the game and I didn't profit from it.
9786814	9788176	I didn't want more followers.
9788296	9792260	I didn't want more people to follow me on Twitter or Facebook.
9792720	9796164	I just, hey, who wants a code for this game and this game?
9796805	9797866	Oh, yeah, I want one.
9798326	9800689	And some were close friends, so...
9802014	9802974	I don't mind that.
9803154	9808496	But yeah, like you said, like, oh, follow me and get a code or something like that.
9808536	9810076	Yeah, that's pretty shit.
9810316	9812556	I don't mean to be like calling people out or whatever.
9812616	9813477	Maybe a little bit.
9813517	9817178	But because Bobby's in chat going, I shouldn't give away my bastion code on the show.
9817258	9817938	Rob hates me.
9817978	9819198	And I'm like, no, that's not what it is.
9819238	9820158	I don't hate you.
9820558	9822779	I'm just saying, think about it this way.
9823419	9824500	Think about it this way.
9824580	9828762	Shouldn't we really be encouraging people to go buy the bundles and give the money to charity and so forth?
9829042	9836366	And then maybe after the fact, you know, a long time when that's no longer an option, maybe give away the bastion code or whatever it is.
9836426	9837607	That, I think, is acceptable.
9837767	9838007	Yeah.
9838187	9842690	You know, I've probably got duplicate codes for some games because I bought multiple bundles.
9843630	9846011	And I don't mind if it's a friend of mine giving away a code.
9846171	9847092	Yeah, me neither.
9847832	9848833	I usually just give them to Dan.
9849534	9850194	There you go.
9850735	9851816	So anyway, sorry Actdeft.
9852477	9854820	I just wanted to clarify before the hate mail started rolling in.
9857398	9859360	Oh, well, that's pretty much it.
9860021	9865106	Like I said, even then, I don't mind people giving away the codes.
9865226	9867468	It's selling them for a profit.
9868108	9870150	Yeah, that's the really bad stuff.
9870190	9873634	If you're selling these on eBay, if you're flipping this on eBay, then I hate you.
9873914	9875636	Then it's okay to say that Rob hates you.
9875796	9878959	I would absolutely hate you if you flip these on eBay for a profit.
9879640	9879760	So...
9881072	9895263	definitely alright, Actdeft, thank you for the call that was a great topic to bring up and got me all revved up for a rant good for you well, thanks take care buddy you too
9897170	9901532	Alright, uh, 1877 GameOLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9901572	9903873	We certainly have time to take one or two more calls.
9904854	9908575	Meanwhile, I wanted to kind of get back into this deep down going free-to-play.
9909416	9915578	The Capcom's role-playing game should be arriving as an open beta near the launch of the PlayStation 4 in Japan.
9915939	9916899	That would be like February 2014.
9917039	9923702	And it will have procedurally generated dungeons and runs on the new Panta Ray engine.
9923842	9925283	That's a Capcom engine, so...
9925763	9929227	The Panty Raid Engine Hi, this is For The Fallen Dreams, can you hear me?
9929287	9929768	Greetings!
9946167	9948428	Hi, yeah, it's been a while since I've called in.
9948509	9951611	I'm normally a podcast listener because I'm East Coast.
9951631	9952731	I'm in South Carolina.
9952791	9956173	So that's all I really have time for is the podcast.
9956193	9959015	But I thought I'd call in and give you guys a shout.
9960016	9960636	Happy midnight.
9960696	9962958	Yeah, I appreciate you staying up late.
9963058	9965219	I appreciate you staying up late to listen tonight.
9966380	9968741	Yeah, it's about midnight now.
9968821	9971183	So it's been a while since I've listened live.
9971223	9974425	But yeah, I just wanted to give you guys a shout on
9974813	9979517	I've been listening for about, I would say, six, seven years now.
9979757	9980037	Wow.
9980077	9989345	I think the reason why I remember is because just one podcast I listened to, and I don't know why I remember this, but it was like y'all's fourth birthday.
9990086	9996211	And I think at a certain point, DarkSakura had said, like, we're this many.
9996591	10000274	And they held up a certain amount of fingers, and you were just like, yeah, that's great radio.
10000495	10000755	Yeah.
10002934	10003934	That sounds like our show.
10004094	10005636	That's been us forever.
10006176	10007417	She does that every year too.
10008418	10011980	She couldn't do it this year because she'd have to put up a toe as well.
10012801	10015623	I stick my nose in the air.
10015643	10018765	That's just how I keep tabs on how long I've been listening.
10018945	10021127	It's great to finally call in this time.
10021607	10022568	I've gone under different
10023007	10025029	Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones
10048087	10052330	So, you know, we really appreciate everybody who tunes in and listens.
10052390	10058915	So, well, I don't want to just have this call be you saying nice things about us, although I really appreciate that.
10059255	10060977	Tell us what games you've been playing lately.
10060997	10062778	What kind of video games are you into right now?
10064159	10068222	As of recently, obviously, Grand Theft Auto V is occupying a lot of my time.
10069123	10073406	Got it on PS3 since I've kind of chosen to boycott any type of...
10074500	10078681	Xbox related, not Microsoft, but Xbox related products.
10078761	10089425	But yeah, other than that, Grand Theft Auto 5, Borderlands 2, I know is not as of recent, but a lot of PS3.
10090225	10092106	Are you looking forward to PlayStation 4?
10092246	10095287	Are you going to give it a little while before you pick one up?
10096312	10097513	I may give it some time.
10097673	10099553	I am really stoked about The Division.
10099633	10100834	Tom Clancy's The Division.
10100954	10101934	That looks amazing.
10102855	10108797	But just the one game isn't enough for me to drop coin on a $400 system.
10108857	10112958	So I'm going to wait until a couple other games come out and then I'll merge.
10113779	10114319	Fair enough.
10114539	10114939	Fair enough.
10115439	10119661	Well, for The Fallen Dreams, I appreciate you calling the show and giving us a shout out.
10119921	10122482	And it's always nice to hear from all of our listeners.
10123022	10124743	And thanks again for staying up late with the show.
10125828	10126328	Not a problem.
10126368	10127429	I hope to hear from you guys soon.
10127569	10127849	All right.
10127889	10128350	Take care, buddy.
10129230	10129571	Take care.
10129711	10129971	All right.
10130051	10130211	Night.
10130311	10130652	Bye-bye.
10132253	10132673	Good night.
10132693	10133354	Sleep tight.
10133374	10134635	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
10134655	10136136	I'm fantasizing right now, Rob.
10136177	10136357	Huh?
10136417	10136557	What?
10136597	10137498	Over CPK.
10138439	10140821	I haven't had California Pizza Kitchen in like forever.
10140841	10143603	Do you want to go to CPK sometime this weekend or something?
10143623	10144103	I do.
10144304	10146105	I just have to have a good week and then I can go.
10146285	10146606	All right.
10146846	10147647	We'll figure something out.
10147667	10150229	Because honestly, I'm in love with a pair of Gorgonzola pizza.
10150840	10156507	I like, um, I like the barbecue chicken pizza, but you can kind of get that at the grocery store.
10156547	10157428	I know it's not the same thing.
10157448	10158450	The Jamaican jerk is pretty good.
10158690	10158870	Yeah.
10159070	10164357	But, but I'd say when I'm feeling extra treif, it's the shrimp scampi pizza with extra garlic.
10165816	10166276	We're this many!
10189062	10189884	I put it on the table.
10189904	10190806	They can't see you.
10191126	10191647	So?
10192169	10195115	Unless I take a picture and then you'll get mad at me for taking a picture.
10195375	10196858	No, then I'll channel your mom.
10197379	10198742	Ah, but it won't get on the internet.
10198782	10200125	Britney Spears might see it.
10204967	10206889	I don't want Britney's friends to post it.
10207269	10210151	As if Britney Spears gives two shits about Orange Lingerie.
10210171	10212312	You know, I had a friend that went to high school with Britney Spears.
10212613	10212873	Really?
10213293	10214834	He said she was a total bitch.
10217596	10219257	Alright, I got a few more tweets here.
10220338	10222259	SSGO100Matt sent us a tweet about this.
10222559	10228584	I want to get your thoughts on these all-in-one classic gaming machines like the Retro N5.
10229104	10230545	Gaming purist friendly?
10230805	10231486	Question mark.
10232574	10255059	I've seen reviews of some of those the key word is purist and I'm going to say if the word is purist then no they're not gaming purist friendly because pretty much these things are emulators in a box and so they are going to have the slightest things wrong with them but if you just want shit tons of games in a box to play on the TV 99.9% of people don't really care and so whatever go for it
10255419	10273110	with the big problem with some of those by the way in reviews that I've watched because Dan and I watch reviews for a number of those things typically it's sound because keep in mind especially with the Super Nintendo it had that Sony sound processor you're not going to get the same quality it'll come out sounding it'll miss sounds or something you'll be wrong with it
10273737	10279240	Just so you guys know, on the Retron 5, if you hadn't heard of this, it has five cartridge slots.
10279280	10279740	Look at that.
10280200	10297950	The NES, the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom, the Genesis and Mega Drive, the Famicom, so you can play not only NES games but Famicom games, and then they have a GBA, GBC, GB slot that plays all those games, so Game Boy games on that as well, and you can hook that up to the telly and play those games.
10298510	10299851	HDMI output, that's pretty cool.
10314358	10314979	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10329642	10344809	and had like this series to have it run off of one power supply and one hookup cable so they got I think one successfully working version of it but it ended up being some prohibitively expensive thing but it legit runs on the actual hardware
10345943	10353907	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, if you're really a purist, you'll play your original game carts on a 300-pound, 22-inch CRT TV from 1993.
10354507	10356828	You know what, though?
10357088	10364551	Alan brings up a good point with that, and that is the one plus side about these systems is that it plays through HDMI port.
10364992	10365672	Let's be real.
10365732	10369774	A lot of modern TVs, you can't hook up classic game consoles to them.
10370034	10371435	You cannot hook up an Atari 2600.
10372475	10373476	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
10388700	10389240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10409433	10410194	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10427964	10433427	For the Fallen Dreams is in our chat room as well and says, remember when Channel 3 and 4 was the game input channel?
10433767	10434948	Pepperidge Farm remembers.
10435388	10435889	I remember.
10435989	10441792	I remember well because in Sacramento you had to use Channel 4 because Channel 3 is a legit channel here.
10441832	10442613	It's NBC here.
10442953	10446395	So you have to use Channel 4 because you could never get a signal on Channel 3.
10447175	10448456	It's noisy because of the KCRA.
10450685	10456788	Three was a used channel in Mobile, but I would still use it because it would actually be clearer for my screen signal.
10457288	10457888	Yes, it's true.
10458729	10462490	There's a channel four in the Bay Area, but the signal's very weak here in Sacramento.
10463411	10469053	But I would always get pissed off because my brothers would try to steal the remote, and they were little brats.
10469253	10472695	Well, they're still brats, but they're older brats.
10474588	10497831	I will never forget being young and trying to get the channels from San Francisco I don't remember why I was doing this but one time there was something I really wanted to watch that the CBS channel here wasn't airing and so I had to try and get the antenna just right if you held it just right I could get channel 12 out of Chico just right
10499393	10504576	Don't let go of it or I won't be able to see the Charlie Brown special or whatever stupid thing Channel 12 was airing.
10504696	10507799	I had a fun day when I was sick and staying home.
10508800	10511722	Now keep in mind, the town I was born in is Dothan, Alabama.
10511902	10512102	Right.
10512262	10515364	Which is a good four hours away if you drive through Alabama.
10515384	10516765	It's like three and a half if you go through Florida.
10517646	10522970	So I was sitting going through the static channels because I would do that for fun.
10523831	10525152	Don't ask, I was weird.
10525392	10525652	Born.
10526493	10528034	No, I was eight.
10529113	10557597	it doesn't matter and so one day I managed the Dothan channel came through and I was sitting watching WG that was the Chicago station that would get through cable but it was like whatever the Dothan station that I used to watch soaps with my granny I was watching TV all day on the staticky ass Dothan channel and then figured out that if you put tinfoil on your rabbit ears you can get a really good signal
10558397	10560259	Okay, for real, this is the last call for calls.
10560279	10563603	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10564043	10568568	I just wanted to say this real quick about the whole TV channels.
10571468	10572369	I just lost my train of thought.
10572409	10572709	Damn it.
10573990	10575091	Radio guys, worst enemy.
10575812	10577933	Oh, I know where I get the whole thing from.
10578514	10580836	Because I'm still totally a nerd.
10581016	10584039	At night, I like to see what AM radio stations I can get in the car.
10584379	10587361	Because late at night, you can get stations from all over.
10587401	10589143	Because at night, they're allowed to increase the power.
10589523	10592966	So you get stations from all the way to the Midwest.
10593026	10594047	I think we can get stations.
10594447	10596589	I know we get them from Colorado, Seattle.
10596629	10597530	We can get them on AM.
10598130	10617615	and I know where I get that from is my dad because I remember growing up my dad had one of those um it wasn't it was like a radio that did like the shortwave yeah yeah and he he used to listen to stations out of like the Netherlands and things like that and he just like not that he could understand we have internet radio for that a lot of stations well remember when OLR started on live 365
10619335	10642226	and we went to that award ceremony when they were kind enough to nominate us that one year and then forget to read our name a lot of the people we met in that community were all guys that used to do and girls that used to do like ham radio and that type of like I never realized until that day how many people from the ham radio shortwave radio kind of just naturally fell into internet broadcasting
10642406	10643407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10663465	10667370	I listen to that because sometimes it's pretty fun and you can hear odd things going on in the background.
10667730	10670133	Or the ones that give the weird frequencies.
10670554	10672216	Those are the ones that I'm interested in.
10672316	10675320	And every so often you can pick those up on shortwave as well.
10676742	10676982	All right.
10677662	10678763	Well, that's going to do it.
10678803	10684085	Nobody else is giving us a call, and we are through all of our tweets tonight, so I want to thank both our callers tonight.
10684485	10698872	And if somebody else had something to say, be it live or podcast, don't forget you can always email us, mailbag at orangelaundradio.com, or you can tweet us like some of our listeners did tonight at Twitter.com slash OLR.
10699593	10701714	It is definitely time to wrap up the show here.
10703385	10705427	I don't listen to the radio anymore in my car.
10705827	10706388	I still do.
10706488	10707248	I still listen to AM.
10707328	10708349	I miss DJs.
10708770	10710972	I think AM is still a good way to get traffic.
10711672	10728146	I know we have it on iPhones and all that but I still like on the phones all you can see is it's red and it's not always accurate because I think a lot of them are running off Caltrans reports but when you listen to traffic on AM radio like they'll tell you we're flying over the bridge and it is backed up all the way to this point.
10728427	10730068	Like I like being able to hear that.
10730248	10733410	So when we drive to the Bay Area... You better break out the Travel Connect 4.
10733450	10734371	You're going to be here a while.
10734611	10734771	Yeah.
10735171	10740074	Alan and I listen to 740 a lot when driving to the Bay Area to get their traffic updates.
10740594	10744737	And Actdeft, I use my cell phone to listen to music for the most part because I have an iPhone.
10744957	10748679	Yeah, I love Stitcher and all that stuff and podcasts in the car.
10748699	10749539	I just play my own stuff.
10749780	10758605	I actually have a playlist called Random Mix that's video game music, anime, J-pop, and all the other weird, crazy stuff I listen to.
10758945	10769528	Well, you know, they are saying, it's funny we bring up AM radio, they're saying that AM radio, I saw a story on this this week or last on one of the big websites like Google or Yahoo, that AM radio is kind of dying.
10769588	10779511	It's a dying art form because so many people have switched to internet and iPod and running that in their cars and so forth, which is great news for us and what we do, but...
10780571	10791857	It's the same thing that I run into, you know, being that when I, you know, picked my major, my focus was print media as far as design for print.
10792458	10799621	When it's all, when really now print design is the more of a special field now.
10800222	10801362	You know, it's dying too.
10801382	10802043	It's just sad.
10802063	10804484	Because nothing smells as good as a print shop.
10805044	10806005	Alright, we need to wrap up.
10806045	10810669	We could reminisce all freaking night, and some of you might like that, but I think it is time to wrap up the show.
10811050	10814032	Thank you guys again for downloading Orange Lounge Radio and checking out our show.
10814072	10816234	We really appreciate it, and you know what we say.
10816294	10820198	If you like the show, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.
10820798	10824539	Talk about us in a convention line like somebody on Twitter did there this week.
10825300	10827040	Help spread the word because that's all we've got.
10827080	10832242	We don't have an AM radio station backing us and putting ads out there or anything like that.
10832302	10833582	So word of mouth is all we've got.
10833902	10836163	Thank you guys, as always, for your support of the show.
10836503	10838604	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10838864	10839684	Loki, we'll start with you.
10839704	10841565	Your final thoughts tonight.
10842225	10845526	My final thought is I'm going to play more Grand Theft Auto.
10846584	10847425	That's a good final thought.
10848246	10849687	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10850708	10851669	I hate Dreamweaver.
10853131	10862680	And my final thought tonight is that if you are in the Sacramento area, you need to make plans on October 12th to come see the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Colonial starring yours truly.
10863241	10865463	Well, co-starring me, but I will be in it.
10866024	10866765	So there you go.
10868223	10868643	That's it.
10869104	10869564	We're done.
10869844	10870465	We're out of here.
10870645	10871786	We'll see you next week, right?
10872366	10873026	I sure hope so.
10873787	10874688	Have a great week, everybody.
10874728	10877149	Happy gaming, and we'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
10877250	10877550	Good night.
10878251	10878851	Thank you for watching.
10908323	10909943	See you next week
