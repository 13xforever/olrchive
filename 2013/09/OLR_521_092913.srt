Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, Valve's 3 announcements have come and gone. What did they reveal that didn't have 3 in its name?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wii Lamento were LucasArts games lost at the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros. Roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oops

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oops

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hi there everybody, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc, etc, with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Empress Sakura of Normandy

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So just a 3 hour DarkSakura lovefest

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are, but here you ain't shit

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hey, I'd like to make an announcement

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Assholes

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You got stung by one, didn't you?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes I did, in my car

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, why did you invite the wasp in your car?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I didn't invite it in my car, the little asshole, he just barged on in, I'm gonna hang out in your car

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Asshole

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I'm super allergic, not like EpiPen allergic, but pretty allergic

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so, thankfully I was at my friend's house and I was like, Benadryl

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So you're here and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Fucking assholes

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hello

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm fine

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Glad to hear it

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We are live, of course, Wednesday, or excuse me, not Wednesday, Sunday

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It is Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
At the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And of course, if you are listening live, you can join our chat room

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Live.vognetwork.com

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And you can participate along with our show

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And whatever games we might be talking about tonight

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Although, oddly, we were kind of looking things before the show

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It was a slower of news weeks. I know we have some big announcements

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Especially in the PC universe and so on

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We'll get to those here before too long

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But otherwise, it's kind of a relatively quiet week

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 5 still?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What is it? A billion?

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Eleventy billion dollars that game's made? Loki?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's over a billion, so

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know what the exact numbers are right now

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's crazy

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A lot

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I got to tell you, I almost caved and bought it

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's not good enough

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It was all the chatter about the online stuff

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And joining the VOD crew

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why are you going to miss out? It's starting in a couple days

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I know, I kind of want to do it

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But then I'm like, Rob, it's $60

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're going to be pissed when it comes out for PlayStation 4

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I resisted

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I continued playing the games that I already have that I need to finish

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, according to the VG charts

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The top global seller is obviously being Grand Theft Auto 5

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It sold a total of about 17 million copies already

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wow

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's as of the 21st

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And that's worldwide, right?

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Worldwide

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Has there been a release besides America? Is it out in Europe or Japan yet?

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, it's out everywhere

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Here's the thing, though

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's the 21st

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's over a week ago

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's only been selling a ton since then

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Gosh, alright

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's see

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where was it?

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, Dungeon Buster in chat says Grand Theft Billions

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's pretty much what it is right now

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Grand Theft Billions

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There was one kid that stole a car or something

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And shot some people and they said

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Right, right

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, they'll try to tie it with him

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, that's because he's stupid

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They'll blame it on anything

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I mean, it's just like there was another one

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Another one of those

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Kid brings a gun to school or something like that

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And they blamed it on Minecraft

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, seriously, it'll be anything

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wasn't there that horrible tragedy happened in DC

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There was a gunman that did a shooting

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I want to say it was either this week or last week

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And didn't they peg that on?

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He played video games, sure enough

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, well that explains everything

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He played Call of Duty, so therefore, you know

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's just dumb because they're willing to like, you know

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Think that's okay to say that

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yet, at the same time, they could say

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You could just easily draw the conclusion

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, he ate food

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Food made him kill people

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, because all of these murders

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I tell you what

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
All of the murders that have ever happened

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Tied the food

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Because people eat

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Food causes murder

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know what

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If video games really, you know

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Caused a particular action

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And wearing cat ears all the time

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And throwing books at people

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If video games caused

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, we're in for the apocalypse

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because there's 17 million people out there now

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That are murderers

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If any food drives people to murder

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's probably mayonnaise

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And that's why I avoid it

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mayonnaise is awesome

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You shut your whore mouth

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You murderous woman

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Barf

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Barf

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Somebody call the cops

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Because somebody's got to get killed over mayonnaise

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mayonnaise is really good for your hair

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why would you

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Something that's good for your hair

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why would you eat it

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you eat shampoo?

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Beer is good for your hair

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I drink lots of beer

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, well I take a bath in beer

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Would you take a bath in beer?

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As long as I could, no

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, because then that would be alcohol abuse

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I just want to put my head in and drink it

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I saw that on Family Guy today actually

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did you now?

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know what, actually last night while I was playing Final Fantasy

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I was, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Which is like some of the best apple cider ever

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I was like, well I'm getting dizzy

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then I kept trying to go to bed

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then I kept doing more quests

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was having a very classy weekend

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Friday night, Alan and I

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We wanted to go to this new restaurant in town

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But it was way too crowded

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Which, you know, you know that place

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We love that place

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Pita Kitchen

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then we went by Safeway

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's like right by there, right?

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So we went by Safeway

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And we got a bottle of barefoot wine

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And some Ben and Jerry's

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I brought it home

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
With my bottle of wine and Ben and Jerry's

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
By the way

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know what's sitting in my fridge at home?

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a bottle of apple wine

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
From the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Delicious

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I need people to help me drink it

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Help you drink liquor, I can do that

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Alright, look

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Moving from our classy weekends

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
To a little bit of a kickoff topic

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then we'll get into our gaming weeks

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
To talk about this latest hacking project of yours

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because you've talked about it on the show

205
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A little bit in passing

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But it's one thing to kind of talk about it

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But it's another to see it

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So here in studio tonight you brought it

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I apologize to listeners because they can't see it

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not anything yet

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But it's just the monitor that I'm using

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, you have like a flat screen monitor

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But not like

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like it is literally just the screen part

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's no base

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's nothing

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, there's no like

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What brand is this?

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is an on lap

220
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's an on lap

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I forget what they call it

222
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But here I'll show you how nice it looks

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's pretty sexy looking actually

224
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's a pretty big big looking monitor

225
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a 13 inch monitor

226
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Normally if I didn't get such a great deal on it

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I wouldn't probably be using that

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So what exactly are you doing with this?

229
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm basically building almost like a

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wii U tablet

231
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But for

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Like PlayStation 3 and

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xbox 360

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not talking about like an emulator type of thing

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Or anything like that are you?

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, it's basically gonna be a wireless HDMI

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And it will sync up with

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know

239
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Whatever

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I hook up HDMI

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or whatever I hook up the transmitter

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm still a little lost

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Tell me like an application

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How this would work with a game

245
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like as you say

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like okay

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So basically I would hook up

248
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I would use this

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And whatever console I wanna play on

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Say like an Xbox 360

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You know

252
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm gonna have controls

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like you know

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like you would see on the Wii U

255
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Gamepad

256
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Or like the 360 and stuff

257
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And

258
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So that's still something you're gonna attach to

259
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah it's something I'm gonna attach to

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm gonna build a whole new case for it

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay that's interesting

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then

263
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What was I gonna say

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So there's that

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then on top of that

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There's gonna be

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This like switch

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can switch between PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

269
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And so it's gonna have a wireless transmitter

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's HDMI

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That you plug into whatever console you wanna do

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And then it wirelessly transmits to the receiver

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Which is gonna be built into the unit

274
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So you have wireless video and audio

275
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Up to like 30 feet away

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then the controllers are obviously wireless

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Although I'm still running into a slight problem

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
With the PlayStation 3 one

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's gonna be a little bit more challenging

280
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Because when you plug that in

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To charge it off

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Or run it off USB power

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It shuts off the wireless radio I believe

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
As it does like you're building like a portable

286
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
360 that works in your house somewhere

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well it's a second screen

288
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because it's basically just pulling

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Whatever signal

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can hook it up to

292
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore

293
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because that's sold

294
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But if I had another OUYA

295
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I could hook it up to that

296
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So basically anything that has an HDMI out

297
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's compatible with a PlayStation 3

298
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or Xbox 360 controller

299
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What's the why on this

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like I know for one

301
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You just like to have these projects

302
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And do it because you can

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's because my wife watches the TV a lot

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And right now I'm sitting there

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
On my computer monitor

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And playing games

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Which is fine

308
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But it would be more comfortable

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If I could sit on the couch

310
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And just kind of kick back

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes so this is something like

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You could play Grand Theft Auto 5

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In private with that thing in your lap

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And not have your kid be able to see you

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shooting hookers on the television

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah he'd be asleep

317
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But yeah basically

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay but it's still like a way

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or okay so the wife can watch

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You know Scandal

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And you can

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Whatever it is she watches

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah

324
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And you can do that

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay

326
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There you go

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I was gonna show you real quick

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's see

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is not a great example

330
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But here's my computer monitor

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay

332
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean so the

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know it'll do

334
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay so since this is radio

335
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Basically Loki is holding up this

336
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This flat

337
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Like basically because it's a flat

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Picture time

339
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah you can do a picture

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll put it on my tumblers

341
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I know not all

342
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah it doesn't weigh

343
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like hardly anything

344
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's just like maybe a pound

345
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah not all our listeners

346
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Are gonna

347
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Are gonna go look it up

348
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So let me describe it

349
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's

350
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It kind of like because it's just

351
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That very flat part of a computer monitor

352
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's almost like a tablet

353
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And function

354
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And you're literally looking at

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
A Windows 7 screen

356
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
With Firefox open

357
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
On this like little tablet

358
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So is that a touch screen too?

359
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No

360
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No

361
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So it's literally just the monitor

362
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because it's just

364
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a USB powered monitor

365
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's important

366
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because the whole thing is gonna

367
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Run off a battery

368
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because it's gonna be wireless

369
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Otherwise I'd have to plug it in

370
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So yeah

371
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's USB powered

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Which is pretty awesome

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I've actually tried it out

374
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
With an Xbox 360

375
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have another cable that's not

376
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hooked up to this that

377
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It converts it to

378
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It splits out the audio

379
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
From the HDMI

380
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because

381
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know

382
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't have any speakers on this thing

383
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So I have to build that

384
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's see

385
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom

386
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Says

387
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?

388
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I have another TV

389
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I just

390
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The problem is

391
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You know setting up systems

392
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And moving them around and stuff

393
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's just a lot easier for

394
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know

395
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I just want to build this

396
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah

397
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You have to understand Brad

398
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is the very manly man side of Loki

399
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That now it's a thing

400
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And once it's become a thing

401
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He will stop at nothing to achieve

402
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Said thing

403
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Unless

404
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There might be like that one little thing

405
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That just derails the whole thing

406
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And they'll be like

407
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ah forget it

408
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Like what happened to the building

409
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
An arcade machine for $100

410
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Or whatever that was

411
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Um

412
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I just lost interest

413
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
See

414
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
See

415
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It

416
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I didn't need another arcade machine

417
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I had two I wasn't using

418
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So why build a third

419
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And also it didn't help that the PC

420
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That I got for that

421
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Was defective

422
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So

423
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can't really

424
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So you get what you pay for

425
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Pretty much

426
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It just wouldn't power up

427
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know go fake

428
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Um

429
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So yeah

430
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I just

431
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I ended up

432
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well I didn't even really part of the PC

433
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I just threw it away

434
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because it was just not working

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Um

437
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah

438
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I just

439
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I lost interest in that

440
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Um

441
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But

442
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Now that I'm gonna be playing Grand Theft Auto 5

443
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know

444
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So I'm

445
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Definitely interested in having a screen

446
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can play that on

447
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Alright

448
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Fair enough

449
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Especially with the online component

450
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Of Grand Theft Auto 5

451
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Starting soon

452
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Ah it's next week

453
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I'm sure it's gonna be absolutely

454
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know

455
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Disastrous as far as

456
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You know

457
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Being able to connect to it

458
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Uh

459
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Quick plug for the VOG Network crew

460
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How many people are in that now

461
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Like 20 at least

462
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Um

463
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's quite a few

464
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah

465
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Um

466
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So yeah

467
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So

468
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Um

469
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Uh

470
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You can go to our forums

471
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And check out

472
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We have a thread on it

473
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Otherwise you can go to

479

480
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And

481
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We're seeing right now

482
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How many people we have in there

483
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
20 members

484
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah

485
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There you go

486
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So

487
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And I even promoted Bobby

488
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So

489
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well there you go

490
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Bobby is now promoted to

491
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Commissioner

492
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Commissioner Bobby

493
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Commissioner Bobby

494
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Nice

495
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I appreciate that

496
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If I know how it's gonna work

497
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I wonder like

498
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm gonna be playing both

499
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

500
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Like all my co-workers

501
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Have the PS3 version

502
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And they want me to play on that

503
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I just hope that my progress

504
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
moves with both

505
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like it's in the cloud

506
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well they say it's in the cloud

507
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And stuff

508
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And they say that like you can

509
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
When the Playstation 4 version

510
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Comes along that your

511
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You know

512
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Multiplayer information

513
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Goes along with that

514
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But

515
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I just don't know how exactly

516
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That works

517
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Like you know

518
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Cause they have special editions

519
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Of stuff you could've gotten

520
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
For one or

521
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The other system

522
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They add different perks

523
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
For your characters

524
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I don't think I can like

525
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Save my character on

526
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Playstation 3

527
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And then transfer it over

528
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It may just do my stats

529
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And that's about it

530
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But

531
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know

532
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We'll check it out I guess

533
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Alright well

534
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Good luck with this

535
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
New project of yours

536
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
How long do you think it's

537
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Gonna take you to finish?

538
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well I'm just testing everything

539
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
As I go along

540
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So I'm getting the

541
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Wireless HDMI stuff

542
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
On Wednesday

543
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then

544
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The hardest part

545
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is gonna be

546
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Making the case for it

547
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cause

548
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah how do you do that

549
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then also

550
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I have to get a battery

551
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
To run everything

552
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Which I figured out

553
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I need a 12 volt battery

554
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then I'm gonna use a

555
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Step down to

556
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Drop it to 5

557
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Volts so that I can get

558
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
More amps out of it

559
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Cause

560
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's basically gonna be powering

561
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
About

562
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
4 or 5 USB powered

563
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Things you know

564
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The two controllers

565
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Cause there's gonna be

566
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The internals for

567
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You know

568
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
DualShock 3

569
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And then also

570
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You know

571
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The monitor

572
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And then

573
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The wireless HDMI

574
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So

575
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's four things

576
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And

577
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I think there's something else

578
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm forgetting

579
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Speakers

580
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We believe in you

581
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We believe in you

582
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You'll get it

583
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well I'll see

584
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At the very least

585
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This monitor's pretty cool

586
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So

587
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It is a nice little thing

588
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It looks like a tablet

589
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Looks expensive

590
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Alright

591
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
$35

592
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wow

593
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's how much of a steal

594
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I got that for

595
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Normally they go for about

596
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
$250

597
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where at?

598
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
eBay

599
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Nice

600
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I bid snipe

601
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
How much

602
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Speaking of eBay

603
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Before we get into

604
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How was your gaming week

605
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How much did your

606
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Ouya go for on eBay?

607
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
$80

608
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well that's good

609
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's really good

610
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's not bad

611
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Considering you paid what

612
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
$90 for it?

613
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah

614
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
$99

615
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And $80

616
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's not bad

617
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And also

618
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Funny enough

619
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Actually Saints Row 4

620
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I sold my

621
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Xbox 360 copy of that

622
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Cause I have it on PC

623
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I don't really play

624
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The 360 version

625
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That went for $14

626
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I was

627
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I would have bought that

628
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
For more

629
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah exactly

630
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's so much

631
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Counterfeit shit on eBay

632
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Of new games

633
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You gotta be really careful

634
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Remember a couple years ago

635
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When Alan got me that

636
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Child of Eden

637
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That came from China

638
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And it wasn't even

639
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like we opened it

640
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And the box was

641
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like Assassin's Creed

642
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And it was very clearly

643
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
A burned disc

644
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And it was

645
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A piece of garbage

646
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And he had to go

647
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The whole thing

648
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Where you file the complaint

649
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
With eBay

650
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And wait

651
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh god

652
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What a mess

653
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well you just gotta

654
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Go watch

655
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I've got

656
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The

657
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's some big box set

658
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
For

659
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The Guild

660
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
On DVD

661
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So

662
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But it hasn't

663
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Streeted yet

664
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So I can't put it up there

665
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Lowkey's eBay shop

666
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Alright

667
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I love the Guild

668
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Alright

669
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's talk about

670
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Our gaming weeks

671
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The types of video games

672
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That we have been playing

673
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This week

674
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So Dark Soccer

675
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wanna start us off

676
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What have you been playing?

677
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Salad

678
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Salad the game

679
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Princess Tomato in the

680
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Salad kingdom

681
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No

682
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm actually legit

683
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Eating a salad

684
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've been playing

685
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I've been playing

686
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Final Fantasy 14

687
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And

688
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Um

689
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I got really irritated

690
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because I couldn't do

691
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The next

692
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A story quest

693
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Until I

694
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I thought that I was

695
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Ahead levels

696
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then

697
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No you have to be 27

698
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So I'm running around

699
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Doing just shit

700
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I'm in this one place

701
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
As a

702
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm a quarry mill

703
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
For anyone who's playing

704
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And everybody there

705
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like you can just follow

706
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hoards of people

707
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
From blue dot

708
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
To blue dot

709
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's hilarious

710
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah it's uh

711
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Fate parties

712
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you actually shout out

713
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And say

714
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You guys all like

715
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Any contributions

716
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Are pooled

717
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So you get more

718
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Golds that way

719
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a trick people use

720
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In leveling

721
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I just ignore everybody

722
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah

723
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That works too

724
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
They don't exist

725
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
In my mental universe

726
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can do enough

727
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Side quests

728
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And other things

729
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
To you know

730
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Level

731
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Um

732
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So I mean I hit it

733
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Obviously

734
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
While I'm drinking

735
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So I was like

736
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay

737
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And um

738
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I uh

739
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What else did I play

740
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Animal Crossing

741
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Of course

742
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I haven't really been

743
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Um

744
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I asked

745
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Bejeweled

746
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know why

747
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's just fun

748
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's a nice little

749
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Time waster

750
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I've actually

751
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Gotten pretty good

752
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
At the diamond mine

753
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a good potty game

754
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It actually is

755
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A really good potty game

756
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
My iPhone has changed

757
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The way I use the bathroom

758
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Rob

759
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There's a shirt

760
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That says that

761
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I want it

762
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Um

763
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And uh

764
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dan had

765
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Beat GTA 5

766
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Mm-hmm

767
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So

768
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I've now been

769
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You know

770
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Randomly going in there

771
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And hearing you know

772
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's been pretty funny

773
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But you're not really

774
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Interested in playing yourself

775
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No

776
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't

777
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You know what

778
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't care how good

779
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
A game is

780
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I have no tolerance

781
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
For misogyny

782
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You have to have also like

783
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Just some interest in it

784
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know

785
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have zero interest in it

786
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Now if it was you know

787
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I want to do like

788
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
A lady Grand Theft Auto

789
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Where it's just this

790
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hardcore

791
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know

792
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Woman

793
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Tearing down the patriarchy

794
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Play Saints Row

795
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because you can kind of do it

796
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Saints Row 2

797
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Saints Row 2

798
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Not the other ones

799
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No

800
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But you

801
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But it's

802
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I really have no interest in

803
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I hate to say

804
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I have no interest in the culture

805
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Because clearly I have an interest

806
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In various aspects of culture

807
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But it's not something

808
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That appeals to me

809
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So

810
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't really care about it

811
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Fair enough

812
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Alright

813
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll go in and watch Dan play

814
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
For a little bit

815
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I'm like

816
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll just roll my eyes

817
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And go

818
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Really?

819
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Because

820
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh my god

821
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I have to tell you

822
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What happened the other day

823
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I was pumping gas

824
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And this guy comes up

825
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And says

826
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You know

827
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
One of the

828
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can we do your windshield thing

829
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Fluid you know

830
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that they're trying

831
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
To sell you something

832
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I said

833
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's okay

834
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm not interested

835
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He's like

836
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh well I hope you have

837
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
A better rest of your day

838
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I got so mad

839
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I said

840
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Would you have asked me that

841
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If I was a man?

842
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And he's like

843
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I thought not

844
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But you know

845
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was like

846
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
God I hate people

847
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But yeah

848
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know

849
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I've been a little bit

850
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hypersensitive

851
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What in the hell

852
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Does that have to do with games?

853
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Because

854
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm just saying

855
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That I've been so hypersensitive

856
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Lately

857
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And just really pissed off

858
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
At everything

859
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Especially after talking

860
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
With my mother

861
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That I think

862
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I would vomit all over

863
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
GTA V

864
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
At this point

865
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
In a feminist rage

866
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're missing the point

867
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean honestly

868
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If you're gonna vomit

869
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
All over GTA V

870
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's a story

871
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It has guys in it

872
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I mean

873
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So what

874
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There's not a fucking female lead

875
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Boo

876
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hoo

877
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Get over it

878
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Seriously

879
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Everybody needs to get over it

880
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can see where

881
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto

882
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't care that it has it

883
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just don't have to play it

884
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It pushes the envelope

885
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
As art does

886
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Right

887
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Video games are art right

888
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And Grand Theft Auto

889
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Definitely pushes the envelope

890
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
In a lot of ways

891
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But for me

892
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Grand Theft Auto

893
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And everything that's in it

894
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Again

895
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't put

896
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
A game like Grand Theft Auto

897
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
On any different platform

898
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Than I put movies

899
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And Grand Theft Auto to me

900
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Is just one of those like

901
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Brosy action movies

902
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Exactly

903
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That are out there and exist

904
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You know

905
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And there's definitely

906
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
An audience for it

907
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A lot of those movies

908
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Really do well

909
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But there's some people

910
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That just aren't really

911
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Interested in it

912
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Just like

913
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I bet Loki

914
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wouldn't be caught dead

915
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Watching The Notebook

916
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You know

917
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I've already seen it

918
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I haven't seen it

919
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And I don't care to see it

920
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Well I mean

921
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's just

922
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a genre that

923
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I am not into

924
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I mean

925
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If it had more things

926
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That I think

927
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Would appeal to me

928
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
As a player

929
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You know

930
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Then I might give it a chance

931
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like I tried Saints Row

932
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Saints Row 3

933
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Or the third

934
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Or whatever the fuck it was

935
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It wasn't very fun

936
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So what exactly

937
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
About Mass Effect 3

938
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Made for a good game

939
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Versus Grand Theft Auto 5

940
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well first of all

941
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It actually told

942
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
A very solid story

943
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
There was very little

944
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Misogyny in it

945
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Which

946
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But you haven't played

947
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

948
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So you have no fucking clue

949
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What the story is like

950
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Um

951
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've actually sat

952
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There's a great story

953
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
In fact

954
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Three stories

955
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Throughout the entire

956
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Campaign of it

957
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There's

958
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I just don't understand

959
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How people can get off

960
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Saying that there's

961
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Not a good story in that

962
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I mean

963
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The whole game is compelling

964
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm not saying the story

965
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Isn't good

966
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm just saying

967
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It doesn't appeal to me

968
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah but you're

969
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Blaming it saying

970
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're saying that

971
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It doesn't have a good story

972
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And Mass Effect 3

973
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Has a great story

974
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I didn't say

975
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It didn't have a good story

976
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I said

977
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It doesn't appeal to me

978
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There is a difference

979
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Between something

980
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And not being

981
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Something that I'm into

982
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know

983
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
For example

984
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay

985
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Misogyn

986
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The play

987
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Great story

988
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't really care

989
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
For the play

990
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Um

991
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Chicago

992
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Great movie

993
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Great story

994
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I hate everybody in it

995
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't

996
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I've seen it once

997
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't care

998
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
To see it again

999
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Breaking Bad

1000
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Just won an Emmy

1001
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I think

1002
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We're going up

1003
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Against the finale tonight

1004
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And I'm sure

1005
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's a great show

1006
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I hate that show

1007
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay

1008
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I'm sure it's a good show

1009
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But I just

1010
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'd rather

1011
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do other stuff right now

1012
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But I mean

1013
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anything

1014
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's kind of where I see it

1015
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is that it's like

1016
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Alright

1017
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So Breaking Bad's

1018
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Winning all these awards

1019
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I'm sure it's a great show

1020
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm not gonna

1021
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sit here

1022
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah

1023
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm not gonna sit here

1024
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Not the show

1025
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But it's just like

1026
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ain't nobody got time

1027
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
For that right now

1028
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
For me

1029
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Here's another

1030
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Here's another example

1031
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay

1032
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I have a bajillion friends

1033
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That are into Buffy

1034
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I love Joss

1035
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Because he can tell

1036
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I have a few episodes

1037
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That I like to watch

1038
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I really don't care

1039
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
For the series as a whole

1040
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The end

1041
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You know

1042
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's the same thing

1043
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Something can be good

1044
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
On its own merits

1045
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But if it's not your thing

1046
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You don't have to watch it

1047
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Or like mayonnaise

1048
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Again

1049
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I really hate mayonnaise

1050
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What?

1051
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Actually it is like mayonnaise

1052
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Mayonnaise has

1053
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Very good culinary applications

1054
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But if you're not into it

1055
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're not into it

1056
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You know

1057
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Alright

1058
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I like boobs

1059
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Some girls don't like boobs

1060
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Another thing

1061
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Self hating women

1062
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I guess we'll leave it at that

1063
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If that's it for your gaming week

1064
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

1065
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto 5

1066
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I played a ton of it

1067
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And even had the time to

1068
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Shoot some video for a funny little

1069
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Montage thing

1070
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's set to

1071
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The music from the movie Rad

1072
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because it's

1073
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I haven't seen your video yet

1074
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's just weird

1075
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
For me

1076
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The movie Rad

1077
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because I was looking

1078
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I don't remember what I was doing

1079
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I was browsing

1080
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
YouTube

1081
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And you know how I make recommendations

1082
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
For you and stuff

1083
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I think I watched

1084
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What was it

1085
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I played the navigator on there one time

1086
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And so I recommended Rad and stuff

1087
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So

1088
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That movie is really fucking cheesy

1089
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If you've ever seen it

1090
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It is super cheeseball

1091
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They have like

1092
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
A scene at a dance

1093
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Where they're riding BMX bikes

1094
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
To like

1095
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Send me an angel

1096
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's just like

1097
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What the hell is going on

1098
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So I was like ok that's really funny

1099
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And so I had Trevor in the game

1100
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Doing all those bikes

1101
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Running from the police

1102
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hitting people with his bike

1103
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Firing a shotgun and stuff

1104
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I thought the juxtaposition of that

1105
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
With the music from the movie

1106
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Was fantastic and hilarious

1107
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So I decided to

1108
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Make a short YouTube video

1109
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Called Breaking Rad

1110
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Cause you know

1111
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He's a meth dealer

1112
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So

1113
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Fixed

1114
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And uh

1115
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you gonna try and go viral

1116
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Like Bobby's article did this week

1117
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh no

1118
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's not gonna go viral

1119
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's just

1120
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's just a funny video

1121
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So that's all

1122
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But yeah

1123
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So I played through that

1124
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I'm actually

1125
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
At the very end of the game

1126
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So

1127
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm trying to finish

1128
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The single player campaign

1129
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Before

1130
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Online starts

1131
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Cause I do wanna do online

1132
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I think I am gonna have a few days

1133
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Though because I know

1134
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know online launches

1135
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
On Tuesday

1136
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But

1137
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Come on

1138
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
They even admitted to it

1139
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
They're like

1140
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So listen

1141
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We know how online

1142
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You know

1143
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Multiplayer launches have been

1144
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And

1145
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Trust us

1146
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You know

1147
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We're gonna try to make sure

1148
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That that's not gonna be the same way

1149
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But

1150
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's probably gonna

1151
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It'll break

1152
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's gonna

1153
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You know

1154
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's gonna be broken

1155
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's gonna be

1156
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You know

1157
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Bumpy

1158
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But

1159
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know

1160
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Just give us some time

1161
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You know

1162
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Cause that's

1163
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Seriously with the

1164
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Rockstar Social Club stuff

1165
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This week

1166
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So they

1167
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's been tough

1168
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And they've been trying to

1169
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know

1170
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Deal with 17 million people

1171
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Wanting to try this stuff out

1172
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So

1173
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You know

1174
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
17 million people

1175
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You know

1176
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Or even like

1177
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Half that

1178
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hitting up a server

1179
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Trying to play online

1180
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What was the strategy

1181
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I apologize if you've covered this

1182
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
On the show before

1183
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But you know

1184
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Now that it's coming up this week

1185
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm thinking about it now

1186
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What was the strategy

1187
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Behind delaying it

1188
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And not having it

1189
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
When the game launches

1190
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Did they just

1191
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They purposely wanted people

1192
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
To spend some time

1193
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
With single player mode

1194
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They wanted people

1195
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
To rush to get into

1196
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The multiplayer portion

1197
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And they wanted you to enjoy

1198
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The single player portion

1199
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Of the game first

1200
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And they wanted to make sure

1201
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That everything worked properly

1202
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So

1203
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Um

1204
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean

1205
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There's a lot of stuff

1206
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In the world

1207
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So I can understand how

1208
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You need to make sure

1209
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Everything's

1210
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know

1211
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Tested

1212
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And you know

1213
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Catch any flaws

1214
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You may have

1215
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
With your servers

1216
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And that kind of stuff

1217
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Especially since they've had

1218
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Trouble with the Social Club stuff

1219
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Going to our chatroom

1220
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
At live.vognetwork.com

1221
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Dungeon Buster said

1222
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Social Club was pretty rough

1223
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The game had issues

1224
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Connecting to it

1225
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Uh

1226
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SEG is in our chatroom

1227
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And says I'm glad they

1228
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Separated out the release

1229
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah

1230
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I could play the single player

1231
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And get a little bit of

1232
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
A handle of like

1233
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know

1234
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The map

1235
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And also kind of like

1236
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
How you do heists

1237
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And just all that stuff

1238
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm gonna totally 180

1239
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The topic on you here

1240
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But this conversation's

1241
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Making me think about this

1242
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And it's not in our show

1243
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Roll tonight

1244
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And it is pretty big news

1245
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The uh

1246
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
New Batman game

1247
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That's coming out

1248
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uh

1249
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
This uh

1250
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Fall in

1251
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
A month or two

1252
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And this

1253
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The Wii U version

1254
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Will not have multiplayer

1255
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh shocking

1256
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They've said that before

1257
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The Nintendo

1258
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You know

1259
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Online component

1260
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Just isn't

1261
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They don't think

1262
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
There's enough people there

1263
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And it's honestly

1264
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Probably not an untrue thing

1265
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But

1266
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because of it

1267
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This is the news that came out

1268
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
This week

1269
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The Wii U version's

1270
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Going to be ten dollars cheaper

1271
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Uh

1272
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Whereas the other versions

1273
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Will be sixty dollars

1274
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Because the

1275
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Wii U's missing the multiplayer

1276
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
They're gonna knock ten dollars

1277
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Off the price

1278
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Some people are saying

1279
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
God

1280
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I wish they would do that

1281
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
For 360 as well

1282
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Or I wish

1283
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
This is an offering

1284
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We could have for games

1285
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Where

1286
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Knock ten dollars

1287
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Off the price

1288
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
For multiplayer

1289
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Which is kind of funny

1290
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
To me

1291
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Cause isn't this like

1292
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The inverse

1293
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But in a more consumer

1294
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Friendly way

1295
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Of the online pass

1296
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Cause

1297
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The online pass

1298
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Was ten dollars right

1299
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Cause I'm thinking like

1300
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
If

1301
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What I'm reading is correct

1302
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If games were ten dollars

1303
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Cheaper to begin with

1304
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We wouldn't have a problem

1305
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
With online passes

1306
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Here's what it really

1307
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's the way I read it

1308
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I think they're just

1309
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's marketing spin

1310
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Is gonna be ten dollars

1311
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Cheaper

1312
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Wasn't a decision

1313
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That they made

1314
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
When they

1315
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Put it out

1316
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think what it is

1317
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Is that

1318
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The Wii U's stuff

1319
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Doesn't sell as well

1320
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And so they have to

1321
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Lower the price

1322
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
To make it more attractive

1323
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
To people

1324
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Buying games

1325
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That's really the true

1326
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Story of it

1327
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And the fact that it

1328
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Just doesn't have multiplayer

1329
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I don't think it

1330
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Would have mattered

1331
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They would have

1332
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Still put it out

1333
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
At sixty bucks

1334
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Anyways

1335
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If they thought

1336
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They could get away with it

1337
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But that's really

1338
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What it comes down to

1339
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know

1340
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Market down ten bucks

1341
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
To try to see

1342
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If we can move

1343
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
A few more copies

1344
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's not

1345
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But see

1346
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Now they've gotten

1347
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A lot of PR spin

1348
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Out of it

1349
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know

1350
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So it's very positive

1351
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And you know

1352
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That helps them out

1353
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
As well

1354
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But it's not

1355
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's not specifically

1356
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Because multiplayer is missing

1357
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Trust me

1358
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Because

1359
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Shit

1360
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They omit stuff

1361
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
From all different

1362
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know games

1363
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Across platforms

1364
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And there's never

1365
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
A price break

1366
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Because of that

1367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's always because

1368
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's a pretty sweet

1369
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Deal

1370
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Seeing

1371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It also has

1372
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Gamepad support

1373
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I gotta be honest

1374
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm interested

1375
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
In the new Batman game

1376
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't know how

1377
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I feel about multiplayer

1378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Part of me says

1379
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Eh get it on

1380
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
PlayStation 3

1381
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But even

1382
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Arkham City

1383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Armored Edition

1384
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Was kind of lame

1385
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
As far as the

1386
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Gamepad support

1387
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It was pretty much

1388
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What you had

1389
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
With the PS3

1390
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't

1391
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Let that

1392
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Effect my opinion

1393
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Of the new Batman game

1394
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000

And

4013
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And

4014
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Are they starting to do away with the

4015
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?

4016
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I don't think so, because

4017
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
We're gonna have a w-

4018
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Mario Kart 8, etc. etc.

4019
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
But

4020
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Could this idiot be on to something?

4021
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Weeee

4022
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Without the gamepad

4023
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
You think

4024
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Then why not just get a Wii

4025
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Cause it's not HD

4026
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Well why not get a

4027
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Why not get a 3DS then

4028
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I'm happier with my 3DS

4029
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Alright, anyhow, I'm just

4030
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Anyway, alright

4031
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
For the love of God, just do what you're gonna

4032
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You know that's gonna happen eventually

4033
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U

4034
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It's gonna happen

4035
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Or even regular DS games, like Clubhouse games

4036
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Anything, it's gonna happen

4037
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
But, I just wish

4038
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish

4039
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
If they were to do that

4040
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Why can't I play a

4041
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
DS game across the internet now

4042
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
That should be something

4043
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I should be able to do, feasibly

4044
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Why can't I fucking do that

4045
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Like, the technology is there

4046
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
If you're gonna sell DS games on

4047
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The Wii U, let me play Clubhouse

4048
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
games with friends on the other coast

4049
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Instead of having to be in the same room

4050
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Because, I mean, I'm just going back to the

4051
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
One 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing

4052
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I

4053
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Go to the International Island and chat

4054
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
With people in Japan

4055
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And do the stupid

4056
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Club Tortimer games with them

4057
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And, you know, and usually

4058
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I don't have too much of a problem communicating

4059
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Because either there's a chance that

4060
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Between the Japanese I know and the English they know

4061
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We can get a point across

4062
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But, I mean, if they're letting you play with people

4063
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You know, across the ocean in a game

4064
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Like Animal Crossing, why can't you play other games

4065
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And actually

4066
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Now that I think about it, that may have actually been

4067
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The game I called out, Clubhouse games, you may have actually

4068
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Been able to play that across the internet on the DS

4069
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Did have some internet enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters

4070
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You could do online, right?

4071
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But, you know, there were

4072
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
A lot of games you could only do in the same room

4073
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And it would be really cool if you could open that up

4074
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a

4075
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Camera in it, why can't we

4076
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Be able to see friends while we're playing?

4077
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Or see dick while we're playing

4078
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Or boobies

4079
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here

4080
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
This is a huge kind of topic change here

4081
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This is going back to a story

4082
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
From a long time ago

4083
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But we talked about this extensively

4084
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
On OLR when it first happened

4085
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Because it had a local connection

4086
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And this goes all the way back to the year

4087
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I think it was 2007

4088
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
When this all happened

4089
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
No, or would it have been 2006?

4090
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I think it, no, it was 2007

4091
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
When did the Wii come out? Nintendo Wii

4092
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Was it 2006?

4093
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold

4094
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Well, here's the thing

4095
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Here locally, in California

4096
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
There was a radio station

4097
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
In Sacramento, specifically, where our show is based

4098
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Which is The End

4099
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And they had a contest called

4100
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Hold Your Wii for a Wii

4101
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You guys remember this now?

4102
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
The unfortunate situation is

4103
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
That the prize being given away

4104
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Was the video game

4105
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And the fact that it had the silly name

4106
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Kind of lent itself to this contest

4107
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And unfortunately

4108
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Jennifer Strange

4109
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Who is a resident of Rancho Cordova

4110
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Passed away after she held her Wii

4111
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
She didn't even win the competition

4112
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Unfortunately

4113
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But she went home and she died

4114
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Because these radio hosts

4115
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And the radio station didn't realize

4116
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
That yes, a person can die from drinking

4117
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Too much water and then not allowing themselves

4118
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
To go to the bathroom

4119
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And people warned them during and before the contest

4120
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And it was really

4121
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Just a hugely ignorant thing

4122
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Unfortunately, they were ignorant of the fact

4123
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That a fraternity guy in Chico

4124
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Had passed away from the same thing

4125
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Not that long before

4126
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Somebody called into the radio station

4127
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this

4128
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And they kind of laughed it off

4129
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And that was the really damning thing

4130
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
In this whole thing

4131
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Because they laughed that person off

4132
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And that clip really came back to haunt

4133
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
All those people that got fired

4134
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So The Morning Rave

4135
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Was the name of this show at the time

4136
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
$2.5 million in damages

4137
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Awarded against the station

4138
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
In a lawsuit

4139
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But there were no further ramifications in place

4140
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?

4141
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Because

4142
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Media watchdog group, the Sacramento Media Group

4143
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And Media Action Center

4144
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Bringing legal action to the Federal

4145
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Communications Commission, the FCC

4146
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
To block the renewal

4147
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Of the license for K-DND

4148
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So because of this

4149
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Incident that happened over a Wii

4150
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Six or seven years ago

4151
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It's going to court

4152
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Where 1079 The End

4153
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
May not get its license

4154
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And just to

4155
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Kind of give you the local connection, living here

4156
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I can tell you that radio station's huge

4157
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
In this area, I think it's one of the top

4158
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Stations in the area, it's the top 40

4159
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Music station

4160
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?

4161
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs

4162
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I personally don't listen to it

4163
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Because it's like the Justin Bieber

4164
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
One Direction

4165
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It's more like a teeny kid's station

4166
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So no great loss

4167
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But that shit's really popular

4168
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
There's still people that work at those stations

4169
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Well, right

4170
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy

4171
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Right

4172
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
And so it's very interesting that all this time later

4173
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
But they kind of bring up a good point

4174
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I guess there was even a documentary

4175
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Sue Wilson in 2009

4176
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Who was the founder of the Media Action Center

4177
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And who was a vocal critic of K-DND

4178
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
In a documentary called Broadcast Blues

4179
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And says quote

4180
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
In that contest, a woman died

4181
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
But the Federal Communications Commission

4182
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Has not acted in any way

4183
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And you kind of look at that and go

4184
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Well, she has a point

4185
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But then there's another part of me that goes

4186
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It's been six years

4187
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And all those ignorant people

4188
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That were involved with this

4189
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Have nothing to do with the station anymore

4190
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I mean

4191
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Yes, it was horrific at the time

4192
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
If it were me

4193
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I would make it more difficult

4194
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I mean, for example

4195
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
To do maybe a complete

4196
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Investigation into their current practices

4197
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
To see that they have indeed

4198
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Learned from their mistake

4199
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And are staying within proper

4200
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Health and safety compliance

4201
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Before approving it

4202
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Maybe give them extra requirements

4203
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Since they had this

4204
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
History of events

4205
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Keep in mind for this

4206
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It takes seven years to come off of your

4207
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Your report, right?

4208
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
We're looking kind of around the same

4209
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Time frame, you know

4210
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
If your financial

4211
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
You know

4212
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
What's the word I'm trying to think of

4213
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
If your financial ability

4214
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Is judged in terms of seven years

4215
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Then that should be

4216
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Clearly enough time to give a company

4217
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Seven years to clean up its act

4218
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Especially with hordes of lawyers

4219
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And officials

4220
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I think it's plenty of time

4221
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I just think that they need to prove that yes

4222
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
We have learned the errors

4223
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Of our ways

4224
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So there you have it

4225
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
All these years later

4226
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The silly name of the Nintendo Wii

4227
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Still

4228
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Still kind of causing these legal

4229
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Fallouts all these years later

4230
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Very interesting

4231
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well maybe it stuck with the revolution

4232
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
They'd be spinning in office chairs

4233
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And I do

4234
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Funny

4235
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Well I do have to say

4236
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I hate you and I really appreciate you all

4237
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
At the same time

4238
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I do have to say that had the FCC

4239
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Stepped in when the event happened

4240
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
That would have been appropriate

4241
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
But it has been a little late

4242
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And yeah I do

4243
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I would more say that I'd want the FCC

4244
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Held accountable for their lack of action

4245
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But

4246
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Right now it would be too late

4247
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It would just be almost spiteful

4248
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And it's like you see all these years

4249
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
All these years later do you know what I still

4250
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Hear about in regards to the FCC

4251
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Is when Janet Jackson

4252
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl

4253
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You still hear about that today

4254
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Because like just recently

4255
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
There was like an appeal of an appeal

4256
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Where the CBS stations themselves

4257
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Would not be fine because

4258
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Oh my god people

4259
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Oh my god it was a titty

4260
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It was a titty

4261
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
When you've got people stringing

4262
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Most people

4263
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Already seen her titties

4264
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
With hands on them too

4265
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Right?

4266
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It was her album cover

4267
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh no it was Rolling Stone

4268
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Oh yeah okay it was Rolling Stone

4269
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty

4270
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yes

4271
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Well I mean speaking of her

4272
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
She made a point not too long ago

4273
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
That I had to roll my eyes at my mom and her husband

4274
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
For being stupid over

4275
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
But I mean she was saying

4276
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You've got shows where you see all of this gratuitous

4277
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Violence but someone says fuck

4278
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Or someone shows a boob

4279
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And people lose their shit

4280
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I agree we need more nudity in shows

4281
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Seriously

4282
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Like it is such a double standard

4283
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You know it's like oh my god

4284
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Oh there's a nipple

4285
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And like they even have it where they're pretty much

4286
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Topless but they've got pasties

4287
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
But for some reason that nipple man

4288
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You've crossed the line

4289
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Why is the chat room going off about titty

4290
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Sprinkles

4291
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Stop giggling

4292
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
SG100 Matt says

4293
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
FCC is still going after

4294
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
MIA for last year's

4295
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger

4296
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Was that even last year or was that two years ago?

4297
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I don't know

4298
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Fucking sports ball

4299
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yes but it was Madonna

4300
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Madonna

4301
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
But Beyonce was this year

4302
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?

4303
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
What's Madonna going to do to one up Miley

4304
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
She made out with Britney Spears or whatever

4305
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Or there was a kiss or some garbage

4306
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Now she needs to one up

4307
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Madonna will have to literally

4308
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Pull something out of her

4309
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
She will need to have sex with somebody on stage

4310
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
In the middle of her song

4311
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Something is going to have to happen

4312
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You know what?

4313
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I have to say that Adam

4314
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
What's-his-face that was on American Idol

4315
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Lambert

4316
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
My mom's a big fan

4317
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Rob I love Adam

4318
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Lambert

4319
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
As my friend Susan calls

4320
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
He should have won Rob

4321
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Why do they let 12 year old girls vote on Idol Rob

4322
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
They should ban little girls from voting on Idol

4323
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Because Adam Lambert was Rob

4324
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Because the other guy was cuter

4325
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But the 30 year olds won with David Cook

4326
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Just saying

4327
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
And you know Susan

4328
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
She calls him Madame Lambert

4329
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
But he went out

4330
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
On some of his performances

4331
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Being basically

4332
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
As

4333
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I'd probably say overtly sexual

4334
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
As some women feel

4335
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That they need to do

4336
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And he illustrated a very good point

4337
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Why should women be expected to do this

4338
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
But men be lambasted for it

4339
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And at the same time if a woman goes out

4340
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And is classy

4341
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
She still has a particular standard

4342
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
That men aren't particularly held to

4343
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And you know

4344
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I think that the big fault

4345
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Just has to do with

4346
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Basically the

4347
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
The expectations that society

4348
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Itself is forced

4349
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
To have

4350
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
By what's presented to us in the media

4351
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I think that

4352
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
People losing their shit

4353
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Over a boob is how they are

4354
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Conditioned to react

4355
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You know

4356
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii

4357
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
To this but here you go

4358
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Alright

4359
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Well you know

4360
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Actually the same will go for violent video games

4361
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Alright

4362
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Let's, sorry I gotta wrap up

4363
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The hot coffee thing

4364
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
We gotta move on cause we're an hour and a half into the show

4365
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And not even halfway through our show roll for party

4366
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
You know what I will flip off everybody for fucking free

4367
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
If you wanna you know

4368
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Pay me at one point

4369
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Well I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars

4370
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off

4371
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I'll do it too

4372
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I can talk to you about bedazzling boobs now

4373
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Just

4374
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I hate to say this but Jamie

4375
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Let's go to the next story

4376
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Actually I do have to point out to Raginator

4377
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That they have such a thing as bedazzling

4378
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Think it over

4379
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Is exactly what you think it is

4380
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
No thanks

4381
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
So um

4382
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
A lot of us love our LucasArts

4383
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And a lot of people love Maniac Mansion

4384
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much

4385
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Like the

4386
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
One of the best LucasArts games

4387
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Well another reason to be

4388
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Pissed off at Disney

4389
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
They got rid of LucasArts

4390
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
They also got rid of the game that was 80% complete

4391
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Hadn't yet been greenlit but it was sort of a dream project

4392
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
For a lot of people

4393
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And it was a Day of the Tentacle

4394
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
HD remake

4395
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And we've had a lot of HD remakes come in

4396
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And you know especially DuckTales

4397
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion

4398
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
This one I think would have made a lot of people

4399
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Piss themselves

4400
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
But um

4401
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
With the fall of LucasArts

4402
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
This was one of the games to suffer

4403
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
You know and on top of that too

4404
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Was they had a Star Wars

4405
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Smuggler game

4406
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
They had a Death Star Ios game

4407
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
A lot of stuff that was in

4408
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
In process including

4409
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
A Star Wars First Assault

4410
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So

4411
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Sad face

4412
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be most

4413
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Now if I found out there was a Loom game

4414
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I would have gone out

4415
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
On a rampage

4416
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I really wish they could have

4417
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Just like transitioned this or sold it

4418
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
To somebody to finish or something

4419
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
This is really heartbreaking

4420
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And it's 80% done

4421
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So just really really sad

4422
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
There was a big

4423
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Just bringing Gearbox to finish the other 20%

4424
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
What could possibly go wrong

4425
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
There was a big expose on Kotaku about it

4426
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And so that's where they got the information from

4427
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show

4428
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Shame on you

4429
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Sorry but the article actually was legit

4430
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Fair enough

4431
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
But I mean that being said

4432
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
You know

4433
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
It makes me think

4434
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
About

4435
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
When we have stuff like this

4436
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Oh god I hate this stupid program

4437
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
When we have

4438
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
You know developers working

4439
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
On games and then just to have

4440
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
It stop oh you're defunded

4441
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Oh we're closing down your division

4442
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Imagine the people that are working on this one

4443
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And they are totally into what they're making

4444
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Their heart goes into it

4445
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Imagine just that level of disappointment

4446
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I'm surprised it didn't leak to the internet

4447
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Even if it was only 80% done

4448
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I'm kind of surprised

4449
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Well keep in mind remember

4450
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
What was it

4451
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Robotech Crystal Dreams

4452
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Well

4453
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
One of the developers

4454
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the

4455
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Levels

4456
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And released it

4457
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
A lot of Atari 5200 prototypes

4458
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Dan and I have gone out and bought

4459
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
They all have fished out the prototypes

4460
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Made them playable and put them on

4461
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
A repurposed cartridge and sold them

4462
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I have a ton of

4463
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
There's a

4464
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
NES games, SNES games

4465
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Basically all these prototypes out

4466
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000

4467
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000

Complete game

4469
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Didn't release because of the Sega license

4470
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
But

4471
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I've got a copy

4472
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
People will find a way to get out what they love

4473
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So I would actually

4474
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Be completely

4475
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Completely happy if someone

4476
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Decided to be sneaky

4477
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
With code and get that out

That's coming out on the 3DS this week

4533
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is

4534
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It's labeled as an adventure game and it kinda looks like

4535
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I like the graphics cause it's like an old school

4536
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
PC game in parts kinda mixed

4537
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
With like a newer thing that's mixed with photography

4538
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something

4539
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
But uh maybe like a

4540
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000

By the way uh chatters are telling me that my

4563
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Mic is cutting in and out sorry I

4564
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Can't see that live when I'm doing talking

4565
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Uh so I'm gonna try and hold

4566
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
This thing together which is really unfortunate

4567
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Because this is a newer mic and was donated

4568
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So I don't know Well it's looking a little bit more stable

4569
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
According to the recording

4570
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Yeah I tried to uh

4571
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Unhook and re-hook and I'm just gonna try to hold it

4572
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Really nice and steady and hope it doesn't cut out again

4573
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Alright

4574
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Steady steady as she goes

4575
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
If it flails too bad though

4576
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I'll have to figure something out live

4577
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Sorry that's the

4578
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Downside of live radio is that I can't

4579
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You know say oh hold on guys we're gonna stop

4580
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
While I go fix this

4581
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Alright uh let's move on Loki

4582
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Uh Valve has started the

4583
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Beta for the Steam Family

4584
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Sharing program so the first

4585
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Thousand people that

4586
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I guess were uh invited

4587
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Were sent invites this week

4588
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Um through email or

4589
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Hopefully through the actual

4590
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Messaging through Steam because if

4591
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It's through email I didn't fucking

4592
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Get that because I get so much spam

4593
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It's ridiculous

4594
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Thousand messages today um

4595
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So yes and then of course you know

4596
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Uh the Steam Sharing

4597
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Program allowed you to share your

4598
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Library with up to ten people and of course

4599
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Only one person can use it at a time

4600
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And it's a fun way to try out

4601
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Games so um

4602
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Yeah so once I get

4603
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Mine going because I am playing a lot of

4604
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Uh a lot

4605
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
A lot of uh

4606
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I will probably have to

4607
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Add people to my Steam sharing

4608
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Things so that maybe Bobby can play

4609
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
The legit copy of Saints Row 4 and get

4610
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Those achievements

4611
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000

Back when I was in college I mean this thing is like years

Old right? Do you remember when I brought my VCD

01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You saw a later one with me because I

4634
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Now I went and saw the very first movie with my friend

4635
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000

4636
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's too bad Seg's not listening he knows her very well

4637
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
But Amanda and I went to

4638
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000

4640
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Auditorium in the theater so what

4641
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Did we do we were screaming our heads

4642
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Off mimicking all the Pokemon we

4643
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Had the we had the best time ever

4644
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
It was so fun but anyway

4645
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Um the important thing to talk about news

4646
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Wise is that Pokemon

4647
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Origins is coming to

4648
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
The west uh this was an anime

4649
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That is a whopping four episodes long

4650
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
But it will launch on

4651
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
November 15th in the Pokemon

4652
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
TV mobile application

4653
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
This tells the stories of the very

4654
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
First Pokemon games Pokemon red

4655
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And blue I thought that looked like red

4656
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
From the original uh 96 game boy

4657
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Or excuse yeah 96 game boy

4658
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Um the protagonist

4659
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Named red will travel

4660
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Through the Kanto region and uh

4661
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Get into trouble with team rocket

4662
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Battle his rival and challenge

4663
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
The Pokemon league also Pokemon

4664
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
The movie Genesect and the legend

4665
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Awakened will air later this month my

4666
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
God how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point

4667
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
They only ever did what like

4668
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Four of them in theaters I only cared about the

4669
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
First one I know right like well

4670
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
The second movie was also

4671
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Great because if for nothing else

4672
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
For the line where Jesse and

4673
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
James from team rocket Jesse goes

4674
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
The opposite sex is nothing but trouble

4675
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And then James goes that's why I stay out of

4676
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
That kind of trouble and

4677
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Laughed my head off and that happened

4678
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's on YouTube somewhere go check it out

4679
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
There you go Pokemon origins

4680
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm kinda I'm kinda thinking

4681
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I might have to try it we'll see

4682
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
See how much it costs for the record I like

4683
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Digimon better

4684
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Okay alright

4685
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I would say let's travel back to a time when

4686
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Pokemon wasn't around but

4687
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
There were plenty of Pokemans around for this

4688
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Yeah thanks to the uh

4689
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Rule change invoked by dark soccer

4690
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Last week ten years ago

4691
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
There was still plenty of Pokemans

4692
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And plenty of classic

4693
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Classic video games that are as

4694
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Old as this show Old as balls

4695
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Are you saying this show is old as balls?

4696
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Probably

4697
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Well here it is the classic game of the week

4698
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Dark Sakura

4699
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Now that you can rip open the

4700
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
The PlayStation 2 era

4701
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter you already did

4702
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
When you picked the mosquito game

4703
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Yes I did I've done other

4704
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But whatever whatever

4705
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I've done newer games than this too now that I think about it

4706
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
But here it is the classic game of the week

4707
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Dark Sakura what did you pick?

4708
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm going with Kingdom Hearts

4709
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Well thank you I appreciate that

4710
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And everybody else who bought the HD version

4711
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Even though I go wait a minute like when this game

4712
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Came out

4713
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I remember playing this when it was new

4714
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And I think we were doing OLR

4715
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yes

4716
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
This game came out eleven years ago

4717
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Oh god

4718
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I was still in my twenties

4719
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Because

4720
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Fuck a bunch of that

4721
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I love this music by the way

4722
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It's the Trevor's Tale music

4723
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I freaking love it

4724
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
So anyway it was

4725
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Kingdom Hearts

4726
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And as we know it's an action role playing

4727
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Game put out by Square at the time

4728
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Now Squeenix

4729
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It came out on PS2 in 2002

4730
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And it was

4731
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
A collaboration between Squeenix

4732
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And Walt Disney

4733
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around

4734
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
And lots of Disney characters around

4735
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It's like the two universes had

4736
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
A very cute baby

4737
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
A very cute kind of fucked up baby

4738
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Um

4739
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And so this one for Square

4740
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
To have done so many

4741
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Regular RPGs you know their standard

4742
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
JRPG format

4743
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
This was a little bit of a departure

4744
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
To be a lot more

4745
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Action oriented

4746
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And in my case it was a lot more

4747
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Oh my god Donald

4748
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Knock the fuck off I don't need healing

4749
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Just saying that was the common

4750
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Thing you would hear at my house

4751
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The really great thing about it too

4752
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Is that a lot of

4753
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
The character designs were done

4754
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I'm sorry the

4755
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura

4756
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Who had done a lot of the character

4757
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Design in Square games

4758
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Had a fantastic

4759
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Voice cast I mean

4760
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Even though at the time I think it was

4761
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Like right at the height of the Haley

4762
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Joel love

4763
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And what actually has impressed

4764
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Me is that he's still voicing Sora

4765
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
He can still make himself sound that young

4766
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
He's you know

4767
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Aged a bit still kind of a cute

4768
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Cute dude but

4769
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I like the fact that he is that

4770
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Talented as a voice actor that he can

4771
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Still sound so young

4772
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Um it had lots of

4773
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Fun cut scenes I mean you had

4774
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Your Final Fantasy 8

4775
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Characters hanging around you had

4776
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
The Sephiroth

4777
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Thing was pretty fun you had

4778
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Your

4779
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Squall hanging out or I'm sorry

4780
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Lillian Hart

4781
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And you would get little nods

4782
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs

4783
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
But you get little nods um

4784
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
To other Square games and to

4785
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Different Disney franchises

4786
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And it was pretty fun

4787
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
You know and I'm not even going to go much into

4788
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 because you know that of course

4789
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Like is newer

4790
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It had the Tron level which was amazing

4791
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But

4792
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
This game was just awesome except for the

4793
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Gummy ship which was like my least favorite part

4794
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I hated navigating the gummy ship

4795
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And I kept saying why is it a gummy ship

4796
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
When there's no gummy bears

4797
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I mean hello

4798
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So as far as

4799
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
You know your characters you've got

4800
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
The main character Sora you have his buddy

4801
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Riku and uh Kairi

4802
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And

4803
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
And for the record

4804
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
At depth I knew how to set up Donald and he was

4805
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Still a ship

4806
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
So basically you

4807
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Team up with Donald and Goofy

4808
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
To find King Mickey

4809
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And uh your main character

4810
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Is the main uh

4811
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Antagonist as Ansem and the Heartless

4812
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So

4813
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
This game has spawned so much wank

4814
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
So much wank

4815
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
But other characters that show up in there I mean

4816
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You've got um

4817
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You know 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest

4818
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
You have um

4819
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
You know major Disney villains in the game

4820
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
You've got you can summon different

4821
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Characters too like you have the genie

4822
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You have Tinkerbell you have Simba from the Lion King

4823
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Other characters that you ran into

4824
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
From square games you have Tidus and Waka

4825
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And Selphie and you have

4826
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Like I said Squall you have Aerith

4827
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
What the fuck was she doing in the game?

4828
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Cid and Yuffie um

4829
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Not dying much to your dismay

4830
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I know. Riku from Final Fantasy

4831
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Uh 10 was supposed to show up

4832
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But was replaced by Yuffie

4833
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Um you have the Cloud and Sephiroth

4834
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Uh showdown in the Olympus Coliseum

4835
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So much really good stuff

4836
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
And the story itself is so rich

4837
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
That they seem to really

4838
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Plan on there being more than one

4839
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
You know they were really looking ahead

4840
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
But um

4841
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I just I can't say enough good about this game

4842
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It was really amazing

4843
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And basically

4844
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
The way that this came about

4845
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Was that there was a discussion

4846
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Between Shinji Hashimoto

4847
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And um Sakaguchi

4848
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
About Mario 64

4849
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Where they wanted to do like a three

4850
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Dimensional movement

4851
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Um but they said they could only

4852
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
The only way to rival a Mario game would be

4853
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
To have Disney behind it

4854
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And Nomura overheard the conversation

4855
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And actually

4856
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Uh led the way to start

4857
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Building the game and then there was

4858
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
A meeting between Hashimoto and a

4859
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Disney executive

4860
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
In an elevator

4861
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Where they were in the same building in Japan

4862
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And magic was made

4863
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
So they brought it together

4864
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
It's got fantastic

4865
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Music, fantastic voice cast

4866
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Both and I have to say

4867
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Both the um the English voice cast

4868
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And the Japanese voice cast

4869
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Were top notch after

4870
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Hearing them in both

4871
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And then getting Utada Hikaru to do

4872
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Um the uh main song

4873
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Both in uh Japanese and English

4874
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Although honestly I think the Japanese version is

4875
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Better I think there was a lot more production value

4876
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Um

4877
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And like there's some of the voice cast that they

4878
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Couldn't get for the American one like um

4879
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
They couldn't get Robin Williams

4880
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
They had um

4881
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I can never pronounce this guys name properly

4882
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Dan Castellaneta

4883
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Uh he's Homer Simpson yeah

4884
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Yeah I can never pronounce this

4885
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Castaneda or something like that

4886
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Billy Zane and David Bourne

4887
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Well they got the guy who plays

4888
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
A really down on himself

4889
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Guy to play another really down on himself guy

4890
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I think though that isn't he also the voice

4891
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Though in like the second and third movies

4892
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
He was in the TV show

4893
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Because after Robin Williams had the falling out

4894
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
With uh Disney over

4895
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Aladdin uh he stepped

4896
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
In and did the voice uh Robin Williams

4897
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Came back and did the third movie though

4898
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
When they all kissed and made up

4899
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
At any rate you know

4900
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
They got really

4901
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Really top level voice talent

4902
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I mean sometimes when you get an RPG

4903
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
In Japan

4904
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
They'll have top notch voice actors

4905
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Behind it there but we won't

4906
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Get as big names there this is

4907
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Probably one of the first to have really

4908
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Significant talent

4909
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Put into a game you know

4910
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it

4911
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
You'd expect them to put in that kind of

4912
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Uh production value

4913
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And I don't think anybody

4914
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Was disappointed by this game if anybody

4915
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Was then they're wrong

4916
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I can see though when you put it next

4917
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
To Kingdom Hearts 2

4918
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 was you know fixed a lot of

4919
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Problems with the first one with the camera

4920
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And so forth

4921
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And this was um stated

4922
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
As um the runner up

4923
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
For the PS2 um

4924
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Best game of 2002 reader's choice award

4925
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Let's see what the first one was

4926
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Um

4927
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Gamepro said that the battle system

4928
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Was like the N64 Zelda games which

4929
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Honestly I thought was really good

4930
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And then there were actually

4931
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Plenty of comments um compliments

4932
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
For the AI with Donald and

4933
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Goofy and it really was very

4934
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Customizable I would just always get irritated

4935
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Because sometimes Donald would do shit

4936
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
The wrong time it doesn't get any better in the HD

4937
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Version just letting you know

4938
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Donald's still his stupid head but there's um

4939
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
The final mix that came out that had

4940
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Um a little bit

4941
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
More stuff thrown in and there was also another

4942
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Side another story the deep dive

4943
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
That had uh

4944
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Bonus stuff that you would get um

4945
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
There's a manga around it

4946
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
There you know like you said there was the uh

4947
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
The uh HD version

4948
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And there's all kinds

4949
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Of side games that have spawned

4950
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
From this that are all a rich

4951
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Part of this world that's been created

4952
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Around the game so

4953
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I really like

4954
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
When you have something

4955
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Big come out and then

4956
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Have it be a success

4957
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And then have such a really

4958
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Beautiful story around the whole thing

4959
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And there's still a lot we don't know

4960
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Like you remember how everyone went oh shit

4961
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
When everyone saw you know

4962
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Riku blindfolded in the

4963
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Organization outfit and everyone was like ahh

4964
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And then the little ending for

4965
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Two where everyone was in the whole

4966
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Keyblade graveyard

4967
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I saw an amazing Google doc

4968
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
That was like 50 pages long that was trying to

4969
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts

4970
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And I was like and it's for kids

4971
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
But it spawned that much

4972
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Fan involvement and when you've got

4973
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
When you can build

4974
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
A dedicated fan base like that

4975
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
You know you've really got something important

4976
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And special so

4977
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Kingdom Hearts is really I think one of the

4978
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
First games that

4979
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Spot several different levels of fandom

4980
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Together and I think

4981
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
That's a pretty monumental event too because

4982
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Usually fandoms are like bitch please

4983
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Alright

4984
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Well there it is guys your classic game of the week

4985
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Kingdom Hearts

4986
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
On the Playstation 2 but of course as we all

4987
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Know now on the Playstation 3

4988
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
With the whole HD version which

4989
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
In our chat room ShadowNextGen points

4990
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Out Rob I heard they fixed the

4991
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD

4992
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Remix on Playstation 3

4993
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It's better but I still get frustrated with it

4994
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
To be honest but I gotta

4995
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Admit Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner

4996
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy 14

4997
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Now that I finally hit end game and maybe that'll

4998
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Calm down a little bit I'm hoping to go

4999
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Back and play more Kingdom Hearts

5000
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And another good thing is that I have to

5001
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Say that it gave Utada Hikaru

5002
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Some really really good exposure

5003
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Here in the US

5004
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
She's had several albums now in the US

5005
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Two

5006
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Well I think she had two and then an EP

5007
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I don't think so I think it was just the

5008
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
One that Timbaland produced and then

5009
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
The comeback to me

5010
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Her best of from Japan is on the US store

5011
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Ah that might be what it is

5012
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
But at any rate I freaking love her voice

5013
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Alright there you go the classic game of the week

5014
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
We're running long tonight so we're gonna

5015
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Go right into our break don't go anywhere guys

5016
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Though we'll be back with plenty more of

5017
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio right after this

5018
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Welcome back everybody to

5019
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5020
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Live on this Sunday night

5021
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
September the 29th of 2013

5022
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
The 521st

5023
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Episode of our show already in

5024
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Progress and unfortunately

5025
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to

5026
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Hear the music that we play during the break while we

5027
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Get up and stretch and refill our drinks

5028
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
And so forth during the break but we had

5029
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
A fun little background medley from

5030
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Kid Icarus that played in the break there and it just

5031
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Reminded me how much I love the music

5032
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
In Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood

5033
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Even though that game is fucking hard

5034
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
It is fucking hard but I still

5035
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Like to go back and play it once now

5036
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one

5037
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Sitting but I can at least get through the

5038
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
First world terror danger horror

5039
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
You picked up Uprising right?

5040
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I did

5041
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
You know and that game like hurt my hand

5042
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
So much to play I never really made

5043
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
A lot of progress in that I enjoyed it

5044
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
But I kind of wish they would do it on Wii U

5045
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U

5046
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Didn't they say they originally had

5047
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
A console version

5048
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yeah they had a Wii U version

5049
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Alright

5050
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Well anyway let's get into some rapid

5051
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Fire gaming news and talk about some

5052
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Things that will be happening unlike

5053
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Kid Icarus on Wii U

5054
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
So there was an ARG

5055
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
That was tied with Surgeon Simulator

5056
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
That has now finally been cracked

5057
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
It was a secret code that you would put

5058
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
In the zero gravity surgery

5059
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Mission

5060
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
And you would get sucked outside of your

5061
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Ship and now you have

5062
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
A brand new set

5063
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Of surgeries you could do on an alien

5064
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
In zero gravity with alien

5065
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Tools and they have you do all

5066
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Sorts of like weird

5067
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Sorts of like gobble shaft

5068
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a gobble

5069
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Shaft

5070
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It's pretty funny

5071
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator

5072
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
There's actually videos out there that show you what the access code

5073
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Is and you can do all that

5074
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
So yeah and then of course

5075
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
There's the second season

5076
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Of Mortal Kombat Legacy

5077
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Ten episodes

5078
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I guess they were all released at one time

5079
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
It's being hosted by Machinima

5080
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
If you may remember it was that live action

5081
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Series that came out around the time that

5082
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
The last Mortal Kombat game came out

5083
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And so yeah if you want to check it out

5084
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It's on YouTube, Machinima

5085
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
And ten episodes for

5086
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Your digestion

5087
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And last but not least

5088
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Rockstar put out some information about

5089
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this

5090
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Tuesday on the first

5091
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Well bumpy launching on the first

5092
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
May or may not launch on the first

5093
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Launching in an MMO sense

5094
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Will be stable by mid-October

5095
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Yeah um okay so

5096
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Basically they were talking about some of the stuff

5097
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
And answered some of the rumors that were going around

5098
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Confirming that there will be

5099
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Not really microtransactions but there will be

5100
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Some sort of online transactions to purchase

5101
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
In-game money so they have that

5102
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
However they prefaced

5103
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
That with you will be able to play

5104
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
The game and it's been balanced for

5105
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
People playing you know the game

5106
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Regularly and you won't actually have to buy money

5107
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
If you don't want to but if you want to just

5108
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Get ahead you know buy your fast

5109
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Cars and better weapons and

5110
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Crib or whatever

5111
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
By all means go ahead and do that

5112
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Some of the stuff that they announced that

5113
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
They're going to be doing with that

5114
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
They're going to be

5115
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Including some different

5116
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I guess activities

5117
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Jobs they have

5118
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Sports you can do you know tennis

5119
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And all that kind of stuff that's normally in the game

5120
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Also

5121
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
They're going to be putting out some free

5122
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Content at launch

5123
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The content creators for deathmatches and races

5124
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Also a beach bum pack

5125
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Which is going to have 300 items

5126
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Like you know

5127
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Customization items for your

5128
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Characters as well as

5129
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I guess

5130
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Weapons

5131
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Capture the flag is going to be coming back

5132
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And they're also going to have a content creator

5133
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
For that and they'll be

5134
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Introducing heists

5135
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
So that's going to be pretty sweet

5136
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And 700 missions

5137
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I think is what they teased before

5138
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Are going to be available online

5139
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Compare that to 69

5140
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
That are in the single player game

5141
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That's pretty significant

5142
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And

5143
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
People have actually dug through the files

5144
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And a couple things that have been confirmed

5145
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Of course they have

5146
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well

5147
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
As betting on horses at the track

5148
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
So

5149
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Hurray do you get to whip the horses though

5150
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Like you do in derby owners club

5151
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I don't know about that

5152
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
That's a game I haven't played in forever

5153
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I miss that game

5154
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Seriously I mentioned again

5155
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
We do have the vog network crew

5156
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That you can join

5157
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You can go check out the forums

5158
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
We have the link to that

5159
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Otherwise I believe it's

5160
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
socialclub.rockstargames.com

5161
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Slash

5162
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Crews slash vog network

5163
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Alright sounds like if you search for

5164
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Vog network you'll find

5165
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
You'll probably find yeah

5166
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Vog network or the

5167
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I don't know if you can search by the

5168
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
The four letter initials we have

5169
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Vog N

5170
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Sounds good

5171
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Traveling around to some other news

5172
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
In kind of the WTF department

5173
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
There's a really weird promotion

5174
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Between the developers flying wild hog

5175
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And volition

5176
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Because of I guess the publishers devolver

5177
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Digital and deep silver

5178
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
But there's a cross promotion between

5179
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Shadow warrior and saints row 4

5180
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
What is said promotion

5181
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Why I'm so glad you asked

5182
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Because in shadow warrior

5183
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You will be able to unlock

5184
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
If you own saints row 4

5185
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And you own shadow warrior on steam

5186
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
You'll unlock the penetrator weapon

5187
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
In shadow warrior

5188
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
That's right the purple dildo bat will be yours

5189
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
To slaughter the enemies

5190
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I love that it has balls

5191
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
In the ancient japan setting

5192
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
That is shadow warrior

5193
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
You play a character named wang

5194
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
So I mean it's fitting

5195
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I know it's just silly

5196
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
But you know anything involving

5197
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Saints row usually is

5198
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I'm just completely

5199
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Unused that it has balls

5200
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Do you want me to bring up the balls again

5201
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
So you can giggle some more

5202
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I'll have you know though

5203
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
It only had balls

5204
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Over here in this region

5205
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And in europe

5206
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It did not have balls in japan

5207
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Where I believe it was censored

5208
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And it didn't have the wiggle physics

5209
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
In japan either

5210
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
So silly what they have to change

5211
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
From region to region

5212
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Almost everyone try a game like

5213
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Rocksmith 2014 which of course

5214
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Is the newest rocksmith game

5215
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
More of a cult level music game

5216
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Because it's not pushing

5217
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Plastic buttons to instruments

5218
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Well I guess it is in a way

5219
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
But you're actually learning to play

5220
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
The actual guitars

5221
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
It's kind of what sets rocksmith apart

5222
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So it definitely has it's following

5223
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
If you weren't already aware

5224
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
There is a new version coming this year

5225
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
It's rocksmith 2014

5226
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
There is a guitarcade

5227
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Which was also in the first rocksmith game

5228
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
But you play games

5229
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
That are retro inspired

5230
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
For example there is a game like ducks redo

5231
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Which is basically galaga

5232
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
But it can't actually be galaga

5233
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Because Ubisoft didn't make galaga

5234
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So you know there is all those issues there

5235
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Some of the other guitarcade items

5236
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Excuse me games that are available for playing

5237
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Scale racers

5238
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And gone wailing

5239
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
In scale racers you will master scales

5240
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Avoiding traffic in a police car chase

5241
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And gone wailing will

5242
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Make you play louder or quieter

5243
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
To elevate characters

5244
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And collect coins

5245
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And lastly there is return to castle

5246
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Core dead

5247
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Which is a first person shooter

5248
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Where you strum chords to kill enemies

5249
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Cute I like that

5250
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That's very similar to this

5251
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Not very popular game that came out

5252
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
For the guitar hero controller

5253
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It was rock of the dead

5254
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I saw that the last E3 I went to

5255
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Anyway

5256
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I like that they use cute little arcade

5257
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Games as kind of like a way to

5258
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Make the game a little more

5259
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Gamey I guess as opposed to

5260
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
A tutorial or what have you

5261
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
That's pretty cool

5262
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It almost does make me want to learn to play guitar

5263
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Just a little bit

5264
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I know I have room in my house

5265
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
For this and I will probably pick this up

5266
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
At some point

5267
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
It's Ubisoft's Just Dance 2014

5268
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
The song list is out for the game

5269
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
For Just Dance 2014

5270
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
You have a lot of newer favorites

5271
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Like Applause by Lady Gaga

5272
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj

5273
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Gentlemen by Psy

5274
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
That's a good song

5275
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Let's see even Ricky Martin's back

5276
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
With Maria, Where Have You Been?

5277
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
By Rihanna

5278
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Oh god that horrible

5279
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Blurred line song by Robin Thicke

5280
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
That song needs to be removed from everything ever

5281
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
He needs to be removed from everything ever

5282
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It's just a bad song

5283
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
In better news, Flash Dance

5284
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
What a Feelin' by The Girly Team

5285
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Sadly it's a cover

5286
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
YMCA is there

5287
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Attention Beliebers

5288
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
The Will.I.Am song

5289
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
That Power, which features Justin Bieber

5290
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Is in there too

5291
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Gamebooey.org will be happy to know

5292
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Kesha is in the game with Come On

5293
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I do love Kesha

5294
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Kesha is so fun

5295
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
In such a guilty pleasure way

5296
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
For those of you that like more basic singers

5297
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Katy Perry is in the game with

5298
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I Kissed a Girl

5299
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And if you like your musicals

5300
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game

5301
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
What the fuck? That's random

5302
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
How random is that?

5303
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Like a holdover from Just Dance Disney

5304
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I have no idea

5305
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
And one of the songs

5306
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
of the summer, Get Lucky

5307
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
by Daft Punk

5308
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Everybody likes that song

5309
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I like this song, David Guetta with

5310
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Wolf falling to pieces

5311
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
But you know what? All of these songs

5312
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
All of them, shit

5313
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
They are trumped

5314
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
They are just nothing

5315
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
With the inclusion of this song

5316
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Gimme, gimme, gimme

5317
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
A Man After Midnight by ABBA

5318
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
It's all you need, fuck the rest of it

5319
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Fuck the rest of it

5320
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
End quote

5321
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it

5322
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Nope

5323
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I can't

5324
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Unfortunately, Dark Sakura, ABBA

5325
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Trumps that song

5326
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I have to, sorry

5327
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Think about it

5328
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
If you think about it, Dark Sakura

5329
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I don't think ABBA could even

5330
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Now Rob, Rob

5331
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
What?

5332
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Did you ever pick up ABBA, You Could Dance for the Wii?

5333
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I did

5334
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
You should have seen Rob

5335
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
do freaking ballerina spins

5336
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I wish I had

5337
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I wish I had been recording it

5338
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Because Rob's like, I've got the ABBA game

5339
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
You need to come over

5340
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And I'm sitting back in this chair

5341
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That no one can see me point to

5342
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Except for us in this room

5343
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing

5344
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Like that was a couple years ago

5345
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And Rob's like, look what I got

5346
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
And I did the winner takes it all

5347
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
For Jamie

5348
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't want to talk

5349
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Oh and remember you bringing

5350
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Singstar ABBA over to my house when

5351
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Tiara was over?

5352
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
There right next to Singstar Queen

5353
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
That is like the best shelf in my entire house

5354
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Rob you're so cute

5355
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I'm just saying

5356
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
But remember it was

5357
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
You, me and Tiara playing

5358
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Singstar ABBA

5359
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
And you made me sing

5360
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I miss her

5361
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
She's in Arlington now

5362
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Well I still miss her

5363
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Yeah it's really hard to hit that far away

5364
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Alright also

5365
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Just going to throw this out there

5366
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Another quick little thing for Just Dance 2014

5367
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Which apparently also includes One Direction

5368
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
But anyway

5369
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
That's not what I wanted to say

5370
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
What I want to say is that the 2014 bundle for the Wii U

5371
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Will come packaged with a Wii Remote Plus

5372
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Which is interesting

5373
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Because you know

5374
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
It's the Wii U

5375
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Yet it's a Wii peripheral

5376
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But if you think about the way Just Dance works

5377
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It's not like you're going to be sitting there with a game pad

5378
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Dancing to Gimme Gimme Gimme

5379
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Also because if you buy a Wii U

5380
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
System you technically

5381
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Could get away with not having a Wii Remote

5382
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Because you might be playing games with a game pad

5383
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I don't have a Wii Remote Plus

5384
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I never

5385
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And the game does require it

5386
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I'm going to get shit for this but I never played Skyward Sword

5387
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
So I didn't have one

5388
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Neither have I

5389
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And the game does require it so yeah that's why

5390
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Exactly

5391
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
So you can get that for 70 bucks

5392
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
The bundle that has all of that

5393
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
You can get the game separately for $40

5394
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
If you have

5395
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Wow they significantly reduced the price

5396
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Oh wait no they didn't

5397
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
It's actually a full price controller so fuck them

5398
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Just buy a used one seriously

5399
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Oh you, alright

5400
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

5401
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Not Abba

5402
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Well

5403
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
For the Super Smash Brothers

5404
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Roster we have a new addition

5405
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
We have Wind Waker Link

5406
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
And all of his adorable cuteness

5407
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
And I believe he's

5408
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Going to be on both versions

5409
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Also with his adult incarnation

5410
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
As well

5411
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
So fun

5412
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Mighty No. 9 is also coming out

5413
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
For the Vita and the 3DS

5414
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
It basically reached the goals

5415
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
For those so you know what

5416
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
If I get it I'll get it on 3DS

5417
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I don't think it's reached those goals yet

5418
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Well no

5419
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
When it reached 3.5 million

5420
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
But it's pretty close I think

5421
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I don't know they've only got two days left

5422
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
They might not hit it

5423
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I still haven't put in money yet though

5424
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there

5425
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
And in other news

5426
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack

5427
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It's coming

5428
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
There's a listing for

5429
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
The

5430
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Let's see, Rockman X

5431
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Soundbox on Rakuten

5432
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So it looks like it's gonna

5433
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Be out for wow it's expensive

5434
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
12,600 yen so basically

5435
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
27 bucks

5436
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
A lot of money. Someone get that for me and rip it

5437
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
No

5438
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Yes

5439
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Actually I have a game on my list Rob

5440
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
That I need to have

5441
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Shut up phone

5442
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Rob is playing with his phone

5443
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
During the show everybody

5444
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
There's like a lot of people out there

5445
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
That still don't realize I do a show

5446
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
On Sunday nights

5447
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
My mom knows I do a show on

5448
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Sunday

5449
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Anyway

5450
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Moving on let's go to the FUGL question of the week

5451
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Every week we go to our Facebook

5452
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Community and our Google Plus community

5453
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
And if you slam those words together you get

5454
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
FUGL and it's the

5455
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
FUGL question of the week

5456
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Except I don't have my music

5457
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Where's my music?

5458
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Dark Soccer you took my music

5459
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
No

5460
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
That's not good

5461
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I didn't take your, I did not, Rob

5462
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Rob Rob Rob

5463
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I'm so prepared. See getting these messages

5464
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
On the phone and everything just like

5465
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Threw me off

5466
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I didn't do shit

5467
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You don't know shit

5468
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
You know what we need to sit down and watch showgirls

5469
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
With a bunch of crap food

5470
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
We do. Good times

5471
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Anyhow, here we go

5472
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Did you find it yet? Yes I found my bumper. Here we go

5473
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Here it is

5474
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
The FUGL question of the week

5475
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
We went with the obvious this week

5476
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
With a lot of folks talking about the steam machine

5477
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And all the related stuff

5478
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?

5479
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Steam OS, Steam Machine and the Steam Controller

5480
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Let's start with Andy R

5481
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid

5482
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
But I do want to try it

5483
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And I'm pretty happy with my current PC

5484
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me

5485
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'll wait until we have more concrete details

5486
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Machine specs, prices and so on

5487
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Until I pass further judgement

5488
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Signed up for the beta thingy though

5489
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
At least a passing interest

5490
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Tigerclaw says I think Steam OS is perfect

5491
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
For those that like to build a home theater

5492
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And PC in a small form factor

5493
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
With a good graphics card

5494
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And play their Steam games on the HDTV

5495
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
That presents a lot of opportunities

5496
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
And there are those that want to play those Steam games

5497
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig

5498
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
The Steam Machine will be perfect for first time PC gamers

5499
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It'll be interesting to see what they can do

5500
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
With the Steam Controller

5501
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
The fact that it has no thumbsticks

5502
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
But uses touchpad technology

5503
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
That the controls are given the tech is the kind

5504
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
You'd find in laptops

5505
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Which is often not very responsive

5506
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Excuse me, responsive to touch

5507
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Katsuhiko J says

5508
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
The controller is something different for a change

5509
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I need to try it before I pass judgement

5510
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Who knows, it could be the next best thing

5511
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Valve made a bold move this past week

5512
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I'm interested in their OS

5513
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Chris C says

5514
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I think spec wise

5515
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
The hardware of the Steam Console would have to be on par

5516
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
If not more powerful

5517
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Than current consoles to pique my interest

5518
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I like consoles because

5519
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Games are tailored to the specific console

5520
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
And no major tweaks have to be made

5521
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
To get a seamless experience

5522
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
If the specs beat out the Playstation 4's

5523
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I might be sold

5524
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Red The Haze left us with this too long didn't read version

5525
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
But you can read his full answer on Facebook

5526
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
It says

5527
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
It will unify hardware manufacturers and software devs

5528
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
To make similar specs

5529
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Which will mean better products for the consumers

5530
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Hmm, I like that perspective

5531
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Ciel says

5532
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
The Steam OS has my interest

5533
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I'm not much of a controller

5534
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I'm not much of a controller, I think I'm a controller person

5535
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
But I'd like to give it a shot

5536
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices

5537
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
The Steam Machines may have multiple price models

5538
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
The OS is free

5539
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
But surely they have an ideal on the controllers

5540
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I can't shut up and give you my money Gabe

5541
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
If you don't tell me how much you desire

5542
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
It's like the third person I've seen say

5543
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
We need a price

5544
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Unfolded Raptor said

5545
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I'm not being involved with the Steam Machine

5546
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS

5547
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
So no sell for me

5548
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Yet

5549
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Ragenator says

5550
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
It's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game

5551
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Given that I don't know too much on the stuff

5552
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I did see a picture of the controller

5553
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
My initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd

5554
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
But hey, if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box

5555
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
And give it a try

5556
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I may end up liking it

5557
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Andrew G says

5558
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
That's actually 23rd Magus

5559
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Working

5560
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Well, he needs to work his way on over here

5561
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
To a Sunday night show

5562
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
The Gabe Cube

5563
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
The Gabe Cube looks promising

5564
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
For those who would rather not self build

5565
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles

5566
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Time will tell

5567
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Some of the answers here from PeegerJunior92 says

5568
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I think it's a logical step forward for Valve

5569
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And they seem to have a number of the important points

5570
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
That users were hoping for

5571
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
The controller is definitely a new concept

5572
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And something that people will have to get their hands on

5573
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
To really understand how it will work

5574
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
My biggest qualm is that there was no reason

5575
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
For this to be a drawn out three stage announcement

5576
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
It would have been a great all in one announcement

5577
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
And people would have been happy

5578
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
CodeMan says

5579
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Honestly, it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do

5580
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And yes, it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC

5581
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
But I'm not sold yet

5582
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party

5583
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
And Eddie K says

5584
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
If Half Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console

5585
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I'm not buying one

5586
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
And let's see

5587
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Going to Google Plus

5588
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week

5589
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
We usually don't have this many

5590
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Let me start with Travis H who says

5591
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Speechless with excitement

5592
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Flaco Jones says

5593
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I think SteamOS is cool but as for the Steam Machine itself

5594
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
There was nothing to convince me I should buy that

5595
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Instead of just running SteamOS on my PC

5596
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
As a partition or however it would work

5597
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
The controller looks like it would not work for me

5598
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play

5599
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
ActDef says

5600
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page

5601
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
And the family sharing option

5602
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Well, need to use logic more

5603
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Alright, hold on ActDef

5604
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That is so easy to say in retrospect

5605
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
But why didn't you call the 1, 2, 3 last week then, huh?

5606
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I could see at least the SteamBox

5607
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And maybe the SteamOS

5608
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Yeah, I kind of thought that the SteamBox announcement

5609
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Would have been kind of combined with

5610
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Actually, like they said before

5611
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
It pretty much could have been all one announcement

5612
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
You didn't really need to separate

5613
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said

5614
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
It could have just been all one

5615
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But anyway, my opinion about the whole thing

5616
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this

5617
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
They're making the Steam Machine pretty much an entertainment console

5618
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Like the Xbox One and the Playstation 4

5619
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
And since they're developing their own OS for it

5620
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
And yeah, I know it's Linux based

5621
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
But still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff

5622
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
And cost effective too

5623
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Not to mention being able to stream all your library

5624
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
In case your game doesn't support Linux

5625
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Going over to Evel, E3VL says

5626
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
From what I see, the SteamOS

5627
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Is basically countering Windows

5628
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
As in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system

5629
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Like Apple's App Store

5630
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
SteamOS is essentially an open system

5631
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Like Google Android

5632
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Very interesting comparison

5633
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now

5634
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
No one needs PC laptops in the future

5635
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Aside for gaming

5636
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs

5637
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
In the future

5638
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability

5639
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Current PC gamers may adopt it

5640
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
But Steam is lending out the OS for third party vendors

5641
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
To create Steam Machines

5642
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It might be a problem and quite possibly a huge gamble

5643
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Depending on how their hardware is marketed

5644
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
And priced relative to consoles

5645
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It's a really interesting comparison

5646
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS

5647
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
To third party developers

5648
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Like you get those companies like Alienware

5649
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
And stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there

5650
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:52,000
You get the junk programs with a brand new PC that you buy

5651
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials

5652
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
And stuff like that

5653
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I used to have all that

5654
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
But with Dell

5655
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You get that a lot

5656
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Even with my ACES

5657
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
There's a lot of ACES programs in there

5658
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I'm just worried I'm going to get all of that bogged down

5659
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
In the SteamOS

5660
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And it's just going to be like a Windows PC again

5661
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And lastly, Retertainment says

5662
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
The SteamOS seems to be tailored for people who have

5663
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming

5664
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Problem is most people don't use their PC like that

5665
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Most people have PCs

5666
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
They use for work, music, movies, games

5667
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
And general dicking around on the internet

5668
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Also porn

5669
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
If people want a device that is only for video games

5670
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
They buy a console

5671
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I didn't really look at this

5672
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
No not really

5673
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs

5674
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Hold on

5675
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Porn

5676
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Advanced Haptic Feedback

5677
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
That they have with that

5678
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Advanced Haptic Feedback

5679
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And lastly, Retertainment says

5680
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
The rest of his answer here

5681
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I didn't really look at the Steam Machine or the Steam Controller

5682
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
As I do not plan to make any major purchases

5683
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Until I accomplish Project Buy-A-House

5684
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And in fact

5685
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
It has a little touch screen on there

5686
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
You could probably stream porn to that

5687
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
While you play Team Fortress 2 or something

5688
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
You can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2

5689
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
First thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday

5690
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Porn

5691
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Alright

5692
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Moving on

5693
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Let's get back into some longer news here

5694
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
And we'll get to the Skype line here

5695
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Hopefully before too long

5696
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
1877 Game OLR

5697
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

5698
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
But first, Loki

5699
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Alright, so there was an announcement this week

5700
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
That first leaked out

5701
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And then they kind of made their own announcement

5702
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Something coming to Xbox One

5703
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Is Xbox Fitness

5704
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Which is an app that uses Kinect

5705
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
And what's kind of cool about it though

5706
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there

5707
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Including Insanity

5708
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
And I want to say P90X

5709
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Is one of the other ones that's in there

5710
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
But all sorts of different trainers

5711
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
It is kind of interesting though

5712
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Because I guess

5713
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
The app will be free for Gold members

5714
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Through December 2014

5715
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Although it says there's some additional content

5716
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
That you can purchase for it

5717
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
And I guess in 2015

5718
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Unlimited access will also require

5719
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
A separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee

5720
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
As well as Xbox Gold

5721
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
But

5722
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
For those people that are really into fitness and stuff

5723
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And you know

5724
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I want to say it because I had co-workers that

5725
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Did the Insanity stuff

5726
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
That DVD says fucking expensive

5727
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
So if they've got that built in there

5728
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
That's pretty cool

5729
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Especially if you're kind of a fitness

5730
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
You know, enthusiast I guess

5731
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Health junkie

5732
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Yes, and it's probably a little better

5733
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Than was it that

5734
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Xbox

5735
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
The Nike one that they had last year

5736
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
That was kind of lame

5737
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
This looks a little bit along the lines of

5738
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Kind of what they were trying to do with that

5739
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate

5740
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And all those features that they were touting before

5741
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
But

5742
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Might be cool

5743
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Some of the trainers to be noted

5744
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton

5745
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Sean T

5746
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Kind of cool I guess

5747
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Not really my thing because

5748
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
You know

5749
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I eat hamburgers

5750
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Yes

5751
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
No no no not today, you had chicken nuggets

5752
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
That's true

5753
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Here's the thing though about

5754
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Xbox Fitness, don't we already have

5755
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
A million fucking fitness games on the Xbox

5756
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I mean I know this is for the new one

5757
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
But doesn't the Kinect

5758
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Need to get out of this rut of dance

5759
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
And fitness games, like show me something

5760
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
New

5761
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Technically yeah, I mean there's about one or two every year

5762
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I mean there's Zumba, there's a new Zumba game this year

5763
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
But there's only really about

5764
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
One maybe

5765
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Two fitness games a year for

5766
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
The Xbox 360

5767
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
And Kinect

5768
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Actually I think it's been about one a year

5769
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
So it's not a ton

5770
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
But yeah I mean

5771
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Those are really the only games

5772
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
That kind of effectively use the Kinect

5773
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect

5774
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Has been kind of crap

5775
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
So I don't know

5776
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
But yeah they're saying

5777
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Different workouts I guess

5778
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I guess from ten minutes to

5779
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
One hour

5780
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
They're going to have little routines that you can do

5781
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
And stuff, I'm assuming this is tracked across

5782
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
All the different

5783
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Ones you have, metamorphosis

5784
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
They've got that in there as well

5785
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Ripton 30 from Jillian Michaels

5786
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
So I don't know if you've got a

5787
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Fitness program that you're really into

5788
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
But see once again though like Insanity

5789
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Unless you're one of those people that just borrowed

5790
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
That set or something

5791
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Like if you already have it

5792
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
You've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks

5793
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
For it

5794
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
You're probably not going to need this

5795
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I don't know

5796
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
S2100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

5797
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Has a good point

5798
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
The fitness things sell really well

5799
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
They won't stray too far from a cash cow

5800
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
And if you think about it though

5801
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
You're probably paying for gold to play

5802
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Online multiplayer so

5803
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Why not? Check it out

5804
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Might be cool

5805
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Alright well moving on to other

5806
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Features on the Xbox One

5807
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
The game DVR will work on Xbox Live

5808
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
At launch but YouTube and Facebook

5809
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Sharing won't be enabled until 2014

5810
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
So here's what game DVR

5811
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Does

5812
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Game DVR will save the previous five minutes

5813
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Of gameplay if you use a voice command

5814
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Xbox record

5815
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
You can edit the piece in the upload studio

5816
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And then share it which would be

5817
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
The YouTube Facebook thing later

5818
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
These clips are saved in 720p

5819
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
At 30 frames a second

5820
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Game DVR will only work if you

5821
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Have Xbox Live gold

5822
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
So there you have it that's how it's going to work

5823
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
That sounds dumb

5824
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Because it's saying that you have to do

5825
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Xbox record and then it records something

5826
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where

5827
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Well no because it says previous five minutes of gameplay

5828
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
If you say Xbox record so my thought is

5829
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
If something funny happens and you say

5830
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
That you can go back and edit it in the studio

5831
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
That's my thought so like if something

5832
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Really funny happens you have a chance to react and say

5833
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Xbox record and that way it'll save it

5834
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
So you know if you are

5835
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Playing an online game and hilarity ensues

5836
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Or whatever or I'm playing

5837
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Slenderman and I have a really scary

5838
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Ah moment although that's not on Xbox

5839
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Five minutes is not fair I don't know whatever

5840
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
For a first person shooter it's enough

5841
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
But like if I'm recording an online match or something

5842
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It might be ten minutes long I mean

5843
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And then this isn't the solution

5844
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
That's why I have my

5845
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
External one I guess

5846
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Yeah there still will be a value in that

5847
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
So there you go Dark Sakura

5848
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Sorry I'm critiquing that

5849
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Image

5850
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Okay first of all they have it like it's levitating

5851
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
But it's at the wrong angle for the

5852
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Level of shadow that they have

5853
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
The Xbox one picture that was on the article

5854
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
You were just reading

5855
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Whoever does their press materials needs to like

5856
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Go back and relearn Photoshop or something

5857
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Levitating consoles are so

5858
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Like Playstation 3 I mean

5859
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
It was the evil baby that made the console

5860
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Levitate or the levitating

5861
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Console that made the evil baby I don't know

5862
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
So EA Sports

5863
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Has put out a statement saying

5864
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
That they are no longer making college

5865
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Games

5866
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Basically the general manager Cam Weber

5867
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Um and

5868
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I'm sorry of American uh

5869
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Who

5870
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Basically the one in charge of all the American football games

5871
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Basically is saying that

5872
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
The college sports games are going away

5873
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
That's meaning the NCAA games

5874
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Um they're also

5875
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Which they themselves put out an announcement

5876
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
That they're letting their license expire

5877
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
In 2014

5878
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And EA is not pursuing it

5879
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
So they are not going to be doing

5880
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Any more college football

5881
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
As in American football and not the real football

5882
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
That you actually play with your feet

5883
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Um and they

5884
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Are not doing any other

5885
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
College games that basically

5886
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
They're letting it go

5887
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Bye

5888
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And the rest of us are like

5889
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Whoopty shit

5890
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
You know I'm surprised though because that does kind of suck

5891
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Because it was a pretty big

5892
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Revenue stream for them even though

5893
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
There was a lot of

5894
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
You know you have to remember

5895
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Like for me I'm always like

5896
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Okay but college football is

5897
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Like a way bigger deal in other places than it is here

5898
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Exactly and in July

5899
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
It really is pretty much the biggest game

5900
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Only big game coming out

5901
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Now it's going to be this big dead area

5902
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Which hopefully will be filled with something else

5903
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I'm from Alabama

5904
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And the biggest thing in the universe there

5905
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Is the rivalry between the University of Alabama

5906
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
And Auburn University

5907
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
And I know people who will probably be

5908
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Well I want my game this year

5909
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
You know

5910
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And um

5911
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
There's all there is to do

5912
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
In Alabama is college football

5913
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And eat crawdads

5914
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Just saying

5915
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So maybe they could

5916
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I don't know

5917
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Go to church

5918
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It's kind of disappointing but at first I remember

5919
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I thought they were just going to put out a college football game

5920
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
And be like EA Sports college football drop the NCAA

5921
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Thing and just do whatever

5922
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
You would think that they would do something like that

5923
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Where they just make a game anyway but

5924
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I think they have to go through the NCAA

5925
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Yeah

5926
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Well I don't know they

5927
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
For example they didn't ever

5928
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
You know

5929
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
License the

5930
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
You know look and

5931
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
You know names of the players and now they're in this big lawsuit

5932
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Which for example

5933
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
They just settle for 40 million dollars

5934
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
So

5935
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I'll settle for 40 million

5936
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
That's probably why you know they're not doing a college game

5937
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Because you know they got into trouble

5938
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
And there was a whole lawsuit against them for

5939
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Using the likenesses of these different players

5940
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Without actually giving them any sort of compensation

5941
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
For it

5942
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
So now of course you know

5943
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
40 million dollars how exactly it's going to be

5944
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Split up who knows but

5945
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game

5946
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Uh yeah

5947
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
I mean it sucks for the fans you know even though I

5948
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Say like well that isn't really a big deal around these

5949
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Parts I understand there are some and I don't even

5950
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Really play these football games to begin with if it's not

5951
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Like tech mobile but I understand

5952
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Where people would be upset

5953
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
About this and it sucks for you know

5954
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
That group that looks forward to these games

5955
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Every year I wasn't happy

5956
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
When DDR died

5957
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Well all they would have to do is just

5958
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Give up some of their profits I would think

5959
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Couldn't they have just licensed the actual player

5960
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Licenses and

5961
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
You know paid the extra money

5962
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Or you know that would be too

5963
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Uh honest and so they can't do that

5964
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
How much would they have to have paid

5965
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
For all of those individual players

5966
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Versus what they paid out in

5967
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Uh fees for

5968
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
The settlement they do it for Madden

5969
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
So I don't understand why they can't do it for NCAA

5970
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Or even NBA Live

5971
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
They do it for all their other sports games

5972
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
SSG100Matt in our chat room says they could do

5973
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Something like what 2K did to get football back

5974
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I'm sure they'll have something after all remember

5975
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
They did they tried to do NFL Blitz

5976
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
So they could have another type of football

5977
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Game hell they even

5978
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
They even experimented a little with rugby

5979
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
A while back but

5980
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Arena football even so I don't know

5981
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
They could do some more

5982
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
A Puppy Bowl game

5983
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Huh? There was already

5984
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Jerry Rice and Nitus

5985
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Dog football so that's right

5986
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
On the Wii I forgot about that well

5987
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Because it was on the Wii

5988
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin

5989
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
With all the other late Wii games

5990
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Puppy Bowl party I can see Puppy Bowl

5991
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Nintendo get on that

5992
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Mhmm

5993
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
These are uh yeah now that they have this team

5994
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Freed up they could make a Wii U game

5995
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Huh?

5996
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Haha

5997
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yeah alright

5998
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Uh moving on uh here's a game

5999
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000

02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Dark Soccer do you have any interest in this?

6022
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Huh?

6023
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It's gonna be awesome

6024
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Definitely gonna pick it up

6025
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I haven't thought South Park was remotely hilarious

6026
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Since ages ago

6027
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
They I don't know they have their moments

6028
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Here sometimes yeah I have to admit though I haven't

6029
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Watched this trailer so can we take a moment

6030
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
To look at this trailer? I guess

6031
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Is the audio gonna come through here at all?

6032
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Apparently

6033
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
When evil rises

6034
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Don't let the brave prince's keys

6035
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
There is only one

6036
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
The new kid the new kid has a power

6037
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
We have yet to understand

6038
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Who can save us

6039
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Step forward now

6040
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
And fulfill your

6041
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And fulfill your

6042
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
The audio on this is low sorry

6043
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
You have some incredible ability

6044
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
To make friends quickly new kid

6045
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my

6046
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Oh

6047
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,120
Oh yay Mr. Slaves in there

6048
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,120
Mr. Slave has a finishing move

6049
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,120
Where he jumps on one of the enemies

6050
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,120
And it sucks them into his ass

6051
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Yeah it's a pain but

6052
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
This is the kind of stuff you put up with

6053
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Living in a remote little mountain town

6054
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
At least we don't have to deal with traffic

6055
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I don't know

6056
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Here's why okay here's why I'm looking forward

6057
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
To the Stick of Truth because like

6058
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
There really should have been another South Park movie

6059
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I don't think I have ever laughed harder

6060
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
In the theater in my life

6061
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Imaginary fun land or whatever

6062
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
That was like a three episode arc

6063
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Of the show

6064
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
And it wasn't as nearly as fun

6065
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
And it wasn't as nearly as good as the movie

6066
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
So I kind of feel like this is like

6067
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
The next closest thing we're getting

6068
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
To like a new movie

6069
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
And that was all in game

6070
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And it looks just like the actual

6071
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
The actual show so

6072
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
It'll be pretty sweet

6073
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Alright well

6074
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
We would be usually moving on

6075
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
To the mailbag at this point

6076
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Except we got Jack and Shit

6077
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And Jack left town

6078
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
So let us use

6079
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
This music as a little opportunity

6080
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
To remind y'all that it is the show

6081
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Where every gamer has a voice

6082
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
As long as you use it

6083
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Yes but if we can't hear you

6084
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Then you don't get one

6085
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I promise I will

6086
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
At least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on

6087
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Okay? One

6088
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Mailbag all one word

6089
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
That's M-A-I-L

6090
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
B-A-G

6091
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
At

6092
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
OrangeSongsRadio.com

6093
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Word

6094
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Well the dot separates the Orange Songs Radio

6095
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And the com

6096
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Shut up

6097
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Alright

6098
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Bitch you didn't even

6099
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Love you mean it

6100
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Hearts

6101
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Alright so that's it then

6102
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
No emails this week for us to read

6103
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Oh well

6104
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
This next segment will just have to be doubled

6105
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
To make up for the time

6106
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
This is bad

6107
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Here is justice

6108
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Here is punishment

6109
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Here

6110
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
This is fucked up

6111
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
FUs of the week time

6112
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Okay I have a couple

6113
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
FU to the asshole wasp

6114
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Which all wasps are assholes

6115
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
But this one was extra

6116
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Asshole by inviting himself into my car

6117
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
And poking his butt in my finger

6118
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
That was really rude

6119
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
And I'm really allergic

6120
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to them

6121
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
So

6122
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Fuck you wasp

6123
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Fuck all wasps

6124
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
The only good thing they do is eat plant destroying caterpillars

6125
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
That's it

6126
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And there's other bugs that will do that too and birds

6127
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
So fuck them

6128
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
They're

6129
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Also

6130
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
An FU to having certain illusions of

6131
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Mind shattered because I like to think

6132
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Better of my relatives

6133
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And then every so often they'll just

6134
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Say something that's completely dickish

6135
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And rude and

6136
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Racist and homophobic

6137
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And I'm like how did I

6138
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Turn out to be

6139
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Miss liberal socialist

6140
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Free thinker in California

6141
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Coming from that environment

6142
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Really how does that happen?

6143
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Or is it just that I was so overwhelmed with

6144
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
The bullshit that I was like I need

6145
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
To go and flew out of

6146
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Alabama with fire

6147
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Out of my ass or something I don't know

6148
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I just am completely baffled

6149
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
How did this happen?

6150
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And also FU to

6151
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
The bitch that wouldn't let me over

6152
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Even though I signaled for like

6153
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Ages and then every time

6154
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I'd speed up she'd speed up

6155
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
The three people weaving in and out of

6156
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Traffic and the cop that didn't pull any

6157
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Of them over fuck all of them

6158
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Fuck them all and even though it's not

6159
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
A fuck you because I'm PMS

6160
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Today so I'm just completely taking over this whole

6161
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Segment I would like to say

6162
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck

6163
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Eggs was not at

6164
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
What are you doing?

6165
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Just keep going

6166
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Okay well there's a guy who sells duck

6167
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted

6168
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
To buy duck eggs and

6169
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
He wasn't there and I was disappointed

6170
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
But Rachel bought a rabbit

6171
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
A dead rabbit A wascley wabbit

6172
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
A frozen dead rabbit Poor rabbit

6173
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Mmm rabbit's delicious So it was

6174
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Rabbit season and not duck season

6175
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Yes

6176
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Yes

6177
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
It was rabbit season

6178
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Okay sorry this is what I was trying to cue up

6179
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Since you're having an extra angsty week Dark

6180
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Sakura

6181
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Yoo hoo

6182
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It's the PMS

6183
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
March

6184
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Well I am legit

6185
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
PMS-ing so F you

6186
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Two cramps TMI

6187
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
You know what I don't care

6188
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Okay guys in the universe

6189
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Women get cramps

6190
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
We get bitchy

6191
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Fucking deal with it

6192
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Don't use it as an excuse for every time we get bitchy

6193
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
My brain has a cramp now

6194
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Good

6195
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Good

6196
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Now you know a degree of my suffering

6197
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
My job has been done

6198
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Alright Loki

6199
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Uh F you too

6200
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Thanks to YouTube's content ID service

6201
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Which is so fantastic

6202
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
That they- Hey did you know that you're using

6203
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Licensed music in your stuff

6204
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Accept this copyright claim

6205
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Or deny it

6206
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Or contest it I will choose option 3

6207
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Do nothing is what I will do

6208
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
But it's great though because on one of the

6209
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Videos I did get that on

6210
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Or that flag on

6211
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Was one of the ones I used an audio swap

6212
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Thanks to YouTube You know YouTube allows you to

6213
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve

6214
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Yeah I know it's licensed music because

6215
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
You told me to use that music

6216
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Instead of the licensed music

6217
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
They had in that before

6218
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Our pal Travis from understation live

6219
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Unfortunately deals with this a lot

6220
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Like if he

6221
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Even uses like a little bit of a song

6222
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
In his like hour and a half long

6223
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Understation live that goes up on YouTube

6224
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
They flag it that's why he had to change the intro

6225
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Of the show and I'm like come on

6226
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
It's ridiculous

6227
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It's ridiculous and they scam that

6228
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
So what would they do? They scan all these videos

6229
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And they just send it to these music people

6230
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
So that they can just complain out

6231
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
What they should do is just have a service that

6232
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
You know if these lawyers

6233
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Or whoever find these videos that infringe

6234
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Upon it then yes they can do a copyright thing

6235
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
The thing is I don't believe the copyright

6236
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
That

6237
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Content ID thing is actually

6238
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
A copyright claim by them

6239
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
But it does sometimes block it

6240
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
From mobile apps and stuff like I tried watching

6241
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
My video on a mobile app and

6242
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
You can't see it

6243
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that

6244
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Because YouTube pulled one of his videos

6245
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Where he was using a copyrighted thing

6246
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
But it was under fair use

6247
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
And he's like I'm a copyright lawyer

6248
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
This was fair for me to do

6249
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
So he's suing YouTube

6250
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
It's a real pain in the ass

6251
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Seriously

6252
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Why should we keep catering to these media companies

6253
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
And stuff I mean the stuff that people are doing

6254
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
On YouTube for the most part is pretty harmless

6255
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
And they're just making it fucking difficult

6256
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
For everybody

6257
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
That's it that's all I've got

6258
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
So I don't know

6259
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Also

6260
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I'm a pretty sure F you for

6261
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Trying to figure out how to make this case for my

6262
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard

6263
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
And I'm thinking I may need to do

6264
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Vacuum forming plastic which is

6265
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig

6266
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
To cook it basically

6267
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I have to build an oven and then

6268
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff so

6269
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Alright that's all I got

6270
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
My F you of the week just goes to the

6271
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Fact that there's a show in two weeks

6272
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Even though it'll be great I'm just like

6273
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Stress

6274
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Ah

6275
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
But you know that'll pass like things

6276
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Usually do

6277
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Alright let's go back to

6278
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
A few more news stories for you guys

6279
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Before we open up the Skype line

6280
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Loki

6281
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Alright so

6282
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
We know that Sony is preparing their Gaikai

6283
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Service for the Playstation 4 to

6284
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Stream older Playstation

6285
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Games to the console since they don't

6286
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Have any sort of backwards compatibility

6287
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
That's hardware based

6288
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
But they're saying that hey you know what

6289
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
We can actually use this to stream these games

6290
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
To other consoles or other

6291
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Devices like PCs

6292
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones

6293
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Tablets so

6294
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
You know their ultimate goal

6295
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Is to be able to stream those

6296
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Things to other devices

6297
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
It'd be kind of funny if you could play a

6298
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Playstation 4 game with an Xbox One

6299
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
If they had some sort of website or something

6300
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
You can go to the stream this stuff

6301
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
That would just be

6302
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Ridiculous

6303
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through

6304
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
The Xbox One's HDMI

6305
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
In

6306
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Create some sort of black hole of death

6307
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
With that

6308
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
I don't know

6309
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
It'll be neat but once again we'll have to see

6310
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
How this Gaikai service works once it

6311
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Does launch next year for at least

6312
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
America

6313
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
We can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy

6314
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Indeed

6315
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Indeed

6316
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Alright one more story for you guys and we'll open up the

6317
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Skyline and this is about actually I think

6318
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show but that's alright

6319
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I'll recap it for y'all

6320
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Anyway this is of course

6321
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Out of Orlando, Florida

6322
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Only in Florida people

6323
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Only in Florida

6324
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
A nine year old boy made a court appearance

6325
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
On school weapon charges

6326
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
And was sentenced to home confinement

6327
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Officials said that the boy

6328
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Brought multiple weapons to the school

6329
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
At Hunter's Creek Wednesday

6330
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And of course this is

6331
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Going to tie into video games eventually folks

6332
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Bear with me here

6333
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Officer searched the bag and found the handgun

6334
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Six bullets, a steak knife and a sledge hammer

6335
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
The guns all came from the father's home

6336
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
And the boy is ordered to

6337
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Home confinement and said the parents

6338
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Need to keep any and all weapons away from him

6339
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
The boy's father

6340
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Said he was playing a character

6341
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
He learned from a video game

6342
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Of course he was

6343
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Let's see

6344
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
The nine year old boy told three friends before school

6345
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
That he had the weapons

6346
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Those three reported the information to a school resource officer

6347
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Who found the student and isolated him

6348
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
School officials said

6349
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Protocols were followed and authorities were called

6350
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
In to investigate

6351
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Now nowhere in this original story does it say what the game

6352
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Actually was that he was trying to emulate

6353
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
But it was Minecraft

6354
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Yes

6355
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Minecraft

6356
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Not Grand Theft Auto people

6357
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Minecraft

6358
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game

6359
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
And there really is no story to Minecraft

6360
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Aside from there's a guy named Steve

6361
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
And there's zombies

6362
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I mean so

6363
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Yeah I don't know

6364
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
It's

6365
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
It's dumb

6366
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
And there's no guns even in that

6367
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
And I like how the boy's father

6368
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Oh he's just

6369
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
He's just pretending

6370
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
He's pretending to be in the game

6371
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Not oh why do I have all these guns available

6372
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
So my nine year old can pick up a gun

6373
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
You know and bring it to school

6374
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Yeah PacDeft in the chat room says

6375
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Irresponsible parents

6376
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
We're not to blame it's the video game that teaches them

6377
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
All the bad stuff

6378
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Yeah

6379
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
And even so

6380
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Even if

6381
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
They've allowed their child exposure to the game

6382
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
They've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons

6383
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I want to know why CPS isn't involved

6384
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Okay

6385
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Um let's see

6386
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
SSJ100Matt says please please

6387
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Someone hijack a horse and blame it on

6388
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Barbie's horse adventure

6389
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I'll do it

6390
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Or imagine horses

6391
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Amazing

6392
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club

6393
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
And I'll name it Politary

6394
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
And beat her

6395
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
It's stupid though

6396
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
It's like why do we even allow these excuses to

6397
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
You know that's about as valid

6398
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Excuses like the voices in my head

6399
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Told me to do it

6400
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I mean come on if someone said that you're gonna be like okay that's ridiculous

6401
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
But if like you know

6402
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Oh the video game told them to do it

6403
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Oh well that makes sense

6404
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Seriously what is wrong with people

6405
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
He was a witch

6406
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Okay must be

6407
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Alright

6408
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
That is it for our stories tonight

6409
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Please go to the skype line and open it up

6410
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
1877 game OLR or our username on skype

6411
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call

6412
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight

6413
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Or maybe there's something we missed

6414
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
That you would like to bring up

6415
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain

6416
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
That is

6417
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I think the most recent Milli Vanilli

6418
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Reference I have seen

6419
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
In the last

6420
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I know the first reference to them I've seen

6421
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
In maybe the last five years

6422
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Ever since that guy passed away probably

6423
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
So there you go

6424
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Not even from this country

6425
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
We do have a couple tweets

6426
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Not a whole lot of them but we do have a few

6427
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
From I thought we had some earlier in the week

6428
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I can't remember

6429
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Alright sorry if I missed yours

6430
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Cause it was too early in the week

6431
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
But we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight

6432
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
One of them is that China will be ending

6433
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
A decade long ban on game consoles

6434
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I had no idea that they have this ban in place

6435
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Cause I thought there were like knock off consoles

6436
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
And stuff that they sold in Japan

6437
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Wasn't the V

6438
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Wasn't the V something they sold in China?

6439
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
It was some sort of weird TV

6440
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Console things

6441
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
I don't know what the restrictions were exactly

6442
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Well that in Hong Kong was

6443
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Not under Chinese authority

6444
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
For the longest time

6445
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
And why was the ban in place in China?

6446
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Communism!

6447
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Well there was concern for the effects that games

6448
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Might have on young people

6449
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
But the group was persuaded

6450
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Because gaming on computers

6451
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
And internet cafes has taken off across

6452
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
China or whatever so

6453
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
There will soon be consoles sold

6454
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
As part of new rules in a free trade

6455
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Zone in Shanghai

6456
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Don't know when the consoles will go on sale

6457
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
But there you go so

6458
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I don't know if that means

6459
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Xbox and Playstation 3

6460
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Necessarily but probably some

6461
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Like local gaming devices

6462
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
There

6463
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
They're talking about something called

6464
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Something based on the Xbox

6465
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
But not called the best pad

6466
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
That again from a tweet that

6467
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Tigerclaw sent us

6468
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
And one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls

6469
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
At 1877 Game OLR

6470
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

6471
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
One other article here from Tigerclaw

6472
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Says Nintendo teaming up with

6473
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Tesco for a Wii U

6474
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Fightback

6475
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Ah so

6476
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Let's see, Nintendo said

6477
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
In an interview with MCV that too many people

6478
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Are unaware that the Wii U is a new

6479
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Console and they're going to do a

6480
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Giant campaign to educate people

6481
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Including Wii owners about this console

6482
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
They've booked in-store space at

6483
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Tesco which is in the UK

6484
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Sending out a 5 page leaflet

6485
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
To 300,000 Tesco customers

6486
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
That have bought a Wii but haven't bought another

6487
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Console and give vouchers away

6488
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
That will allow money off of games

6489
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
There will also be TV ads for Mario

6490
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Donkey Kong and Zelda

6491
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Which will run continuously from half term

6492
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Until Christmas

6493
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I think they know, I just think they don't care

6494
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yeah I don't think they really see

6495
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
That must have game, but then there's

6496
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Mario and... I'm still irritated at

6497
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Tesco for selling fresh and easy

6498
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Yeah isn't that crazy?

6499
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed

6500
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
So mad

6501
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Aren't they all closed now though?

6502
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
No I think certain ones

6503
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Alright well that's... The one here is gone

6504
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
That's it for Twitter topics, again I'll put

6505
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
One more call out there for calls

6506
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
1877 Game OLR

6507
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call

6508
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Loki do we have any last minute stories?

6509
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
There's just a quick mod

6510
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
That someone's working on

6511
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Right now for Team Fortress 2

6512
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
That you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer

6513
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
That sounds kind of fun

6514
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Yeah it's called Star Fortress

6515
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
And it's in pre-alpha

6516
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
And if you want to check it out

6517
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
It's...

6518
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I think Greyman Gaming

6519
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Is the Steam community

6520
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Group that they have

6521
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
With man of course two ends

6522
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Like Team Fortress game

6523
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
So

6524
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
That's it

6525
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
That's it huh? Slow news week

6526
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Um

6527
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
No calls coming in either

6528
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I don't know

6529
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
What do we do guys?

6530
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Let's have a poker party

6531
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
We're in the show

6532
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Yay forgot... You know what? You know what?

6533
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Pinkberry

6534
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I gotta go get Alan after work

6535
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Someone call

6536
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
One more

6537
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
One more holler out there

6538
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
1877 Game OLR

6539
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6540
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
You know if you're one of those people that doesn't listen to the show live

6541
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
You listen to us on like Stitcher

6542
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Or through iTunes podcast or something else

6543
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Don't forget you still can't interact with the show

6544
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
We do want to hear from you

6545
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
So don't forget to send us emails

6546
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

6547
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Or Twitter tweets help as well

6548
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Looks like someone's going to be trying

6549
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I can't think of anything else video game related

6550
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Except

6551
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Blah

6552
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Hey look

6553
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Oh there it is it's lighting up

6554
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Let's go to the phones

6555
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

6556
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
It is Ron but the one who has come to save the day

6557
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Apparently what's up with that?

6558
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Well what's on your mind Rama?

6559
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Oh you don't want to know

6560
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
But um

6561
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Here's a question I've been meaning to call about

6562
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Let me get your opinions on this

6563
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Now we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes

6564
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
And reboots and stuff like that

6565
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
But this is something they haven't done

6566
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Why is it they haven't taken

6567
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Wario and Waluigi

6568
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
And put them in a game and call it

6569
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Super Wario Brothers

6570
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I'm also surprised that hasn't happened

6571
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
But wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?

6572
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Well they have that Wario Land shake it

6573
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Which was a hand drawn game that looked fantastic

6574
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
And it was pretty fun

6575
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
But no one bought it and it was on the Wii

6576
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends almost

6577
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Who wants to play the bad guy?

6578
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Exactly you know

6579
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Me!

6580
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I want to be the villain

6581
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
And if you think about Wario and Waluigi

6582
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Their abilities are different

6583
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
So the game mechanics would be slightly different

6584
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
But a little bit more fun to play

6585
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
You know what actually on that token

6586
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
If they really wanted to introduce

6587
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
A Wario and Waluigi into a good platformer game

6588
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Why don't they do another one like

6589
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
What we got a Super Mario 2

6590
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:15,000
With Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi

6591
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
I like the sound of that

6592
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Nintendo call me

6593
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
We'll talk

6594
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Your people can call me and pay me

6595
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
What other dream Nintendo games do you have

6596
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Rama?

6597
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
That was the only one

6598
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I don't know it just popped in my head

6599
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
They have

6600
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Wario series of games

6601
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
I guess at the time I was thinking about

6602
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
One of my favorite Game Boy games

6603
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Which was Super Mario Land 3

6604
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
And I'm like

6605
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Why haven't he done that?

6606
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
You know what I think you just need your own

6607
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Mario is missing game except

6608
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
In the sequel Luigi is like I know

6609
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Exactly

6610
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
And also I really think they should

6611
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Put the Wii U out without the gamepad

6612
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Because honestly

6613
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Maybe three out of the four games

6614
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
That are out on the Wii U doesn't even use

6615
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
The gamepad

6616
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Some of them use it really well though

6617
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Zombie U is a great example of a game

6618
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
That's really enhanced for that gamepad

6619
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
So

6620
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I like the gamepad but

6621
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Honest to god

6622
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
For me the gamepad

6623
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
And all that thing that's less of a concern

6624
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Than I still feel there's a lot of

6625
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Clunky shit on Nintendo's online

6626
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
And although I like

6627
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Miiverse I don't think it's

6628
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Particularly convenient it's kind of

6629
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Slow and the internet on Nintendo's system

6630
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Can still be clunky

6631
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
I just still feel like where Nintendo

6632
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Is going online isn't really

6633
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Like where they need to be

6634
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
And I just you know I still remain really

6635
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Irritated that Virtual Console

6636
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Isn't

6637
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
What we ought to see on a modern gaming

6638
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Console you know what I mean

6639
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Exactly

6640
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
So but those are just you know

6641
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
What do I know I still have a Wii U

6642
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
And you know there are the games I do have on it

6643
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
I enjoy and I know I will like the

6644
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
New Mario game and I know I'll love the new

6645
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Mario Kart and you know what whatever they continue

6646
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
To do in 2014 that will you know

6647
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Justify owning the system but

6648
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
It is a little frustrating to see all the third parties

6649
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Abandoning ship I just I think a lot of them

6650
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Are being dicks

6651
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
You know you're

6652
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Right cause even though the Wii U isn't

6653
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
As powerful I mean

6654
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
You can get somebody else to take like a top tier

6655
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Title and shove it into that

6656
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Little hardware and somehow make it work

6657
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
They make shitty little

6658
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Computers for kids that will play

6659
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Games and I see ports of games

6660
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
From big companies that end

6661
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Up on these things so

6662
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
LeapFrog is just a little device

6663
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
That's powered by

6664
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Flash that's a Shockwave

6665
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Flash Console

6666
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Alrighty well Rama if that's it

6667
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I'm gonna let you go and see if anybody else wants to call

6668
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Awesome. Alright have a good one buddy

6669
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
You too. Alright bye bye now

6670
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Alright

6671
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else

6672
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Wants to call in 1877 Game OLR

6673
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Or username on Skype

6674
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

6675
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I just I just considered something

6676
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
During that phone call so I was asking

6677
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Ikuma-san if he'd clear it up for me

6678
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Yeah

6679
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Waluigi I wonder if it would be

6680
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
If it's supposed to be the name as a pun

6681
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
For Warui which is bad

6682
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Probably

6683
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Probably

6684
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I would think that the wa part and Wario

6685
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
And Waluigi definitely would

6686
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Have to do with things being bad

6687
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
There's a lot of little puns that don't always

6688
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Necessarily transfer over

6689
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
But anyway let's go to the phones

6690
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Cause we got another call coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

6691
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Who's this?

6692
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Obi Wan Jibroni calling from the

6693
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
United Kingdom

6694
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Oh my gosh

6695
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
You are up late sir

6696
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
I love your icon

6697
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Thank you very much

6698
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Also I want to say numero uno

6699
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
On the leaderboard

6700
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Look at you yeah

6701
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
You and Tigerclaw fighting to the death

6702
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
On the VOG network leaderboards

6703
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Well you know what Sky I heard Tigerclaw

6704
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Likes being on top and that's okay

6705
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I think that was a little bit

6706
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
That was a little bit of shade throwing here live

6707
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
At OrangeLoungeRadio

6708
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
All I can say is that Bobby and I are also tossing around

6709
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Some ideas to make the VOG game

6710
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Just a little bit sweeter in the future

6711
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
But that's all I'll say for now

6712
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Awesome

6713
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Yeah my max has told me it's five

6714
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Hours

6715
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
So what's on your mind buddy?

6716
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Well you know

6717
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
There's been a lot of free to play

6718
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Games out there lately

6719
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
There's been more free to play games than

6720
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
They've fucked you know

6721
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
So

6722
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I think this is a great thing because I'm 35 years old

6723
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Old gamer

6724
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Not that old

6725
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
You're not that old

6726
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I'm older

6727
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
You're a young lady

6728
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Oh I love you

6729
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I love you too

6730
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
So

6731
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
As we get older

6732
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
As older gamers

6733
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I think we become more cheap

6734
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I mean

6735
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
The 2DS

6736
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
That's cool to me because

6737
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
It's going to be cheap

6738
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
It kind of looks kind of shitty

6739
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
But I mean

6740
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
The price

6741
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
I think is going to appeal to a lot of older people

6742
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
For cheap people

6743
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Like myself

6744
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I've got a 3DS at the minute

6745
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
The original one

6746
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I've got a lot of friends

6747
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Who would be into that

6748
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
The 2DS

6749
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Just because they don't want to spend the money

6750
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
On the regular 3DS

6751
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
But

6752
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
I went off on a tangent

6753
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
But yeah

6754
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Free to play is what I was going to mention

6755
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Sorry

6756
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
This is my first time calling you guys

6757
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
And as they say your first time is

6758
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
That's alright

6759
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
We'll go easy on you on your first time

6760
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
The first time is a little rough

6761
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train

6762
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
We're just all sitting here listening to your accent

6763
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
So by all means talk away

6764
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
And for the record I have several friends who've

6765
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason

6766
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Especially one of them that has problems with 3D

6767
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
So just saying

6768
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Yeah exactly

6769
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
And if anyone's out there

6770
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
If I've been to my accent and whatever

6771
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Feel free to let me know on Twitter

6772
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Or the comments on VOG

6773
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
So free to play games

6774
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Do you play any of them?

6775
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Oh yeah

6776
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I've been pimping the shit

6777
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Out of Tekken Revolution

6778
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
That's right

6779
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
That was your comment that got me to play that game

6780
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Yeah I've been pimping the crap out of it

6781
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
And yeah I love it

6782
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
And I don't know if you've played

6783
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
The latest one

6784
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Of course

6785
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Is it Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate

6786
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Call of Fighters or some shit

6787
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
I saw that but I haven't played it

6788
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
But I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one

6789
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Yeah yeah

6790
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Because I'm a huge fighting game fan

6791
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
But the Dead or Alive one is kind of cool

6792
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
It's free gigs I will say that

6793
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
But it doesn't have

6794
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
The token system

6795
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
So you can play how much you want

6796
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
It's one of those games where

6797
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
If you want the story part of it

6798
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
You've got to pay for it

6799
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
So it's kind of like one of those games where

6800
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
It unlocks

6801
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Pay to unlock is what I mean

6802
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Yeah but it's cool

6803
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I mean you can play online too

6804
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
So that's kind of fun

6805
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
You don't have to pay to unlock

6806
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Booby mechanics though do you

6807
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Because it is Dead or Alive

6808
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I'm not sure

6809
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Tekken Revolution's

6810
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Kind of been taking over

6811
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I think

6812
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Pay to unlock is better

6813
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
When you have the expectation that it's going to be

6814
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Pay to unlock

6815
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Instead of just

6816
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Oh well we have this DLC

6817
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
No you just gave us a code

6818
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Yeah at least it's not double dipping

6819
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Yeah when you know that you've got to unlock it

6820
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Pay a little bit more then I think it lessens the blow

6821
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Yeah

6822
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
And I think the story portion

6823
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Of that Dead or Alive is kind of expensive

6824
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
So you might as well just go out

6825
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
And buy the full game

6826
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Also I wanted to mention

6827
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
That Ridge Racer game

6828
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever

6829
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
That's kind of

6830
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
It's okay but like

6831
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I said in one of the comments before

6832
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I said when you crash

6833
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
On the game it's like it's not game over

6834
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
But you can keep carrying on playing

6835
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
It's okay

6836
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
But you know with that game

6837
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Every time I put it up now

6838
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
It says server error

6839
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
And I know you guys love this word

6840
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
It's a beta

6841
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Or a beta wherever you live

6842
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
We say beta obviously

6843
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
I've heard beta

6844
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Yeah

6845
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
This is okay it's not traditional Ridge Racer

6846
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
In my opinion so I can't hear it

6847
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
But it does have trophies

6848
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
I keep forgetting there really are

6849
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
A ton of free to play options on PlayStation

6850
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Right now

6851
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
You mentioned one last week Rob called

6852
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
You played a pinball free to play

6853
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
That was called pinball stick

6854
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
I was shouting at my pinball stick

6855
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
I mentioned it again earlier tonight

6856
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Pinball is stick or something like that

6857
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah I mentioned it again tonight

6858
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
It's free

6859
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Hey

6860
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Yeah free is good

6861
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
I mean you know

6862
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
You gotta pay for handjobs or whatever these days

6863
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
But I mean free

6864
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Free is good love it

6865
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
I wish tech and stuff

6866
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
On the Dead or Alive game was on

6867
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Xbox

6868
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
But probably not gonna happen

6869
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
But PS3 is okay I like the controller

6870
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
I'm the minority who

6871
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Likes the PS3 controller

6872
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
I love the PS3 controller

6873
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Need I remind everyone that Yaris

6874
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
Was also free

6875
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Brad from

6876
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe

6877
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Is the best free to play on PS3

6878
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
He's our DC fanboy

6879
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
As far as MMOs go

6880
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
It's way better than that free realms

6881
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Marvel Heroes is pretty good for

6882
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Steam

6883
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
But it's Marvel and there's Jessica Jones in it

6884
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
And I'm happy

6885
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I did try DC Universe

6886
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Took forever to download

6887
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
My PS3 is on wireless

6888
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
It took

6889
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Just like three days

6890
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
It was a terrible experience

6891
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
It took up so much space

6892
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I mean

6893
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
The PS3 is a great system

6894
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
But there's annoyances

6895
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
It's really ridiculous

6896
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy

6897
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Some of my files over to that

6898
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I can copy save games

6899
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
But I'm not getting any space by copying

6900
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Save games to my drive

6901
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Or send over

6902
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Some of these really large games

6903
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
To play off the drive

6904
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Anyway Obi-Wan, Jabroni

6905
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
It's so good to hear from you

6906
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
That icon you have

6907
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
That Dark Soccer loves

6908
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I just want to make sure all the listeners hear this

6909
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
It says keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis

6910
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
With a PlayStation 1 console

6911
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Well thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice

6912
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Yes

6913
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
It's a PlayStation 1 console

6914
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Plugged into the port 2

6915
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
If anyone gets that reference

6916
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Also can I say one quick thing

6917
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Before I go

6918
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection

6919
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Bye bye bye

6920
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
For everyone

6921
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Because I'm a huge MGS fan

6922
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Everyone knows I follow me on Twitter

6923
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Basically

6924
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Please stay super exclusive

6925
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
But holy shit, value for money

6926
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
It's awesome

6927
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
One more thing if that's ok before I go

6928
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Queen Elizabeth

6929
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Can suck my motherfucking nuts

6930
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Because that's why

6931
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Everything is so fucking expensive

6932
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
That's why I'm paying $429

6933
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
For an Xbox One

6934
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
We need to all just move to our own island

6935
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
And call it fuck everyone else

6936
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
We are the island nation of awesome

6937
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Fuck the rest of you

6938
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
This is probably the only

6939
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Internet video gaming show where people will call in

6940
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
To tell off the Queen of England

6941
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Alright

6942
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Have a good one my friend

6943
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Bye

6944
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
That was a great call

6945
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I love hearing from the overseas people

6946
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
It's great

6947
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
You are up way early or late

6948
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
I have a feeling he's up early

6949
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Because he missed me talking about the pinball game

6950
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
He's 8 hours ahead of us

6951
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
I'm going to close up

6952
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Skype

6953
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I know Act F was trying to ring in

6954
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
But I think he was just trying to be nice

6955
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
I'm going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show

6956
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
I'm out of here for the night

6957
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts

6958
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
I just want to say once again

6959
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Thank you so much for tuning into

6960
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
And supporting independent podcasting

6961
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio

6962
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
We've been doing this a very long time

6963
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
We don't ask for your money

6964
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Once in a while a charity thing we might ask for your money

6965
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
But I'll take it for free

6966
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
But we do ask you to help spread the word

6967
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Tell a friend or five about the show

6968
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

6969
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
And I do see some of you guys doing that

6970
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
I hear some of our other indie podcast folks

6971
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Saying nice words

6972
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
And I just want to let you know we so appreciate you guys

6973
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you

6974
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
For your support

6975
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Which really keeps the fire

6976
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
For us to do this show for 11

6977
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Plus years going

6978
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
You know what? I'm going to make my

6979
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight

6980
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I'm installing WoW

6981
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Oh my gosh

6982
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
You know what reminded me that I still had

6983
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
WoW installed?

6984
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
First

6985
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
You're starting to sound like Gimmet

6986
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Which we'll hear about on Wednesdays Hoard House

6987
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Plug, plug, plug

6988
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
It's already replaced WoW in my heart

6989
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
And besides that I watched the fuckery that was

6990
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
The end of the Orgrimmar thing

6991
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
And fuck that I'm glad I quit

6992
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Alright

6993
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
That is it

6994
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
We're done

6995
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in

6996
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

6997
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

6998
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Hope to see you there

6999
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Sounds good

7000
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
My final thought is Final Fantasy XIV this week

7001
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
End of line, free company

7003

Dark Sakura

7004
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Fucking wasps

7005
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
