1
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, Valve's three announcements have come and gone.

2
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,141
[SPEAKER_01]: What have they revealed that didn't have three in its name?

3
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:23,472
[SPEAKER_01]: We lament over LucasArts Games' loss to the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros.

4
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:25,676
[SPEAKER_01]: roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9.

5
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:33,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there, everybody out there on the internet.

7
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:41,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:48,391
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show.

9
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc., etc.

10
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: With my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,079
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Empress Sakura of Normandy.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a three-hour Dark Sakura love fest.

15
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy.

16
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are.

17
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But here you ain't shit.

18
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:13,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

19
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:13,643
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

20
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:15,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make an announcement.

21
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:15,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

22
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:18,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom.

23
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:20,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Assholes.

24
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:21,966
[SPEAKER_04]: You got stung by one, didn't you?

25
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:22,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did.

26
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:23,146
[SPEAKER_08]: In my car.

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:24,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Benadryl

28
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:47,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're here, and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out, I shouldn't worry.

29
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,799
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since.

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:51,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking assholes.

32
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to Techmaster Loki!

33
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:56,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

34
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Loki, how are you?

35
00:01:58,703 --> 00:01:59,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

36
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?

37
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

38
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:03,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to hear it.

39
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:47,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Games we might be talking about tonight Although oddly, we were kind of looking at things before the show It was a slower of news weeks I know we have some big announcements, especially in the PC universe and so on And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about We'll get to those here before too long But otherwise, kind of a relatively quiet week Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto V still?

40
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it, a billion?

41
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:51,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleventy billion dollars that game's made?

42
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:56,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over a billion I don't know what the exact numbers are right now It's crazy

43
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,417
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot?

44
00:02:58,037 --> 00:02:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

45
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, according to the global VG charts, the top global sellers, obviously both being Grand Theft Auto V, it sold a total of about 17 million copies already.

46
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

47
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:39,747
[SPEAKER_03]: As of the 21st, yeah.

48
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,108
[SPEAKER_03]: That's worldwide, right?

49
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:42,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Billions

50
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,167
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what it is right now.

51
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Billions.

52
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:15,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?

53
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:21,841
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one kid that stole a car or something and shot some people and they said, oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto.

54
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:22,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

55
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'll try to tie it with him.

56
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,305
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's because he's stupid.

57
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:27,686
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll blame it on anything.

58
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:34,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just like there was another one of those kid brings a gun to school or something like that, and they blamed it on Minecraft.

59
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's just seriously, it'll be anything.

60
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

61
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

62
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Food causes murder.

63
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:16,912
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

64
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:27,757
[SPEAKER_08]: If video games really caused a particular action, then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches and wearing cat ears all the time and throwing books at people.

65
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:32,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:41,464
[SPEAKER_03]: If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder, well, we're in for the apocalypse because there's 17 million people out there now that are

67
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Murderers.

68
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:46,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead.

69
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:51,166
[SPEAKER_04]: If any food drives people to murder, it's probably mayonnaise, and that's why I avoid it.

70
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayonnaise is awesome.

71
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,667
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut your whore mouth.

72
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:55,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You murderous woman.

73
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise.

74
00:05:59,228 --> 00:05:59,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Barf.

75
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Barf.

76
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody call the cops, because somebody's about to get killed over mayonnaise.

77
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayonnaise is really good for your hair.

78
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that's good for your hair, why would you eat it?

79
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:09,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you eat shampoo?

80
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:11,240
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

81
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you eat conditioner?

82
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Beer is good for your hair.

83
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:14,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I drink lots of beer.

84
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:15,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well I'd take a bath in beer.

85
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you take a bath in beer?

86
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:18,752
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as I could, no.

87
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:23,694
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because then that would be alcohol abuse, and I just want to put my head in and drink it.

88
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about it on Family Guy today, actually.

89
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:26,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you now?

90
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

91
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:28,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

92
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:35,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, last night while I was playing Final Fantasy, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly, which is like some of the best apple cider ever.

93
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, well, I'm getting dizzy.

94
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I kept trying to go to bed, and then I kept doing more quests.

95
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed.

96
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I was having a very classy weekend.

97
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:50,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday night, Alan and I, we wanted to go to this new restaurant in town, but it was way too crowded.

98
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen, which you know that place.

99
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:53,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We love that place.

100
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Pita Kitchen!

101
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we went by Safeway.

102
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like right by there, right?

103
00:06:56,743 --> 00:07:01,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went by Safeway, and we got a bottle of Barefoot Wine and some Ben & Jerry's.

104
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:06,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And I brought it home, and I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long with my bottle of wine and Ben & Jerry's.

105
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:09,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight.

106
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,091
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you know what's sitting in my fridge at home?

107
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a bottle of apple wine from the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill.

108
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:17,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious.

109
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:18,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I need people to help me drink it.

110
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:21,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself.

111
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:21,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Help you drink liquor.

112
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:22,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that.

113
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

114
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:29,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, moving from our classy weekends to a little bit of a kickoff topic, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

115
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:33,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about this latest hacking project of yours.

116
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've talked about it on the show a little bit in passing.

117
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:37,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

118
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

119
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:00,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And what brand is this?

120
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,150
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an on-lap.

121
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an on-lap.

122
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:07,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what they call it, but I'll show you how nice it looks.

123
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sexy looking, actually.

124
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:13,200
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big looking monitor there.

125
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 13-inch monitor.

126
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:18,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, if I didn't get such a great deal on it, I wouldn't probably be using that.

127
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:21,247
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly are you doing with this?

128
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:30,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm basically building almost like a Wii U tablet, but for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

129
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not talking about an emulator type of thing or anything like that, are you?

130
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,446
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's basically going to be a wireless HDMI, and it'll sync up with...

131
00:08:40,091 --> 00:09:08,311
[SPEAKER_03]: you know whatever I hook up HDMI or whatever I hook up the you know I'm still a little lost tell me tell me like an application how this would work with a game like as you say okay so basically I would hook up I would use this and whatever console I want to play on say like an Xbox 360 you know I'm gonna have controls like you know like you would see on the Wii U gamepad or like the 360 and stuff and

132
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's still something you're going to attach to it as a controller.

133
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's something I'm going to attach to it.

134
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to build a whole new case for it.

135
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's what I'm missing.

136
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what was I going to say?

137
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that, and then on top of that, there's going to be...

138
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:25,476
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

139
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm still running into a slight problem with the PlayStation 3 one.

140
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a little bit more challenging because when you plug that in to charge it off or run it off USB power, it shuts off the wireless radio, I believe.

141
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:04,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller as it does like you're building a portable 360 that works in your house somewhere.

142
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:08,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a second screen because it's basically just pulling whatever signal.

143
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:10,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to.

144
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore because that's sold.

145
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,622
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had another Ouya, I could hook it up to that.

146
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:23,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically anything that has an HDMI out that's compatible with a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 controller.

147
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:24,823
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the why on this?

148
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:28,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, for one, you just like to have these projects and do it because you can't.

149
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because my wife watches the TV a lot, and right now I'm sitting there on my computer monitor and playing games, which is fine.

150
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,486
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'd be more comfortable if I could sit on the couch and just kind of kick back with

151
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:49,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this is something like you could play Grand Theft Auto V in private with that thing in your lap and not have your kid be able to see you shooting hookers on the television.

152
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, he'd be asleep, but yeah, basically.

153
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:59,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but it's still like a way... Or, okay, so the wife can watch, you know, Scandal, and you can... Or Grey's Anatomy.

154
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever it is she watches, yeah.

155
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do that.

156
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:02,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

157
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:03,256
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

158
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to show you real quick.

159
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:05,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, well, let's see if...

160
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,561
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a great example, but here's my computer monitor.

161
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:18,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so since this is radio, basically Loki is holding up this flat, like basically because it's a flat monitor.

162
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:19,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Picture time.

163
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:20,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can do a picture.

164
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it on my Tumblr.

165
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, not all of it.

166
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't weigh like hardly anything.

167
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like maybe a pound.

168
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Firefox Open Touchscreen

169
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

170
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:13,009
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've actually tried it out with an Xbox 360 I have another cable that's not hooked up to this that it converts it to it splits out the audio from the HDMI because you know I don't have any speakers on this thing so I have to build that

171
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?

172
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:29,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another TV, but I just, the problem is, you know, setting up systems and moving them around and stuff, it's just a lot easier for, I don't know, I just want to build this.

173
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:34,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, Brad, this is the very manly man side of Loki, that now it's a thing.

174
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it's become a thing, he will stop at nothing to achieve said thing.

175
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:45,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless there might be like that one little thing that just derails the whole thing and they'll be like, ah, forget it.

176
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:49,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what happened to the building an arcade machine for $100 or whatever that was?

177
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I just lost interest in that.

178
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:51,846
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

179
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because I didn't need another arcade machine.

180
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:58,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two I wasn't using, so why build a third?

181
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:05,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it didn't help that the PC that I got for that was defective, so you can't really...

182
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:07,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get what you pay for.

183
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:08,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

184
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wouldn't power up, you know, go fake.

185
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:19,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I just, I ended up, well, I didn't even really part of the PC, I just threw it away because it was just not working.

186
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it just, I lost interest in that.

187
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:31,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto V, you know, so I'm definitely interested in having a screen I can play that on.

188
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

189
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the online component of Grand Theft Auto V starting soon.

190
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:40,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be absolutely disastrous as far as being able to connect to it.

191
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick plug for the VOG Network crew.

192
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:44,808
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people are in that now?

193
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:45,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 20 at least?

194
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:47,310
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quite a few.

195
00:13:48,531 --> 00:14:05,391
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah the VOG Network crew you can go to you can go to our forums and check out we have a thread on it otherwise you can go to socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network and check it out and we're seeing right now how many people we have in there

196
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,333
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 members, yeah.

197
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even promoted Bobby.

198
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:11,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.

199
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby is now promoted to Commissioner.

200
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner Bobby.

201
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:16,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

202
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:17,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll appreciate that.

203
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:24,761
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'm hoping, but I don't know how it's going to work, is I'm going to be playing on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

204
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,782
[SPEAKER_03]: All my coworkers have the PS3 version.

205
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:27,742
[SPEAKER_03]: They want me to play on that.

206
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:31,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hope that my progress moves with both.

207
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:32,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's in the cloud?

208
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:32,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

209
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they say it's in the cloud and stuff.

210
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:41,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say that when the PlayStation 4 version comes along that your multiplayer information goes along with that.

211
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just don't know how exactly that works.

212
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:49,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have special editions and stuff you could have gotten for one or the other system.

213
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:51,678
[SPEAKER_03]: They add different perks for your characters.

214
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:55,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think I can save my character on PlayStation 3 and then transfer it over.

215
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It may just do my stats and that's about it.

216
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,244
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

217
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll check it out, I guess.

218
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:06,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, good luck with this new project of yours.

219
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,296
[SPEAKER_04]: How long do you think it's going to take you to finish?

220
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:23,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm just testing everything as I go along, so I'm getting the wireless HDMI stuff on Wednesday, and then the hardest part is going to be making the case for it, because, yeah, how do you do that?

221
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:35,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, also, I have to get a battery to run everything, which I figured out I need a 12-volt battery, then I'm going to use a step-down to drop it to 5 volts so that I can get more amps out of it, because...

222
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:41,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically going to be powering about four or five USB powered things.

223
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:47,314
[SPEAKER_03]: The two controllers because there's going to be the internals for DualShock 3 and Xbox 360 controllers.

224
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to wire to both of those.

225
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:53,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also the monitor and then the wireless HDMI.

226
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's four things and I think there's something else I'm forgetting.

227
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,099
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe in you.

228
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe in you.

229
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get it.

230
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, this monitor's pretty cool.

231
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:06,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a nice little thing.

232
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a tablet.

233
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks expensive.

234
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:10,822
$35.

235
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,703
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how much of a steal I got that for.

236
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally they go for about $250.

237
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Where at?

238
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay.

239
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:23,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of eBay, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week, how much did your Ouya go for on eBay?

240
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:23,726
$80.

241
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:24,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

242
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:25,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.

243
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering you paid, what, $90 for it?

244
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:29,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 99.

245
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:31,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And 80 bucks, that's not bad.

246
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:41,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, funny enough, actually Saints Row 4, I sold my Xbox 360 copy of that because I have it on PC and I don't really play the 360 version.

247
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That went for $14.

248
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was a little disappointed on that.

249
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,151
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, yeah, whatever.

250
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have bought that for more.

251
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

252
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,092
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much counterfeit shit on eBay of new games.

253
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:50,992
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be really careful.

254
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:54,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember a couple years ago when Alan got me that Child of Eden that came from China?

255
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:54,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

256
00:16:54,893 --> 00:17:03,286
[SPEAKER_04]: and it wasn't even like... Like, we opened it and the box was like Assassin's Creed and it was very clearly a burned disc and it was a piece of garbage and he, like, he...

257
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing?

258
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Salad?

259
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:35,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Salad the game.

260
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom?

261
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:38,909
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

262
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually legit eating a salad.

263
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV.

264
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,294
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:07,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fate parties.

266
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: If you actually shout out and say, looking for fate party, you'll get invited, and then you guys all, any contributions are pooled.

267
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get more golds that way.

268
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a trick people use in leveling.

269
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I just ignore everybody.

270
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,397
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't exist in my mental universe.

271
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do enough side quests and other things to level.

272
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I hit it, obviously, while I'm drinking.

273
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:35,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing, of course.

274
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really been playing much of anything else.

275
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:41,949
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, I'm stupidly addicted to IOS Bejeweled.

276
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:43,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

277
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just fun.

278
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice little time waster.

279
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:49,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've actually gotten pretty good at the Diamond Mine.

280
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:50,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good potty game.

281
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually is a really good potty game.

282
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,734
[SPEAKER_08]: My iPhone has changed the way I use the bathroom, Rob.

283
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,355
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a shirt that says that, and I want it.

284
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:10,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dan beat GTA V, so I've now been randomly going in there and hearing him doing some of the other side missions, so it's been pretty funny.

285
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not really interested in playing yourself?

286
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

287
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... You know what?

288
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:18,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care how good a game is.

289
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:22,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no tolerance for misogyny.

290
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have also, like, just some interest in it, you know?

291
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I have zero interest in it.

292
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:39,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if it was, you know... I want to do, like, a lady Grand Theft Auto where it's just this hardcore, you know, woman tearing down the patriarchy.

293
00:19:40,680 --> 00:20:05,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Play Saints Row, because you can kind of do it Saints Row 2 Saints Row 2, not the other ones No, but I really have no interest in I hate to say I have no interest in the culture Because clearly I have an interest in various aspects of culture But it's not something that appeals to me So, I don't really care about it Fair enough, all right

294
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:11,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go in and watch Dan play for a little bit, and I'm like, I'll just roll my eyes and go, really?

295
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, oh my god, I have to tell you what happened the other day.

296
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:24,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I was pumping gas, and this guy comes up and says, you know, one of the, can we do your windshield thing fluid, you know, so that they're trying to sell you something?

297
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, that's okay, I'm not interested.

298
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:29,412
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, oh, well, I hope you have a better rest of your day.

299
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:32,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I got so mad, I said, would you have asked me that if I was a man?

300
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, uh...

301
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:36,696
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm like, I thought not.

302
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:41,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it was like, God, I hate people.

303
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,821
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I don't know.

304
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a little bit hypersensitive.

305
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,924
[SPEAKER_04]: What in the hell does that have to do with games?

306
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:57,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm just saying that I've been so hypersensitive lately and just really pissed off at everything, especially after talking with my mother, that I think I would vomit all over GTA 5 at this point in a feminist rage.

307
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You're missing the point.

308
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, if you're gonna vomit all over GTA 5, it's a story that has guys in it.

309
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so what?

310
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:09,063
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a fucking female lead.

311
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:10,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo-hoo.

312
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:11,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it.

313
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:12,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

314
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody needs to get over it.

315
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:18,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see where... Well, here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto.

316
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:20,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care that it has it, I just don't have to play it.

317
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It pushes the envelope as art does, right?

318
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games are art, right?

319
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:28,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And Grand Theft Auto definitely pushes the envelope in a lot of ways.

320
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:37,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, Grand Theft Auto and everything that's in it, again, I don't put a game like Grand Theft Auto on any different platform than I put movies.

321
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And Grand Theft Auto to me is just one of those like,

322
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:43,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Brozy action movies that are out there and exist.

323
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's definitely an audience for it.

324
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those movies really do well.

325
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some people that just aren't really interested in it.

326
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, I bet Loki wouldn't be caught dead watching The Notebook.

327
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already seen it.

328
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:58,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen it and I don't care to see it.

329
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:02,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's a genre that I am not into.

330
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:08,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it had more things that I think would appeal to me as a player, then I might give it a chance.

331
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:12,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I tried Saints Row 3, or the third, or whatever the fuck it was.

332
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:13,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't very fun.

333
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So what exactly about Mass Effect 3 made for a good game versus Grand Theft Auto V?

334
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:47,471
[SPEAKER_03]: well first of all it actually told a very solid story there was very little misogyny in it but you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 5 so you have no fucking clue what the story is like I've actually sat and watched Dan play through it as we discussed before the show there's a great story in fact three stories throughout the entire campaign of it I just don't understand how people can get off saying that there's not a good story in that I'm not saying the story isn't good I'm just saying it doesn't appeal to me

335
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you're blaming it.

336
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:53,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying that it doesn't have a good story and Mass Effect 3 has a great story.

337
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say it didn't have a good story.

338
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:56,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it doesn't appeal to me.

339
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:03,010
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a difference between something being good on its own and not being something that I'm into.

340
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:08,855
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, for example, Miss Saigon, the play.

341
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:09,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Great story.

342
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:11,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care for the play.

343
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: um Chicago great movie great story I hate everybody in it I don't I've seen it once I don't care to see it again uh Breaking Bad just won an Emmy and I think we're going up against the finale tonight and I'm sure it's a great show and I hate that show I'll get around to it someday and I'm sure it's a good show but I just I'd rather do other stuff right now but

344
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:48,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anything... That's kind of where I see it, is that it's like, alright, so Breaking Bad's winning all these awards, and I'm sure it's a great show, I'm not gonna sit here and knock the show, but it's just like, ain't nobody got time for that right now, for me.

345
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's another example, okay?

346
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a bajillion friends that are into Buffy.

347
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:59,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love Joss, because he can tell a really good story, he really gets people into it, but I am not the biggest Buffy fan.

348
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:03,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few episodes that I like to watch, I really don't care for the series as a whole.

349
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:04,219
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

350
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:06,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.

351
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:10,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Something can be good on its own merits, but if it's not your thing, you don't have to watch it.

352
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:13,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like mayonnaise.

353
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I really hate mayonnaise.

354
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:17,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it is like mayonnaise.

355
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:24,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayonnaise has very good culinary applications, but if you're not into it, you're not into it.

356
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I like boobs.

357
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:28,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Some girls don't like boobs.

358
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Not their thing.

359
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Self-hating women, I don't understand it.

360
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll leave it at that.

361
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:38,895
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's it for your gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?

362
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:53,078
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto V, and I played a ton of it, and even had the time to shoot some video for a funny little montage thing that's set to the music from the movie Rad.

363
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen your video yet.

364
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weird.

365
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:05,226
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, the movie Rad, because I was looking... I remember what I was doing.

366
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:11,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I was browsing YouTube, and you know how I'll make recommendations for you and stuff.

367
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I watched Play of the Navigator on there one time, and so I recommended Rad and stuff.

368
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that movie is really fucking cheesy, if you've ever seen it.

369
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It is super cheesy, Bob.

370
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:31,026
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a scene at a dance where they're riding BMX bikes to send me an angel.

371
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:33,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, what the hell is going on?

372
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:35,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, okay, that's really funny.

373
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:39,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had Trevor in the game, running for the police, and

374
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

375
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:03,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to try and go viral like Bobby's article did this week?

376
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:04,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it's not going to go viral.

377
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a funny video, so that's all.

378
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I played through that.

379
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:18,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually at the very end of the game, so I'm trying to finish the single player campaign before online starts because I do want to do online.

380
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:25,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I am going to have a few days though because I know online launches on Tuesday, but come on.

381
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,235
[SPEAKER_03]: They even admitted to it.

382
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:38,748
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, listen, we know how online multiplayer launches have been, and trust us, we're going to try to make sure that that's not going to be the same way, but it's probably going to... It'll break.

383
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:39,829
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be broken.

384
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:40,670
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be, you know...

385
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:42,952
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

386
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:15,965
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the strategy behind delaying it and not having it when the game launches?

387
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they purposely want people to spend some time with single player mode first?

388
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:24,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people feel rushed to get into the multiplayer portion.

389
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted you to enjoy the single-player portion of the game first, and they wanted to make sure that everything worked properly.

390
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:42,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff in the world, so I can understand how you need to make sure everything's tested and catch any flaws you may have with your servers and that kind of stuff.

391
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:45,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since they've had trouble with the social club stuff.

392
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster said Social Club was pretty rough in the first week.

393
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Game had issues connecting to it.

394
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:56,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Seg is in our chatroom and says, I'm glad they separated out the release.

395
00:27:57,345 --> 00:28:05,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I could play the single player and get a little bit of a handle of the map and also kind of like how you do heists and just all that stuff.

396
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:12,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to totally 180 the topic on you here, but this conversation is making me think about this, and it's not in our show role tonight, and it is pretty big news.

397
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:18,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Batman game that's coming out this fall in a month or two.

398
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you heard about this.

399
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U version will not have multiplayer.

400
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shocking.

401
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:24,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They've said that before.

402
00:28:24,276 --> 00:28:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo online component just isn't – they don't think there's enough people there, and it's –

403
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:49,858
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I wish they would do that on the PlayStation 3 and the 360 as well.

405
00:28:49,878 --> 00:29:03,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I wish this is an offering we could have for games where not $10 off the price for multiplayer, which is kind of funny to me because isn't this like the inverse but in a more consumer-friendly way of the online pass?

406
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:06,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the online pass was $10, right?

407
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:13,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm thinking like if what I'm reading is correct, if games were $10 cheaper to begin with, we wouldn't have a problem with online passes.

408
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:13,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

409
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:19,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's marketing spin to be honest because it was always going to be $10 cheaper.

410
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:22,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a decision that they made when they put it out.

411
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:30,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it is is that the Wii U stuff doesn't sell as well and so they have to lower the price to make it more attractive to people buying games.

412
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,557
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the true story of it.

413
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:36,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it just doesn't have multiplayer I don't think it would have mattered.

414
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have still put it out at $60 anyways if they thought they could get away with it.

415
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's really what it comes down to is there's not a lot of

416
00:29:43,260 --> 00:30:12,047
[SPEAKER_03]: you know third party games selling on that system so yeah let's mark you know mark it down 10 bucks to try to see if we can move a few more copies it's not but see now they've gotten a lot of PR spin out of it you know so it's very positive and you know that helps them out as well but it's not it's not specifically because multiplayer is missing trust me because shit they omit stuff from all different you know games cross platforms and there's never a price break because of that it's always because the system's just not doing as well

417
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:32,977
[SPEAKER_04]: E3VL in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says pretty sweet deal seeing it also has gamepad support I gotta be honest I'm interested in the new Batman game I don't know how I feel about multiplayer part of me says get it on Playstation 3 but even Arkham City Armored Edition was kind of lame as far as the gamepad support it was pretty much what you had with the PS3 I

418
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:59,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have let that affect my opinion of the new Batman game because well A I haven't played the new one yet B I know the other case you had Arkham City was kind of shoehorned into the Wii U to try to like and that was one of the Wii U's biggest problems is that most of its launch was made up of games that were already out on PlayStation 3 and 360 but with new little frills in it that didn't really I mean it was kind of at that point no one care

419
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unfortunately.

420
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

421
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

422
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I gotta admit, there's a part of me that's kind of like, oh, maybe I'll just get the Wii U version.

423
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:12,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there's another part of me that's like, well, Rob, you never know when you might want to do multiplayer.

424
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You might really like it.

425
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But what multiplayer do they really have?

426
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:19,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's anything like the other games have been, it's just been challenge maps where it's two-player co-op.

427
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not even really that interesting.

428
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:22,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

429
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:23,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

430
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Another recent release, Tomb Raider.

431
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great, fantastic single-player game.

432
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:30,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

433
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really touch the multiplayer.

434
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have missed it if it wasn't there.

435
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:39,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't pick your system based on multiplayer because I don't think that the multiplayer in that game is going to be very deep.

436
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of challenge maps and that's it.

437
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:47,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of tacked on because these studios think that they need to have multiplayer in every game.

438
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why a lot of people think, oh, hey, if the game was $10 cheaper, yeah, I wouldn't really miss the multiplayer in it.

439
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a lot of games, yeah, that's pretty true.

440
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:58,629
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

441
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:04,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't mean to yank away your gaming week, but that just kind of jumped in my mind and I knew it wasn't on the show roll coming up.

442
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:11,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if I may interject, on the Orange Lounge Radio Tumblr, the picture of Loki and the monitor is up.

443
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:11,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got that?

444
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:14,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it just Orange Lounge Radio on one word dot Tumblr dot com?

445
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:15,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

446
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:15,836
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

447
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want the visual, there you go.

448
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:18,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

449
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys work fast.

450
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Go team OLR.

451
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:23,644
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

452
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:24,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Runchon.

453
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

454
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:26,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, back to your gaming week.

455
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:29,045
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was it, yeah, it's just Grand Theft Auto.

456
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think I got around to it.

457
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:35,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have played one thing at Call of Duty this week, but it's been basically just Grand Theft Auto.

458
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and very briefly, because we're going to get into that later, I had to launch up Saints Row 4 on PC in big picture mode, you know.

459
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

460
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I did Rogue Legacy, same reason.

461
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:53,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into my gaming week, so what did I play this week?

462
00:32:53,146 --> 00:33:03,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I played Rogue Legacy, but most of my time, of course, was spent with Final Fantasy XIV, which really shouldn't surprise anybody who's been listening to this show, but I will say this, I hit level 50 this morning.

463
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

464
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:50,161
[SPEAKER_04]: uh 14 still not perfect the gold spam is very irritating and there's some other quality of life things but you know again for a quote I'm using my quotey fingers new MMO because we're just we're forgiving 1.0 and just pretending it never happened but for a new MMO uh it's you know doing quite well so I look forward to the future patches and what else is going to be in the future um so when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy 14 and getting level 50 there um

465
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in my pinball thing again.

466
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:57,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got into this last week, but even more so.

467
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,364
[SPEAKER_04]: More pinball games this week.

468
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just the Zen Pinball on Vita and PlayStation 3.

469
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing more of that.

470
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:10,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I also downloaded Pinball Arcade, which is the... I can't remember who makes that.

471
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Crave published it on Wii, but then they went under.

472
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:16,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Farsight Studios, I think is the name of it?

473
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:16,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's it.

474
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:18,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Farsight Studios does it.

475
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:19,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And they...

476
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:29,332
[SPEAKER_04]: have deals in place with like Stern and Midway or whoever owns that right now to have all those classic tables in the game.

477
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's really cool, there's tons of DLC.

478
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually downloaded Pinbot so I could have that as a table.

479
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:43,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And because Alan told me this is his favorite table of all time, I also downloaded Elvira Scared Stiff, which is available in Pinball Arcade.

480
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have the Star Trek, the next generation pinball machine, which surprised me.

481
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:54,941
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a couple licensed ones where I was like, wow, Twilight Zone is one of the default machines you get when you buy the game.

482
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very surprised with that.

483
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:01,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, I think that, what is the new table that Stern's coming out with?

484
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,145
[SPEAKER_08]: They have Steve Ritchie working on one.

485
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:06,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron is the newest thing I know that they did.

486
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:38,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the rumor is that the Addams Family pinball machine is coming in a future expansion pack.

487
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make me very happy.

488
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:41,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that pinball machine.

489
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:42,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure a lot of people did.

490
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the best performing pinball machines of all time was the Addams Family one.

491
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,183
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, an odd one that I would love to see would be Black Rose.

492
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:52,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be in there.

493
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,586
[SPEAKER_08]: The Lady Pirate game.

494
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:55,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to fire it up and see what they have and what they don't have.

495
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:59,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this so weird playing the virtual tables?

496
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is weird, but, you know, I can't afford the real machines, and it's not always practical to go out, so it's a nice compromise, because, like, I can actually play on the Vita in my bed, you know, which is kind of neat.

497
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:19,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we used to have Pin Mame hooked up that, I mean, it had, like, a tilt function and everything.

498
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:20,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really cool.

499
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh...

500
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:26,457
[SPEAKER_08]: What was I was going to say about it?

501
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:34,226
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, even those big virtual ultracade type ones just were, it's different.

502
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:39,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get into playing it maybe a little casually, but I can't get into playing it kind of hardcore.

503
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to the chat room.

504
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: In chat, SSJ100Matt says, if Haunted House Pinball Table is in there, then this is sold to me.

505
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:48,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

506
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:49,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in there.

507
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the weird thing.

508
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on PlayStation Network.

509
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:55,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only on the iOS, Android, and Mac versions.

510
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,289
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, it's missing from PlayStation Network.

511
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be because it's the newest pack.

512
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:05,912
[SPEAKER_04]: 17 and 18 are the newest packs, and so maybe it's just not there yet.

513
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:09,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't lose hope, but I'm looking at that.

514
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not have the Black Rose, which you were mentioning before.

515
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:14,114
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned another table, too, you were curious about.

516
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:14,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I did?

517
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:15,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought.

518
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

519
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:19,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackbot, maybe?

520
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:21,256
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Bride of Pimbot's there.

521
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:24,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know they referenced Jackbot in the bio for Pimbot.

522
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:28,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackbot is basically Pinbot's table with the bride's rules.

523
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Attack from Mars is there, which was a pretty neat machine.

524
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:34,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Creature from the Black Lagoon.

525
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to read the whole list.

526
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just reading ones that jump out at me.

527
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:42,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Medieval Madness, No Good Gophers.

528
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:43,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've played that before.

529
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:51,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Terminator 2 Judgment Day is another one of those packs that's not on PlayStation, but it's on the iOS.

530
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,780
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course Twilight Zone is there because that's the best.

531
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's one of the default ones you get I think.

532
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:56,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it's not.

533
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:57,184
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I take that back.

534
00:37:57,364 --> 00:37:57,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

535
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:58,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Theater of Magic.

536
00:37:58,786 --> 00:37:59,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Theater of Magic is so good.

537
00:37:59,727 --> 00:37:59,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

538
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there you go.

539
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to take over with pinball talk, but that's literally kind of what I've been playing in the in-between times is the pinball games.

540
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:19,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And also checked out a free-to-play one on PlayStation, which was more like a demo, but it actually has trophies and a full table in it.

541
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:24,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's called Pinballistic is the name of it, and it's more of a head-to-head pinball game.

542
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:28,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like Revenge of the Gator, which, by the way, is one of my all-time favorite Game Boy games.

543
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Revenge of the Gator?

544
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:30,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

545
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:31,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That big old link cable.

546
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so much fun, right?

547
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, didn't that, wasn't that by the same people who eventually made Pokemon Pinball?

548
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive it was, HAL Laboratories.

549
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:43,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it's more like side by side.

550
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:48,540
[SPEAKER_04]: You play with somebody side by side, but it's the NPC.

551
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the computer.

552
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,581
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't play on PlayStation Network, which surprised me.

553
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought for sure it was something you would play online, but it doesn't appear to be that way unless I somehow missed it.

554
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:57,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

555
00:38:58,765 --> 00:38:59,125
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

556
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much why I've been playing my gaming week.

557
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,548
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mage and Pinball.

558
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

559
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Guru said Orange Pinball Radio and I'm like, maybe we need a pinball podcast.

560
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:08,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Some days.

561
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:09,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Some days.

562
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:14,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator in chat also says Steam selection of pinball is sadly kind of limited.

563
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think they have a lot, but there's some old school PC classics.

564
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite PC pinball games was, oh God, now I can't remember the name of it.

565
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:25,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so embarrassed.

566
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the one that was on the Amiga, Pinball Dreams?

567
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:28,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, Pinball Dreams.

568
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had sequels to that, which were amazing.

569
00:39:31,664 --> 00:39:34,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So I remember playing Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.

570
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:36,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those are two great ones.

571
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:40,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I still need a copy of Jackie Crush.

572
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Pinball Dreams was the one I really, really loved.

573
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the one that had the game show?

574
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Fantasies.

575
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that's it.

576
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Pinball Fantasy was my absolute favorite.

577
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Fantasies, excuse me, was my absolute favorite one.

578
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:00,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That was originally on the Amiga in late 1992.

579
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,037
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was on the PC later on.

580
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:03,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was.

581
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:05,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they really make that on the Jaguar?

582
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:06,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

583
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:07,679
[SPEAKER_08]: They put a lot of stuff on Jaguar.

584
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

585
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:09,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Never knew that.

586
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,260
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

587
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball, pinball, pinball.

588
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Some quick FYIs, and then we'll get into gaming news tonight.

589
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:24,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and then we're also on Facebook, of course, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

590
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know of any shows off that we have coming up, probably not until the holiday season, so we do hope you will join us live, if you can, on the Sunday night at some point.

591
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,506
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we ready to get into some gaming news?

592
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a big 1, 2, 3 that I think everybody's talking about right at the top here.

593
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, start us off.

594
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they had three big announcements for Steam this week.

595
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The first being the announcement of SteamOS.

596
00:40:52,222 --> 00:41:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a version of Linux, or I should say it's based off of Linux, that will support Windows and Mac gamers as well.

597
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:09,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I guess, allow you to stream music, TV, and movies and stuff to your TV as well.

598
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, what this is meant for is you put SteamOS on a PC and you can either... Because, you know, not every game is supporting Linux on Steam, so...

599
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:21,089
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

600
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's going to kind of tie in with big picture mode, and they're going to have a beta in this September.

601
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, not this September.

602
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:57,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have a beta soon, I think, for the SteamOS stuff.

603
00:41:59,043 --> 00:42:04,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Asking a question here, I'm sure a lot of gamers are asking, why do I need SteamOS?

604
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:06,326
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it going to make a game better?

605
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:07,647
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly my question.

606
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:08,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

607
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:13,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I would like to know in order for me to want to do that.

608
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:25,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I spend money to build this small PC to hook up to my TV when I can just build a better PC and just hook it up to my TV in the first place and not have to worry about streaming stuff through my network?

609
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:26,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know at that point.

610
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:30,257
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I was asking you because I thought maybe you would have an answer.

611
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:39,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what I think I'm getting, the impression I'm getting from everything I'm reading is that by having a dedicated operating system, it cuts out a lot of the fat.

612
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:47,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Because an operating system like Windows 7, it's a good operating system, but there's a lot of fatty stuff in it that might not necessarily be needed to play games.

613
00:42:48,254 --> 00:42:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be a lot of things under the hood, parts that we don't necessarily need when we're playing a game.

614
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:59,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So SteamOS as an operating system can kind of strip that out and dedicate all the power of the system to the game.

615
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:04,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think you're going to see these improvements that are like, oh my god, it just blows me away.

616
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: But minor performance improvements that would make a game run a little better than necessarily it would in Windows environment or even Mac OS.

617
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:16,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the impression I'm getting.

618
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can imagine if that's the case, if it's running natively on that box, but as far as streaming goes, probably not so much.

619
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:35,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing, I'm sure that later on, when they do come out with this, that maybe more developers will support it, maybe they'll give them some sort of incentive to support SteamOS, but...

620
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, they haven't really detailed what exactly you're getting with SteamOS.

621
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, because SteamOS is going to be free, might be a reason.

622
00:43:49,756 --> 00:43:54,042
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, Linux as it is, is free, and it doesn't seem to have this... Because I think Linux...

623
00:43:55,143 --> 00:44:18,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Linux, because of the environment it grew up in, it was a very kind of like, I don't want to say hacker, but let's say computer enthusiast type of OS that most general people out there that use a personal computer don't understand Linux because you do have to have kind of a basic grasp a lot of times of how to use the inside of a computer which not everybody has a working knowledge of.

624
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:21,189
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other distros of Linux that are a lot more user friendly.

625
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it really puts itself out there for...

626
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,411
[SPEAKER_04]: and soccer moms.

627
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:33,172
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could teach a five-year-old how to use Linux Mint, anyone can learn it.

628
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:35,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well then I'm going to turn it around.

629
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't people using it then if it's so easy?

630
00:44:37,754 --> 00:44:42,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Because basically we've got this Windows versus PC mentality.

631
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:44,295
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all marketing.

632
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:48,277
[SPEAKER_08]: People are looking into what more things are made for.

633
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:49,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like the...

634
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:52,701
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I trying to think of?

635
00:44:52,961 --> 00:45:14,506
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you have your consumer market, when a lot of marketing money is going into saying, hey, you need a PC for blah, blah, blah, and they're getting all of these developers in their pocket, or hey, you need a Mac for this, especially when they were really marketing to artists and, you know, movie editors, that type of thing, you know.

636
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:21,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, you've got, for example, a lot of 3D programs actually run more efficiently in Linux.

637
00:45:21,964 --> 00:45:28,329
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, every build of Maya I've ever used, I've had the easiest time using it in Linux and I've gotten better results.

638
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even Gabe Newell came out and said the best version of Left 4 Dead was in Linux.

639
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's why this kind of conclusion we're getting to here isn't a huge surprise.

640
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:40,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all kind of figured the Steam box would be a Linux box.

641
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We just didn't realize it would be a custom Linux box.

642
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:50,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and Ranma, I disagree about Windows being easier to use than Linux.

643
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I do agree that you get more unified support for Windows.

644
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But with Linux, you have a lot more freedom and a more efficient OS.

645
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:08,104
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, when I was running Mint on my little stupid netbook, it took up two gigabytes of space less than Windows for netbook did.

646
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Freed up a lot of memory.

647
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:35,110
[SPEAKER_08]: and on top of that whenever I wanted to make any tweaks to it all I had to do was upload a kernel was update the kernel that was it I didn't have to go into and with with Linux even with Mint as user-friendly as it is you can go in and do quite a bit to it go in through the root and everything but the easiest way to do that is find someone who's already done the work for you and upgrade the kernel it's fully customizable

648
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:46,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think also now that with SteamOS, they're getting a lot more support from the graphics card developers and stuff, like NVIDIA is working with them on drivers and support for it.

649
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:49,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming ATI is going to probably do the same.

650
00:46:49,748 --> 00:46:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the most important part for right now is because, say, I want a game on Linux.

651
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of drivers out there available for that stuff.

652
00:47:01,913 --> 00:47:05,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now they're working with them to be able to have better support for it.

653
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:08,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the one downside of Linux.

654
00:47:08,396 --> 00:47:17,544
[SPEAKER_08]: However, especially the reason why I liked Mint is because it used a lot of drivers that worked for Ubuntu and Debian.

655
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:21,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really had a very wide range of what I could pick from.

656
00:47:22,648 --> 00:47:35,454
[SPEAKER_08]: and one of the other things I like too is a lot of programs that existed for Linux that have to go through a verified check before you could download them and it had like this download server that you could get almost anything that had been approved.

657
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:41,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You make me want to take my crappy old laptop I'm not really using anymore and just put Linux on it just to kind of play with it.

658
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:44,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing about Linux, you can run it off a flash drive.

659
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:49,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can bring you a Linux Mint Distro if you wanted to try it and run it off a flash drive.

660
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:49,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

661
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Linux is very user-accessible.

662
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:11,504
[SPEAKER_08]: and very user friendly depending on your distro.

663
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:19,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But Windows is what people have pretty much been sort of, you know, led by the leash to learn how to use.

664
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:29,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And I use Windows for most of my stuff because honestly, like for example, for the Adobe Suite, it's optimized a lot better than it used to be.

665
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:33,949
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, most of my games are on Windows.

666
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:34,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But

667
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,074
[SPEAKER_08]: In a heartbeat, I would have a dual boot.

668
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:40,403
[SPEAKER_08]: When I'm ready to reformat my system, I'm dual booting it.

669
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:40,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

670
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:42,803
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's move on.

671
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:57,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of already have touched on this, so let me just formally bring up the topic of the Steam Box, which is now being called the Steam Machine, or Steam Machines, plural, as the case may be, because there's not just one.

672
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:04,152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be multiple forms of these coming out in 2014, according to the Valve announcement, which was the second one they made this week.

673
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:10,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they announced 300 prototype boxes will be available to Steam users for...

674
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

675
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:53,799
[SPEAKER_04]: all right all in all seriousness though uh you can actually go through this series of um like little i don't want to say hoops online but basically little mini achievements online if you want to sign up for this and even get a little bit of steam xp for doing it but one of them is like basically signing an agreement that you know the legal mumbo jumbo that it's still the property of valve and they can ask for it back and if it burns down your house it's not their fault you know type of thing

676
00:49:54,799 --> 00:50:12,507
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you have to have a public profile you have to because if they want people to share the information right it's got to be public and you have to actually play a game in big picture mode and with a controller and so I'm assuming that's also to make sure that somebody can kind of compare contrast I'm thinking it's kind of the

677
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:13,688
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

678
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:47,471
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously these things will be running Steam OS which will be on the Steam machine they are working with a variety of computer parts makers I have a feeling one of them is Alienware because didn't Alienware put some tweets out there about this?

679
00:50:49,052 --> 00:51:02,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember I thought I remember seeing something like that I know they're still having was it that one company that was doing the pistons doing one and maybe Alienware they do a lot of gaming stuff so I wouldn't doubt it but

680
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:28,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean come on at the end of the day though I mean if it's that easy just to just build a box I mean it's not essentially since it's available free I don't see what they can really put together I mean aside from form factor and making something you know proprietary that way but it doesn't have to I don't think you need to have a box that's like the size of you know an Ouya or something like that because because it's going next to your TV I mean

681
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:30,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, look at the size of the Xbox One.

682
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty decent-sized case.

683
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, when you try to get it down that small, that means a lot more specialized parts, and it's going to send the price up a lot more.

684
00:51:38,082 --> 00:51:42,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, I don't know, make just a smaller case, and that's about it.

685
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:48,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says they don't want beta testers.

686
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:49,926
[SPEAKER_04]: They want people promoting the Steam machine.

687
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:53,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what Blizzard's doing with Hearthstone right now, and it's working very well for them.

688
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:59,930
[SPEAKER_04]: PackDev says, it sucks that they're asking for the machine back, but I understand as a prototype they must have it back.

689
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that they're going to make you give it back.

690
00:52:03,272 --> 00:52:06,874
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I kind of highly doubt they will, but they have the right to ask for it back.

691
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:10,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a feeling, PackDev, that's to prevent people from selling it on eBay.

692
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:13,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if they see one of those machines pop up on eBay, they're going to ask for it back.

693
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:20,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think that's what... They have to just put that in there legally, so you can't go and try and sell it.

694
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:21,822
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably what it's for.

695
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:24,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

696
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:30,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Tenkis in our chatroom says, Daft Punk better be getting some royalties for the use of Steam Machine.

697
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:32,270
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it works that way.

698
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because Steam Machine is not a music performance piece.

699
00:52:36,974 --> 00:52:38,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't happen that way.

700
00:52:40,597 --> 00:52:44,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And DC Nate says, I'm pretty sure those machines will be scattered to the winds.

701
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they say they encouraged hacking them open anyway?

702
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:47,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

703
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think hacking's a part of it.

704
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that supposed to be the deal with the Ouya, too, though?

705
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:56,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Ouya, yeah, they promised that, oh, you'd be able to root it from the beginning.

706
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you the instructions to root it.

707
00:52:58,768 --> 00:52:59,729
[SPEAKER_03]: That never happened.

708
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:01,090
[SPEAKER_03]: People figured it out anyways.

709
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:13,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all the more reason, you know, now that all this stuff's coming out, it's kind of making it more and more insignificant, I guess.

710
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:13,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

711
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:15,795
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

712
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:34,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still... You're building a gaming PC.

713
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all of a sudden because SteamOS is on it that it's going to drop the price of parts.

714
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

715
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:46,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very expensive to... You're not going to get a really great gaming PC for $400.

716
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:52,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're going to have to spend a lot of money to be able to build a nice PC.

717
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:59,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But there'll probably be a bargain one for the streaming solution and very few games...

718
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,773
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

719
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:20,051
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

720
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:47,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there have been a few questions in chat about this, and it's about the Steam Controller.

721
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,022
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, it has no D-pad.

722
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:54,204
[SPEAKER_08]: It is all using a touchpad.

723
00:54:56,746 --> 00:55:08,135
[SPEAKER_08]: The trackpads themselves are using haptic feedback, so it's basically something that's going to make it easier for people that are more used to playing FPS games on a PC.

724
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to make it a lot more friendly to use.

725
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:12,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It also has...

726
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:22,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Different shoulder buttons, some face buttons, and three buttons that are below the touchpad.

727
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:31,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they're trying to do is make it basically run just using your thumbs as sort of the instinctive direction.

728
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:38,192
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty neat, and it actually looks like it would be ergonomically comfortable.

729
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:39,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully...

730
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:53,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like they're taking a big cue from, I would even say, some of Sony's design for their PlayStation controllers.

731
00:55:53,721 --> 00:56:01,288
[SPEAKER_08]: The big thing about it is that with having a touchpad, it's trying to ascertain that it will always be supported for whatever game to be played on it.

732
00:56:03,021 --> 00:56:04,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I understand why I need one

733
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:30,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, okay, so yeah, they're trying to do something that goes with the box, but the Xbox 360 controller can play everything on Steam now.

734
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:41,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the other good thing about this, because it's using that double trackpad, is they also have it configurable to where it can be switched for left-handed or right-handedness.

735
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:44,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So it offers a lot more comfort.

736
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:44,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

737
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,669
[SPEAKER_08]: to people who play.

738
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:50,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just trying to bridge the gap between PC and gamepad.

739
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like having mouse controls, I guess, with it.

740
00:56:53,911 --> 00:57:13,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I can't tell by just looking at that if I would like it because, yeah, the haptic feedback would have to be pretty significant as far as making it feel different from trying to play a game on a tablet versus on this thing.

741
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:13,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because

742
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:27,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, at the end of the day, it's basically you're sliding your finger along a pad and you've kind of trained yourself if you're playing video games that you're using an analog stick or directional pad or something, at least console-wise.

743
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's going to be very different.

744
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's going to be a little bit of a learning curve with there.

745
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:40,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did read a review or just some brief comments about it that the developer for Super Meat Boy actually got to try it out.

746
00:57:41,315 --> 00:57:42,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody just posted that in our...

747
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:45,057
[SPEAKER_03]: He liked it.

748
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:48,240
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few gripes about it and stuff.

749
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some latency things that they need to iron out.

750
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:55,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be a whole new learning curve, but it could be good.

751
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:57,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know based on looking at that.

752
00:57:58,378 --> 00:57:59,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Saganar Chatroom.

753
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:00,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me start with GameGuru.

754
00:58:00,899 --> 00:58:04,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Says, Valve needs kiosks without controllers so we can play with it.

755
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much is it going to be?

756
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Because do I really need to buy another controller?

757
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:09,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be another $60 controller?

758
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:11,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And are people really going to support it?

759
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I understand that it's backwards compatible with all these other games that...

760
00:58:16,723 --> 00:58:30,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You can map it to keyboard and stuff, but dude, wouldn't it be a lot easier if they just put out some Steam app or something that, hey, now I can fucking map my gamepad, like my Xbox 360 controller to these older games and stuff.

761
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:32,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they just do that?

762
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, instead of putting out this brand new controller.

763
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on Steam's page right now looking for price information.

764
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:38,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see anything.

765
00:58:38,636 --> 00:58:39,477
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't have it yet.

766
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't find it.

767
00:58:40,897 --> 00:59:07,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Sagan Chat says the controller is attempting to bridge the gap of games needing mouse and keyboard without remaking the game I get that to a point because I think about what this controller would allow me to do I could play Civilization V on my TV essentially with this controller which is going to be a very surreal thing a very mouse and keyboard type of game I'm going to be able to use this controller on that's kind of funky I'm curious to try that see what that's like that could be very cool

768
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:34,663
[SPEAKER_04]: but then I can't help but my brain goes to when we talk about bringing the mouse and keyboard games over to a controller I keep thinking most people don't want that because my head goes to first person shooters like Battlefield or even something like Mass Effect 3 where the people that are on mouse and keyboard are very loyal to mouse and keyboard and don't want the controller but the vice versa is also true you've got some people that swear by the controller and don't want to do the mouse and keyboard that's an age old thing

769
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: as old as the consoles themselves.

770
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:43,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Becky wants to do all the fun customization stuff I've been doing in Mass Effect, but she doesn't want to use her keyboard.

771
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:50,053
[SPEAKER_08]: She wants to keep using her Xbox controller, which doesn't quite work for the third game because they were kind of jerk faces about it.

772
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:51,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It does on an Xbox.

773
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:52,694
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

774
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, I do.

775
00:59:54,695 --> 01:00:00,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is completely stupid because basically the Xbox version is the PC version just with lower textures.

776
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:05,878
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also what people are used to and what they're more comfortable with.

777
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,799
[SPEAKER_08]: She has wrist problems, I have hand problems.

778
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:09,839
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, my keyboard's better.

779
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,360
[SPEAKER_08]: For her, her controller's better.

780
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:19,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I can see why they'd want to have something in between both styles.

781
01:00:20,514 --> 01:00:22,195
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know that it's going to catch on.

782
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:25,519
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it would take a lot of persuasion for it to catch on.

783
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:30,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just worried about the price because that thing has another display in the actual controller that's a touchpad.

784
01:00:31,405 --> 01:00:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so...

785
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:34,594
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

786
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,931
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I want to play with friends, you know, in my living room or something like that?

787
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they even designing it for that?

788
01:01:08,852 --> 01:01:09,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

789
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really strange.

790
01:01:10,953 --> 01:01:14,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask this question and then we're going to move on for time's sake.

791
01:01:14,955 --> 01:01:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've seen this a lot on Twitter and I just kind of wanted to entertain this out there, you know, because this is where every gamer has a voice.

792
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:25,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes I like to kind of see what's the pulse on things out there going on.

793
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:38,726
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of the stuff I see on Twitter says, you know, if Microsoft or Sony had made an announcement this week along these lines, if Sony had rolled out that controller, they'd be getting crucified right now and raked over the coals over it.

794
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:43,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to admit, I don't think I agree with that because I think

795
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:46,871
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot of skepticism behind the Steam Controller, especially.

796
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:51,615
[SPEAKER_04]: There's less skepticism behind SteamOS because it's free.

797
01:01:52,356 --> 01:01:55,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to argue about something that's free and a choice.

798
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:59,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what it is right here, and this is exactly what the issue is.

799
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,222
[SPEAKER_03]: All of this is optional.

800
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:05,806
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still use Steam the way it is right now, and nothing's going to change.

801
01:02:06,246 --> 01:02:07,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can do all this other stuff.

802
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:12,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like if the PlayStation 4 was going to use the Steam Controller exclusively...

803
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Even optionally, I don't think anyone would really buy into it optionally But let's just say that it was And actually, we don't know how it connects It could be Bluetooth and maybe they could support it I mean, who knows But if this was going to be the only controller Then people would be like, well, hold on now I'm used to this controller that I've been playing with for the last three generations And now you're going to totally switch it up on me That's where people flip their shit and stuff And get pissed off at Microsoft and Sony about this kind of thing

804
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:43,031
[SPEAKER_03]: but Steam, this is all new ground for them.

805
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:44,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all optional.

806
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:52,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Steam's not all of a sudden going to just stop working on current PCs unless you buy a Steam box or a Steam machine or whatever you want to call it.

807
01:02:52,596 --> 01:03:00,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's I think why people aren't really necessarily dogging them so much but at the same time I'm not really praising them so much because I don't know anything about any of this.

808
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:05,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So far they haven't demonstrated to me why this is significant to me.

809
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing I don't get about these tweets.

810
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:12,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, there's always going to be fanboys, but there's fanboys in Microsoft and Sony's camps as well, clearly.

811
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:16,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, there's fanboys in Steam's camp that are going to praise anything and everything they do.

812
01:03:16,865 --> 01:03:27,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love Steam, and I love a lot of it, and I'm interested in the Steam OS, and the price is the big thing for me on the Steam machines, but I've got to say, when it comes to the controller, I'm highly skeptical.

813
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess I have to get my hands on one.

814
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they have them at gaming expos, or they have it out there where I can try this, but...

815
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:39,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I am kind of skeptical about the controller and so forth, and that's okay to be a little bit skeptical, right?

816
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:41,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm skeptical about a lot of things.

817
01:03:42,836 --> 01:03:49,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still skeptical about an included Kinect with Xbox One, but we won't tread down that road.

818
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:53,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I get why Microsoft's forcing it, I get it, but I still don't.

819
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:57,870
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I forgot to mention during my game week, I canceled my pre-order for my PlayStation 4.

820
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,170
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

821
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:33,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, they didn't look that different and it didn't look that much more amazing on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One versus the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

822
01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:39,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go on a limb and say there hasn't been a good launch game since Super Mario World.

823
01:04:41,906 --> 01:04:45,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no, that Wii U Mario game is fucking great.

824
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even keep them all straight anymore.

825
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:54,576
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mario game on this console, Super Mario Wii, it was better than the one on the Wii.

826
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:58,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't put my finger on it, but I enjoyed it more than the one on the Wii.

827
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:01,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just the HD, the touchpad, being able to interact with multiplayer.

828
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:02,583
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with it.

829
01:05:02,603 --> 01:05:05,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a decent Mario game, but it's not enough to sell me a system.

830
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:06,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's how I feel too.

831
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:16,773
[SPEAKER_08]: However, you know, I was all over my Super Nintendo because, you know, I got Zelda and I had Mario World and that was all I needed.

832
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would have sold that system?

833
01:05:18,754 --> 01:05:26,759
[SPEAKER_03]: If they never came out with Super Mario Galaxy and launched Super Mario Galaxy with the Wii U, that would have been pretty significant and looked a lot different than what they had out there.

834
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would have been a little bit better than just like another new Super Mario Brothers game, but whatever.

835
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:33,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fine, we've already traded that.

836
01:05:33,164 --> 01:05:34,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's not go down that road.

837
01:05:34,324 --> 01:05:34,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we've,

838
01:05:35,886 --> 01:05:43,353
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah seriously though the CMOS thing and then of course you know everyone's everyone's still hoping for a Half-Life 3 announcement but you know that's never gonna come

839
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:48,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit disappointing that there was no game announcement.

840
01:05:48,392 --> 01:05:56,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to admit, I was one of those people disappointed that they didn't announce any games because the old rule, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

841
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:56,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.

842
01:05:56,534 --> 01:06:01,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that there's a ton of games already in Steam's library, and that's what they're pushing with these Steam machines.

843
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:08,838
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, something to sweeten the pot and that would really just be optimized for SteamOS or something would have been awesome.

844
01:06:09,418 --> 01:06:24,052
[SPEAKER_04]: and it doesn't even have to be Half-Life 3 people if that's long and gone whatever Left 4 Dead 3 or heaven forbid a new IP from Valve or something they gobbled up a while ago and I forgot about would have been great

845
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:42,470
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think there's still time because right now we've gotten the whole they're going to go through the beta testing thing kind of start building the buzz for it and stuff and once you get towards the launch of this new system whatever because I would assume they're treating it like a Steam console so they're going to have console games for it that's I think when we're going to see you know the bombs being dropped about like you know

846
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Source 2, and that kind of stuff.

847
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming with Source 2 you're going to see new games, maybe not necessarily Half-Life 3, but Left 4 Dead 3, and whatever else is going to follow.

848
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:55,152
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, Left 4 Dead 3.

849
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Half-Life 3, though, is still being worked on.

850
01:06:57,773 --> 01:07:06,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably being done on Source 2, and because they don't have anything to talk about Source 2 right now, there's nothing to talk about about Half-Life 3.

851
01:07:07,074 --> 01:07:08,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on with some more stories.

852
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:09,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

853
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so...

854
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:14,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

855
01:07:32,274 --> 01:07:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of weighed more towards the PlayStation 4 versus the Xbox One.

856
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:48,011
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, they're saying that 15% of the people who are surveyed were going to buy an Xbox One compared to 26% who are going to buy a PlayStation 4.

857
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course the younger people were saying that only 27% were under the age of 40 were going to get an Xbox One compared to 41% under the age of 40 that were planning to buy a PlayStation 4.

858
01:08:06,423 --> 01:08:34,736
[SPEAKER_03]: it kind of makes sense to me if you think about it because I don't know I think a lot of people over 40 would still be that hardcore in the gaming I mean that's kind of before you know before a lot of you know that generation I guess you know the people that grew up in the 80s but um yeah so 15 and 26 I mean that doesn't seem that significant to me I don't really know what you know previous generations were like but um

859
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:37,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

860
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:48,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for me and a lot of people I've talked to, it's just when you look at what they have coming out, like you just launched a huge game with Grand Theft Auto V on current generation consoles.

861
01:08:49,491 --> 01:09:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these big games that are coming out for the fourth quarter, the staple stuff aside from the next-gen exclusive first-party titles, you've got Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and Watch Dogs.

862
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:17,724
[SPEAKER_03]: and like Need for Speed and all that stuff those are coming out in current gen as well as next gen so there's not a lot of um they haven't really given you a lot of reasons like okay here's the PlayStation 3 version here's the PlayStation 4 version here's why the PlayStation 4 version is better

863
01:09:18,024 --> 01:09:18,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

864
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:39,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

865
01:09:39,431 --> 01:09:41,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why people aren't that excited right now.

866
01:09:41,613 --> 01:09:57,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, once 2014 hits and we see a lot more next-gen exclusive games or games that look a lot better in next-gen than they do on current-gen, as we start to get that gap a little bit more, then yeah, it might be a little bit more advantageous to buy a next-gen system.

867
01:09:58,507 --> 01:10:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but are people going to crucify the shit out of these consoles like they did the Wii U if the games aren't there right away?

868
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:31,201
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think there are games there right now it's just there's third party games but the thing is I think it's going to be along the lines of like the Xbox 360 launch where you had a lot of titles that didn't look that much better than the Xbox titles there wasn't that huge difference because they're developing for both systems so you were kind of scaled back a little bit on you know the Xbox 360 and they sort of look like you know a little up res or slightly better versions of the original Xbox games I

869
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:32,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie.

870
01:10:32,622 --> 01:10:34,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have this very funny feeling.

871
01:10:35,003 --> 01:10:36,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Call this whatever you want.

872
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:37,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I just call it a funny feeling.

873
01:10:37,944 --> 01:10:39,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been doing this show for a long time.

874
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:45,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I have this funny feeling that Xbox One is going to perform a lot like Wii U. I think it'll do fine during the holiday.

875
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:49,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell enough consoles to justify its existence and so forth.

876
01:10:49,590 --> 01:11:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when the games don't show up in 2014 like they never do during a console's first year, I think the sales of the Xbox One are going to drop off dramatically simply because of price.

877
01:11:01,355 --> 01:11:25,111
[SPEAKER_04]: and so forth and I think uh I think for some reason it's going to be okay and people will be like that's okay Xbox One will still but yet with but the third party developers aren't going to be jumping ship going we're only going to make PlayStation 4 games here's the thing though it's like I have to see how that looks because right now as far as the slate goes everything that's been I haven't really seen any aside from like you know uh Final Fantasy 14 and

878
01:11:26,051 --> 01:11:33,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really seen any PlayStation 4 exclusive titles that weren't first party that were coming out or even vice versa.

879
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:37,126
[SPEAKER_03]: There hasn't been any Xbox One exclusive titles that were third party.

880
01:11:37,206 --> 01:11:40,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all been multi-platform kind of going forward.

881
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if one console completely tanks...

882
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:45,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that could change.

883
01:12:04,463 --> 01:12:05,184
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

884
01:12:18,455 --> 01:12:22,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Random ass tangent because I'm going to totally switch to a different news story here in a minute here.

885
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:28,021
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got to ask this question while we're talking about sales and console wars and all that.

886
01:12:30,382 --> 01:12:34,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to another podcast I enjoy, Video Game Realness.

887
01:12:34,545 --> 01:12:37,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys have all heard that show, but it's a really fun show.

888
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a newer show.

889
01:12:39,248 --> 01:12:43,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And they brought up a point on their last episode that even I kind of didn't realize.

890
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:46,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Japan right now,

891
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:58,872
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 4, not coming out till 2014 Xbox One So what does that mean for the holidays in Japan this year?

892
01:12:59,393 --> 01:13:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U is unopposed

893
01:13:02,054 --> 01:13:04,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Zat, have any bearing on anything?

894
01:13:04,415 --> 01:13:04,895
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

895
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:05,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

896
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:08,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's all about the games.

897
01:13:08,275 --> 01:13:14,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that unless they come out and just really impress, I don't know, is Monster Hunter 4 coming out on Wii U?

898
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just don't think that they're going to wait because they know that it's coming.

899
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but there is a Mario game that anybody who's touched it seems to really enjoy it.

900
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:28,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

901
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I will see.

902
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hopefully.

903
01:13:30,681 --> 01:13:39,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like I hope there's a little bit of an uptick with, you know, the Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, but I don't think that people are treating it like a brand new Zelda game.

904
01:13:39,822 --> 01:13:44,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of like they almost look at it as like an HD remake type thing, which it is.

905
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

906
01:13:46,284 --> 01:13:46,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Jamie.

907
01:13:46,744 --> 01:13:51,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, IkumaJP in chat was saying that there's Vita ads everywhere.

908
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:52,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

909
01:13:52,825 --> 01:14:02,927
[SPEAKER_08]: and the other thing that I was considering too is that I think that maybe Sony and Microsoft are relying on brand loyalty for marketing over here as opposed to having the games out.

910
01:14:04,268 --> 01:14:07,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Microsoft's already starting a push with marketing though.

911
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,029
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting those billboards up and they're getting their ads on TV and so forth.

912
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:15,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure so much about Sony but I know Microsoft's starting that push over here a little bit.

913
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowNextGen in chat says the Wii U has a nice holiday lineup.

914
01:14:20,131 --> 01:14:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario 3D World will move units.

915
01:14:22,752 --> 01:14:27,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really too bad they don't have Mario Kart 8 on deck this year because I really think that's the game.

916
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:28,297
[SPEAKER_04]: That would help.

917
01:14:28,538 --> 01:14:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more so than Mario 3D World.

918
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the game that they need right now.

919
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that and Smash Bros.

920
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:35,144
[SPEAKER_03]: would be pretty strong.

921
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

922
01:14:36,965 --> 01:14:45,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize good games take time and I'm living in a fan-wank world when I say if this holiday had been...

923
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:50,557
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D World, Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2, and Smash Bros.

924
01:14:50,877 --> 01:14:54,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we would not be hearing the death of Nintendo articles right now.

925
01:14:54,859 --> 01:14:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can exclude Bayonetta 2.

926
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not a system seller.

927
01:14:57,561 --> 01:14:58,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still niche.

928
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:01,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's niche, but it's niche in the right way.

929
01:15:01,604 --> 01:15:03,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta 2 will perform like Wonderful 101.

930
01:15:04,306 --> 01:15:05,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It will not do well.

931
01:15:05,566 --> 01:15:10,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It will do okay, because all the niche people that are into Bayonetta will buy it.

932
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,192
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I heard that Bayonetta is actually in that game, too.

933
01:15:14,772 --> 01:15:15,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful 101.

934
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they will buy it, but it's just not going to be that significant because you have to have, you know, the just the regular players, you know, wanting to pick that game up.

935
01:15:26,843 --> 01:15:30,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, regular players will pick up a Mario game, but they won't pick up Bayonetta 2.

936
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:38,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that would... But yeah, those three big Nintendo titles would definitely help.

937
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:46,452
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the wank I just said is not nearly as bad as... God, one of those investor websites where I sometimes wonder, like, has this person ever even played a fucking video game?

938
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:52,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it says that in order for Nintendo to save itself, because, you know, there's no such thing as a 3DS right now.

939
01:15:55,274 --> 01:16:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: in order for Nintendo to save itself they need to sell the Wii U without the gamepad is Nintendo going to be abandoning the gamepad?

940
01:16:03,241 --> 01:16:04,022
[SPEAKER_04]: what an idiot

941
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a person who needs to get his corporate sponsorship out of his ass and actually play the system and live in the real world.

942
01:16:15,994 --> 01:16:16,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this.

943
01:16:17,315 --> 01:16:27,863
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I agree with that to an extent, there is a part of me though that goes, but Wii Fit U, that's not really built around the gamepad.

944
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:33,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii Sports HD, not really built around the gamepad.

945
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:37,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they starting to do away with this?

946
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?

947
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:50,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so, because Mario Kart 8, etc., etc., but could this idiot be onto something?

948
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii U without the gamepad, you think?

949
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Then why not just get a Wii?

950
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:04,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not get a 3DS?

951
01:17:05,069 --> 01:17:10,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happier with my 3DS.

952
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: For the love of God, just do what you know is going to happen eventually.

953
01:17:14,956 --> 01:17:20,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U. Or even regular DS games like Clubhouse games.

954
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:21,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.

955
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:27,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish if they were to do that...

956
01:17:29,085 --> 01:17:33,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't I play a DS game across the internet now?

957
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:36,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be something I should be able to do, feasibly.

958
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't I fucking do that?

959
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:40,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the technology is there.

960
01:17:41,153 --> 01:17:47,117
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're gonna sell DS games on the Wii U, let me play Clubhouse games with friends on the other coast.

961
01:17:47,137 --> 01:17:47,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It is possible.

962
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:48,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of having to be in the same room.

963
01:17:48,979 --> 01:17:52,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, just going back to the one 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing...

964
01:17:54,322 --> 01:18:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to the International Island and chat with people in Japan and do the stupid Club Tortimer games with them and usually I don't have too much of a problem communicating because either there's a chance that between the Japanese I know and the English they know we can get a point across but I mean if they're letting you play with people across the ocean in a game like Animal Crossing why can't you play other games?

965
01:18:20,635 --> 01:18:24,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, now that I think about it, that may have actually been the game I called out, Clubhouse Games.

966
01:18:24,237 --> 01:18:30,301
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have actually been able to play that across the internet on the DS, because the DS did have some internet-enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters you could do online, right?

967
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, there were a lot of games you could only do in the same room, and it would be really cool if you could open that up.

968
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a camera in it.

969
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:43,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we be able to see friends while we're playing?

970
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Or see Dick while we're playing.

971
01:18:47,272 --> 01:18:47,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Or boobies.

972
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:50,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here.

973
01:18:52,403 --> 01:18:57,864
[SPEAKER_01]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase BRUSH.

974
01:18:58,204 --> 01:19:00,404
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a huge kind of topic change here.

975
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going back to a story from a long time ago, but we talked about this extensively on OLR when it first happened because it had a local connection.

976
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:15,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And this goes all the way back to the year, I think it was 2007 when this all happened.

977
01:19:15,468 --> 01:19:16,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would it have been 2006?

978
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:20,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was, no, it was about 07 or 07.

979
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,489
[SPEAKER_04]: When did the Wii come out, Nintendo Wii?

980
01:19:21,789 --> 01:19:22,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it 2006?

981
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:26,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold.

982
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:27,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

983
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:39,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Here locally in California, there was a radio station in Sacramento, specifically where our show is based, which is The End, and they had a contest called Hold Your Wii for a Wii.

984
01:19:39,634 --> 01:19:40,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys remember this now?

985
01:19:40,714 --> 01:19:40,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

986
01:19:41,054 --> 01:19:43,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, and it really doesn't have, I mean...

987
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:45,156
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

988
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:15,741
[SPEAKER_04]: These radio hosts and the radio station didn't realize that, yes, a person can die from drinking too much water and then not allowing themselves to go to the bathroom.

989
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:18,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And people warned them during and before the contest.

990
01:20:18,623 --> 01:20:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really just a hugely ignorant thing, unfortunately.

991
01:20:23,346 --> 01:20:28,750
[SPEAKER_04]: They were ignorant of the fact that a fraternity guy in Chico had passed away from the same thing not that long before.

992
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:33,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody called into the radio station even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this.

993
01:20:33,393 --> 01:20:34,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And they kind of laughed it off.

994
01:20:34,493 --> 01:20:36,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the really damning thing.

995
01:20:37,015 --> 01:20:44,362
[SPEAKER_04]: and this whole thing because they laughed that person off and that clip really came back to haunt all those people that got fired.

996
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:48,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Morning Rave was the name of this show at the time.

997
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:49,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They got fired.

998
01:20:51,568 --> 01:20:58,514
[SPEAKER_04]: $16.5 million in damages awarded against the station in a lawsuit, but there were no further ramifications in place.

999
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?

1000
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

1001
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:15,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Media Watchdog Group, the Sacramento Media Group, and Media Action Center bringing legal action to the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, to block the renewal of the license for KDND.

1002
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:20,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of this incident that happened over a week six or seven years ago,

1003
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to court where 107.9 The End may not get its license.

1004
01:21:27,794 --> 01:21:33,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to kind of give you the local connection living here, I can tell you that radio station's huge in this area.

1005
01:21:33,657 --> 01:21:36,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of the top stations in the area.

1006
01:21:36,299 --> 01:21:37,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the top 40 music station.

1007
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?

1008
01:21:41,282 --> 01:21:43,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs.

1009
01:21:43,563 --> 01:21:48,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't listen to it because it's like the Justin Bieber One Direction.

1010
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of like a teeny kid station.

1011
01:21:51,508 --> 01:21:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So no great loss.

1012
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:54,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But that shit's really popular.

1013
01:21:54,450 --> 01:22:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still people that work at those stations and that's still... I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy.

1014
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1015
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:23,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's very interesting that all this time later, but I mean, they kind of bring up a good point that I guess there was even a documentary, Sue Wilson in 2009, who was the founder of the Media Action Center and who was a vocal critic of KD&D, did a documentary called Broadcast Blues and says, quote, in that contest, a woman died, but the Federal Communications Commission has not acted in any way.

1016
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And you kind of look at that and go, well, she has a point.

1017
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1018
01:22:44,309 --> 01:22:47,391
[SPEAKER_08]: If it were me, I would make it more difficult.

1019
01:22:48,352 --> 01:23:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for example, to do maybe a complete investigation into their current practices to see that they have indeed learned from their mistake and are staying within proper health and safety compliance, that type of thing, before approving it.

1020
01:23:03,163 --> 01:23:06,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe give them extra requirements since they had

1021
01:23:06,926 --> 01:23:15,094
[SPEAKER_08]: This history of events, because I mean, keep in mind for this, if you have a bankruptcy, it takes seven years to come off of your report, right?

1022
01:23:15,595 --> 01:23:24,103
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking kind of around the same time frame, you know, if your financial, you know, what's the word I'm trying to think of?

1023
01:23:25,104 --> 01:23:25,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1024
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:25,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1025
01:23:47,632 --> 01:23:48,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

1026
01:23:48,613 --> 01:23:58,337
[SPEAKER_04]: All these years later, the silly name of the Nintendo Wii still kind of causing these legal fallouts all these years later.

1027
01:23:58,437 --> 01:23:59,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1028
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:07,202
[SPEAKER_03]: If only they had stuck with the revolution, they'd be spinning in office chairs instead.

1029
01:24:09,743 --> 01:24:10,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny.

1030
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you and I really appreciate you all at the same time.

1031
01:24:16,491 --> 01:24:17,373
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1032
01:24:32,974 --> 01:24:34,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, it would be too late.

1033
01:24:34,275 --> 01:24:36,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be almost spiteful.

1034
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:39,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like you see all these years later.

1035
01:24:39,339 --> 01:24:41,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what I still hear about in regards to the FCC?

1036
01:24:42,442 --> 01:24:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Is when Janet Jackson, everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl.

1037
01:24:45,804 --> 01:24:47,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You still hear about that today.

1038
01:24:48,006 --> 01:24:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Because just recently there was an appeal of an appeal where the CBS stations themselves would not be fined.

1039
01:24:55,612 --> 01:24:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, people.

1040
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:57,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1041
01:24:57,773 --> 01:24:58,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a titty.

1042
01:24:58,934 --> 01:24:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a titty.

1043
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:10,355
[SPEAKER_08]: When you've got people stringing up Most people already seen her titties With hands on them too Right?

1044
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:19,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It was her album cover Oh no, it was Rolling Stone Oh yeah, okay, it was Rolling Stone Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty Yes!

1045
01:25:21,297 --> 01:25:22,117
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1046
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, we need more nudity in shows.

1047
01:25:42,552 --> 01:25:43,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1048
01:25:44,294 --> 01:25:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It is such a double standard, you know?

1049
01:25:45,835 --> 01:25:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh my god, oh, there's a nipple.

1050
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:52,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even have it where they're pretty much topless, but they've got paces on or something.

1051
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:57,445
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some reason, that nipple, man, you've crossed the line when it's the nipple.

1052
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is the chat room going off about titty sprinkles?

1053
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... Stop giggling.

1054
01:26:04,183 --> 01:26:10,846
[SPEAKER_04]: SSG100Matt says, FCC is still going after MIA for last year's Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger.

1055
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:13,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that even last year or was that two years ago?

1056
01:26:13,348 --> 01:26:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1057
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:15,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fucking sports ball.

1058
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:18,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, yes, but it was Madonna, Jamie.

1059
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:19,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Madonna.

1060
01:26:21,412 --> 01:26:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But Beyonce was this year.

1061
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:24,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?

1062
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:26,157
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Madonna going to do to one-up Miley?

1063
01:26:26,197 --> 01:26:31,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she made out with Britney Spears or whatever or there was a kiss or some garbage.

1064
01:26:31,722 --> 01:26:33,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Now she needs to one-up.

1065
01:26:33,784 --> 01:26:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Madonna will have to literally pull something out of her.

1066
01:26:35,966 --> 01:26:39,830
[SPEAKER_03]: She will need to have sex with somebody on stage in the middle of her song.

1067
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:41,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Something is going to have to happen.

1068
01:26:42,256 --> 01:26:42,917
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1069
01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:48,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say that Adam... What's his face that was on American Idol?

1070
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:48,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Lambert.

1071
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:49,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1072
01:26:49,601 --> 01:26:51,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought... My mom's a big fan.

1073
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:52,263
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom is a big fan.

1074
01:26:52,323 --> 01:26:52,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob!

1075
01:26:53,404 --> 01:26:54,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Adam Lambert.

1076
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Or as... Rob.

1077
01:26:57,147 --> 01:26:59,028
[SPEAKER_04]: As my friend Susan calls... He should have won, Rob.

1078
01:26:59,268 --> 01:27:02,751
[SPEAKER_04]: He was... Why do they let 12-year-old girls vote on Idol, Rob?

1079
01:27:02,971 --> 01:27:07,994
[SPEAKER_04]: They should ban little girls from voting on Idol because Adam Lambert was robbed because the other guy was cuter.

1080
01:27:08,094 --> 01:27:08,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1081
01:27:08,615 --> 01:27:08,795
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1082
01:27:08,835 --> 01:27:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: But the 30-year-old's won with David Cook.

1083
01:27:10,876 --> 01:27:11,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1084
01:27:11,357 --> 01:27:11,457
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1085
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:17,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, and you know Susan, she calls him Madam Lambert.

1086
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:30,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But he went out on some of his performances being basically as, I'd probably say overtly sexual as some women feel that they need to do.

1087
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:32,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And he illustrated a very good point.

1088
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:35,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should women be expected to do this, but men be lambasted for it?

1089
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:43,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, if a woman goes out and is classy, she still has a particular standard that men aren't particularly held to.

1090
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:50,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think that the big fault just has to do with basically the...

1091
01:27:52,947 --> 01:28:00,729
[SPEAKER_08]: The expectations that society itself is forced to have by what's presented to us in the media.

1092
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:09,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that people losing their shit over a boob is how they are conditioned to react.

1093
01:28:10,272 --> 01:28:10,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

1094
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:14,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii to this, but here you go.

1095
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:17,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1096
01:28:18,345 --> 01:28:21,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, actually the same will go for violent video games.

1097
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:24,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I gotta wrap up.

1098
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:25,668
[SPEAKER_08]: The hot coffee thing.

1099
01:28:25,728 --> 01:28:30,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta move on because we're an hour and a half into the show and not even halfway through our show roll for part A. You know what?

1100
01:28:30,669 --> 01:28:32,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I will flip off everybody for fucking free.

1101
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,851
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to, you know, pay me 1.

1102
01:28:35,651 --> 01:28:37,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars.

1103
01:28:37,992 --> 01:28:39,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off.

1104
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:42,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it too.

1105
01:28:42,353 --> 01:28:45,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they talking about bedazzling boobs now?

1106
01:28:47,095 --> 01:28:49,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say this, but Jamie, just ignore chat.

1107
01:28:49,676 --> 01:28:50,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the next story.

1108
01:28:50,716 --> 01:28:54,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I do have to point out to Reginator that they have such a thing as bedazzling.

1109
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:55,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Think it over.

1110
01:28:57,178 --> 01:28:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exactly what you think it is.

1111
01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:58,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No thanks.

1112
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:07,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, a lot of us love our LucasArts, and a lot of people love Maniac Mansion.

1113
01:29:07,695 --> 01:29:12,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much, like, the, one of the best LucasArts games.

1114
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:20,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, another reason to be pissed off at Disney, with getting rid of LucasArts, they also got rid of a game that was 80% complete.

1115
01:29:20,686 --> 01:29:24,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Hadn't yet been greenlit, but it was sort of a dream project for a lot of people.

1116
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:28,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a Day of the Tentacle HD remake.

1117
01:29:28,932 --> 01:29:35,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had a lot of HD remakes come in, especially DuckTales and the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion.

1118
01:29:36,017 --> 01:29:38,199
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, I think, would have made a lot of people piss themselves.

1119
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:45,011
[SPEAKER_08]: With the fall of LucasArts, this was one of the games to suffer.

1120
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:49,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, too, is they had a Star Wars smuggler game.

1121
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:52,412
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a Death Star iOS game.

1122
01:29:52,632 --> 01:29:58,213
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stuff that was in process, including a Star Wars First Assault.

1123
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:01,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So, sad face.

1124
01:30:02,714 --> 01:30:05,475
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be missing.

1125
01:30:05,515 --> 01:30:10,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if I found out there was a Loom game, I would have gone out on a rampage.

1126
01:30:10,636 --> 01:30:10,716
Yeah.

1127
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish they could have transitioned this or sold it to somebody to finish or something.

1128
01:30:17,006 --> 01:30:18,628
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really heartbreaking.

1129
01:30:18,648 --> 01:30:19,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's 80% done.

1130
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1131
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So just really, really sad.

1132
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:25,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Just bring in Gearbox to finish the other 20%.

1133
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:26,833
[SPEAKER_04]: What could possibly go wrong?

1134
01:30:26,853 --> 01:30:28,694
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a big expose on Kotaku about it.

1135
01:30:29,495 --> 01:30:30,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's where they got the information from.

1136
01:30:31,076 --> 01:30:33,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show.

1137
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:34,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on you.

1138
01:30:35,098 --> 01:30:37,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, but the article actually was legit.

1139
01:30:38,237 --> 01:30:38,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1140
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:40,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of being the other shit.

1141
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,904
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, that being said, you know.

1142
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:50,432
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me think about when we have stuff like this.

1143
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:52,934
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I hate this stupid program.

1144
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:59,678
[SPEAKER_08]: When we have developers working on games and then just to have it stop.

1145
01:30:59,778 --> 01:31:00,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're defunded.

1146
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:02,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're closing down your division.

1147
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine the people that are working on this one and they are totally into what they're making.

1148
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:09,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Their heart goes into it.

1149
01:31:10,405 --> 01:31:11,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Robotech Crystal Dreams

1150
01:31:24,844 --> 01:31:52,277
[SPEAKER_08]: well one of the developers put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the levels and released it a lot of Atari 5200 prototypes Dan and I have gone out and bought because people have fished out the prototypes made them playable and put them on a repurposed cartridge and sold them I have a ton of there's NES games you know that basically all these prototypes like oh here's an example um

[SPEAKER_08]: Space Fantasy Zone Complete game Didn't release because of the Sega license But I've got a copy People will find a way to get out what they love So I would actually be completely happy if someone decided to be sneaky with code and get that out

1152

[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a lot sooner than that will leak to the internet.

1166
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:34,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a thin week in Japan.

1167

[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot.

1168
01:33:35,316 --> 01:33:36,217

[SPEAKER_04]: There is, uh, S-P-E-C, Spec Can is the game that's coming out on the 3DS this week.

1177
01:34:05,537 --> 01:34:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.

1178
01:34:07,018 --> 01:34:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's labeled as an adventure game and it kind of looks like, I like the graphics because it's like an old school PC game in parts.

1179
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:15,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of mixed with like a newer thing that's mixed with photography.

1180
01:34:15,443 --> 01:34:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something, but, uh...

1181
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:19,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like a CSI kind of game.

1182
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is one of the lone releases this week is on the 3DS.

1187
01:34:29,641 --> 01:34:31,744

[SPEAKER_04]: But stay tuned next week.

1189

[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be more.

1190
01:34:34,255 --> 01:34:37,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for our friends in the UK, there are a few releases.

1191
01:34:39,339 --> 01:34:41,080
[SPEAKER_08]: For the 30th, there's Gridiron Thunder.

1195
01:35:01,658 --> 01:35:05,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1196
01:35:05,304 --> 01:35:08,248
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, chatters are telling me that my mic is cutting in and out.

1197
01:35:08,308 --> 01:35:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I can't see that live when I'm doing talking, so I'm going to try and hold this thing together, which is really unfortunate because this is a newer mic and was donated, so I don't know.

1198
01:35:17,904 --> 01:35:18,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1199
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:43,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that's the downside of live radio is that I can't, you know, say, oh, hold on, guys, we're going to stop while I go fix this.

1200
01:35:43,617 --> 01:35:45,099
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on, Loki.

1201
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Valve has started the beta for the Steam Family Sharing Program.

1202
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:52,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thousand people that...

1203
01:35:52,970 --> 01:36:07,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're invited we're sent invites this week through email or hopefully through the actual messaging through Steam because if it's through email I didn't fucking get that because I get so much spam it's ridiculous

1204
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:09,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1205
01:36:26,653 --> 01:36:41,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I get mine going, because I am playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto, I will probably have to add people to my Steam sharing thing so that maybe Bobby can play the legit copy of Saints Row 4 and get those achievements.

1206
01:36:43,028 --> 01:36:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm waiting for mine to come in too.

1207
01:36:44,829 --> 01:36:45,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play Saints Row 4.

1208
01:36:46,451 --> 01:36:51,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for mine to get enabled too so I can do some of that sharing and test that out and be fun.

1209
01:36:52,297 --> 01:36:53,600
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, moving on.

1210
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,686
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys for the Classic Game of the Week.

1211
01:36:55,746 --> 01:36:59,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is about one of the few animes I used to watch years and years ago.

1212
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:01,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, your favorite, Rob.

1213
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon!

1214
01:37:02,127 --> 01:37:02,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1215
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:03,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1216
01:37:03,628 --> 01:37:12,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as much as I razzed the series and give Shane a hard time for being such a fan of the series, you know, on Horde House and so forth, I actually like legit used to love the old school Pokemon anime.

1217
01:37:14,693 --> 01:37:16,073
[SPEAKER_04]: This is way back when I was in college.

1218
01:37:16,093 --> 01:37:17,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this thing is like years old, right?

1219
01:37:17,274 --> 01:37:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember when I brought my VCD of the Japanese version of the movie over?

1220
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1221
01:37:21,496 --> 01:37:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1222
01:37:21,756 --> 01:37:22,236
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

1223
01:37:22,276 --> 01:37:24,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember going to see the first movie in the theater.

1224
01:37:24,997 --> 01:37:25,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I went with you.

1225
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:28,039
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw a later one with me.

1226
01:37:28,099 --> 01:37:28,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I?

1227
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,582
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I went and saw the very first movie with my friend Amanda.

1228
01:37:32,702 --> 01:37:33,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad Sig's not listening.

1229
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:34,564
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows her very well.

1230
01:37:34,904 --> 01:37:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But Amanda and I went to this movie, the first movie.

1231
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:42,229
[SPEAKER_04]: We were the only people in the largest auditorium in the theater.

1232
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:43,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did we do?

1233
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We were screaming our heads off, mimicking all the Pokemon.

1234
01:37:47,012 --> 01:37:48,573
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the best time ever.

1235
01:37:48,593 --> 01:37:50,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so fun.

1236
01:37:50,194 --> 01:37:55,598
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, the important thing to talk about news-wise is that Pokemon Origins,

1237
01:37:56,318 --> 01:37:57,559
[SPEAKER_04]: is coming to the West.

1238
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:07,067
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an anime that is a whopping four episodes long, but it will launch on November 15th in the Pokemon TV mobile application.

1239
01:38:07,367 --> 01:38:11,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This tells the stories of the very first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Blue.

1240
01:38:11,951 --> 01:38:12,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that looked like Red.

1241
01:38:12,992 --> 01:38:14,213
[SPEAKER_04]: From the original 96 Game Boy.

1242
01:38:14,253 --> 01:38:14,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 96 Game Boy.

1243
01:38:15,554 --> 01:38:15,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1244
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:28,004
[SPEAKER_04]: The protagonist named Red will travel through the Kanto region and get into trouble with Team Rocket, battle his rival, and challenge the Pokemon League.

1245
01:38:28,424 --> 01:38:32,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Pokemon the movie Genesect and The Legend Awakened will air later this month.

1246
01:38:32,868 --> 01:38:35,249
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point?

1247
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,971
[SPEAKER_04]: They only ever did, what, like four of them in theaters?

1248
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:39,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I only cared about the first one.

1249
01:38:39,432 --> 01:38:40,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1250
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the second movie was also great because if for nothing else, for the line where Jesse and James from Team Rocket, Jesse goes, the opposite sex is nothing but trouble.

1251
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:56,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And then James goes, that's why I stay out of that kind of trouble and laughed my head off when that happened.

1252
01:38:56,957 --> 01:38:58,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on YouTube somewhere.

1253
01:38:58,178 --> 01:38:58,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.

1254
01:38:59,399 --> 01:38:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1255
01:38:59,859 --> 01:39:00,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Origins.

1256
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of thinking I might have to try it.

1257
01:39:04,143 --> 01:39:04,543
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1258
01:39:05,183 --> 01:39:05,844
[SPEAKER_04]: See how much it costs.

1259
01:39:06,144 --> 01:39:07,545
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, I like Digimon better.

1260
01:39:09,146 --> 01:39:09,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1261
01:39:10,548 --> 01:39:10,888
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1262
01:39:11,048 --> 01:39:14,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say let's travel back to a time when Pokemon wasn't around, but...

1263
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:17,492
[SPEAKER_08]: There were plenty of Pokemans around for this.

1264
01:39:18,012 --> 01:39:30,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to the rule change invoked by DarkSakura last week, ten years ago there were still plenty of Pokemans and plenty of classic, classic video games that are as old as this show.

1265
01:39:30,435 --> 01:39:31,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Old as balls.

1266
01:39:33,596 --> 01:39:35,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying this show is old as balls?

1267
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1268
01:39:36,138 --> 01:39:37,339
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1269
01:39:37,379 --> 01:39:37,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here it is.

1270
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,941
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

1271
01:39:40,782 --> 01:39:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you can rip open the PlayStation 2 era, even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter, you already did when you picked the Mosquito game.

1272
01:39:47,807 --> 01:39:48,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did.

1273
01:39:48,448 --> 01:39:49,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done other.

1274
01:39:49,428 --> 01:39:49,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

1275
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1276
01:39:50,489 --> 01:39:52,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done newer games than this, too, now that I think about it.

1277
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:52,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1278
01:39:52,911 --> 01:39:53,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But here it is.

1279
01:39:53,532 --> 01:39:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic game of the week.

1280
01:39:54,633 --> 01:39:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what did you pick?

1281
01:39:55,874 --> 01:39:58,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going with Kingdom Hearts for Rob.

1282
01:39:59,363 --> 01:39:59,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

1283
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:00,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

1284
01:40:00,504 --> 01:40:02,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody else who bought the HD version.

1285
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:03,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I go, wait a minute.

1286
01:40:03,927 --> 01:40:11,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when this game came out, I remember playing this when it was new, and I think we were doing OLR at the time.

1287
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:14,356
[SPEAKER_08]: This game came out 11 years ago.

1288
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:15,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

1289
01:40:17,338 --> 01:40:18,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I was still in my 20s.

1290
01:40:20,301 --> 01:40:21,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Because fuck a bunch of that.

1291
01:40:22,923 --> 01:40:23,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this music, by the way.

1292
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The Traverse Town music.

1293
01:40:27,831 --> 01:40:29,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking love it.

1294
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:32,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, it was Kingdom Hearts.

1295
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:40,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we know, it's an action role-playing game put out by Square at the time, now Squeenix, and came out on PS2 in 2002.

1296
01:40:42,418 --> 01:40:45,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a collaboration between Squeenix and Walt Disney.

1297
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:51,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around and lots of Disney characters around.

1298
01:40:51,402 --> 01:40:54,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the two universes had a very cute baby.

1299
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cute, kind of fucked up baby.

1300
01:40:59,262 --> 01:41:12,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this one, for Square to have done so many regular RPGs, you know, their standard JRPG format, this was a little bit of a departure to be a lot more action-oriented.

1301
01:41:12,849 --> 01:41:12,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And

1302
01:41:13,849 --> 01:41:18,891
[SPEAKER_08]: In my case, it was a lot more, oh my god, Donald, knock the fuck off, I don't need healing.

1303
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:22,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying, that was the common thing you would hear in my house.

1304
01:41:23,592 --> 01:41:36,037
[SPEAKER_08]: The really great thing about it, too, is that a lot of the character designs were done... I'm sorry, the director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura, who had done a lot of the character design in Square Games.

1305
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:40,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a fantastic voice cast.

1306
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:46,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even though at the time I think it was right at the height of the Hayley Joel love.

1307
01:41:47,525 --> 01:41:52,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And what actually has impressed me is that he's still voicing Sora and can still make himself sound that young.

1308
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,391
[SPEAKER_08]: He's, you know, aged a bit.

1309
01:41:55,891 --> 01:41:57,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Still kind of a cute dude.

1310
01:41:57,553 --> 01:42:04,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like the fact that he is that talented as a voice actor that he can still sound so young.

1311
01:42:05,738 --> 01:42:07,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It had lots of fun cutscenes.

1312
01:42:07,379 --> 01:42:11,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you had your Final Fantasy VIII characters hanging around.

1313
01:42:11,782 --> 01:42:15,484
[SPEAKER_08]: You had the Sephiroth thing was pretty fun.

1314
01:42:15,824 --> 01:42:21,867
[SPEAKER_08]: You had your Squall hanging out, or I'm sorry, Leonhart.

1315
01:42:23,308 --> 01:42:25,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And you would get little nods.

1316
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:33,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs, but you'd get little nods to other Square games and to different Disney franchises.

1317
01:42:33,886 --> 01:42:35,207
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was pretty fun.

1318
01:42:35,788 --> 01:42:40,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not even going to go much into Kingdom Hearts 2 because that, of course, is newer.

1319
01:42:41,093 --> 01:42:43,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It had the Tron level, which was amazing.

1320
01:42:45,322 --> 01:42:48,765
[SPEAKER_08]: This game was just awesome, except for the gummy ship, which was my least favorite part.

1321
01:42:48,865 --> 01:42:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I hated navigating the gummy ship.

1322
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:53,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kept saying, why is it a gummy ship when there's no gummy bears?

1323
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hello?

1324
01:42:57,591 --> 01:43:04,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as far as your characters, you've got the main character Sora, you have his buddy Riku, and Kairi.

1325
01:43:06,838 --> 01:43:11,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, Actdeft, I knew how to set up Donald and he was still a shit.

1326
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:18,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So, basically, you team up with Donald and Goofy to find King Mickey.

1327
01:43:19,454 --> 01:43:25,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And your main character is the main antagonist is Ansem and the Heartless.

1328
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:28,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this game has spawned so much wank.

1329
01:43:29,104 --> 01:43:29,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So much wank!

1330
01:43:30,665 --> 01:43:37,390
[SPEAKER_08]: But other characters that show up in there, I mean, you've got 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest.

1331
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:41,934
[SPEAKER_08]: You have major Disney villains in the game.

1332
01:43:42,014 --> 01:43:47,098
[SPEAKER_08]: You can summon different characters too, like you have the genie, you have Tinkerbell, you have Simba from The Lion King.

1333
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:50,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Riku from Final Fantasy X was supposed to show up, but was replaced by Yuffie.

1334
01:44:07,445 --> 01:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the Cloud and Sephiroth showdown in the Olympus Coliseum.

1335
01:44:11,788 --> 01:44:13,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So much really good stuff.

1336
01:44:13,309 --> 01:44:19,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And the story itself is so rich that they seem to really plan on there being more than one.

1337
01:44:19,613 --> 01:44:20,973
[SPEAKER_08]: They were really looking ahead.

1338
01:44:22,855 --> 01:44:23,035
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1339
01:44:26,269 --> 01:44:28,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say enough good about this game.

1340
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:30,211
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really amazing.

1341
01:44:30,271 --> 01:44:43,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, the way that this came about was that there was a discussion between Shinji Hashimoto and Sakaguchi about Mario 64, where they wanted to do a three-dimensional movement.

1342
01:44:45,539 --> 01:44:49,922
[SPEAKER_08]: But they said the only way to rival a Mario game would be to have Disney behind it.

1343
01:44:50,502 --> 01:44:57,863
[SPEAKER_08]: and Nomura overheard the conversation and actually led the way to start building the game.

1344
01:44:57,883 --> 01:45:05,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was a meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator where they were in the same building in Japan.

1345
01:45:06,525 --> 01:45:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And magic was made.

1346
01:45:08,685 --> 01:45:09,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So they brought it together.

1347
01:45:10,545 --> 01:45:14,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got fantastic music, a fantastic voice cast.

1348
01:45:15,386 --> 01:45:19,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say, both the English voice cast and...

1349
01:45:19,947 --> 01:45:48,219
[SPEAKER_08]: the Japanese voice cast were top notch after hearing them in both and then getting Utada Hikaru to do the main song both in Japanese and English although honestly I think the Japanese version is better I think there was a lot more production value behind it and like there's some of the voice cast that they couldn't get for the American one like they couldn't get Robin Williams they had I can never pronounce this guy's name properly Dan Castellaneta

1350
01:45:48,699 --> 01:45:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan... He's Homer Simpson, yeah.

1351
01:45:51,001 --> 01:45:51,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1352
01:45:51,702 --> 01:45:52,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I can never pronounce those.

1353
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:53,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Italian, I think Castaneda or something like that.

1354
01:45:53,624 --> 01:45:55,706
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, they get Billy Zane and David Borneas.

1355
01:45:55,926 --> 01:46:02,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, well, they got the guy who plays a really down-on-himself guy to play another really down-on-himself guy.

1356
01:46:02,872 --> 01:46:06,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, isn't he also the voice, though, in the second and third movies?

1357
01:46:07,376 --> 01:46:19,613
[SPEAKER_04]: He was in the TV show because after Robin Williams had the falling out with Disney over Aladdin he stepped in and did the voice Robin Williams came back and did the third movie though when they all kissed and made up

1358
01:46:23,325 --> 01:46:29,327
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, they got really, really top-level voice talent.

1359
01:46:29,807 --> 01:46:38,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes when you get an RPG in Japan, they'll have top-notch voice actors behind it there, but we won't get as big names there.

1360
01:46:38,769 --> 01:46:43,810
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably one of the first to have really significant talent put into a game.

1361
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it, you'd expect them to put in that kind of production value.

1362
01:46:51,457 --> 01:46:54,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think anybody was disappointed by this game.

1363
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody was, then they're wrong.

1364
01:46:57,859 --> 01:47:06,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see, though, when you put it next to Kingdom Hearts 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 fixed a lot of problems with the first one with the camera and so forth.

1365
01:47:06,925 --> 01:47:14,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was stated as the runner-up for the PS2 Best Game of 2002 Reader's Choice Award.

1366
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:16,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what the first one was.

1367
01:47:19,694 --> 01:47:24,237
[SPEAKER_08]: GamePro said that the battle system was like the N64 Zelda games, which, honestly, I thought was really good.

1368
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:33,761
[SPEAKER_08]: and then there actually were plenty of compliments for the AI with Donald and Goofy and it really was very customizable.

1369
01:47:33,921 --> 01:47:37,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just always get irritated because sometimes Donald would do shit the wrong time.

1370
01:47:37,422 --> 01:47:40,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get any better in the HD version, just letting you know.

1371
01:47:40,843 --> 01:47:42,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Donald's still his stupid head.

1372
01:47:42,364 --> 01:47:43,565
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1373
01:48:13,084 --> 01:48:19,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like when you have something big come out and then have it be a success.

1374
01:48:20,165 --> 01:48:24,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And then have such a really beautiful story around the whole thing.

1375
01:48:24,406 --> 01:48:25,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's still a lot we don't know.

1376
01:48:25,847 --> 01:48:32,768
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember how everyone went, oh shit, when everyone saw Riku blindfolded in the organization outfit.

1377
01:48:32,788 --> 01:48:33,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone was like, ah.

1378
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:39,189
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the little ending for 2 where everyone was in the whole Keyblade Graveyard scene.

1379
01:48:39,329 --> 01:48:45,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw an amazing Google Doc that was like 50 pages long that was trying to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

1380
01:48:45,772 --> 01:48:47,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, and it's for kids?

1381
01:48:47,672 --> 01:48:50,614
[SPEAKER_08]: But it spawned that much fan involvement.

1382
01:48:50,654 --> 01:48:57,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you've got, when you can build a dedicated fan base like that, you know you've really got something important and special.

1383
01:48:58,837 --> 01:49:05,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Kingdom Hearts is really, I think, one of the first games that's bought several different levels of fandom together.

1384
01:49:06,405 --> 01:49:10,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a pretty monumental event, too, because usually fandoms are like, bitch, please.

1385
01:49:12,272 --> 01:49:12,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1386
01:49:12,993 --> 01:49:13,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there it is, guys.

1387
01:49:13,834 --> 01:49:15,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week.

1388
01:49:15,415 --> 01:49:16,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts.

1389
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:29,948
[SPEAKER_04]: on the PlayStation 2, but of course, as we all know, now on the PlayStation 3 with the whole HD version, which in our chat room, ShadowNextGen points out, Rob, I heard they fixed the camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD remix on PlayStation 3.

1390
01:49:31,029 --> 01:49:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better, but I still get frustrated with it, to be honest.

1391
01:49:34,011 --> 01:49:38,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But I gotta admit, Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy XIV.

1392
01:49:39,274 --> 01:49:44,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I finally hit endgame and maybe that'll calm down a little bit, I'm hoping to go back and play more Kingdom Hearts.

1393
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:51,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And another good thing is that I have to say that it gave Utada Hikaru some really, really good exposure here in the U.S.

1394
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she ended up having her albums on.

1395
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,202
[SPEAKER_08]: She's had several albums now in the U.S.

1396
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:55,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Two.

1397
01:49:56,062 --> 01:49:58,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that she had two and then an EP, didn't she?

1398
01:49:58,623 --> 01:49:59,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1399
01:49:59,803 --> 01:50:04,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just the one that Timbaland produced and then the Come Back to Me.

1400
01:50:05,105 --> 01:50:06,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Her best of from Japan is on the U.S.

1401
01:50:06,905 --> 01:50:07,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Store.

1402
01:50:07,585 --> 01:50:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that might be what it is.

1403
01:50:09,126 --> 01:50:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: But at any rate, I freaking love her voice.

1404
01:50:13,287 --> 01:50:13,927
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

1405
01:50:14,387 --> 01:50:15,148
[SPEAKER_04]: The Classic Game of the Week.

1406
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:18,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running long tonight, so we're going to go right into our break.

1407
01:50:18,289 --> 01:50:19,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go anywhere, guys, though.

1408
01:50:19,289 --> 01:50:22,990
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1409
01:50:30,003 --> 01:50:41,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, September the 29th of 2013, the 521st episode of our show already in progress.

1410
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:50,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to hear the music that we play during the break while we, you know, get up and stretch and refill our drinks and so forth during the break.

1411
01:50:50,515 --> 01:50:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had a fun little background medley from Kid Icarus that played in the break there.

1412
01:50:54,678 --> 01:50:59,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just reminded me how much I love the music in Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood.

1413
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:01,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though that game's fucking hard.

1414
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: It is fucking hard, but I still like to go back and play it once in a while.

1415
01:51:04,654 --> 01:51:09,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one sitting, but I can at least get through the first world.

1416
01:51:10,018 --> 01:51:12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Terror, Danger, Horror, XXXX.

1417
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You picked Uprising, right?

1418
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:14,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1419
01:51:14,362 --> 01:51:15,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up my house.

1420
01:51:15,262 --> 01:51:18,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that game hurt my hand so much to play.

1421
01:51:18,284 --> 01:51:20,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really made a lot of progress in that.

1422
01:51:20,466 --> 01:51:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed it, but I kind of wish they'd do it on Wii U. That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U. Didn't.

1423
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Can they say they originally had a console version?

1424
01:51:28,532 --> 01:51:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they had a Wii version.

1425
01:51:32,114 --> 01:51:32,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1426
01:51:33,015 --> 01:51:40,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, let's get into some rapid-fire gaming news and talk about some things that will be happening, unlike Kid Icarus on Wii U.

1427
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:46,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was an ARG that was tied with Surgeon Simulator that's now finally been cracked.

1428
01:51:47,341 --> 01:51:55,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a secret code that you would put in the Zero Gravity Surgery mission and you'd get sucked outside of your ship.

1429
01:51:55,903 --> 01:52:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you have a brand new set of surgeries you can do on an alien in Zero Gravity with alien tools.

1430
01:52:03,725 --> 01:52:07,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have you do all sorts of weird stuff like...

1431
01:52:08,267 --> 01:52:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Gobble Shaft Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a Gobble Shaft it's pretty funny so check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator there's actually videos out there that show you what the access code is and you can do all that so yeah

1432
01:52:23,664 --> 01:52:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course there's the second season of Mortal Kombat Legacy 10 episodes I guess they were all released at one time it's being hosted by Machinima if you may remember it was that live action series that came out around the time that the last Mortal Kombat game came out

1433
01:52:41,614 --> 01:53:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: and so yeah if you want to check it out it's on YouTube Machinima and 10 episodes for your digestion and last but not least Rockstar put out some information about Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this Tuesday on the 1st well bumpy launching on the 1st may or may not launch on the 1st

1434
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Launching in an MMO sense.

1435
01:53:02,962 --> 01:53:06,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be stable by mid-October.

1436
01:53:06,366 --> 01:53:10,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so basically they were talking about some of the stuff and answered some of the rumors that were going around.

1437
01:53:11,232 --> 01:53:19,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Confirming that there will be, not really microtransactions, but there will be some sort of online transactions to purchase in-game money.

1438
01:53:20,382 --> 01:53:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: so they have that however they preface that with you will be able to play the game and it's been balanced for people playing the game regularly and you won't actually have to buy money if you don't want to but if you want to just get ahead buy your fast cars and better weapons and crib or whatever by all means go ahead and do that some of the stuff that they announced that they're going to be doing with that they're going to be including some different

1439
01:53:49,798 --> 01:53:55,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Activity, Jobs, Sports, Tennis, Content Creators for Deathmatches and Races Beach Bum Pack Customization Items Weapons

1440
01:54:18,443 --> 01:54:25,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Capture the Flag is going to be coming back, and they're also going to have a content creator for that, and they'll be introducing Heist.

1441
01:54:28,148 --> 01:54:29,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be pretty sweet.

1442
01:54:30,128 --> 01:54:33,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And 700 Missions, I think, is what they teased before, are going to be available online.

1443
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:38,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Compare that to 69 that are in the single-player game.

1444
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:39,653
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty significant.

1445
01:54:39,673 --> 01:54:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1446
01:54:42,154 --> 01:54:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: and people have actually dug through the files and a couple things that they've been of course they have of course they have drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well as betting on horses at the track so it's Derby Owners Club

1447
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:56,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

1448
01:54:56,861 --> 01:54:58,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get to whip the horses, though, like you do in Derby Hunters Club?

1449
01:54:58,803 --> 01:54:59,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

1450
01:54:59,724 --> 01:55:01,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game I haven't played in forever.

1451
01:55:01,085 --> 01:55:01,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss that game.

1452
01:55:01,886 --> 01:55:06,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, mention again, you know, we do have the VOG Network crew that you can join.

1453
01:55:06,571 --> 01:55:08,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go check out the forums.

1454
01:55:08,413 --> 01:55:09,153
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the link to that.

1455
01:55:09,213 --> 01:55:15,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I believe it's socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.

1456
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:17,162
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Network

1457
01:55:33,798 --> 01:55:34,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Warrior and Saints Row 4

1458
01:55:51,582 --> 01:55:58,244
[SPEAKER_04]: If you own Saints Row 4 on Steam and you own Shadow Warrior on Steam, you'll unlock the Penetrator weapon in Shadow Warrior.

1459
01:55:58,644 --> 01:56:03,786
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, the purple dildo bat will be yours to slaughter the enemies.

1460
01:56:04,206 --> 01:56:05,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that it has balls.

1461
01:56:05,286 --> 01:56:09,188
[SPEAKER_04]: In the ancient Japan setting, that is Shadow Warrior.

1462
01:56:10,248 --> 01:56:12,989
[SPEAKER_03]: You play a character named Wang, so I mean, it's fitting.

1463
01:56:13,109 --> 01:56:18,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's just silly, but you know, anything involving Saints Row usually is.

1464
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just completely...

1465
01:56:20,876 --> 01:56:22,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Amused that it has balls.

1466
01:56:24,677 --> 01:56:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to bring up the balls again so you can giggle some more?

1467
01:56:27,178 --> 01:56:28,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Tee hee.

1468
01:56:29,358 --> 01:56:36,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have you know though, it only had balls over here in this region and in Europe.

1469
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:42,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not have balls in Japan where I believe it was censored and it didn't have the wiggle physics in Japan either.

1470
01:56:42,622 --> 01:56:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1471
01:56:44,142 --> 01:56:46,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So silly what they have to change from region to region.

1472
01:56:46,483 --> 01:56:49,665
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, look, safe for, I believe, almost everyone.

1473
01:56:49,725 --> 01:56:53,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Try a game like Rocksmith 2014, which, of course, is the newest Rocksmith game.

1474
01:56:54,369 --> 01:57:00,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of more of kind of like a cult-level music game because it's not pushing plastic buttons to instruments.

1475
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it is in a way, but you're actually learning to play the actual guitars.

1476
01:57:04,716 --> 01:57:06,117
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what sets... He uses a real guitar.

1477
01:57:06,137 --> 01:57:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he uses a real guitar.

1478
01:57:06,997 --> 01:57:08,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of what sets Rocksmith apart.

1479
01:57:08,979 --> 01:57:10,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely has its following because of that.

1480
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,402
[SPEAKER_04]: If you weren't already aware, there is a new version coming this year.

1481
01:57:13,482 --> 01:57:14,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rocksmith 2014.

1482
01:57:15,363 --> 01:57:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: and some mini-games will be involved in this.

1483
01:57:18,446 --> 01:57:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Guitarcade, which was also in the first Rocksmith game, but you play games that are retro-inspired.

1484
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, there's a game like Duck's Redo, which is basically Galaga, but it can't actually be Galaga because Ubisoft didn't make Galaga, so there's all those issues there.

1485
01:57:35,598 --> 01:57:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other Guitarcade games that are available for playing, Scale Racers and Gone Whalen.

1486
01:57:43,044 --> 01:57:43,985
[SPEAKER_04]: and Scale Racers.

1487
01:57:44,085 --> 01:57:47,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You will master scales while avoiding traffic in a police car chase.

1488
01:57:48,508 --> 01:57:55,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gone Wailing will make you play louder or quieter to elevate characters and collect coins.

1489
01:57:55,534 --> 01:58:02,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, there's Return to Castle Core Dead, which is a first-person shooter where you strum chords to kill enemies.

1490
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:06,346
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1491
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:30,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance 2014 Just Dance 2014 Just Dance 2014

1492
01:58:50,436 --> 01:58:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj, Gentlemen by Psy.

1493
01:58:54,341 --> 01:58:56,223
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good song.

1494
01:58:56,403 --> 01:58:58,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, even Ricky Martin's back with Maria.

1495
01:58:59,046 --> 01:59:00,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Where Have You Been by Rihanna.

1496
01:59:01,769 --> 01:59:06,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, that horrible, horrible blurred line song by Robin Thicke is in this.

1497
01:59:06,234 --> 01:59:08,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That song needs to be removed from everything, ever.

1498
01:59:08,277 --> 01:59:09,959
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs to be removed from everything, ever.

1499
01:59:09,999 --> 01:59:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bad song.

1500
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But in better news, Flashdance What a Feelin' by the Girly Team.

1501
01:59:16,182 --> 01:59:17,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, it's a cover, but it's something.

1502
01:59:18,303 --> 01:59:19,244
[SPEAKER_04]: YMCA is there.

1503
01:59:20,144 --> 01:59:27,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And attention Beliebers, the Will.i.am song That Power, which features Justin Bieber, is in there too.

1504
01:59:28,128 --> 01:59:31,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamebuoy.org will be happy to know Kesha is in the game with Come On.

1505
01:59:31,509 --> 01:59:32,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love Kesha.

1506
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:33,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like her too.

1507
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:37,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Kesha is so fun in such a guilty pleasure way.

1508
01:59:38,272 --> 01:59:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that like more basic singers, Katy Perry's in the game with I Kissed a Girl And if you like your musicals, Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game What the fuck?

1509
01:59:48,061 --> 01:59:50,043
[SPEAKER_04]: That's random How random is that?

1510
01:59:50,283 --> 01:59:54,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like a holdover from Just Dance Disney?

1511
01:59:55,127 --> 02:00:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea And one of the songs of the summer, Get Lucky by Daft Punk

1512
02:00:01,252 --> 02:00:02,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, everybody likes that song.

1513
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:07,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this song, David Guetta with Sia She-Wolf, Falling to Pieces.

1514
02:00:07,394 --> 02:00:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

1515
02:00:08,774 --> 02:00:11,795
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these songs, all of them, shit.

1516
02:00:13,195 --> 02:00:14,055
[SPEAKER_04]: They are trumped.

1517
02:00:14,635 --> 02:00:18,116
[SPEAKER_04]: They are just nothing with the inclusion of this song.

1518
02:00:19,176 --> 02:00:21,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Gimme, gimme, gimme, A Man After Midnight by ABBA.

1519
02:00:22,157 --> 02:00:22,877
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need.

1520
02:00:22,997 --> 02:00:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the rest of it.

1521
02:00:23,557 --> 02:00:24,137
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your ABBA.

1522
02:00:24,157 --> 02:00:25,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the rest of it.

1523
02:00:25,978 --> 02:00:26,498
[SPEAKER_04]: End quote.

1524
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:31,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it.

1525
02:00:32,053 --> 02:00:33,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1526
02:00:33,735 --> 02:00:38,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura, ABBA trumps that song.

1527
02:00:38,421 --> 02:00:38,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to.

1528
02:00:39,442 --> 02:00:39,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1529
02:00:41,545 --> 02:00:44,709
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about it, DarkSakura... I don't think ABBA could even...

1530
02:00:46,831 --> 02:00:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Rob, did you ever pick up Abba You Could Dance for the Wii?

1531
02:00:52,113 --> 02:00:52,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

1532
02:00:53,394 --> 02:00:57,996
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have seen Rob do freaking ballerina spins.

1533
02:00:59,336 --> 02:01:04,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had been recording it because Rob's like, I've got the Abba game, you need to come over.

1534
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:05,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, okay.

1535
02:01:05,979 --> 02:01:34,538
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sitting back in this chair that no one can see me point to except for us in this room thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing like that was a couple years ago and you know game streaming and Rob's like look what I got and I did the winner takes it all for Jamie well and then I don't want to talk oh and remember you bringing SingStar Abba over to my house when Tiara was over I still have SingStar Abba right there right next to SingStar Queen that is like the best shelf in my entire house

1536
02:01:35,191 --> 02:01:36,733
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1537
02:01:53,354 --> 02:01:54,115
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1538
02:02:13,214 --> 02:02:13,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a Wii Remote Plus.

1539
02:02:37,103 --> 02:02:39,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I never... And the game does require it.

1540
02:02:39,765 --> 02:02:44,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get shit for this, but I never played Skyward Sword, so I didn't have one.

1541
02:02:44,248 --> 02:02:48,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither have I. And the game does require it, so yeah, that's why.

1542
02:02:48,271 --> 02:02:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1543
02:02:49,291 --> 02:03:00,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get that for $70, the bundle that has all of that, or you can buy the game separately for $40 if you have, you know... Wow, they significantly reduced the price of the controller.

1544
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:01,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, no, they didn't.

1545
02:03:01,459 --> 02:03:03,941
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a full price controller, so fuck them.

1546
02:03:04,321 --> 02:03:06,123
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just buy a used one, seriously.

1547
02:03:06,503 --> 02:03:07,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you.

1548
02:03:07,204 --> 02:03:07,544
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1549
02:03:07,965 --> 02:03:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1550
02:03:09,406 --> 02:03:09,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Not ABBA.

1551
02:03:12,309 --> 02:03:15,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for the Super Smash Bros.

1552
02:03:16,112 --> 02:03:17,654
[SPEAKER_08]: roster, we have a new addition.

1553
02:03:17,754 --> 02:03:21,938
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Wind Waker Link and all of his adorable cuteness.

1554
02:03:22,819 --> 02:03:28,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe he's going to be on both versions, also with his adult incarnation as well.

1555
02:03:29,725 --> 02:03:30,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So fun.

1556
02:03:32,009 --> 02:03:32,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Mighty No.

1557
02:03:32,931 --> 02:03:36,496
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 is also coming out for the Vita and the 3DS.

1558
02:03:36,837 --> 02:03:40,062
[SPEAKER_08]: It basically reached the goals for those, so you know what?

1559
02:03:40,603 --> 02:03:41,985
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get it, I'll get it on 3DS.

1560
02:03:42,486 --> 02:03:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's reached those goals yet.

1561
02:03:46,103 --> 02:03:50,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, when it reached 3.5 million, but it's pretty close, I think.

1562
02:03:50,145 --> 02:03:50,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1563
02:03:50,585 --> 02:03:51,926
[SPEAKER_04]: They've only got two days left.

1564
02:03:51,986 --> 02:03:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not hit it.

1565
02:03:53,866 --> 02:03:55,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't put in money yet, though.

1566
02:03:55,047 --> 02:03:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there.

1567
02:03:57,948 --> 02:04:02,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And in other news, Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack.

1568
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:11,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's coming, um, there's a listing for, uh, the, uh, let's see, Rockman X Soundbox on, uh, Rakuten.

1569
02:04:12,095 --> 02:04:18,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it looks like it's gonna be out for, wow, it's expensive, 12,600 yen, so basically 127 bucks.

1570
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:20,279
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of money.

1571
02:04:20,699 --> 02:04:21,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone get that for me and rip it.

1572
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:23,781
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1573
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

1574
02:04:26,222 --> 02:04:29,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have a game on my list, Rob, that I need to have.

1575
02:04:29,164 --> 02:04:31,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1576
02:04:32,475 --> 02:04:33,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, phone.

1577
02:04:33,196 --> 02:04:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob is playing with his phone during the show, everybody.

1578
02:04:36,438 --> 02:04:40,722
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a lot of people out there that still don't realize I do a show on Sunday nights.

1579
02:04:41,282 --> 02:04:42,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been doing it for 11 years.

1580
02:04:42,764 --> 02:04:44,325
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom knows I do a show on Sunday.

1581
02:04:46,775 --> 02:04:48,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on.

1582
02:04:48,756 --> 02:04:50,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1583
02:04:50,457 --> 02:04:53,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we go to our Facebook community and our Google Plus community.

1584
02:04:54,119 --> 02:04:57,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you slam those words together, you get Fugle.

1585
02:04:57,401 --> 02:04:59,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the Fugle Question of the Week.

1586
02:05:00,063 --> 02:05:01,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I don't have my music.

1587
02:05:01,664 --> 02:05:02,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my music?

1588
02:05:03,565 --> 02:05:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you took my music.

1589
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:08,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

1590
02:05:09,308 --> 02:05:09,989
[SPEAKER_04]: How did I lose that?

1591
02:05:10,569 --> 02:05:11,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not.

1592
02:05:11,209 --> 02:05:11,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1593
02:05:11,749 --> 02:05:11,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1594
02:05:12,069 --> 02:05:14,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so prepared.

1595
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:18,571
[SPEAKER_04]: See, getting these messages on the phone and everything just threw me off.

1596
02:05:19,751 --> 02:05:20,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't do shit.

1597
02:05:21,892 --> 02:05:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know shit.

1598
02:05:23,553 --> 02:05:23,933
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1599
02:05:23,973 --> 02:05:27,274
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to sit down and watch Showgirls with a bunch of crap food.

1600
02:05:27,494 --> 02:05:27,814
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

1601
02:05:28,714 --> 02:05:29,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1602
02:05:30,495 --> 02:05:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, here we go.

1603
02:05:31,355 --> 02:05:31,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find it yet?

1604
02:05:31,855 --> 02:05:32,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I found my bumper.

1605
02:05:32,735 --> 02:05:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1606
02:05:33,075 --> 02:05:33,956
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right here.

1607
02:05:40,882 --> 02:05:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, the Foogle Question of the Week.

1608
02:05:42,444 --> 02:05:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: We went with the obvious this week, with a lot of folks talking about the Steam Machine and all the related stuff.

1609
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:50,614
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?

1610
02:05:50,735 --> 02:05:53,198
[SPEAKER_04]: SteamOS, Steam Machine, and the Steam Controller.

1611
02:05:53,638 --> 02:05:57,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with Andy R., who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid.

1612
02:05:57,443 --> 02:06:00,004
[SPEAKER_04]: but I do want to try it and I'm pretty happy with my current PC.

1613
02:06:00,424 --> 02:06:02,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me.

1614
02:06:02,705 --> 02:06:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wait until we have more concrete details, machine specs, prices and so on until I pass further judgment.

1615
02:06:08,268 --> 02:06:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Signed up for the beta thingy though so I have at least a passing interest.

1616
02:06:11,889 --> 02:06:21,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw says I think SteamOS is perfect for those that like to build a home theater and PC in a small form factor with a good graphics card and play their Steam games on the HDTV.

1617
02:06:21,433 --> 02:06:22,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That presents a lot of opportunities.

1618
02:06:23,334 --> 02:06:25,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are those that want to play those Steam games but

1619
02:06:25,495 --> 02:06:27,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig.

1620
02:06:28,097 --> 02:06:30,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The Steam machine will be perfect for first-time PC gamers.

1621
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:33,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see what they can do with the Steam controller.

1622
02:06:33,161 --> 02:06:43,048
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that it has no thumbsticks but uses touchpad technology, I'm curious to how responsive the controls are given the tech is the kind you'd find in laptops, which is often not very responsive to touch.

1623
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:50,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Katsuhiko J says, that controller is something different for a change.

1624
02:06:50,174 --> 02:06:51,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to try it before I pass judgment.

1625
02:06:52,156 --> 02:06:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1626
02:06:52,576 --> 02:06:53,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be the next best thing.

1627
02:06:54,077 --> 02:06:56,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve made a bold move this past week.

1628
02:06:56,819 --> 02:06:58,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in their OS.

1629
02:06:59,001 --> 02:07:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris C says, I think spec-wise, the hardware in the Steam console would have to be on par with

1630
02:07:05,266 --> 02:07:08,647
[SPEAKER_04]: RedTheHaze left us with this too-long-didn't-read version, but you can read his full answer on Facebook.

1631
02:07:08,707 --> 02:07:10,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, Hmm, I like that perspective.

1632
02:07:34,157 --> 02:07:37,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Xiao says, uh, the Steam OS has my interest.

1633
02:07:37,839 --> 02:07:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not much of a controller.

1634
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not much of a controller.

1635
02:07:40,441 --> 02:07:43,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm a controller person, but I'd like to give it a shot.

1636
02:07:43,443 --> 02:07:45,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices.

1637
02:07:46,044 --> 02:07:48,506
[SPEAKER_04]: The Steam machines may have multiple price models.

1638
02:07:48,866 --> 02:07:51,848
[SPEAKER_04]: The OS is free, but surely they have an ideal on the controllers.

1639
02:07:52,168 --> 02:07:55,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't shut up and give you my money, Gabe, if you don't tell me how much you desire.

1640
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the third person I've seen say, we need a price.

1641
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:23,010
[SPEAKER_04]: UnfoldedRaptor said I heard nothing about Daft Punk being involved with the Steam Machine nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS so no sell for me yet Ragenator says it's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game given that I don't know too much on the stuff I did see a picture of the controller my initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd but hey if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box and give it a try I may end up liking it

1642
02:08:24,370 --> 02:08:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew G says... That's actually 23rd Magus.

1643
02:08:27,971 --> 02:08:28,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him?

1644
02:08:28,971 --> 02:08:29,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's he been lately?

1645
02:08:31,412 --> 02:08:31,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Working.

1646
02:08:32,652 --> 02:08:35,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he needs to work his way on over here to a Sunday night show.

1647
02:08:35,413 --> 02:08:38,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, The Gabe Cube... I like that name for it.

1648
02:08:38,474 --> 02:08:41,815
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gabe Cube looks promising for those who would rather not self-build.

1649
02:08:42,115 --> 02:08:44,796
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles.

1650
02:08:45,176 --> 02:08:45,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Time will tell.

1651
02:08:46,856 --> 02:08:48,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the answer here from PekerJr92 says...

1652
02:08:49,837 --> 02:08:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1653
02:09:11,303 --> 02:09:30,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman says honestly it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do and yes it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC but I'm not sold yet I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party and Eddie K says if Half-Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console I'm not buying one

1654
02:09:32,623 --> 02:09:35,706
[SPEAKER_04]: and let's see, going to Google Plus.

1655
02:09:36,566 --> 02:09:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week.

1656
02:09:38,688 --> 02:09:39,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually don't have this many.

1657
02:09:40,049 --> 02:09:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me start with Travis H. who says, Speechless with excitement.

1658
02:09:44,755 --> 02:09:54,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaco Jones says, I think SteamOS is cool, but as for the Steam machine itself, there was nothing to convince me I should buy that instead of just running SteamOS on my PC as a partition or however it would work.

1659
02:09:54,642 --> 02:09:56,423
[SPEAKER_04]: The controller looks like it would not work for me.

1660
02:09:56,683 --> 02:09:59,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play.

1661
02:10:00,365 --> 02:10:06,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page and the family sharing option, well, need to use logic more.

1662
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:08,551
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hold on, Actdeft.

1663
02:10:08,731 --> 02:10:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so easy to say in retrospect, but why didn't you call the 123 last week then, huh?

1664
02:10:14,935 --> 02:10:18,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see at least the Steam Box and maybe the Steam OS.

1665
02:10:18,718 --> 02:10:27,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I kind of thought that the Steam Box announcement would have been kind of combined with... Actually, like they said before, it pretty much could have been all one announcement.

1666
02:10:27,946 --> 02:10:30,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't really need to separate... Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said, yeah.

1667
02:10:31,049 --> 02:10:32,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have just been all one.

1668
02:10:32,109 --> 02:10:32,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway...

1669
02:10:33,231 --> 02:10:36,234
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion about the whole thing is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this.

1670
02:10:36,494 --> 02:10:40,539
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making the Steam machine pretty much an entertainment console, like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.

1671
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:47,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And since they're developing their own OS for it, and yeah, I know it's Linux-based, but still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff and cost-effective too.

1672
02:10:47,728 --> 02:10:51,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention being able to stream all your library in case your game doesn't support Linux.

1673
02:10:53,315 --> 02:11:03,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, going over to Evil, E3VL, says, from what I see, the SteamOS is basically countering Windows, as in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system like Apple's App Store.

1674
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:07,227
[SPEAKER_04]: SteamOS is essentially an open system like Google Android.

1675
02:11:07,687 --> 02:11:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting comparison.

1676
02:11:09,328 --> 02:11:14,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now, no one needs PC laptops in the future aside for gaming.

1677
02:11:15,411 --> 02:11:18,912
[SPEAKER_04]: SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs in the future.

1678
02:11:19,492 --> 02:11:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability.

1679
02:11:21,973 --> 02:11:27,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Current PC gamers may adopt it, but Steam is lending out the OS for third-party vendors to create Steam Machines.

1680
02:11:27,415 --> 02:11:34,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a problem, and quite possibly a huge gamble depending on how their hardware is marketed and priced relative to consoles.

1681
02:11:34,959 --> 02:11:46,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS to third-party developers, you get those companies like Alienware and stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there.

1682
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:46,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the

1683
02:11:50,454 --> 02:11:52,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Junk programs with a brand new PC they buy.

1684
02:11:52,916 --> 02:11:56,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials and stuff like that.

1685
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,765
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to have all that, but with Dell, you get that a lot.

1686
02:12:00,805 --> 02:12:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with my Asus computers, there's a lot of Asus programs in there.

1687
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:11,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just worried to get all that bogged down in the SteamOS, and it's going to just be like a Windows PC again.

1688
02:12:11,976 --> 02:12:18,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Redertainment says, The Steam OS seems to be tailored for people who have or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming.

1689
02:12:19,062 --> 02:12:21,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem is, most people don't use their PC like that.

1690
02:12:21,464 --> 02:12:26,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people have PCs they use for work, music, movies, games, and general dicking around on the internet.

1691
02:12:26,348 --> 02:12:27,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, porn.

1692
02:12:27,428 --> 02:12:30,371
[SPEAKER_04]: If people want a device that is only for video games, they buy a console.

1693
02:12:30,771 --> 02:12:31,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really look at this.

1694
02:12:31,832 --> 02:12:32,552
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

1695
02:12:32,573 --> 02:12:36,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs.

1696
02:12:36,676 --> 02:12:37,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But hold on.

1697
02:12:37,877 --> 02:12:39,718
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy leaves a lot of tongue-in-cheek answers, though.

1698
02:12:39,738 --> 02:12:39,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1699
02:12:40,178 --> 02:12:40,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn.

1700
02:12:41,059 --> 02:12:44,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of the advanced haptic feedback that they have with that.

1701
02:12:46,043 --> 02:12:47,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Advanced haptic feedback.

1702
02:12:48,865 --> 02:12:51,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Redertainment says the rest of his answer here.

1703
02:12:51,827 --> 02:12:58,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really look at the Steam machine or the Steam controller as I do not plan to make any major purchases until I accomplish Project Buy a House.

1704
02:12:59,613 --> 02:13:12,132
[SPEAKER_03]: and in fact it has a little touch screen on there you could probably stream porn to that while you play like Team Fortress 2 or something you can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2 first thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday porn

1705
02:13:14,449 --> 02:13:15,630
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1706
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:20,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some longer news here, and we'll get to the Skype line here hopefully before too long.

1707
02:13:20,413 --> 02:13:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1708
02:13:24,937 --> 02:13:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

1709
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so there was an announcement this week that first leaked out, and then they kind of made their own announcement.

1710
02:13:32,502 --> 02:13:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Something coming to Xbox One is Xbox Fitness and it's going to be an app that uses Kinect and what's kind of cool about it though is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there including Insanity and I want to say P90X is one of the other ones that's in there.

1711
02:13:49,569 --> 02:13:50,650
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of different trainers.

1712
02:13:51,230 --> 02:14:04,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of interesting, though, because I guess the app will be free for Gold members through December 2014, although it says there's some additional content that you can purchase for it.

1713
02:14:04,517 --> 02:14:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess in 2015, Unlimited Access will also require a separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee, as well as Xbox Gold.

1714
02:14:15,043 --> 02:14:16,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Junkie

1715
02:14:36,348 --> 02:14:45,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's probably a little better than was it that Xbox, the Nike one that they had last year that was kind of lame.

1716
02:14:45,454 --> 02:14:49,517
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks a little bit along the lines of kind of what they were trying to do with that.

1717
02:14:49,897 --> 02:14:54,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate and all those features that they were touting before.

1718
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:57,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But it might be cool.

1719
02:14:57,382 --> 02:15:03,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the trainers to be noted, Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton, and Sean T. So...

1720
02:15:05,063 --> 02:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of cool, I guess.

1721
02:15:06,764 --> 02:15:11,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really my thing because, you know, I eat hamburgers.

1722
02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:13,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1723
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:15,451
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, not today.

1724
02:15:15,491 --> 02:15:16,171
[SPEAKER_08]: You had chicken nuggets.

1725
02:15:16,652 --> 02:15:17,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1726
02:15:18,953 --> 02:15:20,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though, about Xbox Fitness.

1727
02:15:21,195 --> 02:15:24,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we already have a million fucking fitness games on the Xbox?

1728
02:15:25,098 --> 02:15:30,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know this is for the new one, but doesn't the Kinect need to get out of this rut of dance and fitness games?

1729
02:15:31,143 --> 02:15:32,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, show me something new.

1730
02:15:33,264 --> 02:15:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, yeah.

1731
02:15:34,225 --> 02:15:35,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's about one or two every year.

1732
02:15:35,846 --> 02:15:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's Zumba.

1733
02:15:36,707 --> 02:15:37,968
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new Zumba game this year.

1734
02:15:38,008 --> 02:15:46,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's only really about one, maybe two fitness games a year for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.

1735
02:15:47,675 --> 02:15:49,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it's been about one a year.

1736
02:15:50,497 --> 02:15:51,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a ton.

1737
02:15:52,419 --> 02:15:53,480
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean...

1738
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:58,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really the only games that kind of effectively use the Kinect.

1739
02:15:58,201 --> 02:16:00,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect has been kind of crap.

1740
02:16:00,462 --> 02:16:02,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1741
02:16:02,903 --> 02:16:10,405
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they're saying different workouts, I guess from 10 minutes to an hour.

1742
02:16:11,425 --> 02:16:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have little routines that you can do and stuff.

1743
02:16:14,106 --> 02:16:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming this is tracked across all the different ones you have.

1744
02:16:18,988 --> 02:16:21,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Metamorphosis, they've got that in there as well.

1745
02:16:21,548 --> 02:16:23,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Ripped in 30 from Jillian Michaels.

1746
02:16:24,049 --> 02:16:27,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know if you've got a fitness program that you're really into.

1747
02:16:27,614 --> 02:16:37,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, once again, though, like Insanity, unless you're like one of those people that just borrowed that set or something, like if you already have it, you've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks for it.

1748
02:16:38,588 --> 02:16:40,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably not going to need this.

1749
02:16:41,672 --> 02:16:41,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1750
02:16:42,333 --> 02:16:45,495
[SPEAKER_04]: S2C100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com has a good point.

1751
02:16:45,595 --> 02:16:47,015
[SPEAKER_04]: The fitness things sell really well.

1752
02:16:47,156 --> 02:16:48,836
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't stray too far from your cash cow.

1753
02:16:49,317 --> 02:16:57,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about it though, I mean, if you are getting an Xbox One anyways, this is pretty much free since you're probably paying for gold to play it, you know, online multiplayer, so...

1754
02:16:58,482 --> 02:16:58,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1755
02:16:59,022 --> 02:16:59,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

1756
02:17:00,703 --> 02:17:03,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be cool.

1757
02:17:03,406 --> 02:17:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to other features on the Xbox One.

1758
02:17:05,367 --> 02:17:11,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The Game DVR will work on Xbox Live at launch, but YouTube and Facebook sharing won't be enabled until 2014.

1759
02:17:13,214 --> 02:17:14,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's what Game DVR does.

1760
02:17:15,335 --> 02:17:19,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Game DVR will save the previous five minutes of gameplay if you use a voice command.

1761
02:17:20,136 --> 02:17:21,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox record.

1762
02:17:21,577 --> 02:17:27,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can edit the piece in the upload studio and then share it, which would be the YouTube Facebook thing later.

1763
02:17:27,699 --> 02:17:31,380
[SPEAKER_04]: These clips are saved in 720p at 30 frames a second.

1764
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Game DVR will only work if you have Xbox Live Gold.

1765
02:17:35,921 --> 02:17:37,001
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

1766
02:17:37,021 --> 02:17:37,782
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it's going to work.

1767
02:17:37,942 --> 02:17:38,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds dumb.

1768
02:17:39,062 --> 02:17:49,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, because it's saying that you have to do Xbox record and then it records something, whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where... Well, no, because it says previous five minutes of gameplay if you say Xbox record.

1769
02:17:49,132 --> 02:17:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thought is if something funny happens and you say that, you can go back and edit it in the studio.

1770
02:17:54,517 --> 02:17:55,378
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my thought.

1771
02:17:55,438 --> 02:17:59,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, if something really funny happens, you have a chance to react and say Xbox record, and that way it'll save it.

1772
02:18:00,523 --> 02:18:00,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1773
02:18:01,226 --> 02:18:01,486
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1774
02:18:28,948 --> 02:18:30,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm critiquing that image.

1775
02:18:31,372 --> 02:18:37,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, first of all, they have it like it's levitating, but it's at the wrong angle for the level of shadow that they have.

1776
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:38,061
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1777
02:18:38,101 --> 02:18:40,985
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox One picture that was on the article you were just reading.

1778
02:18:41,165 --> 02:18:43,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever does their press materials needs to like...

1779
02:18:44,178 --> 02:18:45,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back and relearn Photoshop or something.

1780
02:18:45,399 --> 02:18:45,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1781
02:18:46,099 --> 02:18:49,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Levitating consoles are so like PlayStation 3.

1782
02:18:49,601 --> 02:18:52,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was the evil baby that made the console levitate.

1783
02:18:53,103 --> 02:18:56,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the levitating console that made the evil baby.

1784
02:18:56,284 --> 02:18:56,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1785
02:18:56,544 --> 02:19:02,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So EA Sports has put out a statement saying that they are no longer making college games.

1786
02:19:04,228 --> 02:19:08,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, their general manager, Cam Weber, and... I'm sorry, of American...

1787
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:25,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Who basically the one in charge of all the American football games Basically is saying that the college sports games are going away That's meaning the NCAA games They're also, which they themselves put out an announcement That they're letting their license expire in 2014

1788
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:50,988
[SPEAKER_08]: and EA is not pursuing it so they are not going to be doing any more college football as in American football and not the real football that you actually play with your feet and they are not doing any other college games that basically they're letting it go bye and the rest of us are like whoopty shit

1789
02:19:51,738 --> 02:20:08,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm surprised though, because that does kind of suck, because it was a pretty big revenue stream for them, even though there was a lot of... You have to remember, for me, I'm always like, okay, but college football is a way bigger deal in other places than it is here.

1790
02:20:08,524 --> 02:20:14,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and in July, it really is pretty much the biggest game, only big game coming out.

1791
02:20:14,126 --> 02:20:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's going to be this big debt area, which hopefully will be filled by something else, but you know...

1792
02:20:18,288 --> 02:20:19,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm from Alabama.

1793
02:20:19,969 --> 02:20:25,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And the biggest thing in the universe there is the rivalry between the University of Alabama and Auburn University.

1794
02:20:26,091 --> 02:20:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know people who will probably be, well, I want my game this year!

1795
02:20:31,393 --> 02:20:38,876
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and, um... There's all there is to do in Alabama is college football and eat crawdads.

1796
02:20:40,817 --> 02:20:41,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1797
02:20:43,298 --> 02:20:45,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they couldn't, I don't know... Go to church.

1798
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of disappointing, but at first I thought they were just going to put out a college football game and be like EA Sports College Football, drop the NCAA thing and just do whatever.

1799
02:20:56,537 --> 02:20:59,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think that they would do something like that where they just make a game anyway, but...

1800
02:21:00,549 --> 02:21:00,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1801
02:21:00,849 --> 02:21:01,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1802
02:21:21,581 --> 02:21:22,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll settle for $40 million.

1803
02:21:23,142 --> 02:21:34,451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably why they're not doing a college game because they got into trouble and there was a whole lawsuit against them for using the likenesses of these different players without actually giving them any sort of compensation for it.

1804
02:21:35,753 --> 02:21:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, of course, $40 million, how exactly it's going to be split up, who knows, but probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game.

1805
02:21:44,299 --> 02:21:44,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1806
02:21:45,799 --> 02:21:50,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it sucks for the fans, you know, even though I say like, well, that isn't really a big deal around these parts.

1807
02:21:50,363 --> 02:21:54,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand there are some and I don't even really play these football games to begin with if it's not like tech mobile.

1808
02:21:55,267 --> 02:21:58,569
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand where people would be upset about this.

1809
02:21:58,749 --> 02:22:02,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sucks for, you know, that group that looks forward to these games every year.

1810
02:22:03,593 --> 02:22:05,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't happy when DDR died.

1811
02:22:06,475 --> 02:22:28,680
[SPEAKER_03]: well all they would have to do is just give up some of their profits I would think couldn't they have just licensed the actual player likenesses and you know pay the extra money or you know that would be too uh honest and so they can't do that how much would they have to have paid for all of those individual players versus what they paid out in uh fees for the settlement

1812
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:32,384
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says they could do something like what 2K did to get football back.

1813
02:22:42,202 --> 02:22:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll have something.

1814
02:22:43,342 --> 02:22:48,404
[SPEAKER_03]: After all, remember, they tried to do NFL Blitz so they could have another type of football game.

1815
02:22:48,644 --> 02:22:55,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, they even experimented a little with rugby a while back, but arena football even.

1816
02:22:55,486 --> 02:22:56,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1817
02:22:56,087 --> 02:22:57,227
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do some more stuff.

1818
02:22:57,247 --> 02:22:59,388
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a puppy bowl game?

1819
02:23:00,368 --> 02:23:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1820
02:23:01,168 --> 02:23:05,050
[SPEAKER_03]: There was already Jerry Rice and Nidus dog football.

1821
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:05,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1822
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:06,250
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii.

1823
02:23:06,610 --> 02:23:07,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

1824
02:23:07,390 --> 02:23:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because it was on the Wii.

1825
02:23:10,009 --> 02:23:14,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin with all the other late Wii games.

1826
02:23:14,733 --> 02:23:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see Puppy Bowl.

1827
02:23:16,494 --> 02:23:20,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, get on that.

1828
02:23:21,138 --> 02:23:23,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that they have this team freed up, they can make a Wii U game.

1829
02:23:28,638 --> 02:23:29,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alright.

1830
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:30,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1831
02:23:31,602 --> 02:23:35,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game that I'm actually legit really excited to play this game.

1832
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: South Park, The Stick of Truth.

1833
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:39,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks awesome.

1834
02:23:40,575 --> 02:23:40,895
[SPEAKER_04]: December 10th

1835
02:23:58,908 --> 02:24:00,229
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, do you have any interest in this?

1836
02:24:20,883 --> 02:24:21,384
[SPEAKER_03]: When Evil Rises

1837
02:24:56,727 --> 02:24:58,187
[SPEAKER_08]: There is only one of them.

1838
02:24:58,207 --> 02:24:58,668
New kid?

1839
02:24:58,728 --> 02:24:59,108
[SPEAKER_05]: New kid.

1840
02:24:59,328 --> 02:25:01,328
[SPEAKER_05]: The new kid has a power we have yet to understand.

1841
02:25:02,449 --> 02:25:03,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can save us?

1842
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:15,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Step forward now and fulfill your d-d-d- And fulfill your d-d-d-d- The audio on this is low, sorry guys.

1843
02:25:15,532 --> 02:25:17,813
[SPEAKER_07]: You have some incredible ability to make friends quickly, new kid.

1844
02:25:18,093 --> 02:25:20,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my greatest warriors.

1845
02:25:25,416 --> 02:25:26,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yay, Mr. Slave's in it.

1846
02:25:27,178 --> 02:25:33,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Slave has a finishing move where he jumps on one of the enemies and it sucks them into his ass.

1847
02:25:35,648 --> 02:25:38,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a trap!

1848
02:25:38,211 --> 02:25:41,635
[SPEAKER_05]: You're playing for the wrong side, dude.

1849
02:25:41,675 --> 02:25:43,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Defenders of freedom!

1850
02:25:43,538 --> 02:25:45,600
Tonight, we're united!

1851
02:25:54,344 --> 02:25:58,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pain, but this is the kind of stuff you put up with living in a remote little mountain town.

1852
02:25:59,109 --> 02:26:00,531
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we don't have to deal with traffic.

1853
02:26:04,171 --> 02:26:05,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's why I'm looking forward to the Stick of Truth.

1854
02:26:05,992 --> 02:26:08,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there really should have been another South Park movie.

1855
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:13,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have ever laughed harder in the theater in my life.

1856
02:26:13,676 --> 02:26:15,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't there the Imaginary Funland or whatever?

1857
02:26:15,897 --> 02:26:18,299
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like a three episode arc of the show.

1858
02:26:18,339 --> 02:26:18,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, whatever.

1859
02:26:19,059 --> 02:26:20,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't nearly as good as the movie.

1860
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:25,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of feel like this is the next closest thing we're getting to a new movie.

1861
02:26:25,022 --> 02:26:26,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was all in-game.

1862
02:26:26,303 --> 02:26:26,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1863
02:26:26,784 --> 02:26:31,931
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it looks just like the actual, um, the actual show, so.

1864
02:26:32,311 --> 02:26:33,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty sweet.

1865
02:26:33,213 --> 02:26:33,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1866
02:26:34,334 --> 02:26:34,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1867
02:26:35,115 --> 02:26:40,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, uh, we would be usually moving on to the mailbag at this point, except, uh,

1868
02:26:40,819 --> 02:26:42,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Jack and shit.

1869
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:42,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1870
02:26:42,660 --> 02:26:43,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jack left town.

1871
02:26:44,601 --> 02:26:51,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So let us use this music as a little opportunity to remind y'all that it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1872
02:26:51,925 --> 02:26:52,886
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you use it.

1873
02:26:53,046 --> 02:26:53,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1874
02:26:53,746 --> 02:26:57,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we can't hear you, then you don't get one.

1875
02:26:57,408 --> 02:27:01,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise I will at least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on.

1876
02:27:02,271 --> 02:27:02,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

1877
02:27:03,211 --> 02:27:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: One.

1878
02:27:03,652 --> 02:27:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag.

1879
02:27:04,812 --> 02:27:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

1880
02:27:05,353 --> 02:27:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's M-A-I-L-B-A-G

1881
02:27:10,542 --> 02:27:12,463
[SPEAKER_04]: at OrangeDonesRadio.com.

1882
02:27:13,444 --> 02:27:13,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

1883
02:27:14,745 --> 02:27:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

1884
02:27:15,685 --> 02:27:18,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the dot separates the Orange Dones Radio and the com.

1885
02:27:21,589 --> 02:27:21,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1886
02:27:22,590 --> 02:27:22,890
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1887
02:27:23,350 --> 02:27:24,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, you didn't even.

1888
02:27:26,072 --> 02:27:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you mean it.

1889
02:27:27,432 --> 02:27:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearts.

1890
02:27:28,593 --> 02:27:28,993
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1891
02:27:29,454 --> 02:27:30,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it then.

1892
02:27:30,915 --> 02:27:32,435
[SPEAKER_04]: No emails this week for us to read.

1893
02:27:32,495 --> 02:27:38,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, I guess this next segment will just have to be doubled to make up for the time.

1894
02:27:53,482 --> 02:27:54,603
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs of the week time.

1895
02:27:55,383 --> 02:27:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a couple.

1896
02:27:57,023 --> 02:28:07,668
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to the asshole wasp, which all wasps are assholes, but this one was extra asshole by inviting himself into my car and poking his butt in my finger.

1897
02:28:08,728 --> 02:28:14,450
[SPEAKER_08]: That was really rude, and I'm really allergic, and thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to Bimmy Girl.

1898
02:28:15,011 --> 02:28:17,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So, fuck you, wasp.

1899
02:28:17,171 --> 02:28:18,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck all wasps.

1900
02:28:18,752 --> 02:28:21,694
[SPEAKER_08]: The only good thing they do is eat plant-destroying caterpillars.

1901
02:28:21,814 --> 02:28:22,194
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1902
02:28:22,635 --> 02:28:24,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's other bugs that will do that too, and birds.

1903
02:28:25,036 --> 02:28:26,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So fuck them.

1904
02:28:28,719 --> 02:28:37,364
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also an F you to having certain illusions of mind shattered because I like to think better of my relatives.

1905
02:28:38,665 --> 02:28:42,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And then every so often they'll just say something that's completely dickish and rude and...

1906
02:28:44,397 --> 02:28:45,117
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll see you next time.

1907
02:29:12,092 --> 02:29:21,199
[SPEAKER_08]: and also F you to the bitch that wouldn't let me over even though I signaled for like ages and then every time I'd speed up, she'd speed up.

1908
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:26,604
[SPEAKER_08]: The three people weaving in and out of traffic and the cop that didn't pull any of them over.

1909
02:29:26,684 --> 02:29:27,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck all of them.

1910
02:29:28,065 --> 02:29:28,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them all.

1911
02:29:29,226 --> 02:29:34,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though it's not a fuck you, because I'm PMS-y today, so I'm just completely taking over this whole segment.

1912
02:29:35,331 --> 02:29:39,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to say I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck eggs was not at...

1913
02:29:41,553 --> 02:29:42,114
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing?

1914
02:29:43,375 --> 02:29:44,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep going.

1915
02:29:44,296 --> 02:29:51,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well there's a guy who sells duck eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted to buy duck eggs and he wasn't there and I was disappointed.

1916
02:29:52,304 --> 02:29:53,445
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rachel bought a rabbit.

1917
02:29:54,266 --> 02:29:54,827
[SPEAKER_08]: A dead rabbit.

1918
02:29:55,067 --> 02:29:55,848
[SPEAKER_08]: A wascally wabbit?

1919
02:29:56,068 --> 02:29:57,049
[SPEAKER_08]: A frozen dead rabbit.

1920
02:29:57,349 --> 02:29:57,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor rabbit.

1921
02:29:58,130 --> 02:29:59,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm, rabbit's delicious.

1922
02:29:59,631 --> 02:30:01,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was rabbit season and not duck season?

1923
02:30:04,617 --> 02:30:04,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1924
02:30:07,116 --> 02:30:08,057
[SPEAKER_08]: It was rabbit season.

1925
02:30:08,117 --> 02:30:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

1926
02:30:08,577 --> 02:30:09,597
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I was trying to cue up.

1927
02:30:09,637 --> 02:30:12,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Since you're having an extra angsty week, DarkSakura.

1928
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:20,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the PMS march.

1929
02:30:23,285 --> 02:30:26,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I am legit PMSing, so F you to cramps.

1930
02:30:27,348 --> 02:30:27,848
[SPEAKER_08]: TMI.

1931
02:30:28,388 --> 02:30:28,688
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1932
02:30:28,768 --> 02:30:29,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

1933
02:30:30,089 --> 02:30:36,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, guys in the universe, women get cramps, we get bitchy,

1934
02:30:37,847 --> 02:30:38,908
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain has a cramp now.

1935
02:30:38,928 --> 02:30:39,569
[SPEAKER_08]: My job has been done.

1936
02:30:55,618 --> 02:30:56,219
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki.

1937
02:30:57,780 --> 02:31:05,485
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to YouTube's content ID service, which is so fantastic that they... Hey, did you know that you're using licensed music in your stuff?

1938
02:31:06,066 --> 02:31:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Accept this copyright claim or deny it or contest it.

1939
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:12,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I will choose option three.

1940
02:31:12,371 --> 02:31:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Do nothing is what I will do.

1941
02:31:14,369 --> 02:31:22,575
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's great though because on one of the videos I did get that on, or that flag on, was one of the ones I used an audio swap thanks to YouTube.

1942
02:31:22,595 --> 02:31:26,078
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, YouTube allows you to audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve.

1943
02:31:27,419 --> 02:31:34,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know it's licensed music because you told me to use that music instead of the licensed music that I had in that before.

1944
02:31:34,824 --> 02:31:39,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Our pal Travis from Under Station Live unfortunately deals with this a lot.

1945
02:31:39,547 --> 02:31:47,491
[SPEAKER_04]: If he even uses a little bit of a song in his hour and a half long Under Station Live that goes up on YouTube, they flag it.

1946
02:31:47,631 --> 02:31:49,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he had to change the intro of the show.

1947
02:31:49,692 --> 02:31:51,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, come on.

1948
02:31:52,233 --> 02:31:52,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

1949
02:31:53,294 --> 02:31:53,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

1950
02:31:54,074 --> 02:31:54,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And they scan that.

1951
02:31:55,035 --> 02:31:55,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do they do?

1952
02:31:55,855 --> 02:32:00,537
[SPEAKER_03]: They scan all these videos and they just send it to these music people so that they can just complain about it.

1953
02:32:00,557 --> 02:32:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: What they should do is just have a service that if these lawyers or whoever find these videos and infringe upon it, then yes, they can do a copyright thing.

1954
02:32:09,582 --> 02:32:16,645
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, I don't believe the copyright content ID thing is actually a copyright claim by them.

1955
02:32:17,525 --> 02:32:20,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does sometimes block it from mobile apps and stuff.

1956
02:32:20,408 --> 02:32:23,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I tried watching my video on a mobile app and you can't see it.

1957
02:32:24,231 --> 02:32:31,636
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that because YouTube pulled one of his videos where he was using a copyrighted thing but it was under fair use.

1958
02:32:31,956 --> 02:32:33,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I'm a copyright lawyer.

1959
02:32:33,738 --> 02:32:34,979
[SPEAKER_03]: This was fair for me to do.

1960
02:32:35,259 --> 02:32:36,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's suing YouTube.

1961
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:36,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good.

1962
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:37,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully...

1963
02:32:38,021 --> 02:32:38,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it!

1964
02:32:38,181 --> 02:32:38,482
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1965
02:32:38,502 --> 02:32:39,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've got.

1966
02:32:55,416 --> 02:32:56,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1967
02:32:57,977 --> 02:33:05,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a premature F you for trying to figure out how to make this case for my controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard.

1968
02:33:05,878 --> 02:33:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking I may need to do vacuum forming plastic, which is going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig to cook it.

1969
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:16,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I have to build an oven and then some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff.

1970
02:33:18,281 --> 02:33:19,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's all I got.

1971
02:33:21,464 --> 02:33:29,869
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week just goes to the fact that there's a show in two weeks and even though it'll be great, I'm just like, stress!

1972
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that'll pass like things usually do.

1973
02:33:35,072 --> 02:33:40,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go back to a few more news stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line.

1974
02:33:41,676 --> 02:33:43,999
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1975
02:33:56,793 --> 02:33:59,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they're saying that, hey, you know what?

1976
02:33:59,194 --> 02:34:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: We can actually use this to stream these games to other consoles or other devices like PCs, TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones, tablets.

1977
02:34:08,019 --> 02:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, their ultimate goal is to be able to stream those stuff, you know, those things to other devices.

1978
02:34:15,743 --> 02:34:21,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be kind of funny if you could play a PlayStation 4 game with an Xbox One, you know, if they had some sort of website or something you can go to the stream this stuff.

1979
02:34:24,246 --> 02:34:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: that would just be ridiculous although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through the Xbox One's HDMI in and create some sort of black hole of death with that I don't know it'll be neat but once again we'll have to see how the SkyKai service works once it does launch next year for at least North America we can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy indeed indeed

1980
02:34:52,392 --> 02:34:55,236
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, one more story for you guys and we'll open up the Skype line.

1981
02:34:55,276 --> 02:34:59,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is about, actually, I think Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show, but that's all right.

1982
02:34:59,943 --> 02:35:01,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll recap it for y'all anyway.

1983
02:35:02,327 --> 02:35:05,251
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, of course, out of Orlando, Florida.

1984
02:35:05,772 --> 02:35:06,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Only in Florida, people.

1985
02:35:07,394 --> 02:35:08,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Only in Florida.

1986
02:35:08,736 --> 02:35:15,059
[SPEAKER_04]: A nine-year-old boy made a court appearance on school weapon charges and was sentenced to home confinement.

1987
02:35:15,919 --> 02:35:20,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Officials said that the boy brought multiple weapons to the school at Hunter's Creek Wednesday.

1988
02:35:21,041 --> 02:35:24,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is going to tie into video games eventually, folks.

1989
02:35:24,903 --> 02:35:25,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Bear with me here.

1990
02:35:26,003 --> 02:35:30,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Officers searched the bag and found a handgun, six bullets, a steak knife, and a sledgehammer.

1991
02:35:31,406 --> 02:35:39,197
[SPEAKER_04]: The guns all came from the father's home and the boy is ordered to home confinement and said the parents need to keep any and all weapons away from him.

1992
02:35:39,999 --> 02:35:45,346
[SPEAKER_04]: The boy's father said he was playing a character he learned from a video game.

1993
02:35:47,089 --> 02:35:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: of course he was

1994
02:36:12,378 --> 02:36:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Grand Theft Auto, people!

1995
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft.

1996
02:36:15,501 --> 02:36:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game, right?

1997
02:36:18,504 --> 02:36:25,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And there really is no story to Minecraft aside from there's a guy named Steve and there's zombies.

1998
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:28,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so... Yeah, I don't know.

1999
02:36:29,395 --> 02:36:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2000
02:36:32,293 --> 02:36:32,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dumb.

2001
02:36:33,054 --> 02:36:34,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no guns even in that.

2002
02:36:35,434 --> 02:36:42,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like how the boy's father is pretending to be in the game.

2003
02:36:42,757 --> 02:36:49,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, oh, why do I have all these guns available so my nine-year-old can pick up a gun and bring it to school.

2004
02:36:49,659 --> 02:36:52,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, PacDeft in the chatroom says, Irresponsible parents.

2005
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:52,840
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2006
02:36:52,881 --> 02:36:53,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not to blame.

2007
02:36:53,621 --> 02:36:55,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the video game that teaches them all the bad stuff.

2008
02:36:56,522 --> 02:36:57,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2009
02:36:58,291 --> 02:37:22,937
[SPEAKER_08]: no it's and even so even if you know they've allowed their child exposure to the game they've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons I want to know why CPS isn't involved okay let's see SSJ100 Matt says please please someone hijack a horse and blame it on Barbie's horse adventure I'll do it or imagine horses

2010
02:37:24,915 --> 02:37:25,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

2011
02:37:25,515 --> 02:37:27,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club.

2012
02:37:27,576 --> 02:37:27,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2013
02:37:28,476 --> 02:37:30,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll name it Politary and beat her.

2014
02:37:31,417 --> 02:37:32,657
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't do that to a real horse.

2015
02:37:32,677 --> 02:37:33,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so stupid, though.

2016
02:37:33,437 --> 02:37:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why we even allow these excuses to, you know, that's about as valid an excuse as, like, the voices in my head told me to do it.

2017
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

2018
02:37:42,580 --> 02:37:44,580
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone said that, you're going to be like, okay, that's ridiculous.

2019
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:47,501
[SPEAKER_03]: But if, like, you know, oh, the video game told them to do it.

2020
02:37:47,801 --> 02:37:49,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, that makes sense.

2021
02:37:50,342 --> 02:37:51,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, what is wrong with people?

2022
02:37:52,102 --> 02:37:52,982
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a witch!

2023
02:37:54,043 --> 02:37:54,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, must be.

2024
02:37:57,084 --> 02:37:57,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2025
02:37:58,565 --> 02:38:00,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for our stories tonight.

2026
02:38:00,686 --> 02:38:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the Skype line and open it up.

2027
02:38:02,727 --> 02:38:07,350
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.

2028
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:12,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight or maybe there's something we missed that you would like to bring up.

2029
02:38:13,126 --> 02:38:15,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain.

2030
02:38:16,668 --> 02:38:25,913
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, I think, the most recent Milli Vanilli reference I have seen in the last... I know the first reference to them I've seen in maybe the last five years.

2031
02:38:26,353 --> 02:38:28,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since that guy passed away, probably.

2032
02:38:29,575 --> 02:38:30,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

2033
02:38:30,675 --> 02:38:31,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And not even from this country.

2034
02:38:32,496 --> 02:38:33,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a couple tweets.

2035
02:38:34,517 --> 02:38:39,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of them, but we do have a few from... I thought we had had some earlier in the week.

2036
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:41,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.

2037
02:38:42,001 --> 02:38:46,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry if I missed yours because it was too early in the week, but we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight.

2038
02:38:46,924 --> 02:38:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is that China will be ending a decade-long ban on game consoles.

2039
02:38:51,206 --> 02:38:56,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea that they had this ban in place because I thought there were knockoff consoles and stuff that they sold in Japan.

2040
02:38:56,813 --> 02:39:00,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't the V something they sold in China?

2041
02:39:00,197 --> 02:39:04,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it was some sort of weird TV console thing.

2042
02:39:04,082 --> 02:39:07,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the restrictions were exactly.

2043
02:39:07,475 --> 02:39:12,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that and Hong Kong was not under Chinese authority for the longest time.

2044
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:14,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And why was the ban in place in China?

2045
02:39:14,963 --> 02:39:15,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Communism!

2046
02:39:16,004 --> 02:39:20,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was concern for the effects that games might have on young people.

2047
02:39:20,789 --> 02:39:23,351
[SPEAKER_04]: But the group was persuaded because...

2048
02:39:24,292 --> 02:39:27,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming on computers and internet cafes is taken off across China or whatever.

2049
02:39:28,953 --> 02:39:34,475
[SPEAKER_04]: There will soon be consoles sold as part of new rules in a free trade zone in Shanghai.

2050
02:39:34,935 --> 02:39:37,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know when the consoles will go on sale, but there you go.

2051
02:39:39,696 --> 02:39:47,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that means Xbox and PlayStation 3 necessarily, but probably some local gaming devices there.

2052
02:39:48,759 --> 02:39:50,479
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about something based on the Xbox.

2053
02:39:53,621 --> 02:39:55,083
[SPEAKER_04]: but not called the best pad.

2054
02:39:56,024 --> 02:40:04,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That again from a tweet that Tiger Claw sent us and one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2055
02:40:05,674 --> 02:40:11,700
[SPEAKER_04]: One other article here from Tiger Claw says Nintendo teaming up with Tesco for a Wii U fight back.

2056
02:40:14,482 --> 02:40:31,453
[SPEAKER_04]: ah so let's see Nintendo said in an interview with MCV that too many people are unaware that the Wii U is a new console and they're going to do a giant campaign to educate people including Wii owners about this console they've booked in-store space at Tesco which is in the UK sending out a

2057
02:40:32,493 --> 02:40:40,656
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 page leaflet to 300,000 Tesco customers that have bought a Wii but haven't bought another console and give vouchers away that will allow money off of games.

2058
02:40:40,996 --> 02:40:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: There will also be TV ads for Mario, Donkey Kong and Zelda which will run continuously from half term until Christmas.

2059
02:40:48,644 --> 02:40:49,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they know.

2060
02:40:49,765 --> 02:40:50,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think they don't care.

2061
02:40:51,766 --> 02:40:55,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think they really see that must-have game, but then there's Mario.

2062
02:40:55,949 --> 02:40:58,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still irritated at Tesco's for selling fresh and easy.

2063
02:40:59,251 --> 02:41:00,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, isn't that crazy?

2064
02:41:00,732 --> 02:41:03,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed.

2065
02:41:04,255 --> 02:41:04,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So mad.

2066
02:41:04,955 --> 02:41:06,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they all closed now though?

2067
02:41:06,475 --> 02:41:09,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I think certain ones.

2068
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:10,436
[SPEAKER_04]: The one here is gone.

2069
02:41:10,596 --> 02:41:11,997
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for Twitter topics.

2070
02:41:12,097 --> 02:41:14,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'll put one more call out there for calls.

2071
02:41:14,397 --> 02:41:19,319
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2072
02:41:20,039 --> 02:41:21,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, do we have any last minute stories?

2073
02:41:21,879 --> 02:41:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a quick mod that someone's working on right now for Team Fortress 2 that you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer.

2074
02:41:30,322 --> 02:41:31,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds kind of fun.

2075
02:41:31,282 --> 02:41:34,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's called Star Fortress and it's in pre-alpha.

2076
02:41:34,763 --> 02:41:39,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to check it out, it's... Let's see here.

2077
02:41:39,524 --> 02:41:49,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Gray Man Gaming is the Steam community group that they have with man, of course, two Ns, like Team Fortress game.

2078
02:41:51,431 --> 02:41:51,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2079
02:41:52,853 --> 02:41:53,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, huh?

2080
02:41:53,894 --> 02:41:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow news week.

2081
02:41:57,618 --> 02:41:58,820
[SPEAKER_04]: No calls coming in either.

2082
02:41:59,501 --> 02:42:00,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2083
02:42:01,002 --> 02:42:01,883
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do, guys?

2084
02:42:02,945 --> 02:42:04,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have a poker party.

2085
02:42:04,246 --> 02:42:06,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we win the show.

2086
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:07,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2087
02:42:08,051 --> 02:42:08,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, Pinkberry?

2088
02:42:10,697 --> 02:42:12,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta go get Alan after work.

2089
02:42:13,778 --> 02:42:16,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone call!

2090
02:42:16,899 --> 02:42:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: One more holler out there.

2091
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:21,661
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2092
02:42:21,981 --> 02:42:30,424
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're one of those people that doesn't listen to the show live, you listen to us on Stitcher or through iTunes Podcast or something else, don't forget, you still can't interact with the show.

2093
02:42:30,464 --> 02:42:31,325
[SPEAKER_04]: We do want to hear from you.

2094
02:42:31,685 --> 02:42:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't forget to send us emails.

2095
02:42:32,825 --> 02:42:35,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or Twitter.

2096
02:42:35,226 --> 02:42:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweets help as well.

2097
02:42:35,986 --> 02:42:37,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like someone's going to be trying shortly.

2098
02:42:42,691 --> 02:42:48,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of anything else video game related except blah.

2099
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:48,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, look.

2100
02:42:49,698 --> 02:42:50,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.

2101
02:42:50,198 --> 02:42:50,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lighting up.

2102
02:42:50,759 --> 02:42:52,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones.

2103
02:42:52,941 --> 02:42:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2104
02:42:53,922 --> 02:42:54,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2105
02:42:55,723 --> 02:42:56,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Ranma.

2106
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:57,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that has come to save the day.

2107
02:42:58,026 --> 02:42:58,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently.

2108
02:42:58,886 --> 02:42:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with that?

2109
02:42:59,687 --> 02:43:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's on your mind, Ranma?

2110
02:43:01,804 --> 02:43:04,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you don't want to know.

2111
02:43:04,907 --> 02:43:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a question I've been meaning to call about.

2112
02:43:08,751 --> 02:43:10,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get your opinions on this.

2113
02:43:10,212 --> 02:43:17,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes and reboots and stuff like that, but this is something they haven't done.

2114
02:43:18,900 --> 02:43:26,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it they haven't taken Wario and Waluigi and put them in a game and call it Super Wario Bros.? ?

2115
02:43:28,843 --> 02:43:32,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also surprised that hasn't happened, but wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?

2116
02:43:32,865 --> 02:43:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they had that Wario Land Shake It, which was a hand-drawn game.

2117
02:43:36,387 --> 02:43:39,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked fantastic, and it was pretty fun, but no one bought it.

2118
02:43:39,869 --> 02:43:40,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on the Wii.

2119
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:42,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends, almost.

2120
02:43:45,451 --> 02:43:46,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to play the bad guy?

2121
02:43:47,232 --> 02:43:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, you know?

2122
02:43:49,435 --> 02:43:51,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sound of that.

2123
02:44:18,246 --> 02:44:19,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, call me.

2124
02:44:19,427 --> 02:44:19,907
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk.

2125
02:44:21,529 --> 02:44:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Your people can call me and pay me.

2126
02:44:26,032 --> 02:44:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: What other dream Nintendo games do you have, Ranma?

2127
02:44:29,735 --> 02:44:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only one because I don't know.

2128
02:44:31,716 --> 02:44:36,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It just popped in my head like, you know, they have like Wario series of games.

2129
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:43,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess at the time I was thinking about one of my favorite Game Boy games, which was Super Mario Land 3.

2130
02:44:43,665 --> 02:44:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, why haven't he done that?

2131
02:44:49,249 --> 02:44:49,589
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2132
02:44:49,669 --> 02:44:54,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you just need your own Mario is Missing game, except in the sequel, Luigi's like, I know.

2133
02:44:57,771 --> 02:44:58,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2134
02:44:59,351 --> 02:45:09,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I really think they should put the Wii U out without the gamepad, because honestly, maybe three out of the four games that are out on the Wii U doesn't even use the gamepad.

2135
02:45:11,253 --> 02:45:12,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them use it really well, though.

2136
02:45:12,753 --> 02:45:16,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie U is a great example of a game that's really enhanced with that gamepad, so...

2137
02:45:19,525 --> 02:45:30,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the gamepad, but I just... Honest to God, for me, the gamepad and all that thing, that's less of a concern than I still feel there's a lot of clunky shit on Nintendo's online.

2138
02:45:31,138 --> 02:45:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And although I like Miiverse, I don't think it's particularly convenient.

2139
02:45:36,585 --> 02:45:40,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of slow, and the internet on Nintendo's system can still be clunky.

2140
02:45:40,709 --> 02:45:46,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I just still feel like where Nintendo is going online isn't really where they need to be.

2141
02:45:47,113 --> 02:45:55,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I still remain really irritated that Virtual Console isn't what we ought to see on a modern gaming console.

2142
02:45:55,398 --> 02:45:55,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2143
02:45:57,799 --> 02:45:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2144
02:45:59,260 --> 02:45:59,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are just...

2145
02:46:01,261 --> 02:46:01,802
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I know?

2146
02:46:01,882 --> 02:46:17,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have a Wii U, and there are the games I do have on it I enjoy, and I know I will like the new Mario game, and I know I'll love the new Mario Kart, and whatever they continue to do in 2014 that will justify owning the system, but it is a little frustrating to see all the third parties abandoning ship.

2147
02:46:17,895 --> 02:46:20,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of them are being dicks.

2148
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:50,809
[SPEAKER_02]: you're right, because even though the Wii U isn't as powerful you can get somebody else to take a top tier title and shove it into that little hardware and somehow make it work they make shitty little computers for kids that will play games and I see ports of games from big companies that end up on these things LeapFrog is just a little device that's powered by Flash that's a Shockwave Flash console yep

2149
02:46:55,362 --> 02:46:59,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, well, Ranma, if that's it, I'm going to let you go and see if anybody else wants to call.

2150
02:47:00,088 --> 02:47:00,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2151
02:47:00,548 --> 02:47:01,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

2152
02:47:01,990 --> 02:47:02,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2153
02:47:02,691 --> 02:47:03,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye-bye now.

2154
02:47:03,792 --> 02:47:04,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2155
02:47:04,953 --> 02:47:07,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else wants to call in.

2156
02:47:07,777 --> 02:47:12,322
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2157
02:47:15,677 --> 02:47:17,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

2158
02:47:17,339 --> 02:47:17,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

2159
02:47:17,579 --> 02:47:18,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

2160
02:47:34,860 --> 02:47:40,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think the wa part in Wario and Waluigi definitely would have to do with things being bad.

2161
02:47:40,304 --> 02:47:44,847
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of little puns that don't always necessarily transfer over.

2162
02:47:45,047 --> 02:47:48,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, let's go to the phones because we got another call coming in.

2163
02:47:48,269 --> 02:47:49,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2164
02:47:49,210 --> 02:47:49,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2165
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:53,953
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Obi-Wan Jabroni calling from the United Kingdom.

2166
02:47:54,213 --> 02:47:55,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.

2167
02:47:55,494 --> 02:47:56,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

2168
02:47:56,514 --> 02:47:57,675
[SPEAKER_00]: You are up late, sir.

2169
02:47:57,835 --> 02:47:58,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I love your icon.

2170
02:47:59,551 --> 02:48:00,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

2171
02:48:01,352 --> 02:48:05,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to say numero uno on the leaderboard.

2172
02:48:06,094 --> 02:48:07,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at you, yeah.

2173
02:48:07,434 --> 02:48:11,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you and Tigerclaw fighting to the death on the VOG Network leaderboards.

2174
02:48:12,036 --> 02:48:12,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what, Sky?

2175
02:48:13,116 --> 02:48:17,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Tigerclaw likes being on top, and that's okay.

2176
02:48:18,178 --> 02:48:22,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was a little bit of shade throwing here live at Orange Lounge Radio.

2177
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:22,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2178
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:23,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

2179
02:48:23,021 --> 02:48:24,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my Max has told me it's five hours.

2180
02:48:24,182 --> 02:48:24,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2181
02:48:40,057 --> 02:48:44,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there's been a lot of free-to-play games out there lately.

2182
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:48,202
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been more free-to-play games than I've fucked, you know?

2183
02:48:50,423 --> 02:48:53,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think this is a great thing, because I'm 35 years old.

2184
02:48:54,386 --> 02:48:55,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Old gamer.

2185
02:48:55,807 --> 02:48:57,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that old.

2186
02:48:57,908 --> 02:48:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not that old.

2187
02:48:58,949 --> 02:48:59,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm older.

2188
02:49:01,190 --> 02:49:02,052
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a young lady.

2189
02:49:02,753 --> 02:49:03,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love you.

2190
02:49:04,776 --> 02:49:05,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you too.

2191
02:49:09,703 --> 02:49:14,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get older, I think, you know, as older gamers, I think we become more cheap.

2192
02:49:14,591 --> 02:49:15,212
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

2193
02:49:16,176 --> 02:49:19,460
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 2DS that they announced.

2194
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:27,068
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to me because it's going to be cheap and it kind of looks kind of shitty.

2195
02:49:28,309 --> 02:49:34,956
[SPEAKER_00]: The price, I think, is going to appeal to a lot of older people for cheap people like myself.

2196
02:49:34,996 --> 02:49:36,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 3DS at the minute.

2197
02:49:37,513 --> 02:49:56,914
[SPEAKER_00]: um the original one so i mean that's you know but i mean i've got a lot of friends actually who would be into that the 2ds just because you know they don't want to spend the money on my regular 3ds so um but i went off on a tangent yeah but yeah the free to play is what i was gonna mention

2198
02:49:58,510 --> 02:50:06,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is my first time calling you guys, and as they say, your first time is... That's alright, we'll go easy on you on your first time.

2199
02:50:06,176 --> 02:50:07,397
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time's a little rough.

2200
02:50:07,537 --> 02:50:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train, and we're just all sitting here listening to your accent, so by all means, talk away.

2201
02:50:14,463 --> 02:50:18,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, I have several friends who've expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason.

2202
02:50:19,607 --> 02:50:21,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially one of them that has problems with 3D.

2203
02:50:22,489 --> 02:50:23,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So, just saying.

2204
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:24,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

2205
02:50:24,751 --> 02:50:31,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone's out there fapping to my accent and whatever, feel free to let me know on Twitter or the comments on VOG.

2206
02:50:35,536 --> 02:50:36,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So free to play games.

2207
02:50:37,176 --> 02:50:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you play any of them?

2208
02:50:39,366 --> 02:50:45,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I've been pimping the shit out of Tekken Revolution.

2209
02:50:45,749 --> 02:50:49,131
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, that was your comment that got me to play that game.

2210
02:50:49,651 --> 02:51:02,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been pimping the crap out of it, and yeah, I love it, and I don't know if you've played the latest one, of course, like, is it Dead or Alive 5, Ultimate, Call of Fighters or some shit?

2211
02:51:02,537 --> 02:51:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that, but I haven't played it, but I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one they're talking about.

2212
02:51:07,999 --> 02:51:10,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, because I'm a huge fighting game fan.

2213
02:51:10,401 --> 02:51:12,183
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Dead or Alive one's kind of cool.

2214
02:51:12,263 --> 02:51:14,304
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free gigs, I will say that.

2215
02:51:15,525 --> 02:51:18,268
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't have the token system.

2216
02:51:18,608 --> 02:51:21,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can play as much as you want.

2217
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:26,755
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those games where if you want the story part of it, you've got to pay for it.

2218
02:51:27,275 --> 02:51:29,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like one of those games where you unlock.

2219
02:51:30,118 --> 02:51:32,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pay to unlock is what I meant, so...

2220
02:51:33,624 --> 02:51:34,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's cool.

2221
02:51:35,065 --> 02:51:38,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can play online, too, so that's kind of fun.

2222
02:51:40,127 --> 02:51:42,628
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to pay to unlock booby mechanics, though, do you?

2223
02:51:43,049 --> 02:51:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is dead or alive.

2224
02:51:44,829 --> 02:51:46,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

2225
02:51:46,770 --> 02:51:51,492
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tekken Revolution's kind of been, you know, taken over.

2226
02:51:53,173 --> 02:51:57,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I think pay to unlock is better when you have the expectation that it's going to be pay to unlock.

2227
02:51:58,136 --> 02:51:58,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2228
02:51:59,096 --> 02:52:03,037
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of just, oh, well, we have this DLC.

2229
02:52:03,097 --> 02:52:04,238
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you just gave us a code.

2230
02:52:04,798 --> 02:52:05,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least it's not double-dipping.

2231
02:52:06,218 --> 02:52:11,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when you know that you've got to unlock it, pay a little bit more, then I think it lessens the blow.

2232
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:20,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think the story portion of it, of that day of life, is kind of expensive, so you might as well just go out and buy the full game.

2233
02:52:20,163 --> 02:52:20,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2234
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:38,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I wanted to mention that Ridge Racer game, Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever, that's kind of, it's okay, but like, I think I said in one of the comments before, I said, when you crash on the game, it's like, it's not game over, but you can keep carrying on playing.

2235
02:52:40,322 --> 02:52:55,864
[SPEAKER_00]: um it's it's okay but you know with that game every time i put it up now it says server error um and i know you guys love this word it's a beta or a beta wherever you live we say we say beer obviously i've heard beta

2236
02:52:56,727 --> 02:52:58,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2237
02:52:58,189 --> 02:52:59,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Ridge Racer's okay.

2238
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:03,214
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not traditional Ridge Racer in my opinion, so I kind of hate it.

2239
02:53:03,254 --> 02:53:04,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have trophies.

2240
02:53:04,655 --> 02:53:09,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep forgetting there really are a ton of free-to-play options on PlayStation right now.

2241
02:53:10,301 --> 02:53:13,584
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned one last week, Rob, called Pinball Free-to-Play.

2242
02:53:13,604 --> 02:53:15,065
[SPEAKER_00]: That was called Pinball Stick.

2243
02:53:15,105 --> 02:53:17,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shouting at my... That's it.

2244
02:53:18,788 --> 02:53:20,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned it again earlier tonight.

2245
02:53:20,169 --> 02:53:21,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinballistic or something like that.

2246
02:53:21,569 --> 02:53:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2247
02:53:21,869 --> 02:53:22,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned it again tonight.

2248
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:26,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

2249
02:53:28,612 --> 02:53:30,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yeah, free is good.

2250
02:53:30,432 --> 02:53:35,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got to pay for handjobs or whatever these days.

2251
02:53:35,074 --> 02:53:35,594
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, free.

2252
02:53:36,952 --> 02:53:37,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Free is good.

2253
02:53:38,052 --> 02:53:38,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.

2254
02:53:38,933 --> 02:53:45,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish Tekken and stuff on the Dead or Alive game was on Xbox, but probably not going to happen.

2255
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:47,995
[SPEAKER_00]: But PS3 is okay.

2256
02:53:48,115 --> 02:53:48,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the controller.

2257
02:53:49,196 --> 02:53:53,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the minority who likes the PS3 controller anyway.

2258
02:53:53,437 --> 02:53:54,637
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love the PS3 controller.

2259
02:53:54,877 --> 02:53:57,518
[SPEAKER_08]: But need I remind everyone that Yaris was also free?

2260
02:53:59,959 --> 02:54:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad from PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe is the best free to play on PC.

2261
02:54:04,221 --> 02:54:05,781
[SPEAKER_08]: He's our DC fanboy.

2262
02:54:05,821 --> 02:54:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: He is, but as far as MMOs go, it's way better than that Free Realms bullshit.

2263
02:54:11,384 --> 02:54:13,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Marvel Heroes is pretty good for Steam.

2264
02:54:13,165 --> 02:54:15,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Heroes ain't bad, but it's not on PlayStation 3.

2265
02:54:15,226 --> 02:54:17,467
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's Marvel, and there's Jessica Jones in it, and I'm happy.

2266
02:54:18,867 --> 02:54:32,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try DC Universe, took forever to download, and my PC was on wireless, so it took just like 3 days, it was a terrible experience, it took up so much space too

2267
02:54:34,886 --> 02:54:39,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, the PS3 is a great system, but there's annoyances with it.

2268
02:54:39,448 --> 02:54:40,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really ridiculous.

2269
02:54:40,409 --> 02:54:44,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy some of my files over to that.

2270
02:54:44,051 --> 02:54:49,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can copy save games, but I'm not getting any space by copying save games to my drive, so I'm just really irritated.

2271
02:54:49,873 --> 02:54:56,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, like, you know, send over some of these really large games to play off the drive, but whatever.

2272
02:54:56,936 --> 02:54:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Obi-Wan, Jabroni, it's so good to hear from you.

2273
02:54:59,418 --> 02:55:04,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that icon you have that DarkSakura loves, I just want to make sure our listeners hear this.

2274
02:55:04,862 --> 02:55:09,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis with a PlayStation 1 console.

2275
02:55:10,426 --> 02:55:13,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice.

2276
02:55:13,227 --> 02:55:13,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2277
02:55:14,048 --> 02:55:21,256
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem, it's a PlayStation 1 console, it plugged into the port too, so if anyone gets that reference.

2278
02:55:21,516 --> 02:55:23,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, can I say one quick thing before I go?

2279
02:55:24,820 --> 02:55:27,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection, bye bye bye.

2280
02:55:28,384 --> 02:55:32,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm a huge MGS fan, everyone knows that, follow me on Twitter.

2281
02:55:36,332 --> 02:55:55,385
[SPEAKER_00]: basically playstation exclusive but holy shit value for money it's awesome and just one more one more thing if that's okay before i go queen elizabeth you can suck my mother fucking nuts because that's why everything's so fucking expensive that's why i'm paying 429 for an xbox one

2282
02:55:57,446 --> 02:56:00,769
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to all just move to our own island and call it Fuck Everyone Else.

2283
02:56:03,371 --> 02:56:05,112
[SPEAKER_08]: We are the island nation of awesome.

2284
02:56:05,633 --> 02:56:06,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the rest of you.

2285
02:56:06,593 --> 02:56:07,094
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our theme.

2286
02:56:07,234 --> 02:56:12,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably the only internet video gaming show where people will call in to tell off the Queen of England.

2287
02:56:12,698 --> 02:56:13,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

2288
02:56:13,499 --> 02:56:13,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2289
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, my friend.

2290
02:56:16,461 --> 02:56:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2291
02:56:16,962 --> 02:56:17,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

2292
02:56:18,263 --> 02:56:18,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2293
02:56:20,029 --> 02:56:20,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great call.

2294
02:56:20,890 --> 02:56:21,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

2295
02:56:21,410 --> 02:56:22,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I love hearing from the overseas people.

2296
02:56:22,931 --> 02:56:23,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

2297
02:56:23,531 --> 02:56:23,911
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.

2298
02:56:24,172 --> 02:56:26,273
[SPEAKER_04]: You are up way early or late, depending.

2299
02:56:26,313 --> 02:56:26,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the two.

2300
02:56:27,053 --> 02:56:31,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling he's up early because he missed me talking about the pinball game in the beginning of the show.

2301
02:56:31,156 --> 02:56:32,176
[SPEAKER_08]: He's eight hours ahead of us.

2302
02:56:32,297 --> 02:56:32,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2303
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I'm going to close up Skype.

2304
02:56:35,360 --> 02:56:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to those didn't get through.

2305
02:56:36,421 --> 02:56:39,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Actdeft was trying to ring in, but I think he was just trying to be nice because we weren't getting any calls.

2306
02:56:40,164 --> 02:56:43,827
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.

2307
02:56:44,127 --> 02:56:52,753
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and so forth, I just want to say once again, thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

2308
02:56:53,053 --> 02:56:54,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2309
02:56:55,055 --> 02:56:56,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've been doing this a very long time.

2310
02:56:56,796 --> 02:56:57,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't ask for your money.

2311
02:56:58,357 --> 02:57:00,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while, a charity thing, we might ask for your money.

2312
02:57:00,418 --> 02:57:01,739
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll take it for free.

2313
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: but we do ask you to help spread the word.

2314
02:57:05,361 --> 02:57:06,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend or five about the show.

2315
02:57:07,101 --> 02:57:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio and I do see some of you guys doing that.

2316
02:57:09,722 --> 02:57:10,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I do see your kind tweets.

2317
02:57:11,242 --> 02:57:17,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear some of our other indie podcast folks saying nice words and I just want to let you know we so appreciate you guys.

2318
02:57:18,084 --> 02:57:26,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support which really keeps the fire for us to do this show for 11 plus years going.

2319
02:57:27,367 --> 02:57:27,847
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2320
02:57:28,227 --> 02:57:30,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make my dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight.

2321
02:57:32,309 --> 02:57:33,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm uninstalling WoW.

2322
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

2323
02:57:34,950 --> 02:57:37,811
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what reminded me that I still had WoW installed?

2324
02:57:38,791 --> 02:57:39,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Curse.

2325
02:57:40,472 --> 02:57:45,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting to sound like Gimit, which we'll hear about on Wednesday's Horde House.

2326
02:57:45,234 --> 02:57:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug, plug, plug.
