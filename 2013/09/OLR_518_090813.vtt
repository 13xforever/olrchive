00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, one of Mega Man's creators successfully kickstarts a spiritual successor, a classic fighting game becomes a MOBA, now he announces a new rhythm game with Capcom, and could Sony release a VR headset for the PS4?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, here we are, episode number 518 for this September the 8th 2013, I hope you guys all had a good week off, Labor Day week, we weren't here last week, but we're back to do it all again tonight, talk about video games and gaming culture and have some laughs

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts, first off the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm in your town raiding your fruits

01:03.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes you are, you are definitely helping out with Animal Crossing, are you impressed though that I actually, I went in when I was flying to Atlanta and cleaned up the whole town, I found that Animal Crossing is a great flight game

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
It is, it's also a great, I have nothing to do so I'm going to play Animal Crossing for 3 hours type of game and the cat won't get off of me, I'm going to play Animal Crossing

01:25.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah usually while I'm here at home I'll end up getting sucked into an MMO or kind of sitting on the chair, I mean my 3DS is really the on the go system, that's when I play it the most, but yeah having the flight this week there and back to Dragon Con got a lot of Animal Crossing in among other things

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Well you also were my 10th Wii person, or me, that popped up on my thing so you got me an achievement

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Woohoo, or what do they call them on Nintendo, accomplishments, trophies?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
They're called what the hell ever I call them

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Whatever they want to be

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
They're called stuff and things

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Alright and also joining us tonight being whoever he wants to be, say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't know I got nothing

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
That's so after school inspirational of you

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It is a little bit isn't it, how are you Loki?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm fine

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Counting down the days until Grand Theft Auto?

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Sort of, yeah I guess, just waiting for the leak

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Which I'm sure it will soon enough

02:19.000 --> 02:31.000
Well Rockstar's not shipping anything out, well they're not shipping anything out to distribution until Friday so probably next weekend I'm sure

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
Don't know if I'll be getting mine early because the powers that be above me are kind of being anal

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm still going to do it but we'll see, I may be slapped on the wrist for that

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Is it like the guy who put up the YouTube today of the Xbox One

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Well see I'm not that dumb

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Are they worried about early leaks and things like that?

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
They're just worried about like because they're requiring manifests of like the orders that go out and stuff just to make sure that no one's getting their product on Friday or whatever

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
No stores, I mean I'm not a store, I'm not going to resell but I understand

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I thought I already saw on Reddit or one of those sites that somebody's got the game and the disc

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
You saw Photoshop and it was from

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Well that was a good Photoshop

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Gamertag Radio posted that on Twitter

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
But yeah it was a Photoshop of somebody they did that

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah there's no actual copies of the game out there yet

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
I mean yeah no there are, there are shippers that are out there, like full pallet shippers

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
But those are like intended for like think Target, Walmart and stuff

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
So those are out there and someone did break in the one of those to take a picture on, I saw that on Reddit

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
But aside from that I don't think any copies have mysteriously vanished from those yet

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
So the retail release though is the Tuesday after this Tuesday right? Next Tuesday? 17th?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
17th yeah

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
This week is Kingdom Hearts HD, I just got my pre-order in for that today so

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Kingdom Hearts and Puppeteer and NHL

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
So we're getting into that time of year, it's going to start ramping up with Kingdom Hearts and Grand Theft Auto

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Those are definitely two big things to kick off this season right?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah and Kingdom Hearts is just an HD compilation

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Well but Kingdom Hearts is like, I don't know like I'm really liking this whole square going back to some of the PS2 games

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And kind of making bigger and better and all that, I like that idea

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
I mean it's kind of cool and all but I think it's going to be more interesting to see in Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
So I want to talk, gosh there's a lot to catch up on since we were gone last week

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I don't even know where to begin

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm sick a little bit again which kind of sucks, I got Complague yet again from Dragon Con

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I don't even know how that happens but there you go

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
We should probably talk about some of the things that happened last week in gaming news

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Because it's only a three hour show so we don't have time to talk all about last week and this week

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So we want to do a segment we call Last Week's News Set to Holic

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Lots of Nintendo news in the week that we were gone

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
The Wii U Deluxe finally got that price drop a lot of people have been talking about

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Down to $2.99 for the Wii U Deluxe which is what the Wii U Basic costs right now

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Also out of Nintendo

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Wii U Basic isn't being sold anymore by the way

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah so kind of interesting that they just basically are giving away Nintendo Land and some extra plastic for free

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
The Nintendo 2DS was announced which had a lot of people have some very strong opinions about the 2DS one way or another

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Or the Nintendo Toast is kind of what it looks like but it is definitely targeted towards the younger set

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Seriously missed opportunity with that I think

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
It does not fold and it only displays images in 2D apparently it uses one screen that's separated by the plastic in order to pull it off

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
But it is aimed at five and six year olds per Reggie

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Zelda Link Between Worlds got a release date November 22nd is the big day

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
Wonderful 101 sales figures not as good as it had hoped but I think it might be a little early to tell with that

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
That's because it's on the Wii U

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It also hasn't released over here yet

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It comes out on the 15th one week from today

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
But that is the news out of Japan so there you go

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Let's see I guess something else we could talk about there

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
How about WayForward's Kickstarter of Shantate Half Genie Hero for Wii U

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
That's the thing that's happening on Kickstarter from WayForward

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
That's last week's news set to Holic

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Most of the big stuff obviously around Nintendo

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Loki did you want to elaborate on the 2DS real quick?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Well the thing you know you mentioned that it's one screen with a piece of plastic in between

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And I saw some people you know on Ars Technica and stuff they were showing like

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Here's what we think that this should have looked like instead being like a whole tablet

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Like basically just remove that plastic and leave just like kind of a barrier there

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And have it where maybe you can have some new software that's supported by the 2DS

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
You know have 2DS software that supports the whole like almost like a whole tablet instead of two screens

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Well I don't know I'm just trying not to overthink this because you'll notice it was very intentional

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Nintendo did not roll this out at E3 they did not even do a direct for it

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
It's not a big deal

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
But here's the thing is the thought is that this is where it's going to go for the next handheld system

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
That it will be a tablet with one screen because this is what they did with the Game Boy Advance SP

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Where you have that hinge in the foldable screen and then that later showed up in the Nintendo DS

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
That might be reading into it a lot I don't know about that

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And this is also Nintendo like trying to I mean if you think about it

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Nintendo the last time they did something really crazy with their hardware aside from the 3DS

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Being in 3D was the Wii and since then they haven't really done too much

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I think it's kind of once again the 2DS is confusing I think to consumers

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
It's just the name itself is going to confuse people because they're going to be like well

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
2DS so I don't see any 2DS games I can buy for this you know I only see 3DS games

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I just don't think they're going to get it and also you're saying that there's a market out there

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Of people that have 5 and 6 year olds that actually read the small little print that's on those boxes

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Saying that they don't recommend 3D for

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Because I don't think it necessarily is only 5 and 6 year olds I think it's other young children

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Where the parents are like oh this is a little too close

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You know like even though it's for 7 and up

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
But they'll read that small print but they won't read the ESRB ratings on the back of the boxes of these games

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
So I like that and the print that's larger fuck that can't read it

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh small print that's you know something that doesn't really possibly affect my kids eyes

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Well we'll read that and be scared of it

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I just think the 2DS is kind of a non-factor as far as we're all concerned

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
You know it's like that Wii that they released in Canada that didn't even have any internet functionality or what have you

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Like remember that? It was released with little fanfare

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
They did that with the PSP as well they had one with no Wi-Fi and stuff or something

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Whatever

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
It's no big deal but I just think it's kind of weird you know why would you invest money into such a narrow demographic?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Well actually I'm glad you know if Nintendo is doing this new thing every year

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm glad that this system is a step backwards in some ways and not a step forward

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Because I'd be kind of irritated if I had a new 3DS I'd want to buy

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
You know so I'm kind of glad we have a year off from all this stuff and maybe there'll be a 3DS Uber or who knows what

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
2DS has Excel

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I doubt it I doubt it

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Alright well our chat room is lighting up and I do want to acknowledge our live chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
vognetwork.com and if you, excuse me, I still have hiccups and other horrible radio things from being sick from the comm plague I got at Dragon Con

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
If you do join us live for a live show don't forget to join our chat room live.vognetwork.com

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I hope I make it through the show

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Where we have comments like Tiger Claw says that 2DS is going to screw up a lot of kids Christmas

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I don't know if I see the logic in that why would that screw up a kids Christmas?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
That's actually perfect because I was, Julian has started to read

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
He's six years old he's in first grade he's reading

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
He's been reading me play Animal Crossing which I've been trying not to get him to repeat Pork Sword

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Thank you to Queen Semia in chat for that

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah his mom was slightly amused by that but anyway he actually is reading the game with me when I play it when I'm over there

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
And he was talking about wanting a 3DS so he could play Animal Crossing himself

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
And actually I think that the 2DS is actually a good idea for him because I've seen how he destroys his stuff

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah and there's no hinges to break on the 2DS but it's also too big to fit in the pockets but I think that actually might be a good thing

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
You don't want a six year old fitting that stuff in their pockets and taking it to school

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
You don't want those portable systems to be portable

11:05.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm worried I'm going to get accused of being a Nintendo defendist or whatever but I just don't think this system is as big of a deal as Twitter made it seem to be this week

11:15.000 --> 11:25.000
Well I'm glad that they decided that fuck it we can't create a hinge that actually won't break very easily so we're just going to make a system that's super weird looking

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
Let's see DC Nate in chat says iPads don't fit in pockets either and they sell just fine

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So talking about that maybe that type of affordability isn't necessarily a deal breaker

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I understand that but who's having their kids bring iPads to fucking school?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Well it's huge in college

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay yeah that's college but five and six year olds where this is actually targeted are you really going to spend that kind of money on it?

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
Well Dan's 12 year old cousin not Dan's I think it was like one of Becky or Chris's relatives got a 12 year old iPhone 5

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
What 12 year old needs that?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
But it's a 12 year old I'm talking about a little kid that has a goddamn iPad

12:11.000 --> 12:25.000
I mean here's the thing is you're talking to kids again and once again the main thing was 3D they don't really like the 3D because parents are concerned that they don't understand how to use a switch which is ridiculous

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Well and you can actually turn off 3D and parental settings on the 3DS today

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
Exactly parental settings well they'll read the small print there but they won't read the manual so whatever okay so they're confused by the switch and stuff and oh that hinge is gonna break

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
What do you think the 2DS is gonna what do you think is gonna happen the 2DS the kids gonna drop on the ground and oh look both of those fucking screens are scratched now

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Congratulations

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
I just think this is if you don't like it don't buy it and this isn't gonna break Nintendo's bank if this thing flops because I really don't think they're making that many of them

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Well I guess they don't care if another system flops now don't they?

12:57.000 --> 13:08.000
Well it's again they did not have the fanfare with E3 or even a Nintendo Direct or anything this was on a press release under the radar I don't think they have an expectation

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
Here's what it is they're just trying to put out another system to drive some more sales because Pokemans is coming out right around the corner and they have to make up for the losses of the Wii U

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
Because the Wii U let's be honest Wind Waker HD I love Wind Waker it's not gonna fucking pull that system out

13:23.000 --> 13:36.000
Mario Kart 8 is really I know there's the Mario game as well but I think the combo of that and Mario Kart 8 is gonna be that's gonna be and if another price drop can squeeze in when Mario Kart 8 comes out that will really seal the deal

13:36.000 --> 13:47.000
And I'm talking even if they can drop it just like 20 bucks I think that would be huge we'll see I mean we got a ways so alright anyhow last weeks news done over with

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Damn it Kabuki needs to move to my town

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
One of your villagers moved to my town

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah I went by and saw a butch that traitor I'm gonna steal Kabuki

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
I was really surprised because I was like oh he came from Normandy oh that's Jamie's town oh she's gonna be pissed because this isn't the one she was trying to lose

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
No I want to lose Ed and I'm glad I'm not the only one that has to share the pain that Ed is

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
There she is playing her Nintendo system compulsively during the show

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Hey you're the one that said you'd open your village

14:17.000 --> 14:26.000
Alright anyhow I want to talk quickly about Dragon Con because I had a great time at Dragon Con I want to say hi to anybody new listening to the show who I might have networked with at Dragon Con

14:27.000 --> 14:36.000
I got pulled onto a panel Monday morning at the last minute about streaming media and I got to talk kind of about the live 365 days and everything from that to like the modern Twitch TV

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
And I had a lot of fun so I just want to say hey to anybody who I might have met doing that or the VOG Network Super Show panel which sadly didn't have the greatest turnout live

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
But what's interesting is that apparently it had a great turnout online and we're getting good download numbers for it so it's I guess just a lot of you couldn't make it to Dragon Con in person

14:54.000 --> 15:03.000
But I hope you enjoyed that show we had a lot of fun doing it and it sounds like we're going to be doing it again next year so I'm making my plans to go to Dragon Con 2014

15:04.000 --> 15:14.000
But I had a wonderful time at Dragon Con I'm going to be honest the first couple days I was a little bit overwhelmed lots of people tried to get used to it I was jet lagged so I was a little crabby

15:14.000 --> 15:27.000
But by the time Saturday night Sunday Monday I was really into it and the amount of talent I saw with the cosplay just really blew my mind and there's something special about Dragon Con because it doesn't really take place in a convention center

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Well I mean like the dealer hall is there but it's across like five downtown hotels so just these

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Sounds very AX

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Well I've never been AX

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
A lot of AX shows spread across a convention center and three hotels

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
At least it was last time I went

15:42.000 --> 15:57.000
But like oh my gosh just like the main floor of the Marriott just wall to wall people and then you go downstairs there's like multi level and there's these different ballrooms where there's artist alley and a room where you can walk up and meet celebrities and a board game room in the basement

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
I think that was at the Hilton had a board game area in the basement that was huge and that's the one that had the mech systems that Bobby's talked about on his show before

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
And you could lose track of time in there easy no windows to the outside because it's in the basement

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
And I can see how people can get stuck in there playing the wolf game or werewolf or whatever you call it till eight in the morning

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Which by the way was the first time I ever saw that being played live

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
I played it online on DDR Freak back in the day but getting to see that playing live was a lot of fun

16:25.000 --> 16:37.000
So lots of panels I really like how Dragon Con separates things into tracks and it's like okay Hilton 203 is going to be nothing but podcasts unless we get a really really big thing that might be one of the other rooms

16:38.000 --> 16:47.000
And they had an MMO track and a video game track the one thing I was a little less impressed with was the digital gaming room sorry I know some people work hard to put that on

16:47.000 --> 16:59.000
But just it's not I mean to be fair Dragon Con is not a video game expo it's not PAX it's not a video game show so that wasn't supposed to be their main draw

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
But barely any console stuff to be seen it was very PC and you know there was a Smash Brothers tournament going on but that was about it

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
Like if it wasn't a tournament or some PC play that's really about it but lots of 3DS street passing to be had that's for sure

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
So yeah I don't know what else to say about Dragon Con I had a great time it was great to just meet people that I've worked with for many years

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
Finally getting to meet Brad from Pod Culture and some of his cohorts and they were very generous in getting me very drunk very quickly so thank you for that

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
And meeting some of Bobby's friends these are people like I've heard about but haven't really met and one of his friends Sue and I hit it off really well I just love her to bits

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And she was giving out vodka soaked gummy bears all weekend so love her

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I want to go next year Rob

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
You really should and some folks in the chat room are talking about there should be a vod con seriously and SSG100Matt says Dragon Con might be the closest thing to vod con

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
I mean honestly in a way kinda because putting on a con is really hard piggy backing on someone else's con is much easier

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Especially a huge con like Dragon Con just be prepared for tons and tons of people

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
Getting to see Travis you realize it's been like 10 years since I've seen Travis so getting to be there with him when he was doing his cosplay

18:15.000 --> 18:24.000
He did an amazing job as Commander Shepard and if you guys haven't heard him and his wife Jenna Mark Meir the voice of Mael Shep renewed their vows one of the mornings

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I'm very pressed because it was a surprise so I wasn't told it was going to happen so I didn't go

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Were you all the clumps for not going?

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
I was a little bit like you did what? Why wasn't I told I would have got up I would have forced myself out of bed

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh well I had a great time

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah so I'm already planning to go back next year and I feel bad for PAX Prime

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
Apparently there was plenty of fuckery that happened in one of the panels I don't really want to get into that controversial issue right now because I'm sure you've all read about it

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I love fuckery panels those are the best to watch

18:59.000 --> 19:08.000
Well all I'm saying is that you know Penny Arcade Expo I love the vibe of Penny Arcade Expo and I still do kind of want to go to Penny Arcade East but

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
Some people there really need some PR help big time and just

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Some people there need to get their foot out of their mouth

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
And it seems to be perpetual is the problem I'm starting to have it's like every time you think they're doing they're on the right path it's just whoop foot goes right back and mouth

19:25.000 --> 19:37.000
And it's like you guys are there's a lot of good things that those guys do but then it's like you know how long are we going to sit here and just like kind of turn the other way

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
When there's one of them won't stop with this running his mouth anyway

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Rob next year if I can make it to DragonCon by the way we need to cosplay

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm already talking about cosplay with Travis too but I would be down I mean there's like four days of cons that's four cosplays

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
I've actually already been working on my costume for one of the SAC anime next year so

20:00.000 --> 20:09.000
I would like to consider going to PAX East just throwing that out there I still would like to try and make that happen we'll see I just it's money at this point you guys cons be expensive

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
And then they just announced gamer X2 is going to be earlier next year it's going to be Alan's birthday weekend in mid July so there's that con to look forward to as well

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
What else did I want to say about DragonCon? I don't know I think I said do you guys have questions or anybody in chat?

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
Who did you notice any of the sci-fi or fantasy writers who were guests that year? I didn't see

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
I didn't really do celebrity sightings I didn't even go to see Kathy Najimy which was the one celebrity I really wanted to see I kind of just skipped all that

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I know Travis ran into George Takei the lucky fucker

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
I would have totally wanted to see was it the guys from Mythbusters are over there

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
They did a whole special show at the Fox Theater one night they did like a special live show and then they did like a panel yeah it was a good time

20:57.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh Bobby's mentioning the Parsec Awards yes that was a lot of fun we got to present at this prestigious award they do for speculative fiction casts at DragonCon

21:07.000 --> 21:15.000
And you can actually see the YouTube online and myself, Bobby and Travis presenting at the awards and Brad is in it too he did an award earlier in the presentation so lots of VOG

21:16.000 --> 21:24.000
But what's funny is that because of a schedule shuffle where Sylvester McCoy the seventh doctor was supposed to present the last award well he had to do the first award instead

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
So guess who got to do the very last award of the evening? VOG got to present that award so we had a whole little spiel we made up like 30 minutes before the thing

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
And that went pretty well I had an Oprah moment up on stage and pretended to be drunk I was not really drunk

21:39.000 --> 21:47.000
You gave everyone B's? Huh? You gave everyone B's? No I said something along the lines of I wish everybody could have an award because all the indie podcasters worked so hard

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
And if I were Oprah I'd say you get an award and you get an award and I think I actually danced so you can see me all jiggling up there on stage

21:55.000 --> 22:05.000
I'm leaving your village now. Bye bye. I've already looted it. Get out. Alright I think that's all I want to say on DragonCon because I know we have a lot of gaming news and other stuff we want to get into

22:06.000 --> 22:21.000
Good time, WoodCon again. A++. Let's get into our gaming weeks I suppose it's time for. I'm a little off after having a week off. Let's talk about our gaming weeks. What have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?

22:21.000 --> 22:33.000
Animal Crossing. And I wanted to play Final Fantasy 14 but apparently my account was rendered inactive so when I went to go register my collector's edition code it created another account

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
So now I have two accounts. One of them with no characters and the other one with my characters on it that I can't access. So I've opened a ticket. I'm calling Square tomorrow. Hopefully get everything fixed

22:42.000 --> 22:51.000
But man they don't have their phone number anywhere on their site and I had to go look at that locate customer service website so I've got that

22:52.000 --> 23:05.000
I played some more Fractal. I'm super addicted to that game. I actually started DuckTales. And yeah that's about it. I mean I've really had a lot on my plate. I had a job interview.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
Oh no I played something else. I don't remember what it is so it's not important. Your turn.

23:14.000 --> 23:26.000
Alright well this week I didn't play a whole ton. I did a little bit of catching up. Well this is even kind of including last week a little bit. Saints Row IV so I finished playing that kind of

23:26.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean I'm still, what was it? Last night I spent a good while modding the files in there to try to unlock DLC without paying for it. But that didn't work.

23:38.000 --> 23:50.000
So I was trying to then unlock weapons that were not really weapons that you can use but they're weapons that are in the game kind of like some of the enemies have in some of the flashback missions and stuff

23:50.000 --> 24:06.000
But I didn't get that to work. And then I was playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto IV just because I'd watch somebody do or attempt to do this like kind of six star run from one side of the map to the other.

24:07.000 --> 24:19.000
And I probably could do it but I could probably only do it in multiplayer because in single player you have limited sprinting. You don't have unlimited sprint and your characters run about as good as I do.

24:20.000 --> 24:35.000
And just they run out of steam just after a few feet of sprinting so that just didn't work. Plus the AI is really cheap. I mean you jump into the water there's no boats and then like two seconds later all of a sudden there's five boats and they've run over you.

24:36.000 --> 25:02.000
Multiple times like where those boats just teleport from. They weren't here a second ago. So yeah I didn't really end up doing that. So I ended up instead filming some of my I don't know if I want to call parkour but like like free climbing I guess it's something I used to do in multiplayer because I got tired of beating everybody so badly in our multiplayer games at work.

25:02.000 --> 25:17.000
And so I used to climb buildings and still kill them. So I filmed some of those buildings and things that you know I used to climb on and I thought it'd be fun to edit it together and do some more stuff.

25:18.000 --> 25:28.000
So I did that and then a little bit of Call of Duty at work but I'm getting really bored with it because I've handicapped myself quite a bit and I still keep winning so I just I don't know what I can.

25:28.000 --> 25:44.000
And we can't really play live anymore because our Internet connection is just shit. So yeah. And then also it's just my boss. I'm usually is playing my boss and pot sometimes our IT guy but it's just getting so boring.

25:45.000 --> 25:56.000
It's what happens when they lay off all your friends you know. So bummer. Wow. All the people they used to play with. So what are you gonna do. That's it. Stock them.

25:56.000 --> 26:06.000
All right. My gaming week. You know because I was at a con for several days I didn't get to play a lot of new stuff at the con but except for one thing I'll talk about at the end.

26:07.000 --> 26:16.000
But I did come home I played quite an obscene amount of Final Fantasy 14. But I know we've talked about it to death on this show and there's really not a lot more I can say.

26:16.000 --> 26:32.000
I got White Mage. I did play a couple new games on PlayStation 3. I played Castle of Illusion the HD remake or whatever that came out. Did they change a lot in that game or is it just me because there's like things in it.

26:32.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm like wait a minute. This wasn't here before. They were saying and I was watching an interview with the creator and also the original designer and the new people and they're talking about how they actually did make some changes to make it more of a Disney film like.

26:47.000 --> 26:56.000
OK. So well then there's like a very Mario 64 vibe in the beginning with the castle and everything I'm like I don't remember. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's just an illusion that it's different. Shut up.

26:56.000 --> 27:10.000
But I haven't really played enough of it to give you a really firm opinion on it but definitely you know has that feel of the Genesis classic and you know I think if you enjoyed the Genesis version of you probably already bought this.

27:11.000 --> 27:20.000
One game I spent a little more time playing was a music game on PlayStation 3 called Kickbeat. I don't know if you guys have heard of this. It's a music game which I haven't got to play a lot of those lately.

27:20.000 --> 27:34.000
Although I also played the demo for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F and I won it. Like that was actually a lot of fun. It reminded me of a PlayStation 2 music game. The price is what's scaring me on that game. I'm like $50 for Hatsune Miku really.

27:35.000 --> 27:53.000
That's too much money. But Kickbeat is more like $10 or $15. I think it was $15 as a download title. And essentially it's set up like it's a little karate thing but your buttons like X and square and circle are all laid out as up down left and right as they are on the pad.

27:53.000 --> 28:03.000
And these little ninja dudes will come out onto the spot and that's when you kick them. And so like you'll be playing along to the music and you know you'll see a little ninja come out and you hit the button and it kills them.

28:04.000 --> 28:12.000
But you have a little bit of warning. So it's just like a different way of reading instead of notes scrolling down the screen. It's little ninjas sending themselves into position.

28:13.000 --> 28:21.000
And depending on the shirts they wear tell you kind of like when the beats are. So like if it's a yellow it's on the beat. If it's blue then you're going to have half beats or third beats.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
But sometimes you have red ones which means it's two buttons at the same time. And sometimes you have like I think it's like orangey where it's like a hold.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
It's a very different way of doing a music game and it's pretty cool to watch your guy like do all the karate moves as he's doing it.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Does he duck turn?

28:37.000 --> 28:49.000
He's not as fabulous as Parappa was. I'm going to tell you what else is as fabulous as Parappa was. This is completely a matter of opinion and some of you are going to disagree with me strongly on this.

28:50.000 --> 28:59.000
I don't like the song list in the game at all. It's a lot of hard rock music. Some of you would like Pendulum and you know those were the songs that bothered me the least probably in the game.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
But like one of them is a remix. What were the huge Pendulum songs? Colors? Was that their song?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Colors yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
That's not in there. It's other stuff.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
It's probably Slam or I'm trying to think of the other one.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
But it's just stuff I don't really listen to in my normal life. I liked my techno DDR stuff and all that.

29:24.000 --> 29:31.000
But there are people that like that music that will be very excited about this game that it incorporates that into it.

29:32.000 --> 29:40.000
And apparently if you beat the game once you can import your own music into it. I'm not sure how well that's going to work because it doesn't always work very well those algorithms.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
But I'd like to try it. I'm trying to play through the game one time so I can at least try it.

29:45.000 --> 29:54.000
But you know for 15 bucks you could do a lot worse. If you like music games especially if you like hard rock, metal and things like that you'd probably get a kick out of it.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
So check it out.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
Akuma JP in chat says is sexy and I know it in there. Very much no. Unless you play it as your own mp3.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Marilyn Manson's The Beautiful People is in it. That was one song I recognized.

30:09.000 --> 30:19.000
What's that? Boom. Don't ask me to sing these songs. It's terrible. What is that band P.O.D. Is that their name? That song's in there.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
Well you know that actually that song a remix of that song was in Amplitude.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Oh that's true. That is true. Alright well anyway so that's kick beat.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
And between that and Final Fantasy is pretty much all I did you know because I was gone for a week.

30:35.000 --> 30:44.000
However at Dragon Con Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus Rift after all. He threatened not to bring it because we were all going to be too drunk to play it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
That's the perfect time to play it.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Well I can understand because it's a very expensive piece of hardware and you know he doesn't want us flinging around.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It's over your eyes not your mouth. If you vomit it's going to miss it.

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
Well he didn't bring Slender Man either so I didn't get to do the scary game. From what I understand Slender Man's on injection drivers. It's more of a hack anyway.

31:03.000 --> 31:13.000
He did YouTube me playing it for the first time. Some type of roller coaster demo that we were doing where the roller coaster like the track just ends up missing at one part so your car goes flying.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
I will say this. It's an impressive piece of technology. I was very impressed with it.

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
And it is exactly what you think it is. If you haven't heard of Oculus Rift it's a headset. You put it on your head. It ties to the PC right now.

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
And what you see is you see full 3D out the goggles but as you turn your head your field of vision moves.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
So when you look up, you look up. When you look down, you look down. So as you imagine the games have to kind of support this technology.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
So right now it's a lot of demos and concept things and that's really what I looked at.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
And one of the things I looked at was a very Myst style type of game where you were walking around these different ramps.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
And you can use an Xbox 360 controller to walk. That's how you move forward and things like that. The looking is different.

32:03.000 --> 32:10.000
And you can go in these rooms and you can flip the stage upside down so you kind of have that sensation of flipping upside down while you're doing it.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
And that was a really cool little demo to do. Now Bobby did do some injection drivers so we could do some fun stuff.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Like he had a Super Nintendo emulator thing so we could play Mario Kart with the Oculus Rift which basically looked like this big theater.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
But as you looked, it was really detailed. Like if you look down, you see a little shadow holding a controller playing the game.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
If you look up, you see a projector on the ceiling that actually is projecting the actual image you see in front of you.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
So I thought that was a very immersive cool thing. But here was the really cool one.

32:41.000 --> 32:52.000
He had a GameCube emulator with F-Zero GX. So I got to play F-Zero GX on the Rift and I'll tell you the first time I went around a loop, that was quite the sensation.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
That was something else. Because you know, imagine you put this thing on, you have headphones on, it's a trip.

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
So yeah, it's something you have to experience. I can't explain it to you but I will tell you it's a pretty impressive piece of technology.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
It works. The one thing I could say about it is that it's low resolution but it's supposed to be because it's a dev kit.

33:14.000 --> 33:24.000
Right now it's a dev kit. And if I looked really closely, I could actually see the little pieces of glass or whatever that make up the RGB or whatever it is.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
You know how if you sit up really close to an old television, you can see the little pieces of color that make up the big picture?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
You can kind of see that in the Rift a little bit.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Like the RGB artificing, right?

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
Exactly, yeah. But again, I'm being super nitpicky. The sensation of being able to look around and having it move with you in real time is pretty cool.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
And the 3D is done very well.

33:47.000 --> 34:00.000
The last time I played a VR game, it was at Santa Cruz the Boardwalk and it was Quake 1 and I think Duke Nukem 3D.

34:00.000 --> 34:08.000
But we played two deathmatches in that game. Yeah, that was kind of derpy because it's Quake.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
You can imagine those screens were very low resolution. It's like having two TVs in front of your eyes. But it was fun.

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, apparently on the PC while you have the headset on, Bobby could see what I was doing because it shows you on the PC it just splits the screen in left and right.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
Like what's going on in the left eye and what's going on in the right eye. So he could see everything I was doing in the Rift, which is cool.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
Let's see, Black Wolf is in chat right now. Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf who tapes before us at Voice of the Geeks Network says,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
The Gallery Airworld demo was the name of the Myst thing I was playing. It was pretty cool.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
So there was another demo that involved a house, but there was like all you did is you walked in.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
You know what it really reminded me of? It was the modern version of, remember all those old virtual reality demos back in the mid 90s?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I remember there was this old one where you walked around the neighborhood with a car.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
They should totally have that for the Oculus Rift. Like the old 90s virtual reality demos.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
They probably do. Bobby didn't show me everything. He didn't have time.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You know what? It just keeps popping into my head over and over with Oculus Rift.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
The Lawnmower Man? Yes! I was thinking of, yes.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Well the movie, the book had nothing to do with it.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Now is the time to bring back the Lawnmower Man game or something. It would be kind of fun.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
So again, Oculus Rift is one of those things you just have to try it for yourself.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Not even a TV show could explain it to you because you have to have it on your head and try it yourself.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
I will say this too. One other thing.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
That means you have to give it head?

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
Well here's the thing DarkSakura. You'd hate it because your motion sickness, I couldn't play it for more than 20 minutes before I was like, okay I need to take this thing off.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
I was getting motion sick playing Borderlands 2.

35:40.000 --> 35:51.000
And that's this device's biggest weakness. I can't possibly see how somebody can have a two hour marathon gaming session with this thing.

35:52.000 --> 35:59.000
You might get used to it or something, but I just, I really worry about the effect it may have on people.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean, here we are talking about earlier in the show Nintendo putting out a TV system.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
He had porn. He did not share porn with you.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
He didn't show me the porn!

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
That is not. That is not.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
He's making me come back next year. That's what it is. It's a big ploy to get me to come back next year.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
That is just downright.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I could have seen boobies on Oculus Rift.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That is very rude that you don't share porn with your guests.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
Very rude. Bobby. Alright. Well anyway, I guess it gives me a reason to go back next year.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
But anyway, the sickness thing though, that's a legit concern I would have.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
I'm really curious to see like what are the long term effects this thing has?

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Like what do the warnings on this thing look like? What do doctors think about it?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Because they are legitimate concerns.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
There's bound to be epilepsy concerns.

36:44.000 --> 36:54.000
Long term effects, you may be immersed into the 3D world and may become a cybernetic being that will then try to take over the whole electric infrastructure and internet.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
This is the start of the Matrix.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
This is the start of the Matrix.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
A la Lawn Mower Man.

37:00.000 --> 37:06.000
It is. Remember when you get killed in the Matrix, you get killed in real life just because of the sensations or whatever?

37:07.000 --> 37:15.000
When you are going over this loop in F-Zero, I felt it a little bit. It wasn't the same as riding a roller coaster.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
There was. I don't know if Bobby has seen it yet. I'm sure he has. I think you may have seen it from him.

37:21.000 --> 37:30.000
But they have a, it was a game made in unity, a Tron light cycle demo with the Oculus Rift.

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
Bobby. Bobby Black Wolf is defending his choices in chat saying Rob wanted to go drink before I got to the porn.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Well that is probably accurate.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
I think Booze Over Porn is.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
To be fair that is probably accurate.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
And besides that, porn is just really bad comedy.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
Alright so yes, I tried the Oculus Rift people. Not that I'm going to say you have that kind of money to buy one.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
But I'm sure these demos are going to start to get out there more and more, add other expos and so forth.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
It was something you have to experience for yourself.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
It very well could be the future of gaming as we'll get into in gaming news here in a minute.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But first, some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We do have a quick housekeeping note here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
Something that we did announce at our DragonCon panel on Saturday was that a new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network Radio.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
Yay! And very happy to have this show on board with us.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
The show is Electric Sistahood and it's going to be debuting Tuesdays at, I always get screwed up by time zones.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Tuesdays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
And this is really cool because it's going to lead right into Anime Jam Sessions pre-show and their live shows.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Now we have a Tuesday block. We have a Monday block, a Wednesday block, and a Tuesday block now.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Instead of just one show on Tuesdays. So it's pretty nice.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Have we gone up a level?

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
We have leveled up. And I really like that Electric Sistahood is very much a girl power show.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
You know, it's fronted by two sisters who live out of Boston.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
And I love, you know, obviously they have guys that they work with too.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
There's the Boston Bastard Brigade, some of them that we met at E3 and so forth.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And they do a lot with EGM now and so forth.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
But I just, I love that we are diversifying things more here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
I mean we already had a great female fronted show in Girls Gone Wow.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
And lots of strong women voices on the network with you and Christina and Jessica and Patty and, you know, everybody.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
So, sorry if I'm, I know I'm leaving people out.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
But yeah, I am loving what we're doing here at VOG.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
We embrace diversity.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
That is right.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We play Genesis and Super Nintendo and Turbo Graphics.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
And once in a while you may catch us off the air listening to Sonic US and Japanese soundtracks.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
No. No. That doesn't happen.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Alright. Rama's in chat.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
That only happens when I hook up the Sega CD.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Rama's in chat very excited saying East Coast run Tuesday nights on VOG Network.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Yes, I guess that is true. It is an East Coast night Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
If you have a geek-centered show or you know someone that produces a geek-centered show that you think would be a good fit for the Voice of Geeks Network,

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
we are looking to add to our family even more.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
You can get in touch with me, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
All we ask is that it be an established show because we want to make sure that the people are dedicated to their craft

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
because so many podcasts do fizzle in the first few weeks, unfortunately.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So we want to make sure that it's already established that the folks are dedicated.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
And we are a little filled up on video game shows at this point.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Electric Sisterhood also focuses on video games, although they also do tech and anime, so they're a little bit that.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
So if your show is primarily video games, that might be a bit too much for the network right now.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
But we have big-time openings for board games as a show I want real bad.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
We don't have anything on comics, and I'd love to get a comic-based show.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I've been trying to talk to a couple people.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Well, where is that pilot, madam?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, you know what? I need to hear from a certain somebody who lives in the Bay Area.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
God, why'd you make my accent come back?

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
But you get the idea. So you can contact me again, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGNetwork.com,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
use the passphrase, SPOON.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
Alright, enough promotion. Let's get into video game news. It's what you guys are here for. Loki!

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Alright, so let's talk about promotion.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
The Xbox One, they finally announced that their launch date will be the 22nd.

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
Also Friday, also eight years after the Xbox 360 launch, and one week past the PlayStation 4 launch.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
And also one week before Black Friday, which is when you expect consoles are going to come out.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Why were people so dead set on, oh, Xbox One's going to be the first to market, and it has to be the first?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Honestly, I still think it's coming out too early. I think that they're not going to have enough.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
Well, they're releasing in a very few regions, and I think they're going to...

42:04.000 --> 42:15.000
I remember Major Nelson, he's like, okay, look, here's the first case of boxes, or the systems, off the assembly line.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
And he tweeted that, I'm like, I almost wanted to respond back, I'm like, it's not that impressive, that's only two systems, buddy.

42:22.000 --> 42:31.000
You know, that would have been rude of me, and I did not do that. So, I thought that in my head, laughed to myself, and went back to working.

42:32.000 --> 42:41.000
But, yeah, so that is coming out there. It's going to be launching 13 markets, and, you know, cool. 500 bucks, all that fun stuff.

42:41.000 --> 42:51.000
On top of that, though, there's going to be some minor tweaks. One, they made the announcement that they're going to be upping the processor speed a little bit.

42:52.000 --> 43:02.000
I guess that they tested the system runs cool enough, and so now they can kick up the processor speed to 1.75 gigahertz instead of 1.6 gigahertz.

43:02.000 --> 43:11.000
And then, of course, the CPU got boosted early in August from, was it, from 800 to 853 megahertz.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
What kind of difference that's going to make, I don't think it's going to be night and day, but whatever.

43:16.000 --> 43:28.000
So, cool, better specs. Also, in Europe, you're going to be getting FIFA 14 with your Xbox One Day One Edition consoles.

43:28.000 --> 43:38.000
Also, there were a few retailers in case you didn't want the FIFA. You can also get a Forza 5, so I believe that's separate.

43:39.000 --> 43:48.000
Nothing like that announced yet for the US or North America. Not sure if they're going to do anything like that, but I don't know. It'd be interesting.

43:49.000 --> 43:57.000
And then, also, there was, this is like a bunch of bullet points from different things. So, the Xbox One can support up to eight controllers at once.

43:58.000 --> 44:07.000
Remember, the PlayStation 3 can support up to seven. I believe there was like NBA 2K used that, and I don't know, maybe FIFA, and that's about it.

44:08.000 --> 44:16.000
And then, of course, PlayStation 4 only four. So, you know, right there, people are going, there you go, Xbox One's going to win this generation because they support eight controllers.

44:16.000 --> 44:28.000
When have you ever had that many people over playing one video game? Well, I shouldn't say that. There are parties, and I've seen Rock Band Nights and so forth, but that's so few and far between.

44:29.000 --> 44:40.000
Its implementation is going to be very limited. I mean, like I said, there is only a couple, like, I swear, less than five games that probably use that seven controller configuration because they're just not going to do that.

44:40.000 --> 44:53.000
I mean, sure, Microsoft would like you to believe that there's going to be a lot of situations that require that, so you have to buy those extra controllers, but I don't think that there's actually going to be, you know, there's probably going to be four players, like, you know, like most games are going to be four players.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
I don't think you're going to have eight people, and definitely not split screen because that'd be just fucking stupid.

44:59.000 --> 45:08.000
Don't get me wrong. I think it's cool that, and like, I'm not knocking Xbox One for having that, but I'm just saying it's not the deal maker or breaker that some people on the internet are making out to be.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
It's like, okay, neat. Let's see what games are going to do with that. What are games going to do with that? We'll see.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
It'd be better if you could hook up eight Kinects.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
No, it would not.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

45:24.000 --> 45:43.000
Alright, and then, also, external storage will not be supported at launch, so the 500 gigabyte hard drive that comes in there, well, that's going to have to be enough for a while because that's all you can do with it, because you're not going to be able to store stuff using the USB ports yet.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
So, I hope those games aren't that big.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
There's not that many games coming out. I mean, 500 gigabytes is quite a bit.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Why is there an expectation here that we're going to get a free game just because Europe is?

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
I think because people think that they want, it's not fair, Rob. It's not fair. Honestly, I think it's because the price point's too high.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
But, Daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.

46:06.000 --> 46:14.000
I think that they think that the price point's still too high and that they keep trying to lure more people into buying the system.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
Europe pays more for their systems, though, in games in general, though, don't they, when you convert dollars to Euros and all that?

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
I understand that, but it would still be the same, you know, so you're going to have a more sensitive game.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And Sony's traditionally had the advantage in Europe, right?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't know.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
I get it.

46:32.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't think that they will, but, I mean, people would like to think that, I guess. I would be kind of annoyed if it was Madden, you know, like, I don't fucking care about Madden.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah, but a lot of fucking people care about Madden.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
I understand that.

46:46.000 --> 46:55.000
That is a pretty big deal if they do get that. I mean, as much as I'm sitting here saying I don't think people should have an expectation about it, if they do come out and say Madden's coming out free with the Xbox One, there's going to be a lot of people that are like,

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
oh dude, but if you get Xbox One, you get Madden. But I still think that price difference is going to be a little like, but it's also $100 more, dude.

47:02.000 --> 47:20.000
I think what they could do is like maybe some free live, maybe, or free something else, you know, that doesn't really cost them anything, like, you know, free, like digital stuff, you know, maybe like a free, you know, you get, well, Killer Instinct, I don't know, maybe that would be kind of, you get Killer Instinct.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
You are getting that.

47:22.000 --> 47:45.000
But then again, you know, it's free to play, you know, essentially for demos, free to play. Um, I don't know, I think it seems like you get more value with the PlayStation 4 as far as like PlayStation Plus, you know, because you're getting some free games with that, but you don't really get any, I mean, maybe they offer like some free games with gold, you know, because they're doing that games of gold thing right now with, you know, Xbox 360.

47:45.000 --> 48:03.000
You know, maybe they offer something like that for the Xbox One, like one of the games, but I don't know, I don't think it's necessary, but I think that there might be something they need to do when, you know, and maybe that close to Black Friday's, you know, they're going to have some retailers doing that already.

48:04.000 --> 48:29.000
Okay. All right. Well, let's move on, talking about, this isn't necessarily console-based, at least for now, but it looks like it might end up there, and this was some huge news that came out. It technically was the week we were off, but this is such huge news that we have to talk about it tonight, and it is about a Kickstarter, which usually, you know, whatever, these things are turning out to be a dime a dozen, but this one is, this one is shaping up to be a game changer.

48:29.000 --> 48:44.000
It is Kiji Inafune's new Kickstarter. If you don't know that name, he is the creator of Mega Man, and he was formerly a Capcom producer. He has turned to Kickstarter to fund a game called Mighty No. 9, and it's Mega Man.

48:44.000 --> 48:52.000
Like, it's not, I'm not, you're not supposed to say that because, you know, oh, well, there's, there, there are some differences in the way things are, it's fucking Mega Man.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
It's fucking Mega Man.

48:53.000 --> 49:08.000
It's fucking Mega Man. It's, it's the game people want that Capcom, for whatever reason, figured would fail, and now Capcom's having to eat a little crow with this because this Kickstarter currently, it was funded, I want to say, within the first day.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Of course, a couple hours.

49:09.000 --> 49:17.000
It was a couple hours, and where's it at right now? 1.8 million, 1.8 million, 32,000 backers with 22 days to go.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Which means now we get a Linux version, a Mac version.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
That's right, a Making of Documentary, New Game Plus, and Turbo Mode, two bonus stages.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
And almost console versions.

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
Almost console versions. If they hit 2.2 million, which they will, they're gonna get PS3, 360, and Wii U versions of this game.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
I'm just upset that it uses Amazon payments, which for some reason, for me, is not working.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, for Kickstarter?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Because this was going to take my Kickstarter virginity.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Was it?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Just, just hold out.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh yes, I was going to, my body was ready.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Why?

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Because freaking Mega Man. Fuck.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Fair enough.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Does that need an explanation?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
But it's not Mega Man. This is Mighty No. 9.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Do not care. Do not care. It will be Mega Man in my heart.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
The art is only similar because it's the same guy.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Do. Not. Care.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
And it's not because I don't like it, but because, you know, I've kind of learned the Kickstarter stuff now.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
It's like, I put money down now, and the game doesn't come out until, like, late next year or something.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
It's like, no thanks, I'll just keep my money now and I'll buy it when it comes out.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Because it's gonna be probably about the same price anyways.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
You know, 10, 15 dollars, and you put down 10 or 15 dollars for the game now.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
It's like, whatever. That's it.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
I've been very conservative with Kickstarter stuff.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Except for Video Game High School, of course.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I'll buy anything they put out.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
I found it very interesting in that video.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
Did you guys watch the Kickstarter video? The little 5 minute, well produced thing that had the pitch in it?

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
There was a very quick line, but something that really caught my attention was something about, he said,

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
when the game he wanted to make, or the game that he was making, was cancelled, he was devastated.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
And I was kinda like, wow.

50:54.000 --> 51:01.000
So this whole Mega Man universe thing really burned him to the point where he's gonna make it anyway.

51:01.000 --> 51:11.000
Well, you know, it's not Mega Man, but this is just so crazy to me how Capcom really just said,

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
you know what, this franchise just isn't worth investing in anymore.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
And now you've got 32,000 people climbing saying yes it is.

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
Well, you had 100,000 people that joined that Facebook group and then more.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, but it's important to put your money where your mouth is.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
I think that a lot of those people are gonna put their money where their mouth is.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
I think they will, too.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
I think there are quite a few people like you that just don't want to participate in Kickstarter

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
that will wait for the game to come out.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
There's a lot of reasons why, especially there's a lot of, we'll get into some of that stuff later on,

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on with Kickstarter that some of these projects aren't worth backing.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
Not to say that this one is one of those, but it's just kind of...

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Is it the Ouya Burn?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
No, it's not the Ouya.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
It's just like there's other projects out there.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
I've gotten into some of that stuff before, but not to get so far off topic.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
It's just I don't really want to, I've been very much, I'm gonna put money down.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
I did that for Shadowrun and Shadowrun Online and stuff, and Shadowrun's awesome,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
and I haven't played that game since I got it.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
I got the game, and I'm like, cool, I have the game.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Alright, I'm gonna go off and do something else now.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
And Shadowrun Online, cool, I pledged for that, and I haven't played that yet.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
And there's still a few more games that I have back that haven't even come out yet,

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
and I just don't play them once I've paid for them.

52:33.000 --> 52:41.000
Here's how Beck, the hero of Mega Man, which isn't there supposed to be a female command called Call?

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
So instead of Rock and Roll, we get Beck and Call, right?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Okay, so here's how Beck is different.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Beck takes the abilities of the enemy robots he defeats,

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
but he uses those abilities further, transforming parts of his body,

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
like his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
That sounds really awesome, but it's fucking Mega Man.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Not that that's bad, that's not a bad thing, I'm just saying this is hilarious,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
because it is fucking Mega Man that we are backing.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
And the other games may just change the color palette a little bit and just give him a different weapon.

53:13.000 --> 53:19.000
We're changing his design a little bit, and his color palette, and he's fucking Mega Man.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
It's like another Mega Man series, Mega Man Y or something.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
It's like if the creators of DDR came out and said,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
hey, you know what, we're going to make In the Groove,

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
but we're just going to change things just enough so we don't get sued,

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
because we don't have the rights to DDR anymore.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
And that's what we have.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Bochi Kawa in chat at live.vog.network.com says,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
I was really concerned once they called the main character Beck,

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
but once Call came to my attention, I was totally okay with it.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I totally fucking hate that band, Beck.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's not a band, it's a person.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Whatever.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
If you have two turntables and a microphone, you're banned.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That's like Alan's favorite musician.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
But the Ghetto Chip malfunction EP was really good.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It was really good. Beck should do music for them.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
Actually, no, he shouldn't, because they actually have the original lady

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
that did the Mega Man 1 music is doing the music for this.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Besides that, Beck did a lot of the music for Scott Pilgrim.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Let me pull up the...

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Remember?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Yes, I do, and that was great.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
Let me pull up the Kickstarter real quick, because...

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Sorry, live radio, what can you do?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I want to actually play a little bit of this,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
because they actually have it on the Kickstarter page.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
They have some of the, it's not Mega Man,

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
Mega Man number 9 theme song by...

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Scrolling down here, where...

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
God, lord, there's so much content on this page already.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Oh, this is terrible radio, I'm very sorry, you guys.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
And I like how he's the number 9, because there are eight other bosses

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
that he's gonna have to fight.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
Manami Matsumae did the soundtrack of the original Mega Man

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
and the iconic soundtracks, and she is going to be doing this game,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and already has the theme song out there.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
Like, you can just see the camera panning up the tall story building to this music.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
Actually, I think they did that in the Kickstarter video, didn't they?

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
I think they did.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Let me fast forward a little bit, so you get more of that vibe.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Totally not Mega Man, totally a new thing, totally.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
You gotta admit, though, the music, the vibe with the music

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
between the first Rock Man and the second one,

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
had a completely different play vibe.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
It did, and I gotta be honest, my favorite music was the first Mega Man game.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
Like, Elec Man's stage, and Guts Man, I mean, those are iconic to me.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I was actually a really big fan of Fire Man's music.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Not that two was bad, because you had things like Bubble Man,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
but one was great.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I totally love those new characters that, instead of having Construction Homeless,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
they have construction cones on their head.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.000
And then, also, the robotic dog that looks nothing like Rush, but is Rush.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
So, it does look like we're totally gonna see this...

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
It's not a bad thing, but, dude, it's Mega Man.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
No, and I'm excited about this.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
And I like the art style they're going with it,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
because what I like about it is that,

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
you remember how Mega Man 9 and 10, like, purposefully went retro?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And, like, that was cool, don't get me wrong,

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
but I kind of like that this is 2D in the new generation.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Does that make sense?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Like, you know, kind of what a lot of us just want to see in a frickin' game.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
So, I'm glad that he's getting to do the game the way he wants to do it,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
and there it is.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I think Rama puts it best.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
Mighty No. 9 is a Mega Man in another parallel universe.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
S.S.G.A. 100 Matt in our chatroom brings up a good point.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
Manami Matsumae also did some of the soundtrack for Shovel Knight,

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
which isn't Mega Man per se, but it was very, you know,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
and that Kickstarter did crazy good, too.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
I think I backed that one.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
I did back that one.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Did I? No, I think I just missed it, unfortunately.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
I backed it.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.000
Yeah. I'll probably get it later, when the game comes out, but, yeah.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Anyhow, I could talk about this further,

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
but this game's happening, folks, and it'll at least be on Steam,

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
but I'm hard-pressed to imagine it's not going to make it to PlayStation 3.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Are we going to get a sidekick that's going to have a sword, too,

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
and his name will be Minus?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
No, that'll be in Mighty No. 10.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Mighty No. 10.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Or whatever.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
How will they call the sequels to this?

57:25.000 --> 57:31.000
Because this isn't true, not Mega Man, unless you have Mighty No. 9, Part 2,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Mighty No. 9, Part 3.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Maybe they'll do letters instead.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
That'll be how it differs.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
MM9?

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
Yeah, no, Mighty No. 9B, Mighty No. 9C.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
I don't know. Whatever.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
I have some stuff and things, but mostly about VR stuff.

57:49.000 --> 57:56.000
I mentioned Oculus Rift earlier because of experiences with Bobby's crazy headset.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Well, it looks like Sony's got a similar plan going on.

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
They have a VR set for the PS4 that should be announced at the Tokyo Game Show,

58:05.000 --> 58:11.000
and they already reported to Eurogamer that the device would be coming out sometime in 2014.

58:12.000 --> 58:20.000
So it's like they're trying to get past the move aspect and really lean toward the Rift.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
That's what it seems like to me.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
I wonder if the PS4 is going to have games that are compatible with either or both,

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
or if they're going to insist on using just their headset.

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
Well, even a rumor is still going around that Microsoft's going to go the same route.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
Remember their whole leaked game plan or whatever you want to call it with Kinect and stuff

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
and this crazy VR shit with that?

58:48.000 --> 58:53.000
Even with the Xbox One and the tagline for it and everything, it was all accurate.

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
So next year we're supposed to see some of this weird shit unless it gets pushed a little bit.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
I'd say next year to early 2015 we'll be hearing something about this,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
but I think it's the way it's going to go.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
I'm telling you, if a Sony executive or a Microsoft executive played the Oculus Rift,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
that's why they're trying to get a slice of it.

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
And it seems like it's really just gaining a lot more speed for people developing for that kind of technology.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
I mean, look who they're supporting it.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Nintendo, this is your chance.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
Nintendo on, remember? Remember that whole concept video?

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
There is no shame in going back and saying, hey, we saw that April Fool's joke or whatever you want,

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
pre-E3 joke, and we're going to make it happen anyways.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
You know what? We could be seeing the return of the Virtual Boy.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
But it's so different. The Virtual Boy was silly and the 3D didn't work very well and it was all one color.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
The Oculus Rift is awesome.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
But now the technology is there to make it work.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I mean, imagine if you had something like, say, for your DS that would play the upper screen stuff through a virtual environment,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
or even hook up your Wii to do a virtual Wii.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Here's the thing about this, although I'm excited for it, I would like to see something like this happen,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
especially if they can make it economical.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I don't want all of gaming to go down this route.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I just don't want to see the entire industry cop on this.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It's all about the VR headsets. That's just like motion gaming.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Just like 3D?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Yeah, it's kind of like I don't want everybody to go there.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And part of that has to do with the fact, again, I don't think you can play it for as long periods of time.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You have some serious accessibility issues with a VR headset.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I mean, you know, Jamie, can you imagine if all your games were on a VR headset?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You'd probably be pissed because it's like...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Well, I wouldn't buy them if they were all on a VR headset. That's the final thing.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I would have to have something that I can play that, number one, would make me want to barf all over the house,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
and I could use a mouse.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And we'll always have indies. I mean, if nothing else, there'll always be people that don't want to develop for this kind of stuff.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But I'm just saying, I like this as an enhancement, not as a, this is the rest of the industry forever.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But, you know, I really do want to say that Nintendo really did give us the big idea.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I would have to say was one of the first inspirations for this type of thing.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I mean, yeah, we had those little virtual environment things before, like at Q's are, you know, where you could get in.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It gave me a rotten headache.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But the Virtual Boy was the first attempt, I think, of bringing a gaming experience in a virtual environment home.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Isn't it funny that Gunpei Okoye got so much shit over that system, but yet maybe he was just really ahead of his time?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I think that's the problem with any wise invention.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:56.000
You know, how many great technologies come out that are basically shot down because of either the technology is not caught up to it, the concept is too advanced, or people are not used to...

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well, in the Virtual Boy's case, it was that the technology wasn't truly there.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Or the red was the problem.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah, but the concept of that type of thing, I mean, we've seen different types of techs come out that are basically poo-pooed because they're not commercially viable.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:23.000
You know, we could be running, just look at our energy issues right now, we could be running on very clean energy right now if it wasn't that petroleum was so, you know, marketable.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I mean, hell, Betamax was far superior to VHS, yet look what went out.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Oh, because porn went VHS for one. Wasn't VHS the cheaper option too?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It was a little cheaper, but the better quality was the Betamax.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I mean, people are avoiding the better items because of market scare, but I mean, the technology wasn't there for the Virtual Boy, but it was a very advanced concept for its time.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And I think if it had waited another two years, it could have been something really great.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Or until the point that they could get full color on it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Or until they could have done Mode 7. Boy.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Alright, anyhow. Up next, Loki.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Alright, so there may be a slight delay in getting the Gaikai service for PlayStation 4 to roll out in Europe.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Apparently the problem is to issues with broadband internet availability in Europe.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And basically they're just saying they don't have a timeline for it right now because those services aren't available.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So the plan is to begin with North America next year, and the plan is to provide a streaming service that will allow PlayStation 3 content initially to be streamed.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Firstly, PlayStation 4, then the Vita, then PlayStation 3.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And so that will happen in 2004 in North America, initially.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And now, I guess they touched upon issues in broadband in Europe and during the presentation.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And they said that Europe is of course part of the roadmap, but the service will be deployed at some point in the future.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And for reasons outside of their control, it's been delayed.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And it kind of makes me wonder, at the same time, remember all those features they were trying to push originally with the Xbox One stuff?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And having to be always connected and having broadband internet?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Man, that would have been a real big clusterfuck in Europe because they're having issues with some decent broadband.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And the area, I mean, what would have made people think, you know, this other cloud stuff's gonna work?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I don't know.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Well, or as you brought up when all the fuckery with Final Fantasy XIV was happening a couple weeks ago, you know.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Oh God, yeah.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Who's-

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Is that fixed now?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Yeah, it's a lot better now.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I mean, obviously there's still issues like what Dark Soccer was talking about earlier that she's having and all these other like weird isolated things.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But it's not on the large scale like we were having it, but there's still like pain points, if that makes sense.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Yeah.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
But there is a good percentage of people who are playing like it is a normal video game at this point.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I'm still gonna document what my experience was with their customer service is like tomorrow.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, good luck getting through. I've heard some nightmare stories about customer service.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But it seems that that's the only way people are getting anything to happen because they have so many tickets open and people keep reopening their ticket.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Ugh, yuck.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Well, anyhow, let's move on. Something that is supposed to help you with your Xbox One experience is Smart Glass, that's right.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Smart Glass, which I kind of was thinking Microsoft might have abandoned at one point because it came out for the 360 and then, well, that's it.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But Smart Glass is happening on Xbox One and there was some more information this week in an interview with Xbox Wire from Microsoft General Manager Ron Pessner,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
who talked about that the app will be more responsive for one. This app will connect to the Xbox One within four seconds.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That's much faster than the 360 connects today. Up to 16 Smart Glass devices are supposed to connect with a single Xbox One console.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Why?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Eight controllers and two phones a person. Sounds plausible.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Well, no. The Smart Glass devices would be like tablets. So why would you need 16 fucking tablets or phones?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Well, I will put it, I will give it this. If it's supposed to be interactive with movies and second screen with that, then people don't have to share one.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Like, each person could have one.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Or maybe it's like, you know, that somebody can be registered with a console and maybe you're talking family members too.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Maybe. No, no.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But Smart Glass is on phones. I think that having the 16 devices around, if you have the people, is not that hard to get.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Anyhow, there could be the use for game controllers with this, but I don't think that's where they're actually going.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's just, I mean, you can kind of use game control. I mean, not game control, but you can console control with Smart Glass today.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But it's a little eh.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That would be fantastic. Hey, cool. I can use on screen digital, you know, game pads.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You know, I still have that Smart Glass app on my phone.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Oh, yeah. Well, I have it too, but I just don't use it.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000
When away from the console, Smart Glass will still allow you to communicate with friends, check achievements, watch game DVR videos, and, of course, go shopping in the store.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
One thing, though, that Smart Glass on Xbox One will have is game help.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000
When publishing a game, you must submit a help manual that will aid players either in-game or through Smart Glass.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And you can actually say Xbox Help, and then the help thing will appear in the console.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But you can also do it in Smart Glass, where you click on the help icon, and it will show you exactly whatever it is that you want to see there.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It should be noted, though, when you do say Xbox Help, you'll see a poof of smoke, and then, out from a shadows, Clippy will arrive.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It looks like you're trying to...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You summon me?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
It looks like you're trying to access Killer Instinct.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Choose one of these three options. Oh, God. I can only imagine what that's going to look like.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious, like, okay, well, how is this second screen experience going to really be enhanced?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Because Smart Glass, as it is right now, is kind of, eh? So, I don't know.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Anyhow, that's it. Smart Glass on Xbox One.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Hopefully, it will be something that doesn't fade away in a few months.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Dark Sakura?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Well, there is actually some stuff going on for Microsoft in Europe right now.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So, what's going on is that they have this Xbox Live Rewards thing that's going to be going on, where basically you get rewards for playing new games.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:48.000
As it works is that if you play a new game for more than ten hours, a disc-based release on top of that, you get a thousand credits every time you play a game.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Well, in the UK, that would be 67 pence. That's like a soda, I think.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It's basically, in North America, I think it's a thousand credits equals a dollar.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Yeah. So, at any rate, of course, you know, the more games you play, the more rewards you get, the more points you get.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And, like, if you get up between $3,000 to $9,999, you get Contender, and the lowest is where you just get 50 credits back on every little bit that you spend.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
That would be the equivalent of 800 Microsoft points.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So, it's supposed to be deposited every 15th and 30th of each month once you hit 5,000 credits.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So, I don't know how this is going to work. Like, right now, I know that when I switched all of my stuff over from my points to money, it gave me a dollar. I bought a song.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Here's how you earn credits in this. Basically, you can complete an apps punch card, which I think you have to buy so many apps or something, or use the apps for so long.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Was that like how when I buy ten pink berries, I get a free one?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Something like that.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
That's weird.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.000
They have a complete My Map Pack punch card, so if you buy, like, so many map packs, you get 5,000 credits.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Make your first Xbox store purchase 1,250 credits.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Complete My Movies and TV punch card, 3,000 credits.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Take a survey, 250 credits.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And then, also, see, play a new game for ten hours is 1,000 credits. Refer a friend, 1,000 credits.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
This sounds like how to get a badge in Steam. One of those badges.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Renew my membership. What I want to know is how many fucking credits do I get on my birthday because it used to be 25 cents.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So, is that any better now? Do I get 25 cents still? Or is it like, you know, 50 cents?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Ooh. Well, inflation and interest and all that.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I think it's a little bribery. Plus, I think the playing ten hours thing is a little excessive.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I mean, it can't be ten hours at a time. It has to be something that you're going to play for a couple of days and then you get your thing.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I think it's during the month. I think it's within a month of it releasing.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
If I was getting Kingdom Hearts HD on 360, that might be happening.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah, but I haven't sat down to play a game like that. Well, I have on my PC. I take that back. So...

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Well, I don't think it's at a time. It's just...

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Well, I know it's not at a time, but there's sometimes... You know, people have busy lives. Some people only play on the weekends for a few hours at a time.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Really? You couldn't squeak out ten hours of Mass Effect in the month that it came out?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
While I'm unemployed, yes.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Actually, and I easily sunk a hundred hours into Mass Effect across three months, I should be ashamed to say.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So I would have hit this ten hours easy when Mass Effect first came out.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Well, I did do that in one day.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I don't want to think ten hours isn't that ridiculous. There is a cap, though, I know what you can get a month...

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000
As long as it wasn't ten hours over and over and over and over again, but yeah, ten hours is not too hard to meet.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I know people that watch that much TV.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I think the other thing, though, with having that ten hour limitation is that they basically also discourage any return time.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Because I know that, like, and I only know Game Stops because Dan managed one, their return policy was like a full refund in seven days.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And not, I don't know how many people are going to get ten hours of gameplay in, like, say it's like the average student, okay?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You got school all day, you have homework, you come home, and then are you really going to have a lot of time to play?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Most of the play is going to be done on the weekends.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So that's going to cut out some of that return time right there.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That's where I see the ten hours coming in, but at the same time, I think it's a little underhanded.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Well, it's only really twenty minutes a day.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I guess that's true.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I mean, it's twenty minutes you could be exercising or you could play some Mass Effect.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Exercise your fingers.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games you can sink ten hours into this month as we look at some release dates.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Let's see, so this week we've got NHL 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
On PC, the Elder Scrolls Anthology.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000
If you just learned about this Elder Scrolls series, you know, you can pick up all of those games on PC.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
All the cool kids are playing this Elder Scrolls.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Exactly, Elder Scrolls, that sounds like games for old people.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Kingdom Hearts HD, or 1.5 HD Remix on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
The Sims 3 has an expansion pack coming out.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Sims 3 movie stuff, so that's coming out this week as well.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And on Vita, hopefully, hopefully and actually a good first person shooter now on the Vita.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Killzone Mercenary coming out this week as well.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I believe that's it, I think.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Let me quickly glance over this real quick.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Didn't forget anything.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Nope, that would be it.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan then and check out the releases over there.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Oh, I did, I did.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
God damn it, Loki.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
One week from today, I forgot. One week from today, Wonderful 101.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
A Sunday release as Nintendo releases tend to be.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Alright, let's go to Japan and check out PlayStation 3 releases.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Air Conflicts Vietnam on September 12th, along with AKB1 149 Renee So Senkyou comes out in regular and limited edition.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
What?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
No, I think that's something that I was looking at the other day.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Was it? Here's what it looks like. Isn't this like a girly band?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Never mind, that's, yeah.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
This is like girly band karaoke, pretty swimsuit photos, I don't know.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Yeah, that's not what I think it is. I was thinking of something else.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
What is this labeled adventure? Is this like the Spice World game or something? Who knows?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I don't know.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Wait a minute, that was the limited edition. Let me look at the regular one.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
The regular one, are there screenshots? Nope, just the box art.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Pretty Japanese girls, some playing the guitar, some are getting married, whatever.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I was wondering if that was like an AKB48 thing.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
No.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Max Payne 3, it goes into the classics, so that means a price reduction this week in Japan on September 12th.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Going over to the Xbox 360, just Air Conflicts Vietnam is the only release that is also on the 360 this week.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Going to the PlayStation Vita, nothing until the 19th, this week looks pretty empty.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But if we look at the Wii U and the 3DS, the Wii U doesn't really get anything until September 26th.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000
That's when Epic Mickey 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the 26th, but that'll be a ways out.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Looking at the 3DS, however, on the 14th there's quite a few games because old Monster Hunter 4 is being released on the 3DS, which is kind of a big deal.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000
There's a shit ton of peripherals that go with that for Monster Hunter 4, such as like you want a new stand for it or a sticker or pouches or what have you.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That is huge.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
There's also a special 3DS-LL coming out for Monster Hunter 4.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
There's a black version and a white version.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
There's special packs that come with the game.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
That is on the 14th.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:18.000
So, I imagine that's Japan's big release and the one that actually some people over here would probably be importing because I know some people are really into their Monster Hunter.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Sony PSP, not to be left out in the cold.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Yes, PSP, not V.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Brothers Conflict Brilliant Blue in regular and limited edition this week on the PSP.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Well, we have a few things coming out in the UK.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.000
On the 10th we have Amnesia, A Machine for Pigs on PC and Metro Last Night on Mac.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
For the 11th we have DuckTales Remastered coming out on Xbox 360 and Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
On the 12th we have Arma 3 and NHL 14.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And on the 13th we have I Am Alive on PC, King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix and Rayman Legends on the Vita.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
That's it.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Yes, so Steam is adding some more stuff to their trading system.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Now they have this Steam Trade Offers program.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And I guess what it allows you to do is it allows, I guess, friends to suggest trade deals for inventory items.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Which you can accept, counter, or decline.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And I guess it's a way to negotiate cards maybe?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I don't know. It would be nice if I could trade my games that I have that I don't use.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But yeah, so that's what they have right now.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I guess you can check out other people's inventories and so if they have a card that you want or something you can be like,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Hey, can I have that card? I'll trade you my other card.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
More stuff on Steam to waste your time and money.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I was very disappointed. I didn't get a single booster pack while I was at Dragon Con.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But I bet the card trading has died down because the summer sale is over.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
So how do you get booster packs in games? I play a lot of...

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Once you've got the most...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Let's say a game has six cards available. Three of them will drop as you play the game.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
For like every twenty minutes you play the game you get a card.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
But up to half the most that's in the set.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
After you've got all those drops you're eligible for a booster pack.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So when someone else crafts a badge, somebody in the community at random will get a booster pack.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
That's how it keeps going. So the more people craft the more booster packs that go out.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Okay, I guess I got all mine in Saints Row IV because I have four cards.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Does it say that you have any left to earn?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I can't see how in Saints Row IV. You've probably played that to death.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yeah, I don't have any more to earn. I have duplicates even.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Okay, yeah, so you'll be eligible for booster packs for Saints Row IV.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
But to be honest, some people trade them, but I just got to the point where I got lazy.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I sold all my duplicates in the marketplace and then bought what I wanted to make badges.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It worked! So there you go.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
ActDef saying, I got a Team Fortress 2 booster pack yesterday, so some people are getting them.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Alright, I got some music game news for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And the first game I want to talk about is a game called Cross Beats.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It's Cross X Beats, which makes me think this game is called Cross Cross Beats, which actually would make sense.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Because guess who's making Cross Cross Beats? Guess who the producer is?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
It's Naoki Madaya is actually producing this game for Capcom.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
He no longer works at Konami.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
He left Konami a year ago if you weren't aware.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Well, no, they're still making DDR. It's different producers.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000
But anyway, if you don't know who Naoki is, we used to talk a lot about DDR back in the day,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and Naoki used to be the producer of DDR. He did a lot of songs that were very famous that were in the game.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
He had all these different pseudonyms that he created songs under.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
He was a big driving force behind the music in the game.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So it goes without saying that a lot of these fans of Bamani projects in the past,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Naoki was still at Konami for a very long time.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:37.000
He did the Dance Dance Party or whatever that game was that wasn't so bad on the 360 arcade.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
That was all Naoki.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So he's left Konami now, and with Capcom he's going to do Cross Cross Beats.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It's an IOS game. It's a rhythm game on IOS.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Not a lot known about the game. We don't know when it's coming out.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Rumor is it could show up at Tokyo Game Show. That would certainly make sense.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It looks like the game is played with tapping, swiping, flicking.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Probably, considering it's on a touch screen, it'll probably get some easy similarities to Elite Beat Agents and Technica and that style of play.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
But I'm sure there will be unique things that differentiate it, such as the music.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000
If you've been playing Bamani games for a while, you might recognize Tatch is also doing some of the songs.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Void, Simon, Who's Some Thinker, DJ Simon, and all those guys appeared in media 2DX and the like.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
That's happy news.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Over the years.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Also speaking of music games, Theatrhythm apparently set to get a sequel.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Theatrhythm, the Final Fantasy music game on 3DS, I guess did well enough to necessitate a sequel called Final Fantasy Curtain Call.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
No idea what this could be.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But my thought is, could it maybe be that this is the fully packaged game with all the DLC?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So I wouldn't necessarily think it's a full sequel, but certainly Square has enough music in their archive.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Especially if you were to throw Chrono Trigger and other Square games into the mix.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The Secret of Mana and Evermore and all those games.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I'm sure there would be enough music to fill up a second game.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But I'm wondering if Curtain Call wouldn't just be an end of the year edition that packages everything and maybe a couple bonus tracks to try and sell this game all over again.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
We'll see.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
But there you go for music game news.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I liked Theatrhythm when I played it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I did too.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000
My only problem with Theatrhythm was that, I don't know, it was a bit expensive for me.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But at least the iOS version, you could do a little more piecemeal.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Anyhow, if Curtain Call really is even more songs, that'll help justify the price tag.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Square likes money.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Who doesn't like money?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Back when games were very expensive, no matter what it was you were buying.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Because they were all in cartridges.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Dark Sakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that she thinks that you kids should be playing this week.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Dark Sakura, what is the expensive cartridge classic game of the week?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It's Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord for the Sega Master System.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And also, I'm sorry that I could not find a longer music sample.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
All of the Let's Plays have freaking people talking over it.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It's fucking annoying.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I don't listen to the stupid thing to hear your voice.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I hear it. I watch it to watch the game.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Anyway, in Japan it was known as Hajanofuin, which is Seal of the Dark Lord.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And it came out on the PC-88 and then was ported to other systems.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Like I said, we got it on the Master System over here.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It's very similar to Phantasy Star.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.000
It has this grid type map to show you where parts of interest are in the game.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And it also has this sort of traveling feature it looks like.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So basically in this game, you play the hero and you have different screens.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Well, different parts of your screen that indicate what you do in the game.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So you have to collect all these mystical weapons in the armor and defeat the bad guy named Tararim and Seal of the Dark Lord around.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
So each of the areas on the screen, there's four parts.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
You have your stats on the lower left and that also lists all your party stats.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And then on the right you have your money, your weapon, that type of thing.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.000
You also have a kind of maze map on top that's more grid shaped that shows you where you are laid out.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And then you have sort of a walking section, the upper left one.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It'll either show you the world you're walking in or the cave that you're walking in and your surroundings.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
In battle it shows you your foes.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So it is built on a grid format.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You can move around and visit other places.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
It shows you where you need to be based on white squares that are there.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And it's a pretty classic RPG.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I mean this is one of the, I'd have to say one of the top ones for the Master System.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You also have different types of things that happen to you in the game.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
There's flame spells that you can be attacked with, sleep spells, you know the usual ones.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And every time you're put to sleep you take damage which I think is a little bit different than a lot of RPGs.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
It's all kinds of different strategies that you have to use to make it through the game.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And the world itself has three continents.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
There's different types of land.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
You have the plain, forest, mountains, and desert.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And each place of course has its own type of enemies that are indigenous to such land.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So you've got your towns too, you have smiths who can repair your weapons and healers and different shops.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And I mean it's typical RPG fare but it is one of the early ones.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
So the game is Miracle Warriors Seal of the Dark Lord.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
If you don't have it, why not?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Probably because not many people have a Master System anymore.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Yeah not anymore.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Find yourself a power-based converter, hook it into your Genesis, you're good to go.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
There it is, your classic game of the week for the Sega Master System, Miracle Warriors.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Nice obscure pick, Dark Sakura.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
That's kind of one I had to look into it a little more and I did watch some of those let's plays with the people talking and I was like, oh okay.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Dungeon Buster is actually funny.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Terror in the Dark Lord who is a half-naked demoness at the end of the game.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Did you have this game on Sega Master System?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I think I had two copies of this game.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Oh my gosh, is this something you came across later?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Keep in mind, Dan already had some of his games and he came into a box of Master System games for dirt cheap.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000
That's why we have, we will be doing, actually I was going to say we are going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:51.000
So I'm going to give VOG listeners first chance whenever we put up an auction, I'm giving VOG listeners first go at it.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
We will post it.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
How are you going to do that? Twitter, Tumblr?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Forums.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So we just had a Ninja Gaiden, we actually still have Ninja Gaiden Trilogy up on eBay right now if you've got 300 bucks.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
In the box manual mint condition.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Super rare game.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Super rare game.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
But great game.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yes.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
If I knew it was going to go for that I would have stolen the copy that I rented from my local store when I was younger.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Well we also have Final Fight Guy which is probably going up soon.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Nice.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Alright we're going to take a quick break but we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
The Frugal Question of the Week.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Some news on a new MOBA that's based off a familiar franchise.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
A fan made movie which I'm sure will get shut down in a matter of time.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Rapid Fire News and your calls and tweets and so forth when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening September 8th 2013 with the 518th episode of our program.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Before we get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News I did want to mention and thank here on the program our good buddy Jason or VX JasonXV if you will.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I don't know if you guys noticed but there was a new voice in the intro tonight and you'll hear him in the outro as well.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Decided to be our voiceover guy because he was doing some of the VOG bumpers anyway so it made sense and I don't know if you know but before it was me kind of processed through Audition with an echo and slowed down.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
What? It wasn't a real robot voiceover person.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Magic. It's magic so I always you know it was always a little bit silly so I'm trying something a little new so hopefully you guys like Jason's intro because I will say that takes commitment to do that because he basically has to kind of guess what we're going to talk about.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Guess what we're going to talk about and have it recorded by Saturday or Sunday and change it if I don't like it.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:53.000
No but he's pretty good about being able to know what we're going to talk about on the show so big thanks to Jason and I should also thank because we really don't thank him enough and we've used this song for what freaking like eight years.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Midi Head did the intro the actual music that you hear in the background and the other announcer here at the top of the show.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Midi Head you know we had him on the show way back in the day because he was well known he did some of the songs that were in the DDR Xbox games.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So we'd had him back on the show back when we were all about DDR and I think he ended up having a song in 2DX as well if I remember correctly.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
One of his remixes the In My Eyes remix or one of them was Jelly Kiss was in 2DX I think.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So big thanks to Midi Head and I don't plug him enough and he's still going to midihead.com I believe he does a lot of sounds and incidental stuff for actually for use for podcasting and so forth.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
So if you like our intro maybe Midi Head can do something for you for a small fee.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Alright let's get back into some gaming news with rapid fire news and a lot of stuff tonight. Loki.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Yes so let's see as I was talking about with Rob and Jimmy earlier there was a Mass Effect texture pack for the Minecraft Xbox 360 version.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Now not only does it kind of reskin everything it also includes a level based off of the Mars facility.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So that's kind of cool and then you also get character skins along with that so you can play as your characters and create your own worlds and do all that fun stuff.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So check it out it's only $2 or I'm sorry $4 is what that's available for.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Totally forgot to check that out and I need to.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And then of course there's this cool device and actually kind of inspired I want to make something very similar I was actually researching how much it would cost to do something like this.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But it's called the cross plane kind of think of the Wii U's gamepad but you can use it with pretty much any game console.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:00.000
So what it's going to have is basically the second screen it's got a small LCD screen that's HD and a wireless HDMI adapter built inside of it.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And then also these you know basically the same layout as the Wii U gamepad and it's got these cartridges that plug in the top that map the signal for whatever you're playing.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
You know if you have an Xbox 360 version you know you have that you can play with the Xbox 360 or using your PC I guess with that.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And then they have a PlayStation 3 one which you could sync up with the PlayStation 3 or with an Ouya so they've got those.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And they're seeking $350,000 to begin production if you want to back one of these it would cost you $300 or $350 to actually get one of the cross play devices which should be available.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I think sometime next year which for me is way too damn long for me to wait to make you know buy something like that.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So I kind of want to make one my own but it's hard to finding a cheap and good wireless HDMI extender.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:07.000
They do exist but it's hard to find them and I was trying to peek in their video to see what what they were using because I can see it but they move the camera too fast so I couldn't read what it was.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
It looks cool though so that's on Kickstarter.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And then if you happen to like free games there's a free remake of Ultima 4 the Commodore 64 version that's on iOS.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And you can actually it has a little keyboard on it and everything and you can play the full game.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
It's near 100% replica of the game.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And I guess it's free to download Ultima 4 C64.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
So go check it out.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Downloading As We Speak.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Which is great because the Ultima game that they put out on iOS EA actually did one like a free to play game.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I didn't like it at all.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I couldn't get very far through it at all I just really didn't like it.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Looks neat.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yeah I've seen a C64 emulators on iPhone already.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I don't know if it still exists.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I think so because I think it uses a lot of free to play games and things that they have the rights to.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But you know who am I to say no to a Commodore 64 experience in my pocket.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yes.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Speaking of in your pocket there's a rumor going around that Infamous will be coming to the Vita.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Which you know shouldn't be a big surprise.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Infamous is huge for Sony.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
We know that Second Son is going on right now.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But this is because of a recent Q&A that happened.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Where there was a Dual Shockers interview with the folks behind Infamous Second Son.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It was the director Nate Fox specifically that I guess got asked some question.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But kind of gave a misinterpreted answer.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But he said quote right now we're only talking about the PS4 game.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I would love to talk to you about any Vita related titles when or if the time comes.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
That still seems a little bit non-committal to me.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
But the reality is Infamous is a huge franchise for Sony.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I'm kind of thinking of course there's going to be something for the Vita.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Of course.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Even if it's not necessarily the same studio.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I mean that's what they did with Uncharted right?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I think that they'll have an Infamous game.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And I can see it coming out around the same time as Second Son too.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Just because it would be a good tie in.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
You could like have like you take your PlayStation 4 character to you know that game or vice versa.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I would also think they would try to do like the remote play or something.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
They would try to tie that feature in as well.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Did you hear the Final Fantasy XIV is supposed to be getting something like that on PlayStation 4.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Not to do too tangity but this sounded really awesome.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
That they're talking about doing a remote play for the PlayStation 4 version.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
It would be limited but it would allow you to do things like crafting and stuff.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It's pretty cool.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I don't see why you couldn't play the game.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I mean aside from being able to text chat and stuff.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I think it's just a resource.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Yeah the text chat and some of the other stuff is a resource hog so.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Just don't text chat. I never text chatted.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Well I liked having the ability to chat from my phone and wow.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
True.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Doing stuff like that.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
You still can yeah.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Well yeah but even though I don't have a subscription anymore.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
But I mean I think that having more remote options for doing other stuff in the game.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Especially you know for things that you're trying to kill time with.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I think that's actually pretty good.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Very interesting rumors coming out of Microsoft with the whole you know their DRM features.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
That originally rolled out and then they were just kidding.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
You guys are really mad so we're not going to do that.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Well according to Xbox director Albert Piniello.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
This ability to trade and loan digital games.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Which is going to be a part of this whole DRM restriction.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
It could return at some point.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I'm not talking about the 24 hour check ins and all this.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Here's the quote in an interview from GameSpot.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Quote we were trying to implement the ability to trade and loan digital games with your friends.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Which is something that no one else was doing.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I believe in retrospect that people have calmed down and gone back and actually looked at what we said.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
People are starting to understand wow they did want to actually allow me to loan and trade.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Which other digital ecosystems don't want to do.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And so yeah I think we need to do that.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I get a lot of mails saying God please bring back the family sharing.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
We'd love to figure out how to bring that back.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I still think it was a good idea.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
So kind of clinging to that idea that maybe something could come back.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
But I'm assuming that would not include the 24 hour check ins.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Although as I was saying plenty of times before when this whole mess happened in the first place.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Why not just have a separate digital license does this stuff and the disc license does this stuff.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Done!

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Because that would make sense.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So silly.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Peter Molyneux has his new game coming called Godus.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Not to be confused with the show at the Stardust in a famous movie.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
But that's G-O-D-U-S. Godus is the game.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Maybe it's Godus.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Godus. Oh I like that. Godus.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Godus he was talking about the royalties because the guy who opened the box.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
The curiosity box gets some royalties from the game.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
But it's not going to be much.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
It's between 1 and 5 percent.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
They don't say exactly what it is.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But Godus will have offline play available.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And in his ever so eloquent style Peter Molyneux speaking with RPS Rock Paper Shotgun.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Mentioned that if he did come out and say that the game would always be online quote.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
This red dot would appear on my forehead and I'd be sniped to death.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000
He does say though that playing online will allow for these other charming moments.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Such as syncing with a villagers social feed.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Isn't that what happens in Tiny Tower?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Kind of sounds like that.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
He said quote my wife tweets and it comes up in the world.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It's a stupid feature. It's just a piece of text.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
But you end up caring for your little people because they love you so much.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Godus will be out on Steam September 13th.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And there will be an iPad version at the end of October and Android version soon after that.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And you can smoke some of the crack that Peter Molyneux is smoking himself.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
No in all reality I do kind of want to check it out because I did like black and white.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I liked Populous from back in the day.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So I feel like I should check it out.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
As soon as that kind of game would be up your alley.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah it is.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Especially when I liked Civ so much in the original Sim City.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I mean I do feel like I need to check it out.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Godus.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Godus.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Dark Saga.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Well we have some Assassin's Creed news.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:18.000
They basically have for the Vita Assassin's Creed 3 liberation is supposed to be re-released on other systems.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
They're looking like PC, PSN and Xbox Live launches.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Probably likely.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And also on the list was Assassin's Creed Pirates.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Excuse me.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And then Ubisoft was also going to have another tie in for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So that's for Assassin's Creed fans.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Good news.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Also EA has six to eight new IPs going on.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
They are going to definitely do more sequels for The Sims.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I was watching some of the stuff on Sims 4 stuff.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
As long as they fixed that memory issue I might be down for that because I liked some Sims.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Need for Speed, Battlefield, FIFA.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Titanfall was the only new name.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
But they were also indicating that there's new Star Wars and Mirror's Edge 2.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:14.000
They are basically working on trying to take the IPs that people like and give them new life.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Still nothing on another Mass Effect.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Well, but the team behind the original Mass Effect is doing one of those new IPs. Don't forget.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I know. That means it won't suck.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Maybe. Depends on the writing.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Anyway, and also for fans of Monster Hunter 4, in the direct that came out there are going to be outfits available in the game for Mario, Link and Luigi.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So if you like running around looking like other Nintendo characters you can do it in the new Monster Hunter.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And they actually said that it appeared in the video that they showed that the Mario and Luigi outfits were for the Mario and Luigi Dream Team outfits.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:11.000
They have hammers and that the Link outfit has the Master Sword and the bow from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Also, you can download the Mario and Luigi costumes at 7-Elevens in Japan, but 7-Elevens in America are not cool enough to do it.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
The end.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Well, are we even getting Monster Hunter 4 here? I don't think so.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Not yet.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Not yet? Be a little while?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Probably next year.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
How did the Wii U Monster Hunter sell? Didn't it do alright?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Not good, I don't think.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
That's too bad.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I don't think any Wii U titles sold well already, I mean.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
But, yeah, probably not good.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Alright, we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week. I just want to address real quickly though, because some people in chat were asking if I'm okay.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Yeah, I'm recovering from Con Crud the sequel.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000
When I got back from Dragon Con I felt fine for a couple days, but probably around Thursday it really started to hit me.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Unlike the Con Crud I got at GamerX, this one didn't come with a fever.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
So I haven't had high temperatures, but definitely the coughing, the snifflies, and all that crap.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So if I'm sounding a little out of it tonight, that is why, so I apologize.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
That kind of stuff is really not a Radio Guy's best friend.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
But what can you do? Let's go to the Fugu question of the week.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together, you get Fugu.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And tonight's Fugu question of the week is about the Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter. Don't call it Mega Man.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
We talked about it earlier in the show, and here's the question we asked quite plainly.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Tell us if you back the Kickstarter, or plan to, or not, and why.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
We just kind of wanted to know where you guys' heads were at with this.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Redertainment responded on Google+, and said no, due to my pursuit of Project Buy a House.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Act Def said, I'm definitely backing this Kickstarter when I get the money.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I want to do $175 US dollars for the plushie tier.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And well, Inafune wants to give what Mega Man fans want, and I support that.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
And there's an all-star team behind it, so I do have high hopes for it.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
There's a yes and a no from Google+.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Let's go over to Fugu, excuse me, Facebook, part of Fugu.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I apologize for the Facebook noises, I really thought I turned those off.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Going to a comment from Rene, over from Cooper Club.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
He says, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I didn't find out about it until just after it met its Kickstarter goal.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But now I really want to.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
They still got the stretch goals, and for what, another 22 days, you can still basically pre-order the game.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Elliot B says, considering the talent involved, I reckon this particular Kickstarter is more likely to bear fruit than most.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000
That said, I never really got quite the appeal of Mega Man, so I guess I'll pass.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
That's kind of surprising.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Well, I mean, I shouldn't say it that way.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I mean, some people just don't like certain games that may be popular otherwise, but I find it interesting that he's like,

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
yeah, it's a bunch of talented people, but eh, not my type of game.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Mason D said, HD2D art, the track record of the people involved, it seemed like a no-brainer.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Bumble D said, I'm going to pre-order the digital copy of the game this weekend.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It reminded me how much time I killed playing Mega Man 1 through 6 back in the NES days.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I recently bought the Mega Man X collection just to re-sharpen my skills for when this comes out.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Burr replied on Facebook and said, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I knew it would succeed anyway.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I try to back things that need the push over the finish line.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
In this case, I can sit back and wait to see the reviews before taking the plunge.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I'm also a bit apprehensive about supporting something so similar to an existing IP

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and wish people would have given attention to a more original idea like Ravensdale.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
That's a very interesting perspective where he's kind of saying, or at least what I'm getting out of this is,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
these guys didn't need the money.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Interesting.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Critical Myth says, no, but I prefer to get opinions on the final product first.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
There have been plenty of great ideas that wound up having poor execution or unforeseen roadblocks.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Raginator says, nope, just because.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Daniel S. replied and said, I haven't heard of this until just now.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And then said, dude, this looks amaze balls.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
A little bit Mega Man and a little bit Meta Bots, I'm in.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Also, screw Capcom for not letting Inafune make Mega Man games.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Here's something to think about, though, just to kind of go off of that point a little bit.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Since you're really excited about how it looks, something to consider is,

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
if he had been able to make a new Mega Man game, would we have got this?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And could this be better?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Just something to think about.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Monty Boggs replied on Facebook and said, yes, he backed it,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
because I wanted to see the Mega Man games evolve

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and I want them to achieve the stretch goal and put it on consoles.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
This should also show Capcom that people want these games

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
and they've been dropping the ball, otherwise this Kickstarter wouldn't exist or succeed.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Ryan B. replied and said, no, he didn't back it, though I do want to, because I'm poor.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Hitstun replied and said, this could be the project that finally gets me to create a Kickstarter account.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I want the game to be good, but I'm on the fence about throwing money at it.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I typically don't buy a game until I see the finished product in motion.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So there's the answers from Facebook and Google Plus.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And I think you pretty much heard what we had to say about it earlier,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
but I thought we would see a lot more of, yes, I was throwing my money at it,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I was rubbing my credit card at the screen,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
but I found that there's a lot more of you out there that are kind of like,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
yeah, we'll wait and see when the finished game's out.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I'll wait for the reviews. I'll check it out then.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
They don't need my money right now. I'll give it to them later.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So I was kind of surprised by that, but in a good way.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
So there you go, our FUGL question of the week.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
All right. So let's talk a little bit about disappointment.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And the disappointment I have that such an awesome concept as the Aluma Room is not going to happen.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And it kind of makes sense because I was like, wow, that looks really cool,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
but how the hell are they going to pull that off without it being incredibly expensive?

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Well, the problem is they never figured out a way to do that.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000
So it would cost thousands of dollars at implement because it does require a nice HD projector

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:28.000
and a really specific setup because who has an HD projector attached to the ceiling

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000
and an extra connect sensor attached to that and just not going to work.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So unfortunately, they said, you know, hey, it was a very it's it's very, very cool tech,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
but it's like for a consumer, it will requires a projector and things.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
It's really super neat if you're in the lab and you've got Microsoft money and you can set this up.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
But we looked at it for an average consumer. It's like thousands of dollars.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So unfortunately, it's not going to go beyond proof of concept.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I say right now, but I think later on, maybe when that technology comes down in price a lot,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
maybe like in three, four years, we might see something like that.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
That's kind of where my head's at, because all technology comes down in price eventually.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Yes. So it might be thousands of dollars now.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.000
But this is something maybe this is technology we're looking at for the Xbox two or whatever is.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
God, I can't believe we're here. We are already talking about the next Xbox.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000
The new one's not even out yet. But, you know, this could be something that happens with whatever Xbox.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Just pick a random number to be like Xbox fifty seven or something like that.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Xbox thirty seven. You'll buy them all in a row.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They stack up in a row to create a giant Voltron.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000
All right. Well, for those of you that are upgrading to a new Xbox, maybe you'll be happy about these programs.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And we touched on this a little bit in the last show,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
but now some more details coming out about who is going to allow you to upgrade to your Xbox one games.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Cheap Best Buy is one of them.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Best Buy is going to be rolling out a program that will offer ten dollar next gen upgrades.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
GameStop and Amazon already had these programs in place.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Eligible games include FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Call of Duty, Ghost, Battlefield 4 and Watch Dogs.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
This is interesting, though, what you have to do.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
If you purchase one of the games within a set period after its release,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
you'll be given a ten dollar coupon to put towards the Xbox one incarnation.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:28.000
When you want to upgrade, you do the coupon and the game and then Best Buy gives you forty dollar credit,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
reducing the final cost of the Xbox one game to ten dollars.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So it's this whole...

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
It seems weird.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
It is a little bit weird, but it's like you get the coupon and then you get the value of the trade game and then you...

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So if you don't use the coupon, then you get ten dollars off another game later on? Is that how that works?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I suppose you could do it that way. I don't know.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
That just seems confusing.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Well, but then it says towards the game's Xbox one incarnation. I don't know, whatever.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
What if I'm upgrading from say, like, uh...

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
How many people is this really going to affect?

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I mean, if it's only for a certain period of time, either you're buying the one this year or you're not.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:15.000
What if I wanted to upgrade from say, like, you know, I don't know, Disney Planes to like, say, Rise.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Is that an upgrade that I can do?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I don't think you can do that, Loki. I'm sorry to say.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
What about like, you know, I don't know, Ben 10 Galactic Racing to Forza 5?

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Because that's technically an upgrade. It's still driving.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Alright, look, I just wanted to add that the Microsoft store is doing this deal as well.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They will also be doing Xbox One games for $10 when you trade in 360 copies.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:47.000
The titles include NFL Madden 25, Battlefield 4 Need for Speed Rivals, Call of Duty Ghosts, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
All you have to do for this one, you bring the game to a Microsoft store and you get the Xbox One copy for $10.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Just throwing it out there, Watch Dogs not apparently on the list for the Microsoft store.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So if you're going to be participating in these programs for whatever reason, you better look at what games what stores are taking.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So, but now you have, what, three, four options? GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft Store.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I have one word for the whole thing.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
What?

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Blah!

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Well, yeah, my whole thing is like, either you're getting the one this year or you're not.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
If this program continues into next year, alright, well then I get it.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Yeah, but if it's such that, such a small window, just maybe, I don't know, here's a thought.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Wait a little bit.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Like, for example, like, if Grand Theft Auto 5, well, okay, no, that's a bad example because I wouldn't be able to wait for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
But let's just say like Saints Row 4 was coming out on the PlayStation 4 or something.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
It'd be like a really super awesome upgraded version or something.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I probably wouldn't have bought the game, you know, on PlayStation, well, I definitely didn't buy it on PlayStation 3.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So why would I, you know, buy one version of the game?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Or, I mean, it's even worse when they're talking about, like, Assassin's Creed that's literally coming out a month before.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Just wait and just pay, you know, pay the same amount of money that you would have bought, you know, the current gen version for.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Alright, let's move on with some new game news, right, DarkSakura?

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yes, we do have some new game news.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:23.000
A, DungeonMuster just said, actually in chat, that ShameStop dropped the price for Xenoblade down to 65 bucks.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
What a deal!

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
$65, that's still...

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Could that, you're telling me nobody was buying it for 90 because they were just all downloading it from the internet?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I mean, just saying.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
There's a new battle arena game online and it's King of Fighters.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Hmm.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Very weird.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's actually in a closed beta in Thailand and I hate Destructoid, sorry, on my tablet, I hate it on my tablet.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I like this site, I hate it on my tablet.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Fix your tablet version, seriously.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And yeah, it's a MOBA.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
They've done some weird stuff with, you know, King of Fighters.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Remember that they had a SHMUP game that was with King of Fighters?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Yes, that was awesome though.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
It's weird though, I mean...

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Well, so far the characters that are revealed have been Kyo, Iori, Joe, Griffin, and Terry.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
So, and it's being developed by Dragonfly.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:26.000
It's kind of cute in a way because, you know, you look at a game like League of Legends, it's all about the heroes, and you have to select one of the heroes, right?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Or the stupid Marvel game.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
A fighting game lends itself very well to that.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Yeah.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Well, the Marvel game's more like a Diablo dungeon crawler than it is a MOBA.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's not all that fun.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
MOBA's a very kind of growing genre of games though.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:48.000
You know, you have League of Legends, then you have DOTA is the other big one, and now you've seen some more pop up, like the heroes in New Earth is one.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
You know, there's more and more, so...

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Because League of Legends does very well.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Lots and lots of people play in that game or have played it at some point, so...

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Yeah, as long as they've changed their passwords now.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Remember, they were going after old data, so the password could be used other places.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
That is very true, be careful.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:10.000
So, wow, I wish I could try this out at least, but just have to wait for it to float its way over here from Thailand.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Oh well.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Through the inner tubes, through unofficial translation patches.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
The same way the rest of us played Ragnarok back in the day.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Who would be your hero in a King of Fighter MOBA?

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It'd be Leona.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
That's who I play every time I play the damn game.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Mine would have to be Kim Kap Wan, because that's who I loved in the game, or of course Mai.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Yeah, what is your dream team?

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
That was always my team.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Of three?

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Yeah.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And a striker.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Kim Kap Wan, Mai, and Joe Higashi.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Who would be your striker?

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I forget, who are the strikers?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
You can pick any character as a striker, because you're a call-in person.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I'm thinking...

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I don't know, come back, I always think about, I always go back to CVS.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Answer hazy, try again later.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
I always go back to CVS and think about that.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Shit, I don't know, Andy Bogard.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I liked Andy.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
My team was always Leona, Mai, and Athena.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Of course, a girl power team.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Or Yuri, with one of them being a striker.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
So I would go between, because Yuri had the fine butt attack.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Was King in King of Fighters?

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Yes, King was in King of Fighters.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
That would be my striker, I liked King.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
King was awesome.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Alright.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
What about you, Loki?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I never played the game.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
See?

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
What?

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
It was free on PlayStation Plus, one of the newer ones.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Yeah, so I checked it out a while back.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Anyway.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Alright, so I've got some Kickstarter information.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
It's kind of a combination of Kickstarter and Ouya.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
So Ouya's got this, I don't know what you'd call it, campaign that they're doing right now,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
called the Free the Games campaign.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Basically, they're offering a million dollars, or they have this million dollar fund,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:15.000
that they are matching Kickstarter, or Kickstarted games for the Ouya.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
They're matching them up to, I think, $50,000.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Might be more than that.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.000
But basically, the stipulations are that the game has to be exclusively for the Ouya.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
It has to have a minimum goal of $50,000.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And I think that, I want to say that $50,000 might have been the, I think it actually goes up from there.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I think $50,000 is not the cap on that.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
But anyway, so they're going to match funding.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Well, two games so far have reached their funding targets.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.000
This game called Gridiron Thunder and Elementary My Dear Homes.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Well, there's a little bit of a problem with that.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.000
The two games, as a lot of people were kind of looking at, had some fishy information regarding them.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:14.000
For example, Gridiron Thunder, which is a football game, had several backers.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:25.000
They had basically less backers than were on, like for example, less backers than there were, the money funded.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:33.000
So it would have basically averaged out to about $626 per backer, would have been the average price.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So there was backers on there that were pledging tens of thousands of dollars at a time.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:47.000
And you could see it, even if you look at Kick Track, you can see these spike days that they like earned $40,000 or something on it.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
And that was a little fishy, being that, you know, basically the thought is,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
okay, so there's a guy who creates a Kickstarter, you know, has people back it or whatever.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Who matches that and then they take the money and run, kind of thing.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Well, it's even gone further. Elementary My Dear Homes had a bunch of fake, or I should say,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:17.000
made up people that were one time backers that were backing this project, including made up characters, celebrities,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.000
a person that's been kidnapped, and just all sorts of weird stuff.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Is that interference from people related to the game, or is that like a 4chan prank?

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I think it's people that are related to the game that are backing their own projects so that they put basically,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:46.000
okay, the project's $50,000, I put in $50,000 of my own money, I get 10% of that taken out or whatever from Kickstarter and Amazon.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
And I get another $50,000 from Ouya.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh, this is one of those, I gotta make sure I meet my goals. Well, then go Indiegogo.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Well, here's the thing though, it's not that, it's they're getting money matched from Ouya.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And what they're gonna do basically is they're getting free money and then they're going to either create a really shoddy game,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
you know, or they're just gonna take the money and leave, you know, type thing.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So, however, the Elementary My Dear Homes has been suspended.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:26.000
It hit its funding goal of $50,000 and it was currently at $58,770 and it's been suspended because of suspicious accounts.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
So yeah, so it sounds like, you know, they were trying to scam it.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
And there's a lot of conspiracy theories about it.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
They're saying, well, it's, I'm not so sure about the Elementary My Dear Homes one,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:47.000
but the other one that Ouya is actually kicking money in there because they want to make it look like these games are being successful and stuff.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:55.000
And I don't know, it's weird, but yeah, Kickstarter, there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on there.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
You don't say.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Yeah, and speaking of-

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
When there's a way to make money on the internet, shady things happen, get out.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Yeah, I know. Speaking of which, remember how I talked about, it was months ago, about that nine-year-old-

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I have to say this real quick.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
sj100mattinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000
heaven help us if the Nigerian internet scammers make it to Kickstarter unless they're already there.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Well, speaking of internet scams.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Yes, speaking of scams, there was, remember that nine-year-old, there was a Kickstarter,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
it was that nine-year-old wants to make her first RPG because her brother said that she can't do this and this whole STEM thing.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I went into detail about it, about how she didn't really need the money because her mom's like a millionaire,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
and that's beside the point, but she said originally it was to go to this RPG camp,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
and then the camp was canceled, so she was going to MIT or something.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Oh, now the money's for a laptop.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Oh, well, then she got a laptop gifted to her from Alienware and Dell.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Oh, well, now the money's for something, and it was an RPG Maker game.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Well, guess what? The date that that game was supposed to be released came and gone,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and no real updates, and they've kind of all disappeared.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
So, once again, people called it a scam.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000
They got called out, the creators called them trolls.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
All the internet people that ran it, Kotaku and some other ones,

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000
defended the Kickstarter people and said, oh, yeah, all those people that are ganging up against that nine-year-old,

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000
they're just trolling them and stuff like that.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Well, are they out here now to say that, well, maybe they were right because they didn't come up with anything.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000
No, because it failing isn't newsworthy.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
No, it didn't fail. They succeeded.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I mean, sorry, it failing to produce isn't newsworthy.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Yes, so basically she got $28,000 for doing nothing.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So, yeah.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Wow. Well, hope it pays for college and not for, you know, trips to Headey.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I want someone to pay for my college.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Yeah, really.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I want someone to pay for me to get additional classes in my profession. That would be nice.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
All right, let's move on with another story.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Well, somebody's going to be getting a lot of money, and that's, I wouldn't mind having $15 million in damages,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
and that is a lawsuit with Microsoft versus Motorola Mobility.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
This is a long-running lawsuit surrounding patent infringement.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Jury ruled in favor of Microsoft.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Microsoft gets $15 million because the Xbox 360 console, it was ruled last year,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
it infringed on four of Motorola's patents surrounding video decoding, Wi-Fi technology.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000
But earlier this year, that decision was overturned, and the same judge cleared Microsoft of the infringement.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Now, a district court jury decided that it was Motorola that breached its agreements with Microsoft.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Because Motorola was not providing the patent licenses for fair and reasonable terms, this is why Microsoft got the damages.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I can't imagine that this is going to be over by any stretch of the imagination.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Is this shit going to go to the Supreme Court? Is that what's going to happen?

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I'm really surprised the two didn't settle.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
That's what always happens in this shit. There's always a settlement.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Yeah, I went to jury, and the jury awarded it to Microsoft, saying that, nope, it's Motorola's fault because they weren't allowing Microsoft to have it reasonably.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I'm sure this is not the last of it.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:22.000
No, probably not. I think, in some cases, trying to push things through to an actual jury trial is a way to set a precedent.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Yeah.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Alright. Well, we're going to allow you to set some precedents on our show right now with the emails that you send us.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Every week you guys send us mailbags, or not, to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Bags of mails? Ooh.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
So Dark Soccer's going to jump in the mailbag and see the flood of email awaiting us tonight.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
More like the drippy one.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
In the two weeks we were off...

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Yeah, we got one email.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And I'm saying drippy not because of the person, but because it's like, drip, drip, drip.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
You open the bag to dump it out and one little email came floating down.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Hi everyone at OLR.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Hi.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Rob.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
What? The listeners say hi, I gotta say hi back.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Do you paraphrase Final Fantasy VII since you love it so much?

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Sit your ass down in that chair and eat your goddamn Ricola.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Hearts, hearts.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I actually came with like a bucket of Ricolas and...

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm actually very thankful.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
It's your favorite person in the whole world.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
He did a face.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Raginator.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
As you probably remember, Sony officially retired the PS2 earlier this year after a 12 year...

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Well, he said ear run, but I think he means ear.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.000
I think it's safe to say that in terms of the last gen systems, the PS2 was the leading favorite and most people had it.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Either as a primary console or a secondary, or even just as a DVD player that just so happened to play games.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
All that being said, I'd like to pose a question to the three of you and to the chat room as well.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Those of you who had a PS2, do you have any fond memories revolving around the PS2 and if so, what were they?

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Getting my JPS2 and playing the hell out of Beatmania 2DX?

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000
You stole my damn answer. I would say getting the Japanese PlayStation 2, which I owned before a US PlayStation 2, and playing the shit out of Beatmania 2DX.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Bam.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Fist bump.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Yep.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Loki, PlayStation 2 memories?

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Uh...

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I'm my HD loader in the...

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Actually, I'd say... when was the first thing I got on PlayStation 2?

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Well, I got Armored Core was one of the first games in there.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I'd say probably like, uh...

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Grand Theft Auto... well, that was PlayStation 1.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
No, no, that was PlayStation 2. Grand Theft Auto 3?

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Yeah, Vice City and all that was PlayStation 2.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yeah.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Goddammit.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Don't die.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Also, playing music games online with DDR and Amplitude was good times.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
You know what I did like?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Not having to do the button trick every time I wanted to put in that pen CD for Beatmania.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
So it was actually a way to play my old 5-key Beatmania stuff.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I also just had... well, you know how many import PlayStation 1 games I had.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
It was nice not having to rely on a separate device.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:16.000
We'd just have to change the plugs and bam, there it was, you know.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
But, um...

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Yeah, I really... I really have to say I had a lot...

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Even though I still laugh my ass off to this day with the Dreamcast vs. PS2 video that was online.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
What a disappointment video.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
You remember that one?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
I do. You've done it as a cookie here on the shelves before, yeah.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
That was great.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
So, um... moving on.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Now, as a secondary closing topic, I'd like to get some information from you three if possible.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Well, that's what we do a show for.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
We charge.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
By the hour.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I've been mulling over some notion of starting my own business,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:55.000
specifically an arcade that primarily focuses on games spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s,

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
with a few music games like DDR thrown in for good measure for a good 10 years now.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.000
The main hurdle is that I know virtually nothing about the subject of starting up and running a business.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I know that there are some basics, like having to lease retail space, pay for utilities,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
needing to incorporate the business, possibly filing for either loans and or grants,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:18.000
buying necessities for the business in case of PC for business purposes, and of course the arcade games.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
But that's the extent of what I know.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
That being said, what advice can you give regarding this?

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:28.000
And yes, I know that arcades are pretty much dead, but I'm confident that I can make this work.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Any info that you have would be provided would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.000
This email is brought to you by Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo. Hey!

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000
I will give some very blunt, frank advice with the whole business.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I've never started a business, so I honestly couldn't tell you like some insider secret.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
We've run one. Dan and I have.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Well, this is my advice. Maybe you will agree or you won't agree.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
My advice is you need to take a class or read a book on starting your own business,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
and if you don't have the time to do that or the money to do that, then you don't have the time or the money to start your own business.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Exactly. That being said, Dan went into business with the lady that used to be one of the owners of video game swappers locally here.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000
And so in that case, there was already the space. There was already the inventory.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
We put up a lot of our own games, too. All of our Dragon Ball Z figures, my old manga.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
We sold a lot of our own stuff.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:25.000
The big thing is that if you've got the space and the stuff in that you need to get the business license,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
and before you need the business license, you need to look up what the local laws are.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
You need to make sure that you don't have to have just a county business license.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
You may have to have a city license.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
For me as a massage therapist, I had to have a county and city license.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
In some cases, you need a state license.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
So like I said, I've been on multiple sides of this.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I agree with Rob. You should really take a business class.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
In some cases, a lot of it is fairly common sense.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000
You can figure it out if you've got that kind of logical mind,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.000
but you really do need to know the legalities of it before you remotely put down any money,

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
before you remotely look for any sponsors.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
We're still trying to start VOG as a legitimate business

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
so we can do some of these things like sell t-shirts

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
and some of the other things you guys have been asking for,

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
and it's not easy to make sure we do it right.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Especially in our case, we're looking at a multinational type of thing.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
There's a lot of stuff that goes into it,

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.000
but you're going to have to have your fictitious name for your business.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
It's the name that goes on your business license, and then it is registered to you.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
From that point on, any of your accounts are going to be registered in that fictitious name,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
being your bank account, being any savings associated with it, paying your taxes.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.000
You're going to need an accountant, that's for damn sure.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's a lot of money that goes into running a business, and I don't suggest doing it by yourself.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Yeah, that's great advice too. Find a business partner.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Just be careful with that idea. A lot of people lose a lot of money on that.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Arcades are dying, and you're not going to save them alone.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000
But if you have a good idea, you never know what might happen.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000
What's going to be the thing that draws people to your arcade when they can play games at home?

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Is that going to be that you do kick-ass birthday parties?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Do you sell booze?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
That's what Dave & Buster's is doing.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Well, that's what a lot of these retro arcades do.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Well, the other thing to also, and this just occurred to me too, is that especially in regards to...

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
God, I forgot what I was going to say.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Because I know it's a big thing too, is you need to make sure that not only do you check with the legality behind it,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000
you also check with not just the legality behind getting the license,

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000
but the legalities around how you handle your money with the place.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Keep in mind that any, I think the rule of thumb is that any business is expected to lose money in its first five years before it turns a profit.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Also check with your local, you know, wherever you have to register through.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
There are first-time business startup plans that can help you with this.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:06.000
A lot of places have a complete checklist on their, you know, be it county, be it city website, that's going to show you what to do.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:13.000
So you've got the information out there, but I think you've done a lot of research clearly.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I think the best thing for you to do is look at everything that you need, make yourself an outline, and make yourself a timeline.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And make sure that you have, that if there's any cost associated with whatever is coming up on your timeline,

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
that you have that money by then, and that you've got some extra.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Now fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there's a novel idea, arcade and strippers.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Now that's something that hasn't been done, that could have, but then again, a whole other set of laws that come when you have titties out in the open.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I will tell you this, you know, it's incredibly stupid.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
What?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Is that in San Francisco, if I was going to be a massage therapist there, I would actually have to have an adult entertainment license.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
To do massage.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
So you could do topless massage?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:04.000
No. They treat, this is so stupid, they treat the massage, the massage and holistic health industry as adult entertainment.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So fucking stupid.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.000
It's not like there's any shortage of adult entertainment in San Francisco.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
It's the whole happy ending thing that's ruined it for all of us.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.000
They talked about that day one in massage school. I can't do it anymore because of my hand.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Aww, happy ending?

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
No!

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
You're so mean. Alright, is that it for the email?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I like the video where the happy ending is just parties and clapping.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Yes, me too.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
That was funny.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give Jamie some work for a future week.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000
In the meantime though, it's time for the FUs of the Week.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Why? I don't know.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I have a big FU to the person who was driving the not so fresh El Camino in the rain the other day on my street, zipped around the corner and nearly ran into Dan's car.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:15.000
So yeah, don't speed on the damn road when it's raining. Don't speed through a neighborhood.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
You are the lowest of low. There's a special place in hell for you if I believed in hell.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000
And you know what? I might just believe in hell for the vague reason that you might go there.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
You're gonna make an exception.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I'll make an exception.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Uh, FU to having to coordinate shipping Grand Theft Auto V.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:45.000
As much as I can't wait to play the game, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare. It's like Call of Duty two times this year instead of once.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:56.000
My FU of the Week goes to being sick again from a convention. It's not like I don't wash my hands and drink vitamin C and all the things you're supposed to do.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
It's all the other people that don't.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Yeah, it's all the other people. That's what it is. Other people's fault. Never my fault.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Rob. What?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:09.000
You do know the theory goes that doing all of those extra preventative measures might actually weaken your immune system to fighting off colds?

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Weren't you the one telling me to take zinc when I went?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I was telling you to take zinc, but regardless of that, you know, people rely on that stuff too much instead of making themselves stronger.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I just wouldn't say an FU to being sick. It's awfully inconvenient.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Instead of washing your hands when you get done at the con, you just lick them clean. And then you'll feel much better later on.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
You're such an asshole.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I'm serious. This is really draining me. I'm really having to push to finish the show tonight.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Thank God we only have two more stories and then we get into Twitter topics and calls and then we're done.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Don't get me wrong. I love doing this show and I love all you guys that turn out to listen.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I should have brought you some soup, Rob. I'm sorry.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Oh no. Why would you apologize for not buying me something?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Because I do nice stuff for people and I feel bad when it occurs to me after the fact.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000
You know what I'm going to do right now? I'm going to go fix myself an emergency while Loki does this next story.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Okay.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.000
So that oft rumor that, hey, there's going to be another TimeSplitters game is finally true.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.000
There is going to be another TimeSplitters game. It's not going to be new necessarily. It's TimeSplitters Rewind.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's basically a, I guess they're saying the ragtag team of fans constructing the game.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And they're going to start on developing a PlayStation 4 version of the game.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And they said, you know, we actually are going to go ahead and start development of TimeSplitters Rewind on PlayStation 4.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
We're pretty confident Crytek's going to say go ahead and do it.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:45.000
But we don't want them saying go ahead and do it when we're caught with our pants down.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Like we're halfway through development.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:54.000
So Crytek, I guess they've approved the PC version of the game.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000
And I guess that's going through some testing right now as well.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.000
But not really approved, I guess, the PlayStation 4 version yet.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
But hey, I don't care. PC version's good enough for me.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Kids like PCs.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Exactly. So, I don't know.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:21.000
You know, TimeSplitters kind of HD, I guess, with all the crazy stuff in there.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I could dig that.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Oh, thank you. DarkSakura's giving me more Ricola.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
I'm saving away from my ride home.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
You're taking pity on me.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Trust me, I buy huge, massive bags of Ricolas.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I would feel guilty if I got one of you guys sick, though.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
But I've got to be past that point. I never really had a fever.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.000
But anyhow, Final Fantasy VI.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I know we talked earlier about Final Fantasy VII being the anniversary.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Oh, actually, sorry. We did that during the music break, so the podcasters didn't hear that.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000
But Final Fantasy VII is 17 years old as of yesterday, right?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.000
But one game that's still near and dear to people's hearts is Final Fantasy VI.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000
And what's interesting is that there's a fan-made Final Fantasy VI movie being made.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
It's called Final Fantasy Terra.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.000
And it's being made, you know, for an amateur film, it's pretty well-made, you know?

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
It's amazing what people can do with their phones and HD cameras.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I don't think anyone needs filming that with their phones.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
You know what I mean, though? But I'm just saying in general, you have HD cameras on your phone,

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.000
you know, just spend another thousand or two dollars and you get these fancy cameras that are capable of a lot.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
So anyway, the group that's producing it is Bad Pixel, and there's actually a trailer that's out there that you can see.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:42.000
They are actually pitching the idea to Square Enix to try to get permission to proceed with development.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:47.000
If that is successful, they're going to turn to Kickstarter to raise the funds to actually make the film.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:53.000
There's a whole part about Square Enix screenlining it, though. I don't think that's going to happen in a million years. Sorry.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Well, at least they're going the correct route instead of let's go ahead and do it on Kickstarter and wait for it to get shut down.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Right.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Rather than, you know, let's ask permission first and then...

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Right. So, yeah, at least they're going about it that way.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:15.000
But, yeah, I just, you know, when they shut down that Chrono Trigger remake project and, you know, they're very protective of their IPs.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I just kind of don't see this happening. You know, they want to do...they have, what, Advent Children.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
They have the spirits within. They kind of want to make their movies animated, and I don't know, they just...

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Final Fantasy VI is a pretty precious franchise, and I think it's still due for a remake at some point, isn't it?

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Because V got its remake on iOS. Shouldn't VI get something? Maybe they're saving it for something big. Who knows?

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:49.000
But, good luck to these guys. I'm not saying I don't want to see it happen, but I just...I don't know.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I just kind of think Square Enix isn't going to give it permission, but props to you guys for creating the impressive trailer that you did.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:04.000
That is our last story for tonight, so that's the point where we're going to open up our Skype line and see if we get any calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:17.000
We do still have the 800 number as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course, again, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:24.000
So that is open now for your calls. If you want to talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or possibly a different topic, we will get to that.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000
In the meantime, last minute stories. I don't know if we have anything, Loki?

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Nah, I don't have anything.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Really?

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
At least not yet.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I think we covered a lot of stuff during the show.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Yeah, there's just not a whole ton of new stuff right now.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Especially no stories about Grand Theft Auto 5 leaking out there on the internet, unfortunately.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Oh, has it leaked?

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
No, I said it has not. Unfortunately it has not, yeah.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Alright, well I do have a few, oh, we have a call coming in, so let's go to it.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
This is Ron Moon. We're going to make sure the Skype line does not crap out on anybody tonight.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Let's hope.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Hang up after a few seconds.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I know, you gotta last 20 seconds to beat your call into Bobby's show. What's up?

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Not much. I have my stopwatch ready, but Rob, as someone who's been going to cons for about 15 years,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I'm going to give you a basic homemade remedy that should fix things up for you.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Okay.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Black tea, two shots of honey, a bit of lemon, a little shot of vodka, half a shot, and two tablespoons of tussin. You'll be fine.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Ugh, tussin, ugh.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Actually, just raw honey is really, really good for all that. Raw honey.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I've been trying to drink tea, so yeah, no, I don't, man, it's just weird that it's happening after every convention that I go to, so I just, yeah, irritating.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Well, the more conventions you go to, your comp plague immunity builds up, so.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Yeah, I guess that's true. Well, congrats, you made it a full minute, so apparently it was your connection with Bobby

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
that was not appreciated by Skype. What else is on your mind, buddy?

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I want to go back to about two weeks ago when I called you out by accident about DuckTales.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Yeah.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Okay. I mean, I understand your issues with the game, with the sound and the cutscenes and so forth.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I mean, personally, I guess because I bought it for, I got it for PS3, I didn't have any issues with the sound, the voices, but with the cinematic sequences,

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I really enjoyed it. It felt like as if I was just watching, like, a five-part miniseries just as I'm going through every stage.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Yeah, I mean, I didn't, I think at the end of the day, I did recommend the game. I just kind of thought, like, there wasn't enough action before those sequences would consistently break things up.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.000
That was one thing that kind of irritated me, and I guess in some regards, that is true, the NES version had some of that too,

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:58.000
but I don't know, it just felt like the action kept being interrupted on the newer one. That was just what really bugged me.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I guess, but I do remember from the original NES game, there were maybe about two or three cutscenes.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:10.000
All the cutscenes just turned into, like, a brand-new movie or something, and as I'm playing through the game, I'm like,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I remember this area, that area, I know what's over there, this, this, this, this, and that,

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
and I noticed, like, the extra perks that they threw in and stuff like that make the game awesome.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Sound production issues aside, it is a great love letter to the cartoon that many people grew up on,

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:35.000
so I can see why people that really loved DuckTales growing up, which, by the way, was a cartoon I didn't watch as much of as some of my peers,

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I can see why you've got to play this game at least once.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Yeah, my only issue is the fact that I had to go to Shame Stop to pick up the Collector's Edition.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Come to find out that certain target locations had it.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Oh.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Mm-hmm.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But at least you got the pin.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Yes, I did, and it's sitting on my shelf in the case.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Next time you go to a Disney park, you can wear it.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Damn right.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
There you go.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
All right, well, Rama, buddy, any other comments or questions for us tonight?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Quick funny thing, this was at my old job, and my supervisor was a big DuckTales fan,

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:15.000
and he would repeat this line from one of the episodes where Scrooge was losing his mind about a sea monster ate his ice cream.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I turned around and looked at him and was, that was not his, this is along the lines of,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
that was a sea monster, that was half his fortune.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
He looked at me crazy, I'm like, go to YouTube.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
He pulled up that episode, and that was the follow-up line to it, and he just gave me this look of how do you know that,

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000
and I'm like, I have this odd tendency for odd pop culture cartoons and references like that.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Come on, I'm sure they screen DuckTales at 3 a.m. at some anime conventions, you get high and watch some, come on.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:48.000
No, the only time you get high at anime conventions is somebody's doing Anime Hell Knight or something like that,

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000
and you just sit there and you just lose your effing mind, and you chant for blue screen over and over.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Oh my gosh.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Rob, there are stories. We will have to talk offline, but I have some stories for you.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I'm sure, and they can, the listeners can hear some of those stories on Anime Jam Session.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Yes, and we're getting ready for our very first 21-plus anime convention this weekend.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Ooh, that sounds like it might be fun.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I have been told it's okay to walk around, um, bottomless, topless, alcohol without alcohol, because we have our own private beach.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Where the hell is this being held, Nevada?

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000
No, uh, Provincetown, Massachusetts.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Oh, yeah, alright, yeah, makes sense. P-Town.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
I get told that too.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Yeah, let me put it this way, I've never even been there, but I want to go.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I've heard a lot about it.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Alice, you join us next year.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:54.000
We'll see, oh my god, my con budget, I'm like, between PAX East, uh, the Gamer X2, E3 hopefully, and Dragon Con 2014, I'm busy, bro.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Dude, don't even get me started on PAX East. I am ready with, my staff knows as soon as they hear about the hotels, you call, text, tweet, whatever, so I can jump to a computer and shank somebody for two rooms at the Westin.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Well, I'm praying that at least one of the VoG guys is able to get a room, and I can piggyback on that, because I'm pretty sure Travis and Bobby and Brad will all be hammering the phones the day those open up, so.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Remember, I'm also Team VoG, I got you, remember.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Alright.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I get the rooms, it comes to us first.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Oh, sorry, I was talking about Dragon Con, but yes, PAX East, PAX East, I will look you up, buddy.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Hell yeah, man.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Alright, I should let you go to get more calls, but take care, and everybody check out Anime Jam Session now, immediately following Electric Sisterhood, Tuesdays at VoG.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Alright, later.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Bye.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:47.000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
And give us a call.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
A couple tweets I'm getting here.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Let's see, some tweets from Tigerclaw tonight.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000
EA to close Battleforge next month.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Battleforge is one of EA's studios, and they are sadly going to be closed.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I'm trying to bring up the story to see what they made.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Oh, they were Play for Free.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Where are these guys?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
That's too bad.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I'm trying to see what games they made, but I don't see anything in the list here, but they are closing at the end of October.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Never good to hear about people losing their jobs, so our thoughts go out to them.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Tigerclaw sends us one more tweet about the Halo designer calling out Hideo Kojima over the sexy comments.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Oh god, did you hear about Kojima's sexy comments?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Because it was creating quite the stir.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:41.000
About Metal Gear Solid 5 and how Quiet needed to be more erotic so more people would cosplay her for Tokyo Game Show.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Really?

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Yeah, he kind of put his foot in his mouth with that comment.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Kojima clarified with Polygon later he meant to say sexy, not erotic.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Well, okay.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I just think it was bad word choice all around.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I started to give him the benefit of the doubt.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I was like, is it maybe one of those things that's lost in translation or something?

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Anyhow, in this article that Tigerclaw linked us, let's see, who is this?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:24.000
David Ellis, Halo designer, said, eccentricity is a cute cover word for objectification and sexism.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
We got another call coming in, let's go to it.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, it's still connecting there.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Boom, it's Jim Sally.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Hey Jim Sally!

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Jim Sally, you're sideways.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Yeah, you're sideways today.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000
That's okay, we will turn our...

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Oh, there you go.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Now you're...

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
He's in MTV camp.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Jim Sally's tech support with a smile.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
You have very nice teeth, Jim Sally.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I do, don't I? I brush every day, man.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:51.000
That's good, that's good.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.000
You should.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.000
You have that big gap right there, though.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
That's okay, Madonna gets away with it, so do you.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I look, yeah, exactly. I look just as cute as she does, I think.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
We're gonna start calling you the material boy.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Material boy, nice.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
So what's up, Jim Sally?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Well, actually, a little sidetrack for the last caller.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I've been to Providence town, man, many a time.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Oh, really?

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
My family, we're from Canada, but we vacationed in Cape Cod in this little town called Falmouth,

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
and we used to always go to Providence town to...

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
You know what, I'm gonna be honest with you, I had the cleanest beaches, nice places to walk.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And it's definitely a different place when you go there compared to the rest of America.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Yeah.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
You wanna hear a funny story that happened to me when I went there?

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Sure.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
You could tell me if you think this...

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Bobby doesn't think my stories are real, by the way, but this is real, Robert, I'm telling you.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I believe you.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I was about 12, 13, I was just starting to get into baseball, and I thought it was pretty cool,

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
and I thought I was gonna be the best back catcher ever.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.000
So we went to Providence, and I was buying a lot of Red Sox gear and stuff there, right, because Boston's close by.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000
And I went to this one place that was selling T-shirts, and they had Boston Red Sox, there they go.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000
And then they had novelty T-shirts, and there was one that I thought was back catching related, so I got it.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000
My mom let me buy it, she's portraiting, she doesn't know any better, and the T-shirt said,

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
You Pigeon, I'm Catching.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Oh, no.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.000
I was like, wow. I looked good in it, though, right? Like, it was tight on my arms and stuff.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Like, I had little 12-year-old pipes back then, too.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.000
So, yeah, I have a lot of pictures of me, like, 12 years old on that vacation wearing a T-shirt that says,

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
You Pigeon, I'm Catching.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Did you wear it to baseball practice when you got home?

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Because I'm sure all the other kids just ate you alive.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Dude, yeah, that's where I found out about what that shirt really meant.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Oh, my God.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Can you believe that, man?

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000
But you just wanted to be a catcher in baseball. In baseball. Literally in baseball.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Yeah, otherwise, Jim Salley throws with his cannon.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
That means that you should vacation there, man. I'm gonna take my daughter there next year.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I would love to visit there.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I have seriously entertained the idea, and I don't know when I'm gonna have the time or the money to do this,

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000
but I've really entertained the idea of just going out to the East Coast and flying in there into a cheap airport

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
and renting a car and just driving around the Northeast to all the places I wanted to go,

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.000
because I want to see people in New York City, although the idea of driving in New York City terrifies me.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I want to go to the Fun Spot Arcade that's out there. I'd love to go to P-Town.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
And there's just tons of stuff I'd love to do out there.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Speaking of arcades, we had someone talking a while ago about wanting to start throwing an arcade.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I believe it was in the email.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000
It was in the email.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.000
When I was 17, I managed an arcade in Kitchener for about three months.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
A little word of advice from me to that guy.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:49.000
You can get a lot of stuff on consignment where the guys that own the machines, just put them in your store.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
You don't have to pay anything for them, but you have to give them a cut.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
They get one quarter, you get another quarter, sort of a deal.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
You can build up a lot of inventory that way without having to shell out a lot of cash, right?

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Jim Salley, do you know who actually ran a very successful arcade on consignment like that?

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Disneyland.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Disneyland.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Really?

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Yeah, when they had the Electronica event that was going on with Tron.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.000
A lot of those machines that were in there were from local owners.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Yeah, it's a great way too, because those local owners don't have the facility to make any money.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000
So for them, it's free money if you want to take the machine for a while.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
That's right, especially at Disneyland of all places.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Hello, those machines got used heavily.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.000
And in fact, they finally did.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
It's like they read Disneyland fans' mind.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
They kind of did this mishmash of Flynn's Arcade and Wreck-It Ralph.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000
And they put it in the arcade that's right next to the exit at Space Mountain.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
So it kind of lives on a little bit.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
There's a lot of cool stuff in there.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.000
That's cool.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Yeah.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I'm walking around the house.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I'm looking for my dog.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
My dog ran outside.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I know, I love that we're getting the tour of Jim Salley's house.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So quickly, Jim Salley, what else on your mind tonight?

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I have a little delay in the podcast.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I listened to my first one and it was a little too macho.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I toned down the machoness.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:07.000
But I decided I'm going to start a new one called Jim Salley's Review Review.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Jim Salley's Review Review.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Jim Salley's Reviewing Your Review.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Are you going to sing the theme song?

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Yeah, I review other people's reviews.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
That's pretty much how they do it.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I'm going to review other people's reviews.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Oh my God, I love it.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Did you get that, Narsagra?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Jim Salley's Review Review.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000
He's going to review other people's reviews.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I love it.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
So it's sort of like a critique.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Yes, in a way.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
It's a critique of other people's critiques.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Because some people's critiques need critiquing.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.000
That's an amazing idea, Jim.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I look forward to hearing the first episode.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I'm so excited to hear that you are taking the podcasting idea to heart and really giving it a try.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I'm sure Bobby would like a quick review of my review of Saints Row IV.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
He's probably recommending giving it a try.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I'm going to give you a piece of advice.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Stay away from the articles written on VoG.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Don't review those.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Oh, well there's reviews that come in Robert.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Uh oh.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Alright, Jim Salley, before I let you go, any last thoughts?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
No, I just wanted to say hi to everybody today.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I really missed you guys last week.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
You should have called me.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I know.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
I'm sorry.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I was having so much fun at Dragon Con.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Jim Salley, I was so drunk.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Dude.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.000
I was so drunk.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Dude.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Brad from Pod Culture had me drink things I never thought I'd drink in my life.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
And it was marvelous.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Ewww.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Liquor?

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Oh my god.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Stop being ridiculous.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Did you take your man with you?

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
I can't remember his name though.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Alan?

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Did you take Alan with you?

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
No, Alan was not able to come because Alan, it's kind of expensive.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Alan hung out with me.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
He had to work.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Yeah, Alan and Dark Sakura hung out.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Alan hung out with me and he helped me with my Skyrim and my Dragon Age stuff.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Oh yeah, that's two other games I did play.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Skyrim and Dragon Age.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Yeah, they had a girls' night.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
More like an after.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And then I drank mimosas all night and played rock band.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
There you go.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
That's a party.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Alright, Jim Salley, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in one more call,

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
but thank you as always.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
You macho man.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
You catcher.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I'm gonna love you.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Alright, bye buddy.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I love you Jamie, you're still my number one.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000
You know you are.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.000
You know.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Touching you.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I'm making hearts but you can't see it.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Touching you.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Ah, he's gonna poke me in the eye.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Alright, bye Jim Salley, bye.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Oh my god.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I love it.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
O-L-R.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
O-L-R.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
O-L-R.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
O-L-R.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
O-L-R.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
O-L-R.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
O-L-R.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
O-L-R.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
O-L-R.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
O-L-R.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I feel like he just poked me in the eye.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I feel dirty.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
A little bit.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
A little bit.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
A little dirty.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.000
A little dirty.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I kinda like it.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Oh my.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Ah, going to Twitter.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I'm trying to see if there's other stuff here on the Twitter.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I do see a tweet from Bobby Blackwolf.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I'm trying to see if it's a troll.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Oh no, it's not.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000
This is legit.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
What he's sending us here from the website Road to VR.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Oculus Rift support confirmed coming to Slender The Arrival, which is the sequel to Slenderman,

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:16.000
the eight pages, which Shane got me to play that on Let's Play, and now Slender is spreading

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
throughout the World of Warcraft community.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Because Gemet and Syl started playing, it's like the new thing.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
You know how you watch a video or something like that on YouTube, and it could be just

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000
a random video of something, and they'll recommend other videos based on usually what you've

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000
watched.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I had one that was a, it was a Slender game with Teletubbies in it.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
It was weird.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I watched it though.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000
SSJ100Matt, again, one more plug for the phones to see if we get any calls.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:54.000
A tweet from SSJ100Matt tweeting us about that is apparently another arcade war documentary,

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
a la King of Kong, on its way out.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000
It's called Man vs. Snake, and it's about the game Nibbler.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
What?

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:08.000
And I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, is that the game that's like Snake on the,

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
you know, old school cellular phones?

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
And I guess Nibbler was like that.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I don't remember Nibbler in the arcades.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I remember they had Nibbles, which was on Basic.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.000
It was the first game that had a high score table that could handle one billion plus points.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.000
That's just ridiculous.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
One billion?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Yeah, a lot.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000
So Man vs. Snake is running a Kickstarter campaign, which, you know, isn't that what they're all doing?

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
To try and get funded.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
So it can be in a theater near you.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
There you go.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Alright, one more call for calls, and then we'll end it if nobody else wants to call.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:55.000
I should also pimp out my independent documentary about Whacking Days, also called Man vs. Snake.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Where's the sad trombone, Rob?

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I'm not playing it after that. That was funny.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I like that. Man vs. Snake.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
That should be the sequel.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
It's more co-op, though.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
That should be the sequel to, like, you know, Snakes on a Plane, you know, like Man vs. Snake.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I got nothing.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Alright, I guess nobody's calling in. How sad.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
And there's our dick joke of the night.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.000
That's alright, because my voice is starting to give out, so I think it's in all of our best interests that we wrap up the show.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
No, it wasn't a dick joke. You thought that was a dick joke?

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
It's not a dick joke. It's a reference to The Simpsons.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Whacking Days, it's a day where they go around with sticks and they beat up snakes.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
You dirty birdie. You dirty birdie.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Confirmed dark soccer is the biggest perv on the show.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000
That's not true, just because she may have missed that up.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000
I do hold the title of biggest perv on the show.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Alright, we won't challenge you for that.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000
That's only because your wife isn't here, because then she would be the biggest perv on the show.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Nellie is just the queen of the off-color remark.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
She's great, though. We gotta get her on the show sometime.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Even though I know she hates the show, we gotta get her on it sometime.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange On Radio.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Thank you guys so much for joining us and inviting us into your life after our week off.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Hope we entertained you tonight. Sorry I was sick for most of it, but blame Dragon Con.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:34.000
If you like what you heard, remember we don't ask for your money to do this show, so just help us spread the word.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Tell a friend or two or five about the show.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:42.000
We really appreciate all the thumbs up on Stitcher, the five-star reviews on iTunes.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.000
We haven't got any in a long time, so if you haven't left us a five-star review on iTunes, we really appreciate it.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
And helping to spread the word. What more can we say? Thanks for the support.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:58.000
And it motivates us to get our family to grow and get more input and do more shows for you guys.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Before we say goodnight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:09.000
My final thought is Alan really needs to charge his Kindle, because this thing has been sitting on the dead battery screen for like two weeks.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.000
But I'm impressed at how long this thing can sit on a dead battery screen with no battery.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Um... meh. That's it.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
And Loki, last but not least, your final thought?

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Um... hopefully Grand Theft Auto this week.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:36.000
We'll see. Could we get an early review of Grand Theft Auto 5 next week? We will see.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
A+.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
It's not rigged at all.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I know, Bobby's giving a C+. That's fine. No one's bitter, I guess.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Alright, tune in to find out. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again. Have a great week, everybody. Goodnight.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:21.000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
See you next week.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Thanks for watching!
