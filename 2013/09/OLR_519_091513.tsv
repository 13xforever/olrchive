13888	25830	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Steam allows you to share games with your family, Buzz begins around a new Geometry Wars, a beloved music game continues its lineage onto the Wii U, Final Fantasy is headed to cell phones, and Loki reviews Grand Theft Auto V.
31638	36319	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36399	45742	It is Orange Lounge Radio here on September the 15th of 2013 with the 519th episode of our show.
45842	52163	My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
52523	55144	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
55717	57178	I want people to buy my anime sales
73192	73672	And now what?
73732	74493	It's anime sales.
74653	75354	Now anime sales.
75534	78956	Although I may have a buyer for my most expensive one.
79596	90544	But I have two BeatX sales, two Fushigi Yugi sales, and the other one that I have up is Dragon Ball Z. Is that what this show is for you?
90604	91624	A place to hawk your wares?
91804	92265	Yes, it is.
92865	101333	No, but I would rather this stuff go to people who I know would appreciate it and that I would at least be able to see a picture of it from time to time.
101953	102494	Oh, there you go.
102714	103615	Hey, that was mine.
104135	104496	All right.
105336	106978	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
107178	107338	Hi.
107698	109160	Loki, what are you selling on this show tonight?
112363	114985	I have DVDs on eBay right now, but I mean, that's about it.
115125	115906	That's about it, huh?
116506	116987	All right.
117107	118148	Not really selling anything.
118726	130529	Well, as I mentioned, we are live here and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
130710	133950	Probably an Ouya next week because I really don't play that anymore.
133970	135111	You're going to be selling your Ouya?
135151	135711	Yeah, I think so.
135731	137071	Yeah, boy, the Ouya.
137091	138872	I think Dan would give you five bucks for it.
139812	141313	I'm looking for a little bit more than five bucks.
141353	147695	The OUYA stuff, I know we have some stories on it coming up later, but it certainly seems like it's going downhill fast.
147775	149276	And what's wrong?
149596	150736	What went wrong in OUYA Town?
151216	153337	It's just the support.
154277	155438	The whole thing's been kind of...
156298	157539	Mishandled from the beginning
178847	180990	are they sitting in a DHL warehouse somewhere?
181030	194508	probably it's probably some DHL black hole I don't necessarily blame I would be so mad I would blame them for going so cheap DHL is just the big problem right there but the fact that you chose to use them
195649	198131	You know, that's not a good idea.
198892	207358	I mean, just use the, well, you know, the post office because you're shipping across, you know, the ocean, but... They had to be cost effective, though.
207498	211420	I mean, you know, a $99 system means you're going to take some budget corners, right?
212641	214041	Well, that's still mishandled, though.
214061	215962	I mean, charge more for shipping then or something.
216002	216862	Or charge shipping.
217002	218562	I don't know what you need to do.
218622	221243	But, yeah, it's really handled poorly.
221363	223984	And just their customer service is just terrible.
224424	234266	And on top of that, now with this whole, you know, free the games thing, it's just not working out to what they want it to be or what people want it to be.
234366	235306	It's being abused.
235606	238407	And as we'll get into later, they don't fucking care.
239312	242876	So, what happens now to these other Android consoles?
242916	245078	Do you think we just kind of wrecked it for everybody?
245259	250444	Or do you think that maybe, you know what, there's a rumored Amazon console, there's, wasn't there a Mad Catz?
250524	251546	I can't keep track of them all now.
251566	256191	I think that a lot of it is going to be, people are going to be a little cautious about these micro consoles and stuff.
256231	257212	I don't think it's ruined it.
257612	286528	I mean, definitely people are going to be comparing any console that comes out to the Ouya, but in the case of, like, you know, the Mad Catz console and stuff, that just plays straight-up Android games, you know, that you can get on the Google Play Store, and you can tie your Google Play account to, so I don't think they're really in that much trouble, since it can be, you can basically map your controller to work with games that don't even use controllers and stuff like that, so I think that's kind of cool, and that might end up working out for them, and then, like, the GameStick and stuff, where they have their own stores...
287508	297557	That might be a little bit tricky when they have their own marketplace and they're kind of separating themselves from everybody else because they want a piece of the money from the games they're selling on there.
298658	298999	I don't know.
299019	302382	We're going to have to wait because right now, really, there's only one
302782	303062	PSP TV
322645	325166	Do you think... Well, before you... You mean the PS Vita TV?
325226	325546	Whatever.
325586	328687	PSP TV, I think, would be a little bit dated.
328707	330508	That's what people wanted, and you can do with that.
330908	331568	Well, yeah, that's true.
331608	331848	Whatever.
332108	345753	Well, anyway, before you cut corners there, I was going to say, a lot of people, I think, were predicting that this was going to screw Kickstarter, too, because, in a way, the Ouya, in these unfulfilled orders and so forth, were giving Kickstarter a bad name.
345793	346133	But then...
346613	348013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
374279	377282	And there's been a lot of other scams.
378183	381646	And a lot of them even put this Ouya thing, which we'll probably get into a little bit more.
381666	387131	We talked about that Great Iron Thunder and stuff and where it was being backed by family members.
387652	390354	I mean, there was like 187 people backed it and they had like...
391215	392116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
420413	420674	Yeah.
420894	426286	I mean, and considering that they're doubling that budget when they match the funds, $100,000 for an Android game?
426606	427889	I mean, that's... That's a lot.
427909	428631	Especially on the Ouya.
428651	429673	I mean, you're talking like...
431443	439829	I mean, there's some probably high-end projects on there, but a lot of these video games are being developed by a team of maybe one person to maybe five.
441150	441971	Very small teams.
442091	442731	I don't think you need $100,000.
442771	449277	I think the tough thing, too, with these is that these sites are really about pre-ordering.
449337	454761	It's essentially these are all pre-order sites, and if the rewards aren't good, I don't think people are going to buy into it.
454961	456863	And some of the Kickstarters that I've seen fail...
457463	458223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
477433	484580	You know, these send my nine-year-old to RPG camp or whatever aside, those are the few and far between.
484760	492007	I think, unfortunately, a lot of these more charity, quote-unquote, things, you have to really catch on viral or it ain't going to happen.
492447	494569	And I think there's a lot of wishful thinking out there.
494589	497632	I had a friend just recently do an Indiegogo that didn't do so well.
498093	500115	And I kind of think a lot of that was the...
501776	504837	I don't think he really pushed well enough what rewards were in it.
527349	529970	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
550336	557443	I guess I should say this first, it came to my attention that there's some sort of embargo out there for press reviews until tomorrow morning, 10am.
558704	568295	As an indie site, we are under no such embargo, we were not given a media preview copy of this game or whatever, thanks to Loki's industry connection, he has other ways.
568852	572434	So if they want to avoid this in the future, they need to hook us up.
572494	579439	Well, there's a guy in Oakland selling some for $120, you know.
579639	582241	And I don't want to resort to silly blackmail.
582821	592868	I know you're being facetious, but it's one of those things where it's like, you know, fans of the game will find a way, and some of these people work in the industry like Loki and can do that.
592888	596190	There's people that had it way before me, so I don't want to tell you this.
598271	605253	It's coming out of GameStop and Targets and those people that are getting their pallets of shit, that stuff, way before everything else.
605393	606033	All right, so what?
606053	607854	We're a whole 15 hours early.
607874	608214	Whoop-dee-doo.
608234	610414	But you can't really do a full review of the game, right?
610495	612395	No, I've only played eight hours of it.
612415	617077	All right, so tell us Loki's little preview of the game from your extreme fanboy perspective.
618892	624074	Honestly, even though, yeah, I am a fanboy of the series and stuff like that, it is a fantastic game.
624455	631638	It is... They have just taken... Like, Grand Theft Auto 4, when I first played it, it was just a big, like, holy crap, this looks amazing, that type of stuff.
632098	638140	This... Ford has nothing on the... This is just ridiculous, the amount of detail that they have in it.
638401	642602	And it's not just murky and kind of brown and stuff like Liberty City was.
643002	645964	It's just... It's very vibrant and colorful and there's...
646644	647905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
667997	694315	all sorts of stuff to see I've only played it for 8 hours and I haven't even been to most of the map in the game it's just huge and one of the things I do like about it though is the characters that they have created in it are great, they're very interesting and each one has their own kind of stuff going on and then at the same time their kind of stories intertwine with each other and so you're kind of figuring out how
695376	696517	How that's happening.
696617	701961	Because you have Franklin, who's kind of this gangster guy that's trying to go legit.
702001	709606	He's just trying to get out of that life and stuff and just trying to make money and make an honest living, I guess.
709646	717871	And then you have Michael, who's this retired bank robber who's killed people and done all sorts of crazy stuff.
717891	719672	Then you have Trevor, who's just fucking nuts.
720313	724075	And so you have all these characters and how they interact and stuff.
725416	726036	It's ridiculous.
727457	731239	Can we talk a little bit about the vastness and the things to do in the game?
731299	744805	Because even in the short three minutes I saw in the studio before we went live tonight, I was like, wow, I can tell that the size of this game and the size of the continent that you're on is way bigger than previous Grand Theft Auto games.
745185	747026	I'm just amazed that they can do that on these current gen consoles.
747466	748706	I mean, it looks really good.
765931	792186	and even just like the details with um you go as as time progresses through the night and stuff when you're driving around you know at night you'll have you know people will be street racing you'll see that going on you'll see cops chasing after you know you just cop cars going by and stuff you know if you see a car or something like that crash or you catch a car and fire you know eventually the fireman will come and put out the fire and all sorts of stuff like that but tell me can you drive a piano
792915	793855	Can't drive a piano.
794295	794635	Damn.
794675	795956	That's a mod.
796176	797736	But can you drive to Piano?
799637	807679	But they've got, for example, they have the Santa Monica Pier, or their version of it, and it's got a roller coaster you can go on.
807859	810340	It has the Ferris wheel you can go on.
811640	822143	One of the missions you had to play as Michael, your daughter was hanging out with these porn directors and stuff like that, and they thought that she's going to go shoot some porn.
822163	822263	Gasp.
822443	823823	GASP PORNOGRAPHY
850349	852291	There's not a Sharknado.
852812	853392	Wait for the DLC.
853792	855234	There's all sorts of animals, though.
857536	861339	There's a deer in the first mission you play as Trevor that runs out in front of your car.
861439	864342	I tried to miss it both times, but it's scripted that it'll hit your car.
866264	867825	I'm trying to think what some of the other crazy stuff.
867845	870186	You know, they have the strip club and stuff.
870466	873148	Yeah, I heard it took you no time to find some titties in the game.
873208	881554	Yeah, there's full frontal or, you know, topless women in the game, unlike the pasties in 4, you know, straight up boobies in this one.
882194	890321	and they even have a little minigame portion of it where you can touch the strippers while the bouncers aren't looking and stuff like that.
890401	894185	Can you invite someone in for some hot coffee?
894625	899009	You can do a booty call with them if you want to later on.
899309	901611	Of course, the same prostitute stuff is...
902992	903592	What else I did?
904633	917200	There's one portion of the game where Michael takes drugs and he has this massive trip where he sees aliens trying to abduct him and so he has to take him down with a minigun.
917701	922203	There was a funny thing that was done with this website.
922443	923984	It's like a Facebook type thing.
924204	926586	It's like LifeStalker or something like that.
927406	927927	How appropriate.
927967	928107	Yeah.
929127	936313	and you have to infiltrate their headquarters in order to sabotage something and it really goes weird.
936533	939476	But do we still have the classic Grand Theft Auto mainstay?
939556	944079	Are you still allowed to get the services of a hooker and then kill them?
944279	944780	Yes, of course.
945500	947462	So are there male prostitutes and male strippers too?
947482	947522	No.
949003	949203	See?
949563	950124	Patriarchy.
951524	952785	No, I'm serious.
953025	963271	But to be fair, though, there is male full frontal nudity in the game, but not full frontal female nudity in the game.
963671	964391	So we get Wang.
964911	965152	Yes.
965412	966552	That's patriarchal.
967113	967933	That's unfair.
968013	969754	It's matriarchal, in fact.
970054	974176	Well, we could use a little bit more matriarchy, okay?
974196	975137	No, I do agree.
975157	976538	To be serious, I do agree.
976578	976938	Fair is fair.
977518	977998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1000572	1001632	The storyline is great.
1001692	1007694	And plus, if you just don't want to do the storyline, there's so much to do and there's so many activities and just stuff to fuck around with.
1008355	1011696	There's some characters from Grand Theft Auto 4 that do make a return.
1012216	1021959	In fact, I don't want to spoil anything, but there's one character in particular from 4 that meets his untimely demise in the very first mission of Trevor's.
1023400	1024180	It gets interesting.
1024540	1033369	I'm sorry, I'm just laughing here because I'm watching our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and of course DarkSakura was in there going, you know, when are we going to get our game with male strippers and prostitutes?
1033389	1036192	And then, oh, never mind, never mind, never mind, y'all, I'm fine.
1036553	1037193	We got cock.
1037373	1037694	We're good.
1037754	1038154	I'm good.
1038174	1038955	I'm good.
1039416	1040437	There's cock and boobs.
1040617	1041037	I'm happy.
1041057	1042259	There's equal representation.
1042938	1044320	I would have to make like a special man whore.
1064079	1070880	Going to our chat room for some other comments, live.vognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says, Grand Theft Auto 4 was too bleak.
1071020	1073541	The story was great, but it was all very super serious.
1073941	1079082	Hopefully 5 injects a tiny bit of the insanity we've come to love from Grand Theft Auto 3 and Saints Row.
1079382	1086503	There's a lot of these people that you meet on the street, kind of like the stuff in Grand Theft Auto 4 where you can meet these random strangers and do things.
1087683	1090264	It's like freaks and strangers missions or something like that.
1091204	1093586	and there's one that's a member of the paparazzi.
1094226	1104813	And so this first thing you're doing is you're riding, the first mission you have with him, you're riding or driving a motorcycle and he's taking pictures on the back of the motorcycle trying to get a crotch shot of some celebrity or whatever.
1105093	1110016	The second one is you find out, oh hey, this one celebrity's really into anal sex.
1110456	1113658	Let's go take a picture of her having anal sex in her backyard.
1113978	1115178	And so, yes, that's what you do.
1115218	1116179	You sneak up on her.
1116259	1119261	You take a picture of her having, you record her having anal sex.
1119901	1123122	And then she comes and chases after you with her boyfriend.
1123163	1124823	She's like trying to run you down with her car.
1124843	1125944	It's like a Paris Hilton type.
1127245	1133551	That's not so much like insane, like Saints Row IV or whatever, where that's just ya nasty.
1133731	1137074	Like, Grand Theft Auto V, what you're describing is just ya nasty.
1138135	1148265	Dungeon Buster said in chat that in an adult game that's actually adult, but Fifth Dream's retort, not an adult game would entail not being able to pay your bills, accidental pregnancy, and your car breaking down on the way to work.
1148365	1149566	It's not entirely graphic.
1149586	1153148	It's just, you know, her pants are down, the guy's pants are down, and there's humping going on.
1153168	1154509	I mean, you can't see anything.
1154569	1156751	It's not, like, you know, very detailed.
1156811	1158412	I believe you said anal sex.
1158853	1160414	There's also dog sex in the game.
1160434	1163096	Loki, why do you keep bringing up anal sex on the show?
1164797	1170261	Yeah, so the first mission that you have Chop, he has sex with a dog, too, so... Oh my god, you're nasty!
1170461	1172803	It's dog sex, because there's two dogs, yeah.
1173443	1175865	That's my... You can put that on the back of the box.
1177131	1179073	You like dog fucking.
1180414	1183176	You'll like Grand Theft Auto V. Along with Raven, of course.
1183217	1184137	You're nasty.
1185318	1185939	It's a great game.
1185999	1187020	It seriously is.
1187520	1189662	All strangers aside, it's great.
1189702	1192164	It's got a bunch of really interesting characters.
1193966	1198370	TigerClaw in chat says, I heard you can also smoke weed in Grand Theft Auto V. Yes, you can.
1199212	1200233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1217943	1221806	Let's see, Dartituya says, so is this Loki's game of the year?
1223087	1224227	Probably, yeah.
1224908	1226049	Most likely?
1226289	1227970	It's really, really good.
1228050	1238316	I mean, I've only played eight hours of it yet, so I don't know a lot of the missions that they're showing off, like what I'm talking about in the press, I haven't really gotten to yet.
1238837	1240238	But so far, it's been interesting.
1240278	1243620	I did the first heist mission, which was fun, and
1245518	1245858	I don't know.
1245958	1246939	It's just going to be good.
1247399	1252443	And I know tomorrow you're going to see a lot of perfect 10 reviews or at least high 9s.
1252543	1253544	High 9s, perfect 10s.
1253744	1254524	I guarantee it.
1254925	1255785	And a couple dog fucks.
1256486	1261449	Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, Dog fucking lovers have been so underserved in the gaming community.
1261569	1263650	Well, now a game for y'all.
1265092	1276962	I also saw a GIF on Reddit where it shows Franklin running up to a cow in a field and he kicks over the cow.
1277302	1279904	So there's all sorts of animal violence and stuff in this game.
1280164	1283147	Oh, I'm sure animal violence is hilarious, Loki.
1284226	1284746	It's a fake.
1284966	1286467	It's not real, okay?
1286707	1288288	I'm not saying go kick a real cow.
1288528	1289729	It's fake.
1289889	1291070	It's a digital cow.
1291430	1291790	All right.
1291830	1293211	Digital violence is okay.
1293451	1295372	Which, actually, that does lead me to something.
1296152	1296593	Go ahead.
1296713	1301375	Did you see, I reposted on my Facebook a while back, but Fox News put up a poll.
1301896	1304777	Do you think that violent video games cause violence?
1304797	1306078	Oh, it was all over the internet, but yeah.
1306098	1306418	Well, yeah.
1306798	1309740	But it was like 90% of the responses was no.
1310222	1314904	Well, yeah, but that's because 4chan, I'm sure, did something to the poll.
1314964	1317525	When I looked at it the first time, it was a little more even.
1317845	1321547	Who gives two fucks what some internet poll has to say?
1321907	1324048	Just wait for all the news to come out after this.
1325598	1328380	Thank you for... That was the point I was getting to.
1329321	1329421	Oh.
1329661	1332343	I usually bring up something to make a point.
1334425	1345293	The point I was getting to is that I wonder what they're going to say after the game is officially out and there's reviews of it and say, well, our poll was skewed because that game man came out yet.
1345353	1351018	I'm picturing a meme in my head with the Game of Thrones guy where it says, brace yourselves.
1351598	1351698	Yes.
1353039	1356500	Cable News gets Grand Theft Auto 5 this week or something like that.
1356680	1357280	No, no, no.
1357300	1357960	This is Cable News.
1358100	1360861	We won't be talking about Grand Theft Auto 5 for another 10 years.
1361361	1363922	They'll realize it after Grand Theft Auto 7 comes out.
1363942	1365842	That Grand Theft Auto 5 is super violent.
1365862	1367042	Rabble, rabble, rabble, rabble.
1368083	1370483	You can also drive a riding lawnmower in the game, which is awesome.
1371744	1372704	But not a piano.
1372744	1373324	What's up with that?
1374144	1375705	Because pianos don't drive.
1376845	1378565	I have seen, for real, a motorized piano.
1378585	1378765	Thank you.
1378785	1380426	Can you reenact scenes from The Happening?
1381266	1381326	No.
1383740	1386642	Plants do not attack you as far as I'm aware What?
1386942	1387902	No!
1388122	1399408	But I do hear, because I've been reading a lot of Reddit I do hear though that there is possibly Here's the great thing about Grand Theft Auto This is how you do an homage to your older games
1400751	1406533	All the cheat codes from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas work in this game, by the way.
1406633	1407133	Which is awesome.
1407153	1410855	Well, that's great, because some people could care less about the story.
1411275	1412955	They just want to run around and kill people.
1413015	1419018	They did, like, a lot of the things that, you know, there's all these, like, there's a killer in the woods, you know, in San Andreas.
1419038	1424099	That was one of the big myths of San Andreas.
1424380	1428221	And now I think they did put that in there as an Easter egg.
1429039	1429319	Alright.
1430580	1435544	Let me ask one more question, then we'll get into the rest of our gaming weeks and the games that Jamie and I have been playing this week.
1438310	1450297	Since we are talking about another game from the same generation, I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is from the same generation, but the way you describe Grand Theft Auto 5 and from what I've seen really makes it sound like it pushes things so much further.
1451098	1461184	What do you think really changed to allow Grand Theft Auto 5 to push the boundaries in ways that Grand Theft Auto 4 apparently didn't, even though at the time we thought it was pushing the boundaries?
1461924	1464066	You know, I'm surprised at how they were able to do it.
1464086	1466367	They must have really gone through and just...
1467745	1476128	Tweet the shit out of their engine because they've gotten in a way now where they basically have made it, okay, listen, we can make this map as big as we want it to be.
1476328	1478428	Storage being the only limitation.
1478628	1479629	Storage and, I guess, RAM.
1480029	1483130	But the detail is ramped up so much from 4.
1483570	1483910	There's...
1485760	1487041	First off, there's animals in there.
1487161	1488382	There's a ton more cars.
1488642	1490084	The detail's a lot bigger.
1490604	1491605	It's more colorful.
1491986	1492947	There's a lot more to do.
1492987	1501135	They have this whole ambient soundtrack in there for when you're not listening to stuff that actually is contextual to what you're doing.
1502877	1504298	There's more animations.
1504798	1506941	There's just a lot more better AI.
1507441	1512744	They've basically taken every aspect of Grand Theft Auto 4, split it all apart, and improved upon everything.
1513605	1515205	Combat in the game is a lot better.
1516086	1520809	One of the things I did notice, I have run into a couple glitches.
1520869	1522870	Let's be honest, there were a few glitches.
1523030	1524631	I ran into one where I was using...
1525051	1530415	and Franklin's special ability, which slows down time when you're driving to be able to maneuver quickly.
1530696	1540744	And I hit a fence in a certain way that when I undid the... Or when I took off the... Or turned off the power or whatever they had, it flipped my car upside down.
1540784	1543206	I got stuck on top of a fence, which is kind of funny.
1543446	1544527	And then there was another one.
1544667	1545007	It was...
1547439	1564166	one of the other things oh i used to be able to like run and jump and grab onto a wall and stuff like that but a lot of times it doesn't quite work the same way in five and so you'll end up running to jump to grab something and instead it'll kind of flop against the wall and like slam into the wall which is kind of funny um
1565740	1566220	I don't know.
1566280	1573926	It's just very... If you've played four, you just need to check out five, and it's going to be very obvious what they've done.
1573986	1576148	It's just improved kind of all around.
1576168	1579150	I'm pretty sure anybody who touched four is probably making their plans to get five.
1579971	1581112	But here's the thing with five.
1581152	1586036	I think even just in sandbox games in general, I think this is a good example of what to do.
1586116	1588137	There's a lot of improvements with just...
1589358	1593501	Even though the world could be the same size, the city is bigger.
1593621	1598964	But it just seems a lot bigger even in the same amount of space that they had it before.
1599545	1601386	Just all the detail that they packed in.
1602187	1602527	I lied.
1602547	1604328	I thought of another question before we get to Gaming Weeks.
1604368	1608871	Because before the show, TigerClaw had sent me this link wondering if we were going to talk about it tonight.
1608891	1610212	And I thought now was a good time to bring it up.
1610852	1624665	There's an actual petition on Change.org that quite simply says to Rockstar Games, don't make a PC version of Grand Theft Auto V. And the title of this is, so PC gamers learn their lesson and stop stealing games.
1624825	1627388	That is the most stupid thing I've ever seen.
1627958	1632080	which how are most people playing Grand Theft Auto 5 right now if they're not in the press?
1632100	1632661	They're probably stealing it.
1632681	1633701	They probably stole it.
1634942	1637964	Playing it on PC has nothing to do with the ability to pirate a game.
1639444	1646608	I always thought the allure of PC was, well, for one, some people like the keyboard and mouse and some people like PC, but modding is huge on PC.
1647949	1650691	Well, you've got people like me who have problems with controllers.
1652692	1655073	There will be a PC version at some point.
1655093	1656935	There will be a PlayStation 4 version at some point.
1656955	1657755	It's already leaked out.
1657815	1660777	It's in the configuration files that they make reference to that stuff.
1661138	1661798	So it's coming.
1661858	1666761	It's just they haven't announced it yet because why would you cannibalize your sales for this current gen?
1666961	1668342	It'll come out maybe a year later.
1669743	1671364	With DLC or something.
1691335	1717400	at launch and then later on once that you know exclusivity ran up then it came out on PlayStation 3 and that's when the PC version came out as well so it's with that not being the case anymore I think it's just gonna be that they're gonna wait for some systems to sell and they're gonna wait for the sales to start dipping down a little bit because why would you say oh yeah by the way this PlayStation 4 version is coming out then no one's gonna buy it because they're gonna buy a new system
1717840	1722206	Brad from PodCulture asks, now will Grand Theft Auto 5 be one of those $9.99 upgrades?
1722806	1724068	No way, Jose.
1724248	1728133	I mean, the $10 upgrade stuff is mostly for stuff this year anyway.
1728193	1730796	It's to encourage people to make the leap sooner rather than later.
1731296	1735601	So, you know, a game like Grand Theft Auto 5 kind of doesn't need the upgrade program.
1736122	1736563	It'll sell.
1737123	1746846	Also, if I may, I would like to encourage people not to use change.org because they sign you up for 50 million mailing lists every time you sign a petition so they suck anyway.
1746886	1749026	Unless you're going to sign this petition then by all means go ahead.
1749246	1753047	No, if you're going to sign this petition then just don't tell me about it because I'll probably berate you.
1756369	1766278	Uh, let's see, uh, going to our chat room for more comments, live.vognetwork.com, uh, Datatrack says, is it sad that all I really enjoyed was the electronic music from the old Grand Theft Autos?
1766778	1769781	Well, that makes me think, how's, how's the soundtrack for the game?
1770061	1770582	It's pretty good.
1770982	1775647	Um, I, I also like the electronic music, but I haven't really been messing with the radio stations because I,
1776067	1776487	I forget.
1776687	1780328	I think there's two electronica stations, but I can only find one of them.
1781309	1784190	I do like how they changed the way you do the radio stuff.
1784230	1790091	Now you hold down a button and then you select it from a... There's like a radio selection that you select it from.
1790632	1792052	But yeah, there's a lot of music in the game.
1792312	1792932	A ton of music.
1792952	1795513	There's, I think, like 15 radio stations in it.
1796553	1802775	And even, like I said, when you're not listening to the radio and you're just in a mission and stuff, the contextual soundtrack that they have in there is really nice.
1803456	1803696	So...
1804776	1813067	And plus, the other thing too is if you're... If you're sensitive to the N-word, you might not want to pick up this game.
1813548	1814389	Just saying.
1814469	1819736	Well, all the other games kind of use that word and other provoking words.
1819896	1820818	Yes, it's...
1822737	1830080	There's a lot of, you know, because Franklin's missions and stuff, it's a lot of, it has to do with like, you know, gang banging and stuff.
1830141	1832001	So, I don't know.
1832101	1832822	It's just interesting.
1832882	1834543	Just seriously, check out the game.
1835123	1835763	I love this.
1835863	1837524	My phone just went off on Twitter.
1838484	1839185	I just got a tweet.
1839225	1840745	I retweeted it so y'all could see there.
1841306	1844207	A tweet here from Marcus Boy, BOI, on tweet.
1844247	1847409	It says, Grand Theft Auto 5, ya nasty edition.
1847569	1849029	And look, look at the box art.
1849049	1849670	Look carefully.
1850410	1851030	Yeah.
1851150	1852391	Inserted there in the corner.
1854606	1855768	Oh, our listeners rule.
1855788	1856409	That's awesome.
1856449	1857170	Thank you for that.
1857750	1858311	I needed that.
1858531	1858832	All right.
1860334	1862276	Is that all we're going to say on Grand Theft Auto V for now?
1862296	1862657	That's fine.
1862797	1864740	I'm sure you'll talk about it plenty more in the coming weeks.
1864780	1865300	Yes, plenty more.
1865340	1867183	When you have more time to get your hands on it.
1867423	1870547	Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week in How Was Your Gaming Week?
1870687	1872650	Dark Sakura, what other games have you been playing this week?
1872850	1873790	Final Fantasy 14.
1874811	1875231	I'm almost 21.
1875291	1877692	They finally fixed my account.
1877772	1878432	I'm so happy.
1879272	1880413	I played Animal Crossing.
1880453	1881833	You didn't have to call them and get on them either.
1881873	1882973	It just magically happened.
1882993	1883734	It just happened on Monday.
1883794	1886314	What they were doing is they were actually handing out other...
1888335	1902976	basically like for people who had the collector's edition they were handing out new collector's edition codes so that you could put it on the proper account and then they said they would close whichever one was inactive so I actually went ahead and closed the inactive account myself so that my characters would be okay
1904157	1908598	Um, and, uh, I played a little bit of, uh, Dragon Age Origins.
1908879	1921362	Um, I'm gonna be starting over on that one, um, just because I really do not like how my character turns out, and I kinda, I was really, I felt nauseous playing through the female city elf thing.
1921583	1922563	I was just really nauseous.
1922583	1922903	I don't wanna...
1924364	1925044	Finish the character.
1929547	1930628	What else did I play?
1931068	1932309	Oh yeah, I played some more Fractal.
1933410	1941075	Fractal is my game that I don't really... I mean, I care if I beat the level or not, but it's one that I don't mind the challenge.
1941535	1943796	Because I'll get so close.
1944096	1948179	It's really a difficult game once you get up into the higher levels.
1948259	1950120	And I am just short of beating level 20.
1950160	1950240	Okay.
1951441	1957485	So, which I'm pretty proud of myself for making it that far because it really is a lot to keep track of in that game.
1957505	1968812	I also, one of our listeners gifted, I thought we were all gifted with a copy of Don't Starve, but it came on my account.
1968872	1969772	Don't think I got that.
1970213	1970473	Oops.
1971333	1971693	It's fine.
1971753	1974255	Well, one of our listeners gifted me with Don't Starve then.
1975015	1977557	So I haven't started it yet, but it's installed.
1977901	1978141	Okay.
1979141	1980122	I've wanted to check that out.
1980162	1984203	So that'll be when the whole lending thing that we'll talk about later comes into play.
1984243	1985223	I'll have to check that out.
1985883	1992265	See, that's a really good thing because for all of us who are into different games, that gives us a chance to review everything.
1992845	1994766	Or unless it was today because I haven't checked today.
1994806	1995746	No, it was a couple days ago.
1995866	1996086	Okay.
1996366	2020198	I was actually just half asleep, heard my email beep, and checked as like, oh... No, actually, I gotta say, I just want to say a big, like, thank you to... Well, A, I want to thank all the listeners who take the time to listen to this show every week, because it often kind of comes to light how many of you there are that maybe aren't actively participating with the show, but that are just listening, whether it be on Stitcher or Apple podcast app or whatever.
2020559	2022500	So I just want to say thank you for listening, for one.
2022560	2022760	But B...
2023741	2034494	Those of you guys that take the time and money to actually buy us a game is such a cool, unexpected, nice thing.
2035075	2037998	Actually, one of our listeners, Codeman, got me Outlast.
2038018	2038379	Mm-hmm.
2038639	2041281	This week, which is supposed to be a super scary game.
2041902	2048267	And I think it's to egg me on to do a playthrough on Twitch TV to do a playthrough of that.
2050489	2054572	I'm always very humbled by the generosity there.
2055232	2062659	Well, hopefully this week I'll have a chance to give it a better play just because, you know, I've got nothing to do except school.
2063779	2066262	And now all the major holidays are over, thankfully.
2068704	2074689	And there's also, now, it's not a game, but I don't know if I've told people about it.
2074769	2076490	I might have mentioned it.
2076710	2078412	It's a neat little app is what it is.
2079232	2106802	and I've been playing playing with it it's called Art of Glow and basically all it is is you draw and it animates everything that you draw in different colors you can change how it does but I've actually been making kind of a game with it by seeing how I can control the colors on it it's actually just a fun little waste of time but you know it's not a game per se it's just a neat thing so I've been telling people about it it's Art of Glow is it free?
2107597	2113924	there's a free version I believe and then that Final Fantasy XIV Libra came out which I've been playing around in
2114713	2122079	That's very... I do like that on Final Fantasy XIV, every free company or whatever has a forum on the official thing.
2122139	2125502	If you go in and look, you can actually look at everybody's little character.
2125602	2127624	So I guess I should plug real quick.
2127684	2137893	If you are playing Final Fantasy XIV and you want a free company to join, you probably would have to roll a new character unless you're already on Midgarcimer as a server that we play on.
2137953	2139314	But we do have our free company there.
2139334	2140175	It's called End of Line.
2140675	2141416	And it's been...
2141817	2145005	Active, and we're already rank 5 or whatever.
2145808	2148475	Shane's really good about getting that 5% experience boost perk every day.
2149127	2149607	Yeah, it's good.
2150047	2150207	Yeah.
2150227	2151188	We're having a fun time.
2151388	2152628	I'm actually on my third dungeon.
2153008	2153248	Nice.
2153628	2155389	So when people want to run it with me.
2155629	2157429	Not to sound, I lost count.
2157449	2158390	I think I'm on dungeon 11 or 12.
2158890	2161391	But it's nice that they have all that to kind of keep you going.
2161451	2161931	So it's good.
2162071	2166512	And I like that actually people who are higher level can go back and play with people who are lower level.
2166572	2166832	Oh, yeah.
2167192	2172994	Instead of, you know, just that was a big annoying thing about WoW is that if I had friends at different levels, I couldn't.
2173559	2179225	Right, no, that is great, because, yeah, and I totally, well, I think I did help you run a dungeon the other night, right?
2179285	2180646	You ran my first two with me.
2180786	2190175	Yeah, so even though I was level, like, 35 or whatever, I was able to kind of level sync down to where you were at, and it wasn't a face roll thing, it was actually still challenging, I had to be alert.
2190536	2195400	It wasn't necessarily difficult, but it was still, you know, a game.
2195420	2195601	Right.
2196301	2197762	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2213055	2235244	which I would say I hope you had a happy holiday although I know it's not really happy so I hope you had an insightful an easy fast for Yom Kippur everybody who does not know anything about Judaism never tell someone happy Yom Kippur because it's not a happy holiday you fast for 25 hours that alone does not sound happy
2235664	2237325	with no water or food.
2237425	2238085	Oh my gosh.
2238426	2239606	Because you're supposed to afflict yourself.
2241067	2246350	And this also was on Shabbat, so it was like no internet, no nothing, no work.
2246370	2246810	No fun.
2248851	2251853	But you spend the day basically being apologetic and introspective.
2252093	2259357	So if you want to wish somebody something, you can tell them Shana Tova, you know, good new year, because it's right after Rosh Hashanah.
2259717	2261198	You can tell them to have an easy fast.
2261878	2263538	and that would be a pleasant thing to say.
2263558	2265999	Can I tell you like I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over?
2266259	2266999	Yes, you can.
2267499	2270280	Can you eat a juicy hamburger in front of them?
2270560	2272240	Mmm, it's so good.
2272640	2273720	Now you're being insensitive.
2273780	2275601	They're at synagogue all day anyway, right?
2275641	2278661	Yeah, we're at synagogue all day and there's no hamburgers at synagogue.
2278721	2279522	No in and out at synagogue.
2279562	2281122	No standing in the window.
2281302	2286563	Well, actually we have police at our synagogue so they'd probably say move along, move along.
2287475	2287856	I like that.
2287916	2288758	I will use that next year.
2288778	2290361	I'll totally buy you a Taco Bell when it's over.
2291143	2291303	Ew.
2291464	2291744	Alright.
2291965	2294871	Just get me Adalbertos and then we'll say it's good.
2295896	2298678	Loki, how was your gaming week outside of the big one we talked about?
2299278	2303380	I played, actually, one sort of new game.
2303460	2305961	It was an old game, but new on PC.
2306821	2312143	I played Burnout Paradise because, hey, I got that in the Origin bundle, so why not?
2312824	2317286	And it runs fantastic on PC, so played a bit of that.
2317966	2319887	And what else?
2320816	2344498	a little bit of Saints Row 4 on PC although I've kind of run out of things to do in it so I didn't play it for very long I was just checking out some of the new mods in there they have a hydraulics mod now that Isle Ninja worked on so that's pretty sweet and what else oh also played a little bit of Call of Duty and that's pretty much it
2345565	2368315	my gaming week I've also been playing an unhealthy bingeful amount of Final Fantasy 14 but I'm not sorry but I did play some other games too I would take a break once in a while to play some other games one of the big games I've been playing of course huge release this week Kingdom Hearts HD on the PlayStation 3 was one I had to pick up on the day it was released and I've been playing that a little bit I haven't really been binging on Kingdom Hearts but I've been playing it enough and
2368955	2371176	It's so gorgeous in HD.
2371376	2372557	Even right from the very beginning.
2372597	2376238	You remember the very beginning of Kingdom Hearts with the stained glass princess floors?
2376258	2377599	You have to show me after the show.
2377619	2379960	Oh, it's so beautiful.
2380180	2383762	In the HD and everything, the televisions, those colors just really jump.
2383842	2386023	It's a really pretty game to look at.
2386664	2401701	and of course you know it's the game you remember from the PlayStation 2 you know it's not like they really changed the game except well it is the final mix but I find those changes to be a little bit minor but I know for the Kingdom Hearts fans it's it's a big deal and you know the fact that it's out in the U.S.
2401741	2403963	for the first time so that's that's cool um
2404824	2405545	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2431887	2450669	I get really frustrated with the camera still too granted they did make some changes some of the things that they had done with Kingdom Hearts 2 in regards to like control and things they went back and did with this which I'm thankful for and I'm so thankful for the fact you can invert the X and Y cameras and all that too and just kind of customize that so nice
2452091	2453152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2473493	2475854	But it's still a gorgeous story.
2477275	2478455	Just a lot of fun to play.
2479236	2484258	And yeah, I plan on playing more of it throughout the week and hopefully get even further in the game.
2484538	2487439	Do you have an option of Japanese dialogue?
2487579	2488640	Ooh, I don't remember.
2488700	2491341	Maybe somebody in chat can answer that for me because I do not remember.
2491656	2499162	I just think it would be nice if they gave you the option that you can have any of the music in Japanese, well, you know, the Itada Hikaru stuff, or any of the dialogue.
2499182	2501925	I don't think so, because I don't remember that coming up at the very start of the game.
2502465	2507490	There are different levels of difficulty, and to be fair, I'm playing it on normal quote-unquote difficulty.
2508130	2515977	I didn't drop it down to easy, because I didn't remember the game being that hard, but I guess, maybe I was playing on easy the first time, I didn't realize it, I don't know.
2516457	2516978	So, whatever.
2517558	2522443	Um, and Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com confirms, nope.
2522463	2536338	Ooh, I mean, not that I mind Hayley Joel, but... Yeah, well, and to be fair, the Blu-ray is packed pretty full because it's not just Kingdom Hearts, they also have Chain of Memories HD, which I haven't even touched yet, but that whole game's in there waiting for you to play, and then they have...
2537619	2553574	358 slash 2 that isn't playable but they turned it into like a three hour movie so you can just watch all the cut scenes and I think that's where all that voice acting and all that stuff kind of came in the extra stuff that they did so that's all on one blu-ray for 40 bucks so that is a great value
2554625	2557730	A couple other games I played this week just quickly.
2558531	2567385	There's some free games on PlayStation Plus right now, so I checked out Galaga Dimensions, which is actually a couple years old.
2567425	2569288	It just happens to be free on PlayStation Plus right now.
2569888	2571009	and DarkSakura.com.
2590265	2596650	It's really about kind of setting off the bombs at just the right time so that everything kind of, yeah, these chain reactions and everything.
2596690	2603716	So I like a game that kind of peels back the layers and shows its depth the more you play it, what might look stupidly simple in the beginning.
2604077	2605778	So I do give Galaga props for that.
2605938	2609961	That was because I remember playing it on 360 a couple years ago and I was kind of like, meh, don't get it.
2610302	2611082	I didn't really buy it.
2611403	2616347	But now that I have it for free, thanks to PlayStation Plus, I've been having a good time with it.
2617047	2645189	and um yeah that's that's really about it I played Star Wars pinball for like 30 minutes too which was also free and does things that you would never see a regular pinball table do like flying x-wings and stormtroopers that pop up on the table and shoot your ball so there is kind of that sense of ridiculousness but they are well done games from what I've played so far I mean Zen does a great job with all their pinball games so that is pretty much my gaming week in a nutshell um
2646150	2652612	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Robert M in chat says, I really can't get into Galaga Legion's DX personally.
2652912	2655772	For some reason, the collision seems way too forgiving.
2657533	2662834	Yeah, I guess I could see that, although I do notice that the game will do this slowdown thing.
2662874	2666395	Like, if you're about to get hit, the game will suddenly, like, slow down and zoom in.
2666455	2667955	It actually does this in Pac-Man 2.
2668015	2671676	I don't know if they kind of borrowed the idea from each other or what, but it does this in Pac-Man 2.
2671716	2674297	Like, if you're about to die, the game will slow and that.
2674517	2674817	DarkSakura,
2693161	2720343	Alright, that's really it as far as my gaming week and things I wanted to talk about So, housekeeping, I don't really have a lot to say tonight So please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR You can see that nasty thing I retweeted earlier, that's always fun And follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Not a super busy week for news, if I'm not mistaken But a few big things to talk about tonight So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2720623	2722825	Yeah, it wasn't too busy of a week.
2739838	2743481	One of which, of course, was the Vita TV.
2743821	2748184	Well, the Vita TV is this really small device that plugs into the TV.
2748224	2754008	It uses a DualShock 3 controller, which is not included with it unless you buy the more expensive bundle.
2754088	2762854	But it runs for about the equivalent of $99 US for the system itself, or $150 with the controller bundled in.
2763554	2788585	and it acts like a Vita without the screen so you can play Vita games on it it has a spot for the memory card and for the Vita cartridges and you can also do the game streaming stuff that you can with the Vita like for example you can stream you know PlayStation 3 games with it you can do PlayStation 4 games once you know that comes out and
2789545	2794948	The only thing that it's limited on is obviously you can't technically stream.
2796449	2799171	You can't play games that use the touchscreen, obviously.
2800392	2801973	But yeah, you can play all the digital stuff.
2801993	2806896	You can watch Netflix on it because there's the Netflix app.
2807416	2812119	So all the stuff that you can do on the Vita except for the touch stuff, now on this device.
2812139	2815421	So you can play PSP games and PlayStation 1 games and all that fun stuff.
2816241	2821425	Is it just me or does it seem like some of the Vita games are kind of abandoning the touch stuff, especially the rear touch thing?
2822626	2828430	I could see that, but that's just almost the same way as a lot of the PlayStation 3 games abandon the six-axis stuff.
2829611	2833914	I don't think it's... Okay, this is going to sound horrible, but this is just how I've lost track of time lately.
2833974	2836156	Was that Japanese press conference this week?
2836236	2837197	It was Sunday night.
2837377	2840259	Okay, that's why it was right after the show.
2840279	2841260	I actually stayed up for it.
2841700	2848246	I did too, so we should say at some point there's those new Vitas too but do they even have the touchpacks?
2848626	2869464	No, they do, they're just smaller and they don't have the OLED screen, they have just a regular LCD screen and so they have that and they're a little bit cheaper but they're multicolored and stuff and a little slimmer and all that fun stuff and I think they have one gigabyte of memory built in to the system
2870064	2875930	TigerClaw in chat says, why would you want to stream PlayStation 3 games on the PlayStation Vita TV when the PlayStation 3 is right next to it?
2876731	2879314	Well, this would be like the Vita TVs in your bedroom, right?
2879334	2881316	And the PS3s in the living room or something like that?
2881596	2891806	That and also the fact that like safe, I think what this could be is when they actually do get to, you know, the point where they have their Gaikai streaming service available and
2892307	2895851	You don't even need a PlayStation 3 to stream PlayStation 3 games.
2895911	2899055	You could play that stuff over the Vita.
2899616	2905503	Eventually they're going to have it where it'll come to the Vita as far as streaming all sorts of things.
2906625	2909468	But I think this is mainly for playing Vita games, which...
2910189	2917056	I gotta say, it's a great idea, because even though the Vita does have the dual analog sticks, though, it's still kind of awkward to hold.
2918457	2924303	So I would love actually just having a dual shock available to be able to play that way, because I think that'd be great.
2925123	2929828	I can't put my finger on it, but I really want one of these things, and I don't even know why.
2929928	2931389	They just look so cool.
2931409	2933371	It's a cheaper alternative to... Let's put it this way.
2933391	2934993	It's a cheaper alternative for a Vita...
2935733	2960631	and for a person like me that doesn't really play on the go I'm sitting on my couch anyways playing the Vita this is fine because I'll just pop in a Vita game if I really want to play it and do that hey here's an idea you know I really wish they had this for like the 3DS you know have you know where I can play with an external controller and play a game on my TV and it put in the cartridges like a Wii U controller no
2962313	2963034	That would be fine.
2963294	2966697	Honestly, actually, if that would be fine, that's the way they're going to get around having the second screen.
2967158	2974825	Although I still, to this day, I'm still saying that's a matter of time that they're going to have that where they will have 3DS games on the Wii U. It will happen.
2975025	2976367	Or regular DS games first.
2976387	2977468	It would just make sense.
2977528	2977908	Come on.
2977968	2979350	They are lacking content anyways.
2979370	2981252	They have a ton of fucking great 3DS games.
2982752	2988254	or even just DS games like Clubhouse Games and the Metroid Prime Hunters.
2988334	2989655	God, there was a ton of shit on DS.
2989815	2991256	Pokemon, come on!
2994517	2997258	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, I want one, the Vita TV.
2997618	3001839	If anything, to be able to play PSP and Vita games I missed out on on a big screen.
3002980	3004180	It's a better $99 spent than buying an Ouya.
3008681	3009582	Oh, snap!
3009882	3010843	I'm all down for that.
3011843	3014085	There's good Vita games out there.
3014105	3019068	At the time, I didn't really want to have a Vita for all that stuff.
3020108	3021889	But this is not a bad idea.
3021949	3026872	But the thing is, it's not planned for the US and Europe markets yet.
3026892	3027813	It's just for Japan.
3028333	3029354	So, I think...
3029614	3029814	All right.
3029834	3030054	All right.
3055120	3060301	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CLICK.
3060822	3063182	Well, let's move on and talk about Xbox for a little bit.
3063482	3066323	There was a couple pieces of news about Microsoft this week.
3066403	3068304	Some I'll talk about, some Jamie will talk about in a minute here.
3069084	3074185	One of them has to do with a domain, the xb1.com domain.
3074225	3076706	But the way it was capitalized, it more looked like the...
3077646	3081688	Infamous term you hear around the internet, the Xbone.com domain.
3082229	3084150	Microsoft... Excuse me.
3084530	3085731	Gotta love the hiccups on live radio.
3086291	3089233	Microsoft got this domain back this week.
3089873	3100500	Major Nelson, in a public way on NeoGAF, of all places, going public and saying that the Xbone name disrespects the people that created the Xbox One.
3101160	3102621	He said, quote, I don't like it.
3102941	3105983	It disrespects the teams that have put in thousands of hours already.
3106323	3107663	into the development of the product.
3107864	3110404	Sure, it's cheeky, but I don't care for it myself.
3110724	3114526	Then maybe you should have named your fucking console Xbox One, you dumbass.
3115106	3117527	Well, isn't that what they called it?
3118847	3120228	You said they should have named it.
3120248	3121988	You mean they shouldn't have named it.
3122008	3124109	Should not have named it the Xbox One.
3124329	3125149	Should not have.
3125249	3125909	Should not have.
3125969	3130691	Just like, you know, if you were Nintendo and didn't want penis jokes, maybe you shouldn't have named your console the Wii.
3130771	3132051	I mean, it's just a thought.
3132451	3132732	All right.
3133032	3133512	Well, um...
3134352	3140115	What's interesting about this domain is that it was originally purchased on March 20th of 2000.
3141356	3145038	So this domain was bought a long time before there was ever an Xbox One.
3145098	3147639	Some people are saying, wow, they just got lucky with the guess.
3148180	3152902	I'm more thinking, well, wasn't this around the time the first Xbox came out?
3153002	3153943	And so maybe...
3154523	3169450	Some lucky person thought that they would be calling the original Xbox the Xbox One, looking back, because you look at the PlayStation 1, the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, I think a lot of people would think that you would call that original Xbox the Xbox One.
3169470	3173032	They probably never thought that they would go back and make a new console named the Xbox One.
3173052	3173312	Right?
3173732	3174433	Anonymous Report
3202801	3204182	was talking to Edge.
3204242	3209447	These were anonymous developers saying that the PlayStation 4 is in a better state of performance.
3210047	3213891	The hardware isn't locked yet, according to this source.
3214391	3216713	The PlayStation 4 apparently more capable.
3216793	3227863	The same game running on both consoles at 1080p at 30 frames a second is on PlayStation 4, but it will run on a lower resolution and frame rate on the Xbox One as of right now.
3228663	3256948	um I believe Microsoft put out a comment about this later on that was basically like it's bullshit to summarize uh but what do you guys think do you think there's any I mean sometimes where there's smoke there's fire with this stuff so I'll entertain it for a minute I thought the comment that they made wasn't necessarily that was bullshit but that you know it's not just about speed it's about all the specs together that make the console and type things so it's like yeah that may be the case but it's not gonna matter
3257208	3285582	I don't think it's going to matter anyways because you're going to have just like the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 spec wise they were different and so they still have to make the games perform pretty much the same on both systems so I think you're going to see pretty much the games playing the same on both systems it's not going to be that dramatically different I think it has to play the same on both systems or that's like Microsoft would never put a system out there that can't handle it the same you know what I mean
3286528	3289652	Yeah, you're not going to see something dramatically different.
3289673	3299365	You're not going to have Assassin's Creed 5 or something where it's stick figures on Xbox One and full 1080p graphics on the PlayStation 4.
3299726	3300887	It's just not going to happen that way.
3301628	3305350	Coupa Kid Jeremy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Are the games fun?
3305690	3306750	That's all I care about.
3307251	3309952	I do agree, and it goes back to that old golden rule, right?
3309972	3311773	The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3311973	3319336	But you have to admit that if it does come out that such and such game, let's say Assassin's Creed 4 or whatever...
3319836	3327522	runs at this particular speed on the PlayStation 4, but the performance is five less frames a second on Xbox One.
3327883	3332086	That's going to get out on the Internet, and it's not going to make Microsoft look good.
3332526	3335509	In a way, that happened to Sony in the last generation, didn't it?
3335529	3347278	Because I seem to remember with Oblivion especially, and I know I'm going way back, there was a lot of problems with PlayStation 3, and that was all over the Internet, and a lot of that was blamed on the Blu-ray drive, if I remember right.
3347358	3350200	Well, there was Oblivion, Skyrim had issues.
3350240	3352982	There's a lot of games that had issues on the PlayStation 3.
3353422	3354703	So, yeah.
3354904	3361849	You know, and that stuff does get reported on and tweeted about and Facebook messaged about and it all adds up to not looking so good.
3362009	3362209	Yeah.
3362429	3363670	So, yeah.
3363730	3368573	But I do agree at the end of the day, if the games are fun, that's the most important thing, which...
3369614	3391921	is what Nintendo is banking on in a big way because these games that are going to run at 30 frames a second and what have you on Xbox One and so forth aren't even going to be made for the Wii U. So Nintendo kind of has to bank on these games that are experiences that are only going to be on Nintendo because most of them are by Nintendo pushing that system through 2014.
3393741	3396223	Which Wonderful 101 came out today, did it not?
3396303	3398605	And I'm hearing some good things about that.
3398986	3400067	Still haven't played the demo.
3400167	3405191	I'm a bad fan, but blame all these other things like Kingdom Hearts taking away my attention for a minute.
3405752	3406913	I want to check it out at some point.
3408544	3408804	DarkSakura.com
3424083	3430307	And that is, well, we don't know specifically if it's taken from the Xbox idea, but it's a lot like it.
3430848	3439213	It's basically the Steam Family Sharing Program, which is very interesting because didn't we see something very similar to this?
3440634	3445240	At least described on the Xbox One when they first made their press announcement, right?
3446121	3453791	So what this is basically is if, say, I have a game installed, but you want to play it and you don't own it, I can authorize you to play it.
3455370	3480492	and then that way we can share the game but if I decide that I want to play it you get a few minutes to save your game or buy the game to continue playing it so it's a way to expose other people to a game like if I say Rob you really really have to play Fractal no I mean really you have to play Fractal I go here play Fractal and you can download it and play Fractal and then if I decide that I want to play it which literally might happen because I don't believe I own that game yeah
3480772	3482972	And I can be like, no, Jamie, Rogue Legacy.
3483172	3485093	It's like Castlevania, but fun.
3485413	3487253	Well, I mean, Castlevania's fun, but you know what I mean.
3487273	3488974	It's an indie Castlevania that's a lot of fun.
3489014	3489914	You need to check this game out.
3489934	3491414	And I can be like, here, go play this.
3491814	3499555	And I will have to figure out if I have any space left with all the other Steam games on my system, because I have almost filled up 500 gigabytes with games.
3500276	3500756	It's scary.
3501396	3503676	I probably should uninstall WoW now that I think about it.
3504616	3507557	But at any rate, you know, it's...
3508417	3510338	I can say, here, play Fractal.
3511218	3518580	And you can say that you have gotten into Fractal, and I was like, you know, I want to play, I want to try to beat my game now, so I want to log in.
3519081	3523342	Well, you have the option then to stop playing the game, and it'll save your progress.
3523902	3529324	Or, you know, if you can be like, well, you know what, I'm at level 10, and I really like this game, I'm going to buy it.
3529904	3532405	Then you can buy it and keep playing, and I can go back to playing my game.
3533085	3535408	and I never have to walk into a GameStop.
3535448	3537289	I don't have to hand anybody cash.
3537650	3542254	I just click that little button that says drain all the imaginary money from my bank account.
3542995	3543495	Exactly.
3543736	3552604	And the thing with this too is that like at my house, Dan didn't have a Steam account for a while and now he has it for mostly his racing games.
3553124	3554386	And we play Borderlands together.
3555066	3556868	But say that
3558800	3566745	He wanted to try out, like, I just bought that, oh yeah, there's another game I didn't talk about playing is that I played Duke Nukem 3D.
3567126	3570088	Because I bought the indie shooting thing.
3570748	3576272	But say that, you know, Dan wants to sit and play Duke Nukem 3D and I'm not playing it.
3576712	3578493	I can just go, okay, you're authorized on yours, here you go.
3579474	3583937	And, you know, given that we're in the same house, you know, it doesn't really matter.
3585558	3587719	I don't have to log out of my account for him to play my games.
3588900	3591642	But if you want to play your games, then he's going to get kicked out.
3592342	3594203	It sounds like a different game.
3594803	3597024	Oh, I always thought that, oh, okay.
3597064	3600626	The way that I understood it is that it's just authorization on that game.
3601006	3603788	It's on all your games, your entire library.
3604268	3612272	So if you play any game, if you're playing Duke Nukem 3D or something like that, and he's playing Borderlands, on your account, he will get kicked out of Borderlands.
3612312	3613873	Then while I'm at school, you know.
3613893	3616995	Or while you're playing Final Fantasy XIV, which isn't in your Steam library or something like that.
3617075	3617295	Yeah.
3617495	3621498	I mean, the only reason I linked it into my Steam is not one of my Steam games.
3621618	3625801	I just run it through Steam to screen cap, which by the way, they booted that out for the record.
3625941	3626282	Oh, wow.
3626442	3628603	Yeah, so I haven't been able to do my screen caps through Steam.
3629044	3629564	Well, that sucks.
3629664	3633727	Well, I also haven't been able to do my Mass Effect 3 screen caps through Steam either.
3634348	3634728	That's weird.
3635048	3635749	But I can for two.
3636650	3643796	Well, it's very easy to take screenshots in Final Fantasy XIV, but granted, I get that you can't post them or do the cloud or your captions.
3643816	3647339	Well, no, you can't take screencaps during cinematics.
3649040	3649421	Oh, got it.
3649441	3652243	And that's what I was using Steam for, was taking screencaps during cinematics.
3652263	3652623	Tricky, tricky.
3652643	3653364	Okay, I gotcha.
3653384	3654005	I gotcha.
3654525	3655926	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3680605	3687607	One person at a time in your library, and that person locks your library, including from you, basically.
3688587	3700390	But you can take control back of your library at any time, but it will prevent that person from playing that game any further outside of 120 seconds or whatever to wrap it up and save or buy the game and keep going.
3700410	3701050	Yeah.
3701570	3706918	and I think it's a good feature and I think that they're handling it in a very intelligent manner.
3707699	3717833	Even if it's completely lacking at your account, like you said, what if I'm playing Final Fantasy and Dan wants to try out one of the other games I have or play through some, because I've got the whole Doom set and all the old school games.
3718574	3719994	If Dan wants to play through it, that's fine.
3720034	3724575	If I have a friend who wants to play Loom because she can't get her CD to work, I can say, oh, just play on mine.
3724615	3725796	Here, you're authorized.
3727456	3728556	I think it works very well.
3729216	3736158	Or, you know, what other... I got another game on... What if I wanted a friend of mine to play Mass Effect, the very first one?
3736598	3738619	I can be like, okay, because mine was a Steam version.
3738939	3740059	Here, you can play on my account.
3740679	3741699	Here's a text mod thing.
3741759	3743080	Here's how to do all this crap.
3743700	3744620	You know, and...
3746593	3776046	I think it would be just fine I think that it's a very good opportunity I think that it's better than demos because people are having access to the full version of the game the moment they get into a game and they're inconvenienced about playing the game when you want your game back that's going to give them even more encouragement to buy the game
3778479	3780581	Don't you think?
3780601	3787327	Yeah, I think it's a great idea where developers will kind of be able to get their game demos out there.
3787707	3789249	It's essentially kind of a demo in a way.
3789529	3790690	Kind of.
3791751	3798417	Hypothetically, I could probably borrow one of your little games while you're out of town for a week or something and probably beat it in that time frame, but
3798917	3809701	Those cases are probably going to be less common than the cases where somebody is playing this epic RPG and can't finish because you want to be able to play your games so they have to buy it to finish it.
3809721	3812302	For example, if I wanted you to play Little Inferno.
3812322	3812903	You don't have it, do you?
3816781	3817602	I don't think so, no.
3833156	3833756	What's the problem?
3834116	3838759	SS2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I just wonder how it will work with MMOs like DC Universe Online.
3838799	3840840	Will people be able to play on another person's account?
3840940	3841321	You can't.
3841341	3842882	It's free anyway, so why?
3843802	3844082	Yeah.
3845123	3851327	Anything that has like extra serial numbers or like basically MMOs and online games aren't going to apply.
3851347	3853729	It's anything that requires like you play, you can't do it.
3853809	3856430	If you can't, if Games for Windows Live, you can't do it.
3856570	3857491	MMOs, you can't do it.
3857571	3858552	That's pretty much it.
3858572	3858752	Yeah.
3859292	3864275	Stuff that requires an additional serial, like, for example, you can't, you know, play online, like you mentioned, you need a code for that.
3864835	3866076	So, yeah, those don't work.
3866797	3868438	I still, I'm looking forward to it.
3868538	3877123	Now, we're going to talk about this probably a little later in the show when we get into the Fugo Question of the Week, so if you haven't answered it yet, you might want to go answer it, because we're going to read these a little later, but...
3877543	3878564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3899043	3903266	I'll get into that a little later, but we want to know what you think, and there's no right or wrong answer.
3903906	3905828	So go answer our Fugle Question of the Week if you haven't yet.
3905848	3909130	We're going to get into those a little bit later in the game, or in the show.
3910091	3912172	For now, let's go on with some more news.
3912472	3912732	One thing.
3913153	3916235	I would like to repeat what Spike said in the chat room.
3916435	3917315	Yeah.
3917335	3922979	The information released indicated that games that require their own keys and accounts would not be shareable.
3923239	3923399	Yeah.
3923820	3923980	So...
3925925	3928646	All right, so something coming out of Kickstarter.
3929186	3936589	You'll be seeing a lot of these old game resurgences, and one of which is River City Ransom Underground.
3936829	3946173	It's an officially licensed sequel to River City Ransom done in kind of the 8-bit style of River City Ransom.
3946853	3964160	and they kind of took like the 8-bit graphics and obviously added more color to them and stuff but it's in the same style and they're seeking $180,000 Canadian by October 9th and they'll probably make it.
3964300	3965261	It looks awesome.
3965801	3972584	Right now they're at about a third of the way and it's only been seven days and it looks pretty sweet.
3973924	3974524	I looked at it.
3974584	3975765	I almost put some money on it.
3977463	3989587	I'm kind of with Loki, though, where it's like... It's got to be a really good Kickstarter at this point for me to jump on beforehand because there's just too much out there now where it's like, I don't want to buy all these games I'm not going to see for a year.
3989607	3990267	Yeah, exactly.
3990327	3993268	This is expected out September 2014.
3994008	3997109	And you know they always get... Nothing ever comes out on time.
3997229	3998669	So, like, you know, 2015 or end of 2014, it's like...
4002070	4008696	I'd rather just keep my money now and then I'll buy it when it comes out if I have time for it.
4009897	4011238	I don't want to back anything.
4011258	4014600	Unless it's hardware that I'm pre-ordering like an Oculus Rift or something like that.
4015081	4015982	That's a little different.
4016442	4017703	But if it's a digital game, I'm...
4019304	4020685	I'll just buy it when it comes out.
4021086	4025450	I want an actual Kunio sequel, not branded under River City Ransom.
4025610	4030955	I loved going back and playing the PC Engine version of the hot-blooded downtown story.
4031916	4032777	It was fun.
4032817	4033557	It was quirky.
4033597	4035459	But is that really possible at this point?
4035499	4037581	Or is this really, you know, we're having to settle here?
4037881	4039443	I think it's having to settle, really.
4039563	4042966	But, I mean, that's just sort of like, eh, maybe not.
4044045	4052569	Well, yeah, and it's like I want to wish these guys well and good luck, and I love the idea, and I hope the game's great, but I'll see you when you come out.
4053009	4053189	Yeah.
4054270	4054450	Yeah.
4055090	4055370	All right.
4056051	4064254	Now, I might be tricked into kick-starting something like this if this were the way this game were to go because I did love me some Geometry Wars.
4064975	4068116	And Geometry Wars was really – I mean, let's be real.
4068216	4071297	Geometry Wars was like the best launch game on the Xbox 360.
4071338	4071418	Yeah.
4072418	4073299	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4098756	4099517	PhilSpencer
4125919	4146294	Who's right now the corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios Said on Twitter, take it or leave it Quote, I like Geometry Wars, great game from the old Bizarre Creations Activision picked up IP when they bought Bizarre Creations And then somebody followed up with a question like Would you work with Activision on a new game or buy the rights to it?
4146334	4154200	Spencer said, quote, oh I'll respond Let's just say as someone who worked on Project Gotham Racing I have a lot of love for Geometry Wars
4154600	4156341	Conversations have been had.
4157361	4159802	Oh, that was the tweet that drove everybody crazy.
4160322	4163403	Somebody's talking about it, bringing back Geometry Wars.
4163903	4169965	So I'm a little surprised that if something was going to happen, it hasn't already.
4171665	4177907	But do you think maybe this is something they're sitting on until the Xbox One or the inevitable next Project Gotham Racing game?
4177927	4179208	It would be a nice launch title.
4179628	4181308	I just don't think it's going to be a launch title.
4181408	4183049	Well, no, we'd know about it by now if it was.
4184113	4185655	Is there a Project Gotham?
4185775	4187939	No, there's not a Project Gotham at launch because there's a Forza, right?
4188019	4192485	They're going to have a conference or a presentation at Tokyo Game Show.
4193246	4193867	Microsoft.
4194027	4196751	That's ironic, but they're going to.
4200250	4200730	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4220951	4226676	So I don't know if that's hiring back some of the people who worked on it before, if they're not already happy somewhere else or what.
4226736	4236025	But don't just make another game with completely different people and then have it suck because we've seen that happen to other franchises and it's always depressing when that stuff happens.
4237546	4239968	Before we get into release dates, DarkSakura's got a story for us.
4240829	4245254	I do and it makes me kind of happy but kind of wary and sad at the same time.
4245995	4250741	It has to do with the next Mass Effect because we all love some Mass Effect here.
4250841	4253103	Well, at least two out of three of us like Mass Effect.
4253143	4254185	And two out of three ain't bad.
4254830	4255891	And two out of three are correct.
4256631	4260374	So they are calling it, at present, Mass Effect 4.
4261595	4263196	At least I guess that's their development name.
4264317	4268340	And there are a series of quotes out about that from Casey Hudson.
4268380	4275746	And he's saying that they're basically reworking the universe, going to make it new and
4276366	4293639	and that it's not going to be about Shepard but that it could be about people who were in the previous Mass Effect games so who knows you could be any one of the crew you could be the elusive man which why would anybody want to be him because he sucks
4294920	4295640	Chain Smoker.
4298201	4302842	But they were also saying that it was supposed to be a new fictional world.
4302922	4310784	So I don't know if it's supposed to be alternate universe, another story, just something else occurring within the established canon.
4311364	4320427	I personally want to see something less human-centric, but I know why they make it human-centric, because people will more easily get into the series.
4321527	4331612	And I'm actually, you know, part of me would like an MMO, but I would really rather have just another standalone game with, you know, the same awesome multiplayer that Mass Effect 3 had.
4332913	4333273	Don't you think?
4334969	4337412	Sorry, I only heard the first half of that.
4337452	4337812	My bad.
4339394	4340455	I'm multitasking.
4340475	4341036	Leave me alone.
4341196	4342358	No, you're single-tasking.
4346122	4349626	There have been some rumors about it being MMO-style.
4352830	4354692	That could be like Borderlands, though.
4354972	4367875	Yeah, I think it would be fun to play around in that universe, but I would still rather have a single-player game that has all the same cinematic... To quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, it's the best movie I've ever played.
4368915	4371676	And I would like another experience like that.
4371796	4384399	I would like to see more things about the other races, not have it just be human-centric, but understand that it was focused on humans because that would be what would get people more easily immersed in the game.
4385340	4388825	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, how about Garrus as the main character for Mass Effect 4?
4389346	4389886	Totally.
4390127	4391388	That would make the fandom happy.
4391629	4393151	I would totally play Garrus the game.
4393291	4396375	I thought Bioware was trying to get away from that universe, though.
4397076	4400040	I mean, that whole story in Shepard's crew and all that.
4400080	4403244	I thought they were trying to do something completely different.
4403544	4404604	But there'd be plenty.
4405025	4413087	I mean, I still think that there would be plenty to go on in a post-Reap Apocalypse world or universe or galaxy.
4413107	4414168	I should say galaxy.
4414748	4420610	SSJ100Matt says, so would this next game be the Star Trek Voyager to Mass Effect 1 through 3 Star Trek Next Generation?
4422970	4424431	I don't know because Voyager was shit.
4424784	4431528	Hey, I liked Voyager, so I'm going to say hopefully, although apparently it will divide the fandom epically if that happens.
4432009	4432449	So we'll see.
4432749	4437772	All right, let's travel around the universe and check out release dates coming to a planet near you, starting with the US.
4437832	4438092	Loki.
4439333	4442035	There's Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver.
4442295	4448599	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and who gives a shit?
4449159	4451881	And I think maybe Wii U. I don't know.
4452361	4452922	Who cares?
4454102	4456885	There's also some stupid karaoke game, you know, Wii.
4457505	4459487	Wii Sing 80s or something like that.
4459547	4460167	That's on the Wii.
4461088	4467713	And, you know, the only game you really should get this week, Grand Theft Auto V. That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4467893	4470815	So there you go, Grand Theft Auto V. Your shopping's done.
4471235	4471536	Buy it.
4471836	4472556	Comes out tomorrow.
4473097	4473857	Or, not tomorrow.
4474038	4475659	You're not biased at all.
4478206	4479287	Oh, I'm not biased.
4479888	4485635	Hot Wheels World's Best Driver, a game based off a YouTube series that has no Hot Wheel cars in it.
4485695	4489901	It's just about fucking rally driving with a really stupid premise built in.
4489921	4491162	Like, oh, we have all these teams.
4491202	4492444	We're telling them to do this...
4493445	4496626	Strategic Driving, which is like a really short course anyways.
4497266	4502068	And then we have a karaoke title that they imported from the UK that's just lame on a Wii system.
4502268	4505049	And then you have Grand Theft Auto, the game that's going to get perfect interviews.
4505249	4506570	I don't think you're going to see perfect interviews.
4506590	4507870	You're so easily wound up.
4507910	4508991	You're so easily wound up.
4509051	4509391	I love it.
4509451	4509691	All right.
4510191	4514152	Going to Japan, since unfortunately no Grand Theft Auto V in Japan this week.
4514833	4516473	Do they get Grand Theft Auto V at some point?
4516653	4517013	Eventually.
4517373	4526557	Alright, so instead, on the PlayStation 3 this week, you have Fairy Fencer F to look forward to over there, and I don't think they are actual fairies, just so you know.
4526597	4528377	It looks like one of those epic RPGs.
4529157	4534459	Actually, it looks kind of cool, and it's by Compile, although I know the Compile of today is not the same as the Compile of yesterday.
4535460	4536600	Compile Heart, excuse me.
4537113	4556863	but we can still give them a little love that's right we can that game does look kind of neat so you got that coming out this week regular and limited edition Phantom Breaker Extra also in regular and limited edition on the Xbox excuse me on the PlayStation 3 this week and that Phantom Phantom Breaker is a fighting game with chicks and sailor suits
4558838	4567385	Going on to the Xbox 360 because it is still chugging along over there for the loyal supporters in Japan.
4567485	4571989	On the Xbox 360 this week, Alan Wake gets a price reduction.
4572109	4576193	Halo 3 gets a price reduction including Halo 3 ODST, Halo Reach, Halo Wars.
4576793	4583858	and then the Phantom Breaker Extra game I mentioned earlier is also coming out this week on the Xbox 360.
4584238	4589862	There's also a couple new Xbox console packs themselves, a 250GB one and a 4GB one that also includes Kinect.
4593084	4597745	So, I guess a soft launch, if you will, of the Xbox 360 and some new SKUs.
4598545	4599125	Hope they're cheap.
4599786	4611248	On the PlayStation Vita this week in Japan, Yahari Game Demo Ore no Saishin Love Kome wa Machigateru comes out this week in regular and limited edition.
4611508	4613468	I'm just trying to see quickly what this game is all about.
4615989	4619190	This one is, this is a dating sim, totally a dating sim.
4620498	4623800	Yep, totally a dating sim, but you know, everything you expect.
4624421	4629084	Beach outfits, notes written on notepaper, all that stuff.
4629965	4633067	Quickly checking the Nintendo platforms to see what we have to look forward to there.
4633507	4635549	Unfortunately, nothing on the Wii U this week.
4635569	4638251	They don't have any releases until the 26th of September.
4638931	4641353	But on the 3DS this week, a little more to choose from.
4641773	4649997	Jewel Master, Nobunaga Noyabu, also Sango Kushi comes out this week, all on the Nintendo 3DS.
4650837	4651838	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4652964	4653704	There's some stuff.
4654264	4655445	God, if it'll ever load.
4655505	4655865	Thank you.
4656405	4660486	Okay, so, on the 17th, we have Grand Theft Auto V in the UK.
4661126	4663707	On the 19th, Angry Birds Star Wars 2.
4664948	4666388	And what the hell just happened to my thing?
4666428	4671509	Okay, and on the 20th, we have Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which, ew, snails.
4672970	4673330	That's it.
4674793	4677496	Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.
4677576	4677836	Loki.
4678156	4680759	They're not just snails, they're snails on Nos, okay?
4681820	4686564	No, that is like my big phobia, are mollusks of that nature.
4687148	4689690	Yeah, it's even better when they moved at turbo speed.
4689710	4691371	They can just... No, no, no, no.
4691391	4692892	La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
4693573	4694573	Alright.
4694713	4696695	Okay, so this is kind of interesting.
4696715	4699537	You know, here we thought that this channel was just done for.
4699857	4703179	They put the bullet into it and it was just done.
4703720	4708883	But up from the grave like a zombie rises G4, a husk of...
4710004	4717369	Well, pretty much nothing at this point because they fired all their staff, so G4 will no longer become the Esquire Network.
4717429	4725254	Instead, that wonderful title goes to Style Channel now is going to be the Esquire Channel.
4725274	4727175	But what's going to happen to Bill and Juliana?
4727896	4729137	Here's the thing about Style, though.
4729237	4732479	Style was like a totally different demographic, I think, than the Esquire Channel.
4732499	4734500	Wasn't that focused more like women and stuff?
4734520	4735781	And now it's like, oh, Men Channel.
4736454	4737395	Well, here's the thing.
4737435	4738355	It was in more homes.
4738555	4745280	And I think at the end of the day, that's what they're trying to do is they're going to push the Esquire Network on a channel that's in more homes.
4746040	4749263	I don't think this is about they suddenly wanted to give G4 a reprieve.
4749943	4751984	G4 is like a lame duck network now.
4752405	4755507	I mean, what the hell do you do with G4?
4756127	4757828	How do you solve a problem like the G4 Network?
4775183	4777046	Does that mean we're still gonna have G4 at E3?
4777086	4779529	Because, you know, that's... No, no, that's not gonna happen.
4779669	4783914	And BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, G4 died in 2004.
4784014	4784515	End of story.
4784995	4789261	And for all practical purposes, I think we banned all talk of this network in the future on the show.
4789661	4792345	However, I'm entertaining it tonight because...
4792945	4801331	You know, it is interesting to think, like, well, I mean, even though I think, you know, this network is damned, it's done for.
4801851	4804853	I would have been more interested if they said, tech TV's coming back.
4804873	4812838	Well, is it possible that maybe they'll try to launch the network with this space that maybe should have been?
4812878	4813379	I mean, that's gonna...
4814139	4817601	That's going to mean an investment or somebody's going to have to come in and buy it.
4817641	4819262	And I don't really know if that's going to happen.
4819342	4822424	But it is interesting that they have all this space and nothing to do with it.
4822464	4826567	You would think that they're going to try to repackage it and launch it as something.
4827087	4829469	And that might entail additional content.
4829509	4832711	You bring back Leo Laporte and Patrick Norton on screensavers.
4833431	4835293	I'll sign up for cable and watch that shit.
4835373	4843659	But until then, I don't give a shit about reruns of... Just pay those Twit guys in Petaluma to be on basic cable.
4843859	4844580	Hell yeah.
4844880	4846481	If they want that, they probably don't.
4850785	4851385	They've moved on.
4851585	4852366	Everyone's moved on.
4852406	4853167	Everyone's moved on.
4854167	4862134	It's nice to... I'm just saying, just saying, not that, you know, we love doing OLR and, you know, we're all getting to be in our mid-30s, but we're available.
4863675	4889678	We'd be cheap too Exactly, I said I will sell out in a second You don't understand I'll take a paycheck I don't care I'll introduce videos of cheaters if you want me to quip about something I don't care what you want Hey, this episode of Cops is classic We've got this druggie guy He tries to jump over the fence but a dog grabs him in the ass That's hilarious, let's watch that clip
4889998	4898385	And I'll introduce things too, like, okay y'all, this is that episode of Cops where they try to arrest the drag queen and he's all, excuse my beauty.
4898766	4900507	So, don't change the channel.
4901188	4901668	Or you're rude.
4901768	4902189	This would be me.
4903470	4904150	Here's some shit.
4905171	4905652	Watch it.
4906492	4906933	I don't care.
4907113	4914139	No, you would be like Dr. Claw where you would only allow your arm to be shot on video while you're petting Midna.
4914159	4915500	No, while I'm petting Midna.
4915740	4918284	While trying to get Midna to sit freaking still.
4918404	4921569	Well, wasn't that an enthusiastic episode of Campus PD?
4922029	4926916	Up next, Cheaters, followed by a rerun of MacGyver.
4927217	4929100	No, Rob, do you know what I would be?
4929200	4930241	I would be the Kennedy.
4931537	4933038	Remember the MTV days.
4933098	4933858	I liked Kennedy.
4934078	4934818	She was awesome.
4935218	4941020	Remember the, I got voted the least loved VJ and she had the tiara and everything.
4941100	4945922	Do you want to know a story that not a lot of people know that has to do with Kennedy?
4946102	4946382	Tell me.
4946602	4948122	I don't know if I should admit this on the air.
4948142	4948382	Do it.
4948662	4953604	Okay, so like many years ago when I was in high school, I was probably like a senior in high school, so it was a long time ago, right?
4953764	4955204	It would have been 96, right?
4956105	4959986	There used to be this show on the radio that I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of called Loveline.
4960866	4964029	and Loveline back in the day had Adam Carolla, right?
4964389	4966932	And Dr. Drew, which I think he still does.
4966952	4967993	I think Dr. Drew still does it.
4968013	4968413	Yeah, he does it.
4968633	4970335	I think so, amongst all the other stuff he does.
4970775	4979042	Well, I called in one night and I called in because Kennedy was the guest and I just wanted to talk to Kennedy.
4979402	4985368	So I think I asked, I don't even remember what it is I asked all these years later, but I was on an episode of Loveline
4986288	4990593	And I think it was something like, what's your advice to somebody who's trying to get into business?
4990613	4997300	Because at that time, I was thinking that I was going to go into broadcast journalism and all this stuff in college, and that's the type of stuff I really wanted to do.
4997360	4999202	I wanted to do that type of radio stuff.
5000659	5002080	Look where I ended up.
5002820	5004761	Thanks, Kennedy, for your shitty advice.
5004781	5006901	I wonder what happened to her.
5007862	5009362	I'm sure she's still around and doing all that.
5009382	5011743	I think she did political stuff later on.
5011783	5017065	But anyway, she said, and it's really funny because they had to dump this from the air.
5017465	5020466	She said, well, don't work for the guy in Bleep.
5020886	5021886	That guy's a dick.
5022327	5024968	And Adam Carolla goes, we're on in that station, you idiot.
5025028	5026728	So they had to dump that from the airwaves.
5027068	5028649	So if you want to know what town she said...
5029409	5029930	Portland.
5030150	5031211	Don't work in Portland.
5032713	5034335	So that's the advice I got.
5034375	5034835	So yes.
5035496	5036537	And now we know.
5036898	5041122	I was on Loveline when I was 18 or something like that.
5041283	5041923	So there you go.
5042924	5045167	Sorry, no juicy relationship questions for you.
5046067	5048910	Lisa Kennedy Montgomery You know what?
5048930	5049490	I'm 35 and awesome
5068158	5069560	Yeah, well, I'm 37 in a row.
5090302	5092184	Well, this finally is coming out.
5092244	5097569	It's in the same universe as Final Fantasy Type-0, which was a PSP game in Japan.
5098230	5099652	And it's in that same universe.
5099692	5105778	It's going to be a free-to-play app for iOS and Android, which means you'll probably get to play the first part for free and then you're going to have to buy everything.
5106758	5110120	The play will be divided between solo play and team play.
5111040	5116743	There will be missions based around individual characters, and there'll be bosses that you fight as team play.
5116783	5121305	We don't know what release day this is, but it is something that will come out soon.
5122745	5125046	Speaking of Square Enix, I just wanted to do a quick follow-up.
5125166	5135648	Last week we talked about Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, and it was suggested this could be a sequel to Theatrhythm, and I was sitting here going, no, it's probably just like a year-end edition that's going to package everything together.
5135729	5137429	Well, I was wrong.
5137729	5138349	Go figure.
5139309	5146851	Final Fantasy Curtain Call, or Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, it will be coming to the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 at some point.
5146911	5148872	It will be in Japan in spring.
5149692	5154614	200 plus tracks, 60 plus characters, and a versus battle mode.
5154934	5162697	They say songs from Final Fantasy XIV as well as Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII-3, are some of the games featured in that.
5162757	5166318	So it sounds like it's going to be even bigger and better.
5167905	5174509	200 tracks is a lot of tracks, but when it's all music from your own company, that shouldn't be too difficult to put together.
5175029	5177751	I wonder if it'll just have all the regular tracks from Theatrhythm 1.
5178351	5179632	That would be interesting if they went that way.
5180813	5185196	All right, well, let's go back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.
5185216	5185716	Here we go.
5186826	5189367	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5189387	5194708	The classic game of the week is Valus the Phantasm Soldier, or as it was called, Mugen Senshi Varisu in Japan.
5211659	5218184	It was the first game in the Valis series, and it originally came out on the MSX and PC-88 home computers in 1986.
5219324	5232833	And then later on, there was a Famicom version, and then there was a Sega Mega Drive version, which I'm sure is the one that most people remember, either the Mega Drive version or the re-release that came out on PC Engine CD or Turbo Duo CD.
5233753	5247675	so um the game is basically a side-scrolling platformer you are a girl in a school uniform with a sword beating shit up and then you know later on she gets all magical outfits and everything
5249262	5263132	But the big part with this game is that it was one of the first Magical Girl games that, well, kind of Magical Girl games that came out that got a US release and was really popular.
5264733	5269536	Now, the interesting thing about this is that the Famicom version was absolutely different from the game.
5270071	5281397	It had the same plot of the game, but it basically was more of a maze-style game with different paths, so it's supposed to be a lot harder.
5281817	5288721	For the Mega Drive game, it was pretty much side-scrolling, D-pad, hack, slash, slide, jump, swing your sword, that type of thing.
5288821	5290281	And you did have magic attacks.
5291882	5296365	There was a promotional video that came out with the game's release, but...
5298416	5299158	It's hard to find.
5299198	5300402	I don't think you can find it anywhere.
5300522	5302487	However, the entire thing is on YouTube.
5303550	5303831	So...
5306288	5318653	Now with Valus, if anyone does want the PC Engine version, or I should say the PC Duo or Turbo Duo version, it actually comes with a Valus 1 and 2 collection.
5319274	5321455	So you get two games for the price of one.
5321815	5327697	But this is one of the classic RPGs that came out on Sega Systems.
5327877	5329118	So definitely get it.
5331638	5334260	Valis to defend the earth and the spirit world and the dream world
5355356	5366071	I'm looking at some of these later stages now Yeah, and there were more sequels I mean, we had Valus 2, Valus 3, Valus 4 I think I played one of the later Valus games I seem to remember Valus 3 and 4 I think I played one of those
5366656	5368899	Yeah, and I'm trying to remember.
5368919	5370921	Let me see what it was that Valus 4 came out on.
5370941	5372463	Valus was also on the NES.
5372503	5373704	I'm looking at this related thing.
5373744	5376528	That's what I'm saying, the Famicom version, but it was more of a maze game.
5376868	5378049	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5378290	5386199	Valus 4 was on the Super Nintendo, or as it was known in Japan as a...
5389153	5397196	No, it was actually called it in America too, Super Valus 4, which was on the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.
5397957	5403759	Valus 3 did come out on PC Engine because I do have that game.
5404219	5416304	And with Valus 3 is basically you play as Yuko, but she has a couple other characters that are there named Valma and a warrior named Cham who are also in the game.
5418007	5421410	But I might cover the later Valis games at another time.
5421570	5425712	But it has to start somewhere, so going with the first Valis is pretty safe.
5425752	5428754	DungeonBuster in our chatroom says, I played Valis 3 on the Genesis.
5428794	5430195	I think that's one of the ones I played too.
5430235	5432156	I think I played a later one because a friend of mine had it.
5432477	5435539	But still, it's nice to know where those games came from, right?
5435719	5436419	Well, there was a...
5442760	5443560	What was I trying to think?
5443580	5445361	Because I think it had a different release.
5445421	5451863	I don't think... Was this one ever released on Wii?
5452863	5453903	I don't think it had a Wii release.
5454163	5455224	I don't think it was.
5456144	5457584	Because this would have been perfect.
5457824	5458565	Yeah.
5458665	5463586	The Dallas 1 and 2 set for PC Engine would have been a perfect Wii store release.
5465014	5465695	Well, you never know.
5465735	5468957	There's always time on the Wii U virtual console, so you'll see.
5469557	5471359	As long as it still has life in it.
5472239	5473340	Alright, there it is.
5473360	5475241	Your classic game of the week.
5475882	5478304	Valus, the Phantasm Soldier.
5479144	5480986	Alrighty, let's do a music break, guys.
5481026	5483527	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5483547	5484928	We have some rapid-fire news for you guys.
5484948	5486389	The Fugle Question of the Week and...
5487310	5516324	because we haven't done it in a little while we're going to do a listless tonight we've got listless on deck for tonight because it's been a while we will have a special guest calling in to help us with that so stay tuned guys so you too can participate and play along here at the Voice of Geeks Network because remember we have our new fancy little Bobby Blackwolf programmed listless game thing so get your butt over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play listless with us tonight coming up when Orange Lounge Radio resumes here right after this
5523226	5526329	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5526429	5527369	We are live.
5527429	5530732	Episode 519 already in progress here at VOG Network.
5531513	5533634	September the 15th, 2013.
5533735	5535716	Boy, this year is almost over.
5535876	5542382	But it is my favorite time of year right now because that is when pumpkin all the things come out at all the various stores.
5542902	5543522	Very happy.
5543542	5545484	I'm not just talking about pumpkin spice lattes.
5545504	5546064	Don't get me wrong.
5546084	5546805	Those are really good.
5547265	5550988	Although one of the other coffee stores has a maple that's really good, too.
5551069	5551929	But I love pumpkin.
5552089	5552610	I love pumpkin.
5552970	5553331	Pumpkin Muffin
5559488	5565830	Alan and I at Target the other day got pumpkin waffles because I guess that's like a season thing now that Ago does like seasonal waffles.
5566330	5572711	But I was very happy because Noah's not only does pumpkin bagels this year, they have a pumpkin walnut bagel that is real good.
5572771	5574191	It's like eating dessert for breakfast.
5574211	5577512	You know what we need to do one day when it's an I Can Eat Week day?
5577632	5577832	Yeah.
5578052	5579032	We need to go to Coco's.
5580012	5580292	Okay.
5580373	5584773	And get their pumpkin pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream.
5585053	5586214	Oh, it's going to be that time of year.
5586374	5587274	IHOP soon too.
5587294	5587374	Yeah.
5588817	5590058	Pumpkin all the things.
5590078	5590838	Pumpkin all the things.
5590938	5591218	All right.
5592379	5602986	During that break, which I know you guys don't get to hear it on the podcast, but we play some songs for the live listeners while we take a quick break to rest our voices, refill our drinks and so forth, use the restroom.
5604046	5607288	During that break, Loki picked one of the songs tonight that we heard tonight.
5607308	5607669	What was that?
5608329	5612852	It was a parody of Prince Ali from Aladdin called DLC.
5612872	5614353	That was so stupid.
5614373	5614453	Yeah.
5615731	5616092	Sorry.
5616152	5617093	You know how to pick them.
5617574	5618395	I was sure dumb.
5618495	5619256	I thought it was funny.
5619396	5619676	All right.
5620898	5624883	But what was awesome was the Grand Theft Auto V you were playing during the break.
5624924	5626726	You ran over there real quick and turned it on.
5626846	5629790	You were able to show me the little roller coaster sequence on the pier.
5629810	5630631	That looked pretty cool.
5630771	5630992	Yeah.
5631292	5639154	I was trying to dive into the water too, but unfortunately I picked the spot that was too shallow, and so I dived in the water and smacked my head on the ground.
5639174	5640095	I did get to see you in the water.
5640375	5643016	It was something.
5643756	5656200	Anyhow, we are going to do a few rapid-fire news stories here, and then the Fugo Question of the Week coming up, and then Listless before too long, so I know you guys are excited for that, and you can play along with us if you are here live.
5656240	5660381	I'm sorry, podcast listeners, we don't have a way you guys can participate with us yet.
5661101	5666663	That's a 2.0 upgrade later on, or more like 3.0 at this point.
5667023	5669664	Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with rapid fire news.
5669964	5680187	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Humble Bundle 9, which I had to buy because unfortunately I am addicted to buying Humble Bundles.
5680207	5684729	I am totally addicted to buying Humble Bundles, and I bought this one too the day it was announced.
5685189	5697235	So it came with some wonderful games, including Fez, Market the Ninja, also Brutal Legends, Trying To, and Faster Than Light.
5699176	5700837	Of course, that's just the initial offering.
5702357	5707840	Oh, and Eats Munchies, I guess that's the sequel, and that's going to be in beta.
5708340	5713947	Faster and Light and Fez of course are if you beat the average which is only $4.59 right now.
5714107	5715249	It actually went down in price.
5718012	5722117	I know I have to give away a copy of Mark and the Ninja at some point because I already have that game.
5723158	5725100	I'm surprised they don't have Brutal Legend yet.
5727463	5728263	The other ones I did not.
5728504	5734086	And of course they will be adding more games probably closer towards the end of the pay period there.
5734126	5735067	So another nine days.
5735087	5738928	So probably announcing some more games by the end of the week maybe.
5740809	5741510	So we're checking out.
5744091	5750594	And to go along with Grand Theft Auto V, they have this wonderful fake website that they made called...
5752186	5755828	I see, I called it LifeStalker, it was LifeInvader.
5755948	5756328	Still funny.
5756608	5757289	Close enough.
5757549	5760690	But what's kind of cool about LifeInvader is it's actually a real website you can visit.
5760731	5767134	So LifeInvader.com, you can go stalk a bunch of people on there, just like following them, I guess.
5767874	5779160	And what's kind of cool though is it ties in with your Rockstar Social Club account and you can stalk different businesses and it actually gives you in-game discounts and perks that way.
5779460	5779660	Nice.
5779700	5782501	So it's kind of a cool little thing that they had to do.
5782601	5784562	And of course, you know, it plays a part in the game.
5784862	5787203	And Rockstar is taking advantage of the cloud.
5787624	5789024	I noticed that when you booted up the game.
5789064	5794787	There's a special little icon for when Rockstar is uploading info to the cloud so they can do things like this where you do something on the internet and it impacts your game.
5794807	5808533	Well, that's also going to be mainly for the multiplayer portion when that's going to... with Grand Theft Auto Online because there's a way you can quick switch between the characters and the fourth quick switch option is your multiplayer characters.
5808573	5808693	So...
5809233	5811975	It's going to be, you know, you'll be able to jump into it right away.
5812535	5821299	Jumping back to your previous topic real quick, because we have a good question here from Robert M in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Hey, are Humble Bundle games win Mac Linux still?
5821620	5824321	I'm sure there's no Mark of the Ninja or Fez on Mac and Linux.
5824681	5827963	Didn't I read somewhere that Fez was making its Linux debut with this Humble Bundle?
5828463	5832625	Usually we'll say which platforms they're on.
5832785	5835706	Sometimes the Humble Bundles aren't on all platforms.
5836186	5837127	Sometimes they are.
5837687	5838287	It depends.
5839528	5843770	In this case, I believe, let's see here, for Fez...
5845311	5849295	It is making its Mac and Linux debut.
5849356	5851258	There you go.
5851358	5853520	Mark of the Ninja is making its Mac and Linux debut.
5854602	5857545	These new platforms are debuting with this Humble Bundle.
5857565	5857966	That's awesome.
5857986	5860809	Trine 2 is not Linux, but it is Mac.
5862651	5867555	You usually just watch the video and it should clarify which games are and are not.
5867915	5874320	And sometimes it will also clarify what platforms they're on.
5874340	5877582	For example, the Origin bundle I don't think was Linux.
5877963	5880364	And there's been some other ones that have not been Linux.
5880825	5882886	Well, good question from the chatroom, so I wanted to clarify that.
5882926	5884708	And you also get soundtracks, by the way, too.
5884728	5884868	Yeah.
5886947	5914754	Um, alright, and then, uh, on top of that, let's see, so, there was also another announcement this week, uh, you know, of course, Apple doing their announcements of the new iPhones and stuff, so the iPhone 5S is gonna be the brand new iPhone, and along with that, you're gonna get Infinity Blade 3, which is gonna launch September 20th, and is even more amazing because now they have, you know, the wonderful, um, graphics chips and stuff like that in the new phone, so...
5916431	5916971	Thanks for watching!
5935134	5940876	Which I'm not, but it's not enough of an upgrade and I'm already locked in a two-year contract with my current phone.
5940936	5947599	But if I was up for renewal, I probably would be going to the 5S because I didn't have a 5 yet, I would assume.
5947759	5948079	Uh-oh.
5948299	5952341	Ah, it's one of these stupid pages I'm on.
5952361	5953722	It has an autoplay something something.
5953742	5954302	Sorry about that.
5955262	5958184	It made your comment that much more dramatic.
5972032	5972072	E.G.
5972152	5974354	Anuma, Legend of Zelda Series Producer, was questioned by IGN about it.
5974374	5974474	Quote,
6000450	6004392	It's really up to them if we want to interpret my laughter as, yeah, we're making it, or no, we're not.
6004532	6005632	I guess that's really up to them.
6006693	6012295	I didn't read Jack shit into that, but some people are clinging to that as, oh, it could be information about a new Majora's Mask.
6012415	6014896	Would it have been different if he said, I sharted?
6015336	6019478	Don't read into that as like, I'm just going to make the game.
6019718	6021218	There's a little bit of poo.
6024079	6025400	That doesn't mean it's bad poo.
6027389	6029170	Anyway, moving on.
6030011	6035234	Stories about DJ Max Technica Q is something... Oh, I know what that is.
6035254	6036054	It's more epic!
6036574	6037175	It's that site.
6037195	6040957	I think that site was... All right, so I'll try to summarize it for you guys from what I remember.
6040997	6044119	DJ Max Technica Q, it was announced for iOS and Android.
6045099	6046800	That was pretty much the big thing, right?
6046840	6054865	Which is interesting because DJ Max, they had the PS Vita version that I liked, and I thought it did well, but I guess not well enough to necessitate future games.
6055865	6056265	That's sad.
6056305	6058226	Because I don't think they're making any more on the PS Vita.
6058606	6060487	Did that come out over here?
6060507	6064229	Or was that one of those things you had to import?
6064329	6065129	No, it did come out here.
6065709	6067770	I think it was only available on the store.
6068230	6071672	No, you could get it through Amazon in really limited quantities.
6073735	6074856	Star Trek Pinball
6096406	6100672	It will have to do with the reboots, so if you're not a big fan of those, you might be disappointed.
6100952	6102955	But it will use elements from the reboot movies.
6103015	6104938	It's not strictly based off one or the other.
6105638	6106319	That's too bad.
6106339	6112528	I thought for a second there that we'd see Jean-Luc Picard teaching us about the quadruple take.
6112608	6115629	Dan has a friend who buys all the Stern Tables when they come out, so I'm sure I will get to see it.
6115729	6115989	Excellent.
6130294	6153310	he's got the limited edition Tron table which oh my god it has like this frosted glass top on it nice oh it's beautiful I only got to play it like the one time real quick at Disneyland I want to play it again you know what else was pretty hot was playing Metallica pinball with the speaker right by me oh my god that game is awesome okay all right DarkSakura what do you have for us for rapid fire news Metallica pinball
6154112	6155653	No, for rapid fire news.
6156634	6161197	This one I brought up just because I know we have a few racing game fans out there.
6161877	6174605	So for anyone who is looking forward to F1 2013, the Ferrari that was driven by Niki Lauda is supposed to be in the game.
6175566	6179388	So for fans who are into racers, there you go.
6179448	6181610	You get a classic Ferrari in game.
6182871	6192421	and then I've also been watching a lot of Top Gear so also in this is some pretty interesting news for Ridge Racer news
6193533	6194454	Ridge Racer.
6194834	6195154	Yeah.
6195795	6204141	There is going to be a free-to-play PC racing game called Ridge Racer Driftopia that's part of Steam's early access program, so it should already be out.
6204241	6213369	And thank God we finally have new Ridge Racer news, because I was like, how can it be that we have two consoles launching this year and neither one of them have Ridge Racer?
6213829	6214970	What is up with that?
6216175	6216755	It's a shame.
6216895	6218996	I know, it's a sham is what it is.
6219156	6221917	Well, the Driftopia beta has already been out for PS3.
6223017	6230139	It's a public beta, and they said that the official release in Europe is supposed to be not too much later this year, hopefully.
6230279	6231840	Well, Steam, you've officially made it.
6231860	6232880	You have a Ridge Racer game.
6235604	6261334	and happy happy happy Puyo Puyo Tetris I'm just trying to figure out how Puyo Puyo and Tetris would breed but apparently it's Tetris with but they're gonna try god help them I'm wondering if the little if the Tetris blocks are gonna have like little Puyos on them or something but Puyo Puyo I love Puyo Puyo so hopefully it's going to be fun and not you know utterly crappy I hope
6263815	6265096	You know me and my P.O.P.O.
6266117	6266338	I know.
6266638	6267639	I know you do love P.O.P.O.
6267999	6269180	What was the last big P.O.P.O.
6269200	6269721	game that came out?
6269741	6272323	I remember the DS one, but that was the last one I really remember.
6272764	6274165	Wasn't that, yeah, just P.O.P.O.P.?
6274406	6274626	Yeah.
6275266	6275787	Or P.O.P.O.P.
6275807	6276087	Fever?
6277649	6280632	Alright, let's go to the foogle question of the week.
6288280	6293624	Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together and you get Fugle.
6293724	6296526	Every week we take to our social networks to ask a question.
6297206	6301709	And this week it has to do with something we talked about earlier in the show, the Steam family sharing.
6302070	6307794	This week we heard that Steam would be implementing family sharing, which was a feature that had been teased for the Xbox One.
6308354	6337335	many people who are critical of the Xbox One policies embrace the idea of family sharing on Steam do you think there is an unfair double standard in play in the gaming community when it comes to Steam announcing features versus Microsoft announcing Xbox One features why or why not I'm going to read just a few of the answers tonight because unfortunately the answers get very long with this but you have a lot of good stuff so I really want to encourage our community go read the answers people wrote
6337495	6340196	The Xbox One features outraged people because it meant the end of used game sales.
6340216	6345919	Even before Steam and other digital stores, selling and buying used PC games was not a huge market just because of the issue with CD keys.
6361327	6365729	even if I give you the right CD key I could still use it for myself to play online for example.
6366229	6372612	Meanwhile there's an entire retail chain that is basically built around the idea of buying and selling used console games.
6374888	6375669	Critical Myth says,
6395181	6408530	Xiao replies and says, I think the biggest reason Steam isn't catching any crap over this is the fact that Steam doesn't use your webcam and microphone to stalk you through your gaming area yet, and offline mode is an option, even though it enjoys making me rage.
6409151	6413193	It actually exists unlike what the Xbox One had before it became the Xbox 180.
6414254	6418037	So there really isn't a double standard as much as there is a different standard.
6418577	6424521	Console games are easier to share but cost more, and PC games are harder to share but tend to go on sale more often.
6425421	6440352	Degenerate Johnny says trick question the gaming community is full of double standards but I get your point honestly it's a feature that benefits Valve's market more than Microsoft's imagine you're a business and your competitor announced a special feature for a product that competes with your products and services
6440632	6441132	DarkSakura.com.
6466136	6489419	another one here on Facebook from Alan Alchemy there has always been an inferred or proven portability with console games packing up an entire system in a backpack and taking it to a friend's place loaning copies of games and so on Microsoft wanted to get rid of that with a strict licensing and killing used games with the online sharing feature being a band-aid to help soothe the burn it didn't work PCs and PC users never really had that narrative
6489719	6490179	and DarkSakura.
6519200	6527928	and taking a look over on Google+, Actdeft says, I've actually seen more people complain about Steam's family sharing not being all that much rather than praising it.
6528468	6538257	For me personally, I praised both of the Xbox One and Steam family sharing since I have to share with my brother and these kinds of services make it a whole lot simpler and I don't have to share accounts this way.
6538997	6557846	and lastly Travis H says nope not one bit I think that after Microsoft flip-flopped more times than a backward ass politician they deserve every bit of bias and scrutiny they get I don't even think that they knew what they were offering when they were offering it I also think that Microsoft is way too greedy to actually follow through with something as giving as what Steam is doing
6558406	6561729	Steam never has failed to impress the hell out of anyone that is a member.
6561849	6564451	Daily sales, summer and winter sales, weekend deals.
6564811	6567093	Hell, right now I can get all Tomb Raider games for $17.
6568374	6574820	Not to mention the 60 plus free games that are there for the taking by anyone who signs up for a free Steam membership.
6575320	6579544	But as a biased heavy PC and PlayStation gamer, I'm probably just talking crazy right now.
6579864	6581665	Kind of seems like a no-brainer to me though.
6582506	6583608	Those are some of the answers.
6583688	6586191	Check out Facebook and Google for more answers.
6586632	6588054	There with the Fugle Question of the Week.
6588634	6589616	What do you guys think?
6590116	6595724	Is there a bias in the way we treat Steam announcements versus the way we treat Microsoft announcements?
6596397	6597438	Depends on the precedent.
6598118	6600939	Steam has done nothing but good things for the most part.
6601500	6602760	We expect to see good from them.
6602800	6606883	We know that when they are offering a service, yeah, I mean, they're a business.
6606983	6607723	They want to make money.
6607763	6617428	But we know that they really are trying to put out a service that is going to be good for their... I'm sorry.
6617628	6618269	Consumer?
6618509	6619469	Yeah, for the consumer.
6622171	6622291	Loki?
6622311	6622531	Loki?
6623543	6631466	I would say that it's more of like the service was good as it was, but now they're adding another feature, so that's great.
6631966	6648473	Whereas Microsoft, I don't really trust them too much because of what they've done in the past as far as, first off, all these really crazy ideas, which I still don't think that they're completely against doing, like eliminating the whole retail marketplace so that they can basically control everything.
6648493	6649313	Yeah.
6650573	6655975	But at the same time, it's a service that if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.
6656155	6660017	It's not like you have to share your library with other people.
6660277	6661798	I think it's just an added feature.
6662638	6667160	You're already doing the DRM stuff with Steam, so it's not that big of a deal.
6667180	6671461	And also, you're not buying games for the most part for $60 a pop.
6671681	6672642	You're buying them for...
6674461	6675922	Very slim fractions of that.
6677203	6678184	I don't feel so bad about it.
6678364	6681006	I think for me, one big difference.
6681467	6687332	I get those tweets that say, why do we always praise Steam but we cut down Microsoft?
6687912	6691055	For one, there was a lot of confusion with Microsoft.
6691215	6708215	Whatever you may have thought about Microsoft's system They were never really clear with the positives of their system The negatives ended up being pretty clear when they announced that early on But the positives were always a bit of a haze And that was one big problem But here's the other big thing to remember is that
6709432	6710753	Steam is not a console.
6711014	6713996	I know there's rumors about the whole Steam box and everything, but Steam is not a console.
6714036	6715177	Steam is a delivery method.
6715237	6716158	Steam is a store.
6716739	6721143	Steam is a way of acquiring licenses to play on your PC.
6721523	6723565	And your PC is ultimately the device.
6724085	6725286	And the perception...
6726027	6726928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6744981	6753408	and I think that was one big problem is that, you know, well, even if Steam were to go down or your internet goes down, at least you can still do something with your PC.
6753948	6764517	You can still do all the other things that are outside of Steam like Photoshop or writing, word processing or games that... Complaining about Steam being down on their... Exactly, through your cell phone or whatever.
6764937	6772243	But I think the perception is your PC is not going to be a freaking brick if these, you know, negatives, you know, were to occur or whatever.
6772343	6772503	So...
6773644	6790155	Again, I don't think there's any reason why Microsoft can't, and I've been hooting and hollering about this for weeks now on the show, months, is that there's no reason Microsoft can't say, okay, well, if Steam is more of a delivery method, then why don't we invoke multiple delivery methods on the Xbox One?
6790575	6797340	You can either go buy a disc at the store, at Amazon, at Walmart, at GameStop, whatever.
6797720	6801643	Bring it home, put it in your console, and it's all the restrictions and things you're used to.
6801703	6804886	Your disc has to be in the console for it to work, etc., etc.
6805206	6812032	Or we can have the Microsoft Store that sells digital licenses that work in this whole new way, and you can family share.
6813353	6813733	Why not?
6814474	6816896	I'm literally saying Microsoft should set up two different stores.
6819477	6820537	It could appease everybody.
6820778	6822518	I'm not sure I would see the negative in that.
6823699	6826560	But anyway, that's my big thoughts on the issue.
6826620	6831082	So thank you guys for sharing yours over at Facebook.
6831162	6835664	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus page.
6837108	6846540	So, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, BlackWolf says, actually, when Lightning took out my internet for five days, my PC did feel like a brick.
6847801	6851966	But to be fair, your Xbox One would have been a brick, too, especially under those old policies.
6852087	6852807	So, I mean...
6853989	6861217	SSJ100Matt says, will people change their tune if the Steam Box has the same requirements and things we didn't like about the original Xbox One?
6861577	6863299	Most likely, I think people wouldn't buy it.
6863319	6864780	The Steam Box is going to be a PC.
6865761	6867443	It's just going to be a PC.
6867563	6868685	Yeah, I don't think it will do that.
6869365	6869465	So...
6870246	6876169	Alright, Datatrack in chat says, as if the normal store isn't already confusing enough.
6876509	6877509	I'm not sure I see that.
6877549	6880150	I think maybe, I mean, I don't think it's super confusing.
6880271	6882972	Well, confusing to navigate maybe.
6883272	6884092	I'd give you that.
6884632	6886593	You know, it's not always easy to find what you want.
6886793	6888354	But, I mean, right now it's pretty simple.
6888414	6890055	You buy the game, it's on your drive, there it is.
6890495	6892616	Finding what you want might be another problem, but...
6894767	6899969	It's also, once again, back complaining about how it would have been.
6901809	6903590	Their marketplace would have been locked down.
6903630	6909272	There's really only one place you can get your digital content from, and that's Microsoft.
6909732	6914113	Whereas, if I want to get digital content from Steam, I have a ton of avenues for it.
6914213	6916034	I have multiple retailers out there.
6916394	6918055	I can buy a physical copy of it.
6918155	6921816	I mean, granted, you can buy a physical copy of the disc if you went to any retailer for...
6922476	6923097	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6943180	6944041	I don't think so.
6944462	6947225	Because really, they're not spending that much for the packaged media.
6947245	6952330	Remember, it only costs a few bucks, maybe two or three dollars to actually make that packaged media.
6952571	6956675	And they're even cutting back on that by not printing the manuals anymore or doing any of that stuff.
6957036	6957216	So...
6958137	6962641	You're not going to see a huge discount in games from Microsoft because they have it locked down.
6962681	6965244	If anything, now they can keep games at a higher price.
6965304	6971810	Just look at Vita, for example, in the digital marketplace that was on PlayStation Network for some of the older PSP titles.
6972050	6977635	They don't drop the digital price on them even though they're dropping price at retail for whatever reason.
6978436	6981919	That's just how it works when you have a single marketplace to get something.
6982557	6985159	All right, let's go back into some gaming news.
6985279	6987922	And Loki, I know you teased these stories a little earlier.
6988442	6992025	All right, so let's talk a little bit more about Ouya's Free the Games Fund.
6992065	6993366	So here's kind of what happened.
6993766	6996909	They announced the Free the Games Fund back in July.
6996949	7009860	It was going to be this fund that was going to match any earnings from these crowdfunded campaigns, probably through Kickstarter, if their goal was $50,000 or more.
7011281	7026293	and then on top of that, the game that had the largest earnings, I guess, for it through Kickstarter would get an additional $100,000 and anything else would have been backed or matched by Ouya.
7026873	7031597	So, at the end of August, there were two games that met that goal.
7031897	7036621	The first one being Elementary My Dear Homes and the second one is Gridiron Thunder.
7037781	7044963	Elementary My Dear Homes, as we talked about last week, was the campaign was pulled because of a bunch of fake accounts on there.
7045023	7057167	They had them named after fictional characters, sports celebrities, all these different people that definitely weren't actually backing the game, but they had basically put their own money into the project so that they'd meet their goal.
7057627	7061989	So then that way, when they make their $50,000, Ouya matches that $50,000, and then they make a profit off of it.
7066090	7066911	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7085851	7098723	So, obviously there was some sort of fraud going on there because it just seems a little fishy that these few people are not even requesting any sort of... They're not selecting a $10,000 option.
7098763	7103728	They're selecting no prize or gift whatsoever.
7103748	7106250	They're just backing it with multiple thousands of dollars.
7107712	7126711	and it was obvious that they were doing that and in the case of Gridiron Thunder it was a really shitty looking game that they probably already had finished and in fact it is coming out at the end of this month kind of weird how all of a sudden they were able to turn that game around with over a few hundred thousand dollars in like two weeks
7128682	7129563	That was the plan all along.
7129603	7130964	They're not going to make anything off the game.
7131505	7133266	They're just going to make it off of this program.
7133927	7139152	So then Julie Ehrman responds back to this, basically saying that, you know...
7141282	7142443	We're not going to change the program at all.
7143383	7145024	We think things are good the way they are.
7145504	7148986	We heard your complaints that you think that these are scamming us, but we're not going to do anything.
7149286	7151267	We're not going to alter it.
7151687	7155789	Because of that, there's been a lot of reaction to it.
7156189	7161352	In fact, there's even one more Kickstarter that I believe just posted.
7161372	7162973	I don't know if it's been funded yet.
7163813	7165354	Dungeons the Eye of Draconis
7181461	7198275	and this is basically what they said it's all dear pledgers we have been honest up front with you about our situation from the start as you can see we currently are only one quarter of the way to our goal before launching this Kickstarter basically saying let's see here where they get to the part where they're actually funding it with their
7199576	7214125	Basically, he goes into saying that his father decided to give five checks for a certain amount of dollars to people in the family so that they could each back...
7214645	7215785	All the tiers are hereby unlocked.
7236170	7242097	You and previous Kickstarter pledges will receive all three episodes and will stream to you once every few weeks.
7243939	7245320	Everyone wins in this situation.
7245360	7247082	We're going to make an excellent video game for $65,000.
7247503	7251828	It matches the funds that come in three disbursements
7252348	7256751	First, $12,500 at the end of the Kickstarter.
7256911	7259272	Second, $25,000 when the game is released.
7259372	7263074	And finally, $12,500 after the six months OUYA exclusive.
7263115	7265996	We have to finish the game before we get the second and third payments.
7266517	7269999	You will receive the fully expanded trilogy and all this stuff.
7271059	7275382	Thanks to the OUYA funds, we'll be able to afford marketing and have a booth at PAX and all this stuff.
7276263	7287261	but it's he funded the game so they would get over their minimum otherwise they wouldn't have been able to do it in the first case so they funded with their own money and they're going to pay themselves back with the matched funds
7289123	7292164	Um, so I have people reacting to this, including developers.
7292684	7300925	Um, some people, for example, uh, Sophie Holden, who launched a game called Rose in Time on the Ouya, is going to be pulling her game for the marketplace.
7301326	7310887	Says basically, uh, you know, Julie's response, it became very apparent to me that the company does not support the indie developers who need the support the most, and they're incapable of correcting their mistake.
7311227	7313468	I'm simply no longer comfortable supporting the company.
7314669	7326629	and you know basically saying you know these smaller developers actually need the money and not like a hundred thousand dollars to develop a game right they're not getting the funding that they need to make this game
7327605	7328225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7349358	7350259	Thanks for watching!
7368453	7384623	and unfortunately, that's going to kind of, I think, nix any ideas that they have as far as doing this in the future because if that's all it's going to be is a bunch of abuse from people just releasing shitty apps on the store, then, you know, they're out even more money and what's this really have gained?
7384643	7386064	If anything, negative press.
7386104	7389486	I think most people bought Anuja to be an emulator, let's be real.
7389786	7396871	I mean, I think that's, you know, and I think it's starting to show that a little bit now through some of the corruption going on in other places.
7396891	7396971	Yeah.
7397051	7401014	Yeah, and unfortunately, even a lot of these other consoles are probably getting better emulators than this thing.
7413844	7420409	Well, news came out this week that Soul Calibur Lost Swords is a free-to-play PlayStation 3 title.
7421070	7422210	This is according to Famitsu.
7422250	7424252	It's something that's going to be coming out later this year.
7424312	7425613	I don't know if that means in the U.S.
7425693	7428135	as well, but we know that's for Japan.
7428915	7431317	It is confirmed it will release in Europe at some point.
7431838	7440204	Namco Bandai did file a trademark for this back in July, so we knew something was coming, but I think a lot of people thought maybe like handheld game or spinoff game or something.
7441284	7443085	This will be a free-to-play game.
7443185	7447746	Siegfried and Mitsurugi are the first characters that are confirmed to be playable in it, but here's the thing about it.
7448106	7453327	It's a single-player game, not really a head-to-head fighter game.
7453347	7459228	They say it is a free-to-play fighter, but I don't know exactly how that's all going to work out if they say it's single-player.
7460288	7465469	There's only very, very low-resolution screenshots out there, thanks to Famitsu Magazine's scans right now.
7465489	7467630	If you wish to buy more resolution, it's going to cost you some money.
7469050	7469490	Exactly.
7469750	7469910	Listless
7495057	7496498	Ah, I love hearing that music.
7496578	7499040	It always means we're going to have a good time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7499900	7506184	So what we're going to do, we're going to put together the definitive list around a certain topic.
7506825	7516050	And the way Listless works, if you don't remember, is that each of us, as well as a guest, who I'll introduce here in a minute, will give our top three answers on this topic.
7516471	7518492	And then we go around, and the tricky part is...
7518812	7519372	and DarkSakura.
7547957	7551719	So, let's introduce our special guest tonight.
7551759	7558884	Since three doesn't make for a very good list list, we always like to invite a fourth person from the indie podcast community to come play with us.
7559264	7563146	So, tonight we have Captain Spike with us on the line.
7563186	7563947	Are you there, Captain?
7564707	7565568	Ahoy, can you hear me?
7565648	7566368	Yes, I can.
7566408	7567129	How you doing, Spike?
7567847	7568347	Gamebuoy.org Gamebuoy.org
7592678	7595481	Yeah, it's interesting what's going on with Capcom, isn't it?
7596422	7599665	It's really one of those things where you look at it and go, what in the hell are they thinking?
7599725	7601267	Or did you guys come to a different conclusion?
7602348	7603349	No, rather certainly.
7603469	7615380	I would say that three of the big gems or jewels coming out of the Japanese game development scene right now are tied to stuff that they sort of brought up into the world and, you know,
7616990	7627757	It's really funny to see them flailing and floundering as all of these really important voices in Japanese games are coming on to sort of their big opuses, so to speak.
7629118	7633240	Spike, actually, I perked up for just one moment because I thought you said R-Type.
7634321	7637583	Oh gosh, I didn't, but... Maybe next time.
7637623	7640365	Maybe there'll be a Game Buoy Micro on that whole series in the future.
7640985	7643787	If people want to check out that discussion, where can they find that?
7644839	7650602	You can find that over at GameBooey.org GameBooey.org Thank you.
7650642	7653464	I had to do that since Slidekick isn't on the show tonight, unfortunately.
7654144	7658367	Okay, so tonight's topic for Listless is about the Xbox One.
7658487	7663609	And I'll tell you the specific topic in a minute, but Spike, quickly, your thoughts in a nutshell on Xbox One.
7663629	7664770	Do you have one pre-ordered?
7666211	7672734	It's the first console in the last decade that I haven't pre-ordered, but if I can find one day one, I'll probably end up buying it.
7673475	7673635	Okay.
7674345	7677047	That's kind of what I did with Wii U. I was like, I'm not going to buy it.
7677087	7677627	I'm not going to buy it.
7677647	7678268	I'm not going to buy it.
7678308	7679449	And then I look at my Target app.
7679549	7680249	Oh, it's in stock.
7680609	7680910	Fuck.
7680970	7681730	And I bought it.
7682010	7683051	So we'll see.
7683464	7687025	All right, so tonight's list list is all about the Xbox One.
7687065	7693306	And the topic tonight is thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.
7693826	7701247	Well, you know, the Xbox has taken a lot of kind of kicks in the face when it comes to their DRM policy.
7701387	7705008	And then, you know, the whole 180 reversals they've done on other things.
7705148	7709989	And now this whole thing with Steam got the family sharing and everybody praised Steam again.
7710249	7712693	What did you think about all that, Spike, before we begin?
7712733	7717781	Do you think people were fair in praising what Steam was doing versus what Xbox was trying to do?
7718567	7732336	You know, I had loaded up your Facebook for Orange Lounge Radio to comment on this, but I saw comments there that reflected exactly my thought, which is that the PC marketplaces operated so different for so long that it's really not the same thing.
7732817	7743724	There isn't an expectation of being able to resell and have the portability, as Alan Alkemy had called it, of your games and being able to take your software other places.
7743964	7745485	For PC, that's not really a thing.
7746286	7748047	So I don't think people are, you know,
7749007	7754751	That expectation that exists in the console market for games to stay open, I don't think exists in the PC market.
7755391	7762576	Alright, well if you are playing along with us at live.vognetwork.com you're going to see that pop up right on your screen.
7762596	7765017	We're going to put up the board there for Listless tonight.
7765338	7770041	The thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.
7770061	7773903	Because you know, everybody just really wants to be popular at the end of the day.
7774483	7775864	They need to get their mojo back.
7775964	7776345	They need to...
7777105	7778546	That song just popped into my head.
7778586	7778986	What song?
7779006	7780047	The Not A Surf song.
7781068	7782148	Popular.
7782709	7785371	Well, unfortunately, you get Come On Down as your theme song tonight.
7785391	7785871	That's what you get.
7785911	7786151	All right.
7786711	7789934	Captain Spike, since you are our guest, we're going to let you go first tonight.
7790014	7796498	What is your number three answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet tonight?
7796558	7801821	By the way, sorry, before you answer, if you want to play along in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
7801901	7802442	Sometimes...
7802822	7806686	We steal chat answers and replace our own with chat answers.
7806746	7809669	So shout out your answers in chat as we go along with this.
7809689	7811330	All right, Spike, what is your number three thing?
7812552	7814834	And we're talking about popular on the internet, right?
7814874	7816035	Not actual popular.
7816375	7818698	Popular on the internet was what was said.
7818758	7820940	So serious or funny, whatever you want to do.
7821841	7822181	Oh, good.
7822782	7825704	Buy Sega, rename the Xbox One as the Dreamcast 2.
7829659	7831220	So rename it to the Dreamcast 2.
7831661	7835824	Didn't that come up as an answer in another list at some point?
7836084	7838506	I think that was name of system maybe?
7838586	7839306	Perhaps, yeah.
7839606	7840947	Thing to name the system.
7841328	7843129	Alright, well that could do it.
7843469	7852796	Yeah, there was a lot of posts on Twitter and so forth not that long ago on 9999 Remember the Dreamcast XOXO Love you 5 ever, right?
7853757	7858821	I remember sitting on the ground outside waiting in line at Arden Fair Mall
7860003	7861364	Alright, so there it is up on the board.
7861404	7862625	Rename it to the Dreamcast 2.
7863005	7865547	Alright, Loki, what is your number three answer?
7866167	7870270	My number three answer would be they need to drop the price of that system at least $100.
7873208	7873808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7906911	7909172	Why can't we just embrace what the people really want?
7909212	7909933	I don't understand.
7909993	7911554	It helped VHS win that war.
7913216	7916798	Alright, let's go on to DarkSakura, your number three answer.
7916938	7919821	What could the Xbox One do to be popular on the internet again?
7920261	7922202	A pack-in with every online order?
7922383	7922943	Waffle iron.
7924224	7925905	Free waffle iron with every online order.
7928227	7930389	Forget a game or a controller.
7931009	7933311	Give people what they really want and that's waffles.
7933331	7934472	They're already waffling.
7940051	7943414	You're kind of dumb and amazing at the same time right now.
7946656	7947557	See, I made a pun.
7947617	7948598	Yeah, I get it.
7948638	7951140	A free waffle iron because they're waffling.
7952601	7953241	Oh, good lord.
7953361	7963429	All right, Captain Spike, I don't know how you're going to one-up that, but good luck to you as you go into your number two answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.
7965069	7972207	Fling Phil Fish to the moon What do you have against Phil Fish?
7974147	7975488	Can I just say everything?
7976368	7978229	I suppose that's a valid response.
7978609	7981111	But how would that sell Xboxes?
7981291	7986794	It would be something that you could only watch it on the Slingshot app or something?
7987354	7990856	It would get the Xbox One popular on the internet.
7991256	7991976	Yeah, sure.
7992036	7994798	Tie it to a stream on your Xbox One only.
7995218	7996439	People would buy it to watch that.
7996779	7996979	Like a
7997359	7999340	The pay-per-view event of the millennium.
7999500	8002100	We're going to fling Phil Fish into the moon.
8004041	8004481	All right.
8005641	8013364	Loki, dare I ask, what is your number two answer tonight for a thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet?
8014204	8014884	Let's see.
8015564	8017265	Be backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.
8020424	8022325	Very serious answers for me tonight, Loki.
8022385	8024566	Why is backwards compatibility... No, it's fine.
8024606	8026486	Why is backwards compatibility so important?
8026806	8032149	It's not, but people bitch about it, so... It would make it important.
8032389	8035410	Again, it's about being popular on the internet when all is said and done, right?
8036110	8037431	All right, so let's put that up on the board.
8037471	8040312	Loki says backwards compatibility with the 360.
8041072	8045574	My number two answer... My number two answer is... Okay, so...
8046594	8050117	We all know everybody's losing their shit about Killer Instinct, right?
8050137	8059024	Because Killer Instinct got its big remake, even though it's interesting it's only going to have six to eight characters, but I guess that's a whole nother Oprah.
8059325	8060406	But I said, you know what?
8060506	8069313	When we were being teased for so long about that Rare is going to bring back a classic franchise, I had my fingers and toes crossed for a different franchise to come back.
8069353	8073556	So my number two answer is give us the Rare remake we really want.
8074137	8075078	Anticipation.
8080974	8086896	Alright, so I'm just going to shorten that to Make Rare Do a New Anticipation Game as my number two answer.
8086936	8088016	We'll put that up on the board.
8088737	8091898	Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?
8092734	8121974	a more interactive banning system meaning like a I'm trying to remember how to phrase this like a smart list where when people get certain amounts of complaints made against them and I'm talking about real time complaining for people on Xbox Live that it puts a mark on them they get a certain number of marks they're banned or sent to a moderator review to see if they're legit or you get to sit in the chair next that flings you to the moon yes but I mean but I mean
8123414	8144128	either that or something that completely removes the anonymity alright you know just some way to hold people you should be publicly shamed a way to hold people accountable for being shits on Xbox Live so I did shorten that to the more interactive banning system but I honestly think maybe that should just be put DarkSakura in charge of Xbox Live
8148878	8151839	Alright, let's recap what we have on the board so far.
8151959	8154600	So, thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.
8154940	8156081	Rename it to Dreamcast 2.
8156801	8158202	Fling Phil Fish to the moon.
8158562	8159743	Drop the price at least $101.
8160983	8162204	Backwards compatibility with 360.
8163184	8164245	Pornography app.
8164605	8166486	Make Rare do a new anticipation.
8166826	8168847	A free waffle iron with every order.
8169287	8171328	Or a more interactive banning system.
8172188	8176689	Alright, boy, this elimination is going to be some of the hardest ever tonight.
8176769	8179710	Let's see what folks have for their number one answers tonight.
8180130	8186412	Captain Spike, your number one answer for what Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.
8187352	8189012	I call this one the Nintendo method.
8189833	8198175	Money Hat, a hipster games exclusive that everyone claims to want but wouldn't actually buy, like Mega Man Legends 3 or Shenmue 3.
8201018	8202322	I'm trying to think how to shorten that.
8202362	8203465	Hipster exclusives.
8206764	8212567	and why would Mega Man and Shenmue more than others bring all the boys to the yard?
8213548	8220912	Because both of these games are games where everyone on the internet claims to have loved these games and played them and ooh, I remember that.
8221653	8224854	But if that many people played these games, they would have been commercial success.
8226215	8229617	But mind you, a lot of people pirated them on Dreamcast.
8231258	8231878	That is true.
8232058	8234260	But if they really loved it, they would have spent the money on it.
8234280	8234800	That's right.
8235260	8235800	That's right.
8236461	8238082	You even have people in chat right now.
8238162	8240143	Fifth Dream says, Shenmue 3, motherfucker.
8240183	8241123	I want it so much.
8243544	8243845	All right.
8244525	8245285	Good answer, Spike.
8246006	8247787	Loki, what is your number one answer tonight?
8248527	8249247	Thanks for watching!
8271041	8273622	So the box is now an artificial kitten.
8274283	8274803	There it is.
8276044	8277524	Because who doesn't love cats?
8277784	8278325	Exactly.
8278405	8279125	The internet.
8279365	8279805	They don't.
8279825	8280166	That's right.
8280246	8281146	Internet loves cats.
8281566	8283727	And it was, how do we be popular on the internet?
8284128	8284488	Cats.
8284728	8285088	Cats.
8285288	8285628	All right.
8285828	8286489	Excellent answer.
8286889	8287189	All right.
8287249	8288550	My number one answer.
8289550	8294773	I actually went for something serious tonight, and I'm surprised nobody said it yet, unless maybe DarkSakura was sitting on it.
8294813	8296074	But if so, I apologize.
8296454	8300136	I think the thing people want most of all, detach, connect.
8301755	8304196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8329962	8333562	Making OLR the official voice of Microsoft.
8338755	8339556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8360530	8361531	When you're not watching.
8361651	8363372	That's why it needs to be detached.
8363452	8368096	And then that's the porn channel.
8368316	8369977	Let's run down the list real quick.
8370017	8376562	If you guys need it up so you can choose what to eliminate, go to live.vognetwork.com Here is the list as it stands right now.
8377102	8404349	Rename it to Dreamcast 2 Fling Phil Fish to the moon Hipster exclusives like Mega Man Legends and Shenmue 3 Drop the price at least $101 Backwards compatibility with the 360 The box is now an artificial kitten Pornography app Make Rare do a new anticipation Detach Connect A free waffle iron with every order A more interactive banning system And OLR becomes the official voice of Microsoft That is a great list tonight This is going to be painful tonight
8405029	8405549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8425214	8429075	Making Orange Lounge Radio the official voice of Microsoft because I don't want you to sell out.
8429235	8431436	Stay independent.
8431596	8433136	He did sugarcoat that in a very good way.
8433196	8436017	Yeah, but we said we'd sell out in an instant if people wanted to pay us.
8437757	8438978	No, no, no.
8439078	8443559	I think he's just a little jealous because there was no room for GameBooey.org in that sentence.
8443799	8447260	Maybe I should just put it VOG and pals.
8447560	8448140	VOG and pals.
8448160	8448640	There you go.
8448860	8451621	Literally, GameBooey would be the right voice for Microsoft.
8453584	8468194	You're so far up Nintendo's ass, I don't think you would know what to say They care about game design, I'm here for that It is stricken from the list Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8469135	8477000	Just because it's silly and they don't really make a ton of games anymore Buying Sega and calling it the Dreamcast 2
8478140	8480961	Oh, you're going to eliminate the Dreamcast 2.
8481262	8482582	Yeah, I'm sorry.
8482802	8483362	You ass.
8483463	8484163	Alright, that's alright.
8484863	8486084	It is stricken from the list.
8486164	8487364	Rename it to Dreamcast 2.
8487544	8488345	Not going to happen.
8488785	8492006	Alright, so that comes to my turn.
8492146	8493427	Oh my gosh, this is so hard.
8497990	8504075	Okay, the internet's gonna totally hate me for this, but I am gonna say the box is now an artificial kitten.
8504535	8511880	I just, it's, it's, I like cats, don't get me wrong, but something about the eyeball, like, fucking freaks the shit out of me.
8511980	8514422	So I don't want that Xbox to turn into that.
8514442	8515543	Can I ever bring over my eyeball?
8515563	8516344	I want an eyeball.
8517885	8520547	So, unfortunately, I'm gonna eliminate the artificial kitten.
8520567	8523069	Dude, I really want an eyeball, because I want to see what Midna would do.
8523089	8526992	Especially now that I think of it, a box that poops is also probably not a good idea.
8527612	8528713	So sorry about it.
8528813	8530374	It is removed from the list.
8530894	8532295	Real cats are better anyway.
8532715	8537818	Alright, so DarkSakura, last but not least, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8538098	8538879	Anticipation.
8540940	8545943	Because I'm sorry, the only anticipation I care about comes from Frank's mouth.
8549365	8550206	I see what you did there.
8550646	8553048	Okay, only because you phrased that in a great way.
8553789	8554229	There it is.
8554329	8556531	Make rare, do a new anticipation, is removed from the list.
8556811	8560854	Very interesting the way that worked out tonight because nobody got hosed with two eliminations.
8560974	8564176	Each host got one taken off, so fair enough, fair enough.
8564877	8570181	Well, Spike, we're going to put it to a vote of the public, but hey, I want to thank you for being here tonight.
8571451	8601183	oh thank you so much for having me not a problem let's plug your show one more time where can folks hear you on the interwebs and what kind of fun topics do you have coming up next on your show that is GameBooey.org oh sorry it just reflects to wait for someone to repeat it oh GameBooey.org and coming up we have a researched episode on bootleg games Cheetah Man and Donkey Kong Returns 99 and that sort of thing
8601448	8604170	Cheetahman is awesome and horrible.
8605992	8611496	I like how you say it's a researched, as opposed to so much other stuff out there on the internet like this program.
8612237	8613758	No, Rob, have you ever played Cheetahman?
8614299	8614599	What's that?
8614659	8616681	Have you ever played Cheetahman or any of the sequels?
8616881	8619443	I don't think so, actually, in all honesty.
8619603	8620384	I'm sure it was bad.
8620984	8622425	The music is super good, though.
8622465	8624747	Are we talking about like Color Dreams games on the NES?
8624807	8625027	Yes.
8626330	8628151	That's going to be a thing we talk about, yes.
8628372	8629672	And the 10-gen games.
8629813	8630433	Oh, my God.
8630513	8631694	Some of those were really horrible.
8631734	8635596	Like Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who was like the worst NES game in history.
8635616	8636577	It was so horrible.
8637037	8638959	We're going to talk about Bible Adventures.
8639239	8640240	Yes, awesome.
8640540	8641801	Well, actually, I will say this.
8642141	8644743	You guys are always very well-researched over there.
8645083	8649186	I know people may not know this about you, Captain Spike, but you're like a freaking encyclopedia when it comes to games.
8649206	8651887	You know an awful lot, domestic and import.
8651967	8655670	So people should check it out if they want to hear something really educated.
8656871	8657411	Aw, thank you.
8657491	8658932	Thank you so much for your kind words.
8659092	8659832	I love your show.
8660272	8660953	Long time fan.
8661013	8661753	Thank you for having me.
8661773	8663274	Alright, we're long time fans of you, Spike.
8663294	8664755	Come back and say hi in studio sometime.
8665928	8667449	All right, take care, my friend.
8667810	8669771	All right, Spike, help us out tonight.
8669811	8671192	We are about to make this answerable.
8671232	8676897	I just want to remind people as they vote on this, you get to vote for your number one and your number two pick.
8677177	8678958	Your first click will be your number one.
8679039	8680680	Your second click will be your number two.
8680760	8682621	So think before you vote.
8683002	8685904	It is now put to the vote of the listeners.
8686044	8688846	Help us come up with the definitive list.
8689627	8692469	We will keep this open for a few minutes while we...
8693871	8696554	We have a mail One email tonight And apparently we can get cheap Viagra
8705856	8733728	yay live.vognetwork.com while we open up the mailbag and if you want to send us an email about Viagra or otherwise mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com maybe you could send us a well researched email on bootleg games and we can one up what Game Boy is doing you know what I have to make a mention of something by the way I've seen a lot of people try to do stuff on GoFundMe and I wonder if I put up a GoFundMe if people would send me to Comiket laughing
8735189	8736530	But what are they gonna get out of it?
8737170	8738211	Me at Comiket?
8740212	8741352	I'll bring back toilet paper.
8742958	8745379	Alright, what's that email we got tonight, DarkSakura?
8745399	8748961	Okay, we got something from CatastrophicMagi, who I chat with all the time on Steam.
8749922	8753023	Even and all, it's your very favorite CatastrophicMagi.
8753103	8753484	Smile.
8754304	8759507	I've been pretty psyched for Telltale's new game, A Wolf Among Us, which is a prequel to the Fables comics.
8760127	8761448	I like the Fables comics, for the record.
8762208	8766690	You guys haven't mentioned it yet, apart from Jamie, who I'm continually pestering on Steam anyway.
8767011	8768271	Have you seen anything about it yet?
8768291	8769112	And he linked us the trailer.
8770354	8773931	In other news, I honestly haven't seen anything on it by the way.
8776194	8779055	In other news, I've always wanted to go to one of the big American cons.
8779336	8783999	So given VOG's ties with DragonCon nowadays, I'm going to aim for that one in 2015.
8784319	8785540	So you'd better be there, Rob.
8785560	8785540	2015?
8785920	8786680	Yeah.
8787301	8787441	Not 14.
8787581	8790203	It takes time to save up.
8790243	8790763	No, you're right.
8790803	8791523	It does take time.
8791564	8792044	I'm just saying.
8793044	8799869	If I have as good of a time next year as I did this year, and I don't see why I wouldn't, I would absolutely go back every year as long as I can afford it.
8800731	8801752	Hear you later, Magi.
8802492	8808898	So, I don't know how well it's going to do to play the trailer on the air.
8808938	8812100	No, I don't really want to play it on the air, but where can people look that up?
8812140	8812781	Is that just on YouTube?
8812881	8813661	It's on YouTube.
8813681	8814702	Well, people can look that up on YouTube.
8814722	8815883	So, it's A Wolf Among Us.
8816224	8816764	Well, there you go.
8816984	8818766	You can just Google that and you'll find that.
8819166	8822909	Yep, and I pretty much do kind of chat with Magi every day, come to think of it.
8823300	8830004	Yeah, he chatted with me on Steam once in a while, too, and he was good enough to... He's the one that got me... Oh, God, and now I forgot the name of that game.
8830044	8830865	That other scary game.
8830885	8832545	Paranormal, the one that I played.
8832866	8835067	That was another scary game that I played a little bit.
8835367	8841451	Magi's been trying to get me into Shin Megami Tensei, which I probably will play it eventually.
8842051	8843492	I've got a bunch of games on my plate, man.
8845225	8846527	Okay, so that's it.
8847789	8856183	One email apart from Viagra, which I don't know about you, but I have no problems with that part of anyone's anatomy.
8857819	8862641	All right, we are going to move on with some news.
8863361	8867302	Again, you can vote in the list list tonight, live.vognetwork.com.
8867662	8872544	Oh, before we get to the news, we have to get to the angst with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
8872944	8876125	Why do we do a segment called the FUs of the Week on the video game show?
8877105	8882987	Because if you were me fighting the Cerberus boss in Kingdom Hearts earlier today, there was a lot of rage.
8898874	8902355	I'm going to give a big F you to anti-Semitism.
8903516	8912759	Not just because of things that happened earlier, but because it's... And this is the people who are like, oh, well, we're Christians and we're persecuted here in America.
8912939	8913439	No, you're not.
8913719	8923022	You don't have to have the cops at your Christmas services to keep people from, you know, breaking into your cars or throwing bricks at your place of worship.
8923182	8925323	So, an F you to that, you know.
8926863	8927983	F you to intolerance in general.
8928003	8929864	Yeah, F you to intolerance.
8930564	8934245	But it's just, you know, and the cops have been really good about it every year.
8934545	8936906	They just make a presence and we don't have any trouble.
8937506	8941167	But I just still think it's horrible that it's necessary.
8941807	8942287	Absolutely.
8942647	8944588	So, F you to that.
8945568	8946068	Alright, Loki.
8948697	8956104	FU2, Logan's Roadhouse, their fried cheese hamburger because it was not good.
8956905	8963171	You would think that a patty of fried cheese would be good on a burger, but it was not.
8963191	8964772	That's why you need to go to Squeeze In.
8966153	8968355	I've been to Squeeze In, and their burgers are not good.
8968535	8979882	And I was sorely disappointed because, you know, it sounded awesome, like a cheese skirt, but they burn the shit out of their burgers, and they don't season the patties at all, and so they tasted like crap.
8979982	8986106	I can't remember, like, the last really good hamburger I had where I went like, mmm, that is a tasty burger!
8986166	8989568	Red Robin's burgers are pretty good if you put a ton of their seasoned salt on it.
8990168	8991449	It makes their burgers taste really good.
8991469	8992090	I like In-N-Out.
8993010	8995171	Rob, I'm going to have to take you to California Burger around my house.
8995191	8996012	Oh, I like Smash Burger.
8996392	8997092	I took Alan there.
8997493	8997753	Oh, yeah?
8998093	8998673	He really liked it.
8998793	8999454	Nice.
8999874	9003096	Oh, he sent me a picture, and I was like, that burger is drenched in mayonnaise.
9003116	9004036	That looks disgusting.
9004116	9006718	Well, you can get it without.
9006898	9007458	Thank God.
9007478	9009900	They do Thousand Island dressing and other stuff, too.
9009960	9011721	Yeah, that's all the devil's work.
9012541	9013601	I love mayonnaise for the record.
9015062	9017743	My FU of the week goes to mayonnaise, first and foremost, every week.
9018483	9026786	And my other FU goes to, you know, as much as I love this time of year pumpkin everything, it's making me die.
9027346	9036749	My FU to all the sugar that I'm eating right now, and it's making me gain weight when I should be trying to lose it to do sexy cosplay next year at DragonCon.
9037150	9038270	So FU to sugar.
9039929	9040890	Can I add another one, Rob?
9041070	9041330	No.
9041970	9042951	Let's go to the next story.
9043331	9044392	Yes, you can add another one.
9044952	9049134	A big F you to all of the people who are sending poor hussy death threats.
9049755	9052256	I know you don't like the... This is a Homestuck thing, by the way.
9052476	9052576	Oh.
9052937	9055618	I know you don't like what happened in the last update.
9055778	9057579	A lot of us were like, oh shit.
9058800	9062342	But it's no reason to send somebody freaking death threats.
9062542	9063603	It's a story.
9064403	9067225	And I have to commend him for being very positive about the whole thing.
9069273	9081807	It's a very mature sign when the author who is apparently receiving said teenage crap is being very gracious and focusing on the good parts of the fandom.
9083208	9083569	Good for you.
9084810	9085391	Duke Nukem Forever
9102473	9114589	I don't know if you guys remember, but a few months ago, there was this whole lawsuit with 3D Realms trying to get their royalties from Gearbox and all that stuff.
9114689	9117012	Apparently, they were owed $2 million.
9119154	9121217	But apparently they've dropped the case.
9121938	9124101	I'm not sure if they've settled it or what the case is.
9124261	9133894	After reviewing evidence regarding our business affairs and without any money exchanging hands, we have satisfactorily resolved any and all differences we perceived against Gearbox.
9135095	9136217	And so they've apologized.
9139201	9142243	I don't know what that means, but... Boy.
9142964	9143224	Yeah.
9143404	9146887	Kind of interesting how that all ended with an apology.
9147027	9148408	Yeah, basically, here's the press release.
9148428	9148688	It says,
9158155	9177047	In all sincerity, we regret the misunderstanding that instigated our lawsuit, and now that we better understand and appreciate the actual nature of our business matters, we have voluntarily withdrawn our claims against Gearbox with genuine apologies to Randy for any damage that our lawsuit may have caused the relationship.
9177587	9180249	Sincerely, Scott Miller.
9180349	9181550	So, in other words, they hugged it out.
9182490	9182930	Essentially.
9183491	9183971	I guess.
9185112	9185772	I don't know.
9186152	9186793	Maybe it was...
9188513	9190294	Tycho Drummaster Tycho Notachujen
9212766	9222571	Taiko Drum Master, Namco Bandai will be bringing it to the Wii U. Famitsu has mentioned that you can play Taiko Drum Master Wii U version with a Taiko Drum accessory.
9222611	9226132	It'll be available for the Wii, Wii Remotes, or the Wii U GamePad.
9227253	9231134	The GamePad controls will be optimized to be simple for game players.
9231515	9234256	I'm hoping you're not going to beat that GamePad with a stick.
9234316	9235837	I'm sure it's like tapping or something.
9235857	9236737	They're doing a little different.
9237357	9243159	Baton Change Mode is a new mode where between two to four players will work together in playing one song.
9243719	9251782	There'll also be Nintendo crossover content like Mario & Luigi Masks, and one of the songs that will be playable in the game, Wild Pokemon Battle Medley.
9252162	9257304	So it'll have a little bit of that crossover there to make it even more appealing to Nintendo fans.
9257644	9258624	So, there you go.
9259225	9260145	No word on when.
9260725	9264747	You can just look forward to it I guess next year, I would think at this point.
9265387	9265547	So...
9266267	9266907	There you go.
9267888	9269808	Do you guys ever play Taiko no Tachigen?
9270109	9271949	It's been a long time, but I like that game.
9271969	9278472	Last time I played it was on PSP, so... I don't think I've played it since they originally put the US PlayStation 2 one out.
9278612	9280133	I have the US ones.
9281113	9285895	Because Dan actually, back when he got to take home Field Destroys, that's how I got mine.
9286555	9286755	Okay.
9287195	9287575	It worked.
9287655	9288016	I don't know.
9289216	9292980	Alright, well, now's the part of the show where we're going to open it up to your calls.
9293000	9297024	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9297044	9299847	You can give us a call to talk about whatever you'd like to.
9300728	9303691	Perhaps something we've talked about tonight or something that we missed.
9304511	9306273	You can also still vote on list lists.
9306333	9312800	We'll close that up at the end of the show, the very end tonight, once everybody has had a chance to call in or what have you.
9316327	9318408	Loki, do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls?
9319389	9320690	Just one, Grant, that's auto-related.
9321191	9342928	It's been found by digging through the files of the game that it makes reference to PC and PlayStation 4 in the form of Orbis, so most likely those versions will be coming, and I would assume that an Xbox One version would be coming as well unless there's some sort of financial exclusive trickery or whatever that they're going to be pulling.
9343269	9343449	Hmm.
9344009	9346391	Alright, let's go to the phones because we are getting a call.
9346451	9347512	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9347552	9347933	Who's this?
9348733	9349554	Hello, it's Shane.
9349674	9350355	Hey, Shane.
9350375	9350895	How you doing?
9351856	9354498	I am running a dungeon, so I'm doing pretty well.
9354778	9356640	In Final Fantasy XIV, you're multitasking?
9357341	9359621	Well, I might not pay attention to the phone call.
9360622	9363942	Well, thanks for calling when you had so much attention to give us tonight.
9364542	9366163	How is Final Fantasy XIV going for you?
9366223	9367343	You're all the way in Endgame, right?
9368403	9383206	Yeah, I am actually running a dungeon that's for max level, and it seems pretty terrible so far because the tank left when the three of us that joined said we've never ran this one before, so we just auto-quit the dungeon.
9384557	9385137	What a jerk.
9385797	9386418	I know, right?
9386778	9388978	Check out his name so I could publicly shame him.
9389038	9389438	You should.
9389498	9390199	Do that in the future.
9390899	9397001	Quickly, I know you'll talk about some of this on Horde House this week, but what is there to do when you get to the endgame in Final Fantasy XIV?
9397581	9398201	What happens when you get to 50?
9399141	9402762	Gear up for the actual endgame, because that's what I'm doing right now.
9402862	9409504	I'm running the hard mode primal battles, so I got a weapon from there already, which is pretty awesome.
9409524	9410625	It took only two tries.
9410945	9411105	Mm-hmm.
9411705	9416789	and I'm running level 50 dungeons to get like currency to get better gear.
9417269	9420092	So after the grinding of leveling up comes more grinding?
9420732	9422493	Yeah, but it's not bad.
9422533	9423494	I'm having fun with it.
9423574	9424395	Alright, well that's important.
9424755	9428258	Alright, well did you call to talk about 14 tonight or what did you want to talk about tonight?
9428678	9430859	Now, I called to talk about the 2DS.
9432020	9432440	Oh, yes.
9432720	9435822	The Nintendo 2DS was announced, what, last week?
9435862	9437003	About a week ago or two weeks ago?
9437203	9437763	Two weeks ago.
9437984	9443427	A lot of internet anger about this thing.
9443527	9452092	How dare Nintendo put this thing out because it looks stupid, basically, was the verdict of the internet courtroom.
9452752	9453693	What do you want to say about it?
9454613	9472882	well I if you know my job I kind of get Nintendo stuff early and so I have my 2DS and I have to say that I just barely barely like it less than my 3DS XL it is a wonderful system really?
9473383	9481387	yeah it's comfortable to hold the way the design the slate design is awesome like
9482507	9483729	I don't know.
9483749	9487455	If the screens were a little bit bigger, I probably wouldn't play my Excel at all.
9488376	9489858	It's that nice to me.
9490639	9493323	What do you think people on the internet are getting wrong about this thing?
9494445	9494786	I'm not...
9495779	9507692	I'm not sure they are, because it's geared really more towards an entry-level, first-time, current generation of Nintendo handheld experience.
9507892	9512978	So these people that are saying, oh, this is awful, why would anybody get this?
9513058	9514360	It's not geared towards them.
9514400	9516982	It's geared to the five and six-year-olds that...
9517623	9525409	didn't have one before or the person that didn't want to shell out $170 to play the latest Mario or Pokemon.
9525449	9531734	Now you can shell out $130 and you don't get the 3D features but you still get a really great experience.
9532755	9533976	I know a teenager who wants a 2DS.
9536003	9564410	pretty much for that reason yeah it's great I really hope a lot of people get their hands on it if you are going out to GameStops or Walmarts or Targets this week you might run into a Nintendo app and they might be able to show you one so you can play around with it and see how you really feel about it but I love it and the little case that you can buy extra is adorable and it's also shaped like a piece of toast so it's pretty cool
9565553	9570136	Would you really have dropped the $129 or whatever the price is?
9570156	9572077	Would you really have dropped that amount of money on this device?
9572697	9576399	If I didn't have any form of 3DS, yes.
9576659	9580361	If I had a regular 3DS and then got to mess with this, yes.
9580962	9583903	But because I have an XL, personally, no.
9584563	9590507	But that's just because I already have an XL, and I think this is just slightly under the XL in terms of how great it is.
9593029	9594311	Pokemon's almost here, right?
9594971	9595692	Yeah, it is.
9595712	9596733	Are you excited about that?
9597654	9597855	What?
9597875	9598956	Are you excited about that?
9599426	9601849	No, I'm not excited whatsoever for Pokemon.
9602549	9604291	Aren't they supposed to announce something?
9605252	9607334	Didn't Twitter tease some type of announcement tomorrow?
9607494	9608535	Tomorrow at 8 a.m.
9608615	9609276	Pacific.
9610017	9615582	So it's the first time in forever for some sort of announcement that I don't have to get up early for.
9615802	9616303	There you go.
9616924	9620827	Do you think it might be anything that's not about X and Y?
9620888	9622769	Like something in the future of Pokemon?
9622789	9622870	Yeah.
9623450	9623910	I'm not sure.
9624611	9625411	I really don't know.
9625571	9629414	I'm just as excited as everybody else is.
9629814	9634798	Alright, and before we wrap up tonight, why are you so damn excited about Pokemon X and Y?
9634878	9636379	What about it is exciting?
9638200	9641722	It's taking the game to the new graphical and like...
9642603	9645585	I don't know what the word is I'm looking for.
9646266	9655594	It's the evolution of Pokemon and that's exciting because black and white, it was a nice jump but it wasn't a real jump.
9655634	9657775	It was kind of like a little step up.
9657855	9659437	This is a huge jump forward.
9660362	9660682	All right.
9661283	9664065	Well, Shane, if you don't have anything else, I guess we'll let you get back to your dungeon.
9664245	9665326	But thanks for calling.
9665506	9665806	All right.
9665846	9666367	Bye.
9666647	9666987	Bye.
9667407	9669169	He makes it sound like he didn't want to call.
9669189	9673472	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9673512	9677275	If you want to call, this is also the last call to vote in listless.
9677815	9681016	You do need to be a registered VOG participant, but we don't charge money for that.
9681036	9681656	We're not like that.
9682216	9687838	Just sign up at vognetwork.com, and then you will see the board up at live.vognetwork.com.
9688398	9691038	And a big thanks to Bobby Blackwell for coding this little game.
9691339	9694999	And he had to fix it on the fly tonight because I guess it was actually broken when it went to tabulate.
9695039	9699921	It was taking the last list we did, which was the first one on the system, and it was combining the votes together.
9700261	9701801	So the wrong answer was winning.
9702521	9703101	But he fixed it.
9703242	9704762	So now we have the accurate results.
9705522	9708685	Uh, the last time we did listless was thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.
9708945	9711066	So it gives you an idea how long ago that was.
9711567	9714329	So, alright, so this is your last chance to vote in listless.
9714349	9718211	Don't forget to vote for your number one and your number two answer with your first and second clicks there.
9718952	9721154	Uh, again, phone lines are open if you want to give us a call.
9721174	9725156	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9725697	9727938	Uh, I will try to bring up the Twitter topics here real quick.
9728299	9729740	Uh, no other last minute stories, Loki?
9730800	9731361	No, I'm just...

9751909	9756892	Yeah, you know, the phone lines haven't been lighting up as much this month as previously.
9756992	9759634	Like last week, I seem to remember, was really tough.
9759834	9761295	We barely got any calls last week either.
9761696	9762136	It was weird.
9763317	9765778	Do I have to have another open Skype challenge?
9767760	9771002	No, I figure, you know, some weeks people have things to say and some weeks they don't.
9771042	9773524	This was a pretty slow news week, all things considered.
9773544	9778047	There wasn't really anything that really ignited passion maybe in previous weeks.
9779066	9780027	Candy Crush Saga
9802284	9805206	All right, you've heard of the game Namco Cross Capcom, right?
9805306	9805526	Yes.
9806827	9810149	And the now spiritual actual sequel, Project Cross Zone.
9810430	9815693	Yes, the name of our panel at GamerX was inspired by that podcast, Cross Zone, yeah.
9816174	9816434	Nice.
9817034	9820877	I just want you to know, I have been playing this game for about three weeks straight.
9820917	9823559	I have almost 50 hours logged into the game.
9823579	9823959	Wow.
9824539	9831264	I mean, this is like... I see my... I'm sitting here watching stuff on DVR to catch up, and I'm like, pause...
9832261	9844285	Go grab your 3DS, sit down, unpause, just turn the volume down on the game, start playing, and I'm like, pause DVR, put the volume back up, put the headphones on, and just keep playing.
9844585	9846406	What is it about this game that makes it so amazing?
9846446	9852488	Is it just the cutscenes and this and the way you get sucked into it that way?
9852988	9858330	No, it's the fact that I call it, and it's not just a tactical RPG game,
9858846	9861168	It's an action tactical RPG.
9861468	9862329	Real time RPG.
9863250	9871657	Whereas before, you know, with games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars, you set your characters and you sit there and you watch them attack each other.
9872778	9887030	In this, you move your character to the person you want to fight and then the screen comes up, you hold down the attack button, you do one attack, then you do another series of combinations like it could be attack and left and up and down and then right.
9887271	9890402	and it'll just keep doing a series of attacks right behind each other.
9891675	9892576	Project CrossZone
9919274	9921516	I'm not hearing a lot about this game.
9921556	9924338	It seems to be a game that really is flying under the radar.
9924398	9926580	What do you think people are missing about this game?
9927801	9932264	I think it's because you have different gaming properties in it.
9932304	9942252	You have Rival Schools, you have Space Channel 5, you have .hack, Street Fighter, the Tales of series, Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Force.
9942352	9942732	It's like...
9943673	9949498	It's pretty much Sega, Namco, Bandai, and Capcom just had a freaking gaming orgy.
9951519	9953521	And the storyline is just phenomenal as well.
9953561	9954742	And you get to clean it up.
9955423	9955583	Yeah.
9958345	9958925	That sounds hot.
9959986	9964530	So even the storyline incorporates all this cross-IP fuckery.
9965725	9973852	I think I sent Jamie a screenshot or I posted it on my wall for her to look at for a little in-joke or something like that.
9975653	9979736	I believe that you did, and I can't get onto my Facebook right now.
9980517	9982038	Yeah, something about the fantasy zone.
9982078	9982518	Get ready.
9982558	9985401	I'm like, oh, Jamie's going to love that.
9985661	9986722	One of Jamie's favorite quotes.
9987422	9987642	Yes.
9988283	9988403	And...
9989850	9990471	Thanks for watching!
10009899	10023585	Alan Alchemy in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, no shade, but it's a fan service game with a lot of niche franchises in a format, Strat RPG, that generally isn't a heavy hitter and only appeals to certain gamers, which of course makes it completely phenomenal.
10023905	10029428	Is this one of these hipster games that might save the Xbox One if tonight's list is to be believed?
10029448	10029528	No.
10030328	10039414	Maybe, but I was just saying to a bunch of friends of mine, if they ever did a brand new Naruto video game in this style, I would sit there and play it from start to finish.
10039674	10040455	Because it would fit.
10042236	10045878	Well, Ranma, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?
10047819	10050141	My liver will never forgive me from this past weekend.
10051141	10051502	How so?
10053127	10058973	I went to Nauticon, a 21 plus anime gaming convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
10059193	10059814	Oh my.
10061115	10062777	Oh, you have no idea, good sir.
10065199	10071546	Let's just say in one night, I drank typically what I would have drank over three nights.
10072561	10073021	Wow.
10073562	10075263	That was like me at DragonCon, though, to be honest.
10076284	10078906	But I haven't been drinking a lot lately, so I've been well-behaved.
10080147	10080447	Alright.
10081168	10082769	Well, Ranma, I'm glad to hear you had fun.
10082789	10093317	You can hear all about that con and more cons on your little program that you co-host here at VOG Network Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights, right?
10093777	10094277	That's right.
10095798	10099900	Pre-show starts around 9.15, 9.20 right after our brand new Neighbors at Electric Sisterhood.
10100080	10101060	Sounds awesome.
10101120	10101861	Alright, take care, buddy.
10102401	10102781	You too.
10102981	10104662	Bye-bye.
10104682	10107844	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10107884	10112906	We have about one more moment to take calls and we'll reveal the results of this list as well.
10115567	10119190	I was just going real quick to see if we had any tweets.
10119590	10121772	And we did get a couple tweets from TigerClaw.
10121972	10124874	And one of the stories he tweeted us, I remember reading about this.
10125214	10126615	Did you hear about this on the internet this week?
10126695	10127136	J.J.
10127316	10131939	Abrams emotionally hurt by the latest Star Trek game.
10131999	10133020	Yeah, I saw that.
10133120	10136462	I wasn't going to post it, but I was like, that's stupid.
10136582	10138404	What did you guys think about that?
10138484	10140425	That he was so hurt about it?
10140605	10141286	I could see that.
10141806	10142026	Yeah?
10142066	10142847	That game was pretty bad.
10143367	10144408	I heard it was pretty bad, too.
10144728	10147129	Alright, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.
10147189	10148790	I love this icon this guy has, too.
10149110	10150011	Hi, you're on Orgasmons Radio.
10150031	10150451	Who's this?
10151071	10152012	This is Codeman.
10152052	10155214	Hey, Codeman, I love your little user picture.
10155334	10164278	It's like, who I envision is you and a little creeper drawn Minecraft-style with little Mickey Mouse balloons and mouse ears.
10164338	10169061	Like, it's the most random collage of worlds, but I love it.
10169661	10170802	I want to make it
10171448	10172209	It's absolutely fantastic.
10172249	10172329	Yeah?
10190181	10193424	You know, I haven't played the first one in so long.
10193684	10200449	And bringing that back into my life, because I remember I was 17 when it came out, and I bought it on launch day.
10201289	10204552	And I remember playing it and imagining...
10205347	10208328	How could any game get any better than this game?
10209268	10210569	Because I'm a huge Disney fan.
10210829	10212029	I'm a huge Squeenix fan.
10212389	10215410	And so I'm all over all of these games.
10215471	10224674	And so when they came together and made this fantastic game, I was just going crazy.
10225194	10228475	But when they announced that they were releasing this,
10228800	10229640	This is HD remix.
10229700	10231601	I absolutely went crazy.
10231641	10234801	And so when I popped it in, I started playing it.
10234861	10235782	They have changed.
10235902	10240743	Of course, I never played the final mix because it was never released in North America.
10242763	10245164	But the music sounds different.
10245264	10245464	It is.
10245544	10248504	Obviously, the graphics are just phenomenal.
10251741	10252702	and just things.
10252882	10259105	I mean, there's so many different things now that maybe I missed when I played it earlier or they weren't actually in there.
10259185	10259645	I don't know.
10259985	10264327	I think, too, just the fact that it's been, what, 12 years since the game was first out.
10264347	10268630	I think you just kind of catch on to more and you're probably a different gamer now than you were then.
10269050	10271031	So you just kind of find different things that way.
10271391	10272832	But is it just me, Codeman?
10272992	10275633	Or did you lose skill over 12?
10275913	10276754	Or maybe you got better.
10276814	10277214	I don't know.
10277274	10281016	But why am I so bad at this kids game?
10281656	10284298	This game is tough as hell.
10285118	10290782	I'm playing on proud mode because I figured, okay, I'm going to play on proud mode.
10291002	10302209	I started Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and I still want to play Dream Drop Distance, but like I said in chat earlier, I don't own any Nintendo handhelds, and I'm trying to figure out...
10304676	10306738	I'm anticipating the infamous fight with Sephiroth and I'm just like, okay...
10333942	10336203	I've beaten him several times when I was a kid.
10336263	10347886	Like, I beat him a million times because, you know, he was a tough, you know, the platinum, I can't remember what it was called, but it was like the platinum whatever that you fought him and then you got like a special keyblade and all that stuff.
10347906	10350127	But he was like the hardest character in the whole game.
10350640	10357343	I'm anticipating that fight because I know now I started playing it again and I'm like, God, this game is so difficult.
10358163	10360504	And I don't remember it being that difficult when I was a kid.
10360744	10361344	No kidding.
10361645	10363445	I'm still getting my butt whipped by servers.
10363805	10372729	But I seem to recall, and I think I might have had to do this the first time I played too, you can actually skip that fight and go on to the next world and then go back and do it later and it's a lot easier.
10372789	10374250	So I think that's what I'm going to end up having to do.
10375491	10375591	Um...
10404238	10408661	Well, you know, because I've watched your live streams.
10408821	10411723	I don't really get a whole lot of time to do anything, really.
10411783	10415825	So I have to watch your live streams when you post them like a nerd.
10416465	10427572	But I watch your live streams and I find how hilarious it is when you play... Paranormal wasn't as bad because I don't think that game... I don't know.
10427772	10429613	That game's kind of cheesy to me.
10429673	10430034	I don't know.
10430274	10433776	I played it and some of the scares were fine, but...
10434178	10436800	But then when you played Slender Man, that was hilarious.
10436860	10439922	And so I'm trying to figure out something in my head.
10439962	10453551	I was like, okay, so what can I buy Rob to play that would be the funniest, scariest, and all-around entertaining livestream that he can play?
10453971	10455613	But this game, Outlast, came out.
10455633	10459635	And one of the guys that I talked to that was on my podcast, he...
10461877	10464742	He was like, this game is the scariest game I've ever played in my whole entire life.
10464842	10469350	And so I was like, okay, well maybe this is the game that I should... And I never really heard a whole lot about it.
10469390	10469891	I mean, I watched...
10471645	10499731	and you know whatever but like I don't really play games like that so I thought okay well maybe I should gift that to him so I gifted that to you and you are in for a ride my friend I hear it's something else I'm not a big fan of the blood and gore and apparently there's plenty of that in Outlast but I will make good on a live stream at some point I'm not sure when but soon we'll see we'll see you gotta tear me away from Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts for a little bit first but I do really appreciate it you know what you're talking about
10501512	10507096	Code Man, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, get listless done and all that stuff, but any last quick thoughts for us?
10509337	10512980	If you're not playing the Kingdom Hearts HD remix, you should definitely pick it up.
10513020	10516783	And also, Rom, I gotta party with that guy sometime.
10516823	10518884	That guy, he sounds like a fun character.
10518964	10520205	He is a very fun character.
10520245	10523968	If you ever go to New York City, you look him up and say Rob Roberts sent ya.
10524048	10524929	He'll show you a good time.
10525529	10527671	Well, I have a friend in New York that...
10528843	10533144	I don't want to speak for him you will have to just listen to Anime Jam Session to get all the latest
10551588	10552029	All righty.
10552309	10552609	All right.
10552849	10553570	You take care, my friend.
10554070	10554310	All right.
10554351	10554611	Thanks.
10554731	10555031	All right.
10555211	10555551	Bye-bye.
10556312	10559034	Thanks for the calls, guys, but we are going to close up the Skype line for now.
10559194	10568162	If you had something you wanted to say and you didn't get through, you should absolutely email us, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com, or you can always tweet us.
10568722	10596440	Such as Tigerclaw did with one other story I want to read here real quick About the PlayStation 4 sharing options and the whole game recording Apparently, things coming out about how you're going to have to break the DRM Of the high bandwidth digital content protection If you want to stream outside of the built-in game streaming Which, as you know, could be shut off for certain games Because PlayStation 4 doesn't have component cables And that's how people were getting around it on the PlayStation 3
10599037	10601118	There's ways to strip that out.
10602859	10605220	There's like purples you can get.
10605480	10610043	There is apparently like a box you can get that strips it out, like an HGCP stripper.
10610063	10612364	But when you do that, you're breaking the law.
10612764	10617747	You are violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it prohibits.
10617767	10620288	Oh, yeah, they're going to send cops to your house right away.
10620308	10620929	That's right.
10620989	10622410	They will call the po-po.
10622550	10624851	It's just like when you rip off that tag on your mattress.
10625131	10626652	They hear it, they're all,
10627032	10628632	Someone's been ripping the tag.
10628692	10631513	No, it's only if you resell it after ripping off the tag.
10633093	10634874	You don't get arrested for ripping off the tag.
10634914	10637114	The seller does, just so you know.
10637554	10637794	All right.
10638074	10642555	By the way, I have to read this amazing drag from Alan in chat.
10642916	10643396	I love this.
10643456	10644536	Alan Alchemy in our chat room.
10644996	10649497	This was in response to Tiger Claw's article earlier about how JJ Abrams was emotionally hurt by the game.
10650057	10653478	Perfect way to end the show here with Alan Alchemy literally dragging this.
10654478	10662367	Star Trek fans are emotionally hurt by his shitshow fanfic of Wrath of Khan and saying he doesn't like pretentious intellectual Star Trek and never did.
10662688	10663269	Sorry about it.
10666192	10666773	For the record?
10667313	10668695	For for you, Alan Alchemy.
10668735	10669876	You go, Alan Alchemy.
10672339	10673020	Yeah, for the record?
10673340	10673961	I wasn't hurt.
10676601	10678182	Then again, I'm the DS9 fan.
10679162	10679483	Alright.
10680803	10689749	That's going to about do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but before we get final thoughts, we have one other thing we've got to take care of, and that is tonight's list list.
10689769	10690809	Don't you want to know what won?
10691530	10692410	Yay!
10692830	10693711	So let's get to it.
10696161	10705208	Here it is, the top three as voted on by you guys at live.vognetwork.com The board is now away.
10705249	10708311	You can no longer vote because here are the answers.
10708431	10708992	The winners.
10709052	10709832	No ties tonight.
10709852	10712274	This is a very clear top three tonight.
10712795	10719440	The number three answer for the thing the Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again.
10719861	10720901	The number three answer?
10721702	10724444	A more interactive banning system.
10724665	10724925	Wooo!
10726482	10730604	The number two answer for a thing that could make the Xbox One popular again.
10731104	10732524	Detach Connect.
10734425	10740927	And last but not least, the number one way that you will be popular all over the internet, Microsoft.
10741167	10742768	You got to announce this tomorrow.
10743548	10748150	You buy the Xbox One, a free waffle iron with every order.
10749110	10750651	Because they're waffling.
10752111	10752511	Get it!
10752771	10755832	Alright, there it is.
10755852	10756472	Your number one answer.
10756512	10758472	A free waffle iron.
10758492	10759412	Kids like waffles.
10760253	10761213	I like waffles!
10761973	10762993	Waffles!
10764133	10765574	A big thanks to Captain Spike.
10765654	10772215	Unfortunately, none of his answers made the top three, but I will say his answer on hipster exclusives was the number four result.
10772415	10772935	So there it is.
10772955	10773935	Mega Man Legends of Sammoo 3.
10773975	10775235	That was the number four answer.
10776255	10778776	Followed right by Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.
10778856	10778996	So
10779796	10781698	So close yet so far, Captain Spike.
10781738	10782779	I did love his answers.
10782799	10783980	Fly, Phil, to the moon.
10784000	10784541	I know, right?
10784581	10785302	I got that stuck.
10785462	10786703	Like I'm having a Bayonetta moment.
10786723	10789186	And let him flame among the stars.
10790267	10793810	In other words... Kiss my ass.
10798860	10803745	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom saying, anticipation would have won had DarkSakura not been a meanie.
10803805	10809451	Well, that's... That's... Them's the breaks here on Listless.
10809611	10810993	I want you to picture something.
10811834	10813856	Imagine you're standing in an open field.
10814176	10816279	Imagine a world without you crying.
10816319	10816620	No.
10817240	10819163	Imagine you're standing in an open field.
10819223	10819504	Yes.
10819804	10821907	And you're looking up at the sun.
10822628	10831140	And then suddenly, five letters float in front of the sun, completely blocking out its light, and it's S-H-A-D-E.
10836847	10842172	And on that note, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.
10842893	10844274	Maybe I'll sing us out tonight.
10844354	10846356	Fly me to the moon.
10846857	10850140	You know, the other half of the fans are saying Evangelion.
10850720	10853883	There's like 50 million versions of that song.
10853923	10855084	Or Utada Hikaru did one.
10855124	10856065	Utada Hikaru did one.
10856085	10857447	I think it was on a Dance Mania album.
10857507	10857767	Anyway.
10858488	10860891	I've got like the album version.
10860911	10862733	Next April Fools on VOG.
10862854	10864696	All we will do is play covers of that song.
10865196	10865617	Hear me out.
10866037	10866338	All right.
10869942	10871104	Let's wrap it up, guys.
10871144	10873286	Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10873326	10874348	Thank you for participating.
10874628	10875509	Thank you for being here.
10875549	10877792	Whether you were here live, whether you were listening to us on the podcast.
10878092	10879113	We really appreciate it.
10879213	10883055	And all we ask, guys, tell a friend or two or five or seven about the show.
10883395	10885797	Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
10885877	10889899	You guys are what helps our fan base grow and grows our family.
10890160	10892621	And yeah, just thank you guys for your support.
10892661	10893522	We so appreciate it.
10893902	10895603	We'll be back next week to do it all again.
10896163	10899565	But for now, we're going to wrap up with final thoughts tonight.
10899866	10901487	I'll go first with my final thought tonight.
10901847	10903108	My final thought is...
10903968	10910349	You know, Grand Theft Auto V is probably going to do very well even though it's being released right before all these new consoles come out.
10910730	10917591	I really wish Final Fantasy XII would have gotten the same break because Balthier and Fran are still like some of the best characters ever to come out of that series.
10918191	10920012	Maybe they'll do an HD remake.
10920072	10921272	Fingers and toes crossed.
10921292	10922592	There was that rumor some time ago.
10922692	10925193	So I plan to buy the X remake.
10925613	10927753	If the X remake is as good as Kingdom Hearts, I'm on board.
10927773	10929734	They still haven't announced one that's coming out yet.
10929754	10930594	I'm still waiting.
10931758	10932899	Hopefully by the end of the year, I hope.
10933139	10933459	Yeah, hopefully.
10933479	10933779	We'll see.
10934239	10935319	All right, that's my final thought.
10935539	10936379	Loki, your final thought.
10937620	10939600	I'm going to play lots of Grand Theft Auto V this week.
10939620	10940141	Of course you will.
10940161	10945542	And hopefully now that it's out there, maybe we can livestream some of it because that would be fun.
10945562	10946102	It would be fun.
10946582	10948603	Last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10948963	10950964	Fly me to the moon.
10950984	10951524	Of course.
10951604	10954565	And let me play among the stars.
10955465	10956725	That's all the singing you're going to get out of me.
10957065	10957405	All right.
10957445	10958106	Hey, that's something.
10958126	10959126	We usually don't get singing here.
10959811	10962014	Thank you guys again so much for listening to the show.
10962074	10966739	We'll be back here to do it all again next week with episode 520 of our show.
10967480	10968161	A fifth of the way to 600.
10968221	10969783	For the record.
10969823	10970464	For the record what?
10973982	10975923	In other words... Shut up.
10976563	10979425	You know, the more I think about it, we're going to be episode 600 before you know it.
10979765	10982186	This show might actually make it to episode 666.
10982286	10984347	I'm just saying.
10984547	10985468	Dun, dun, dun.
10985528	10987369	Those are like the big episodes we have left.
10987409	10988910	We have 600, of course.
10989270	10992511	We have 573, obviously, is going to be a big episode for us.
10992591	10994032	We'll explain that later if you don't know.
10994272	10997434	And then 666 would be like, we've got to do something...
10997734	11011703	but if we make it to 777 we have to do like a whole Final Fantasy 7 I'm gonna be like 43 I will be 43 when we get to 777 alright that's it we're done goodnight everybody and have a great night bye
11015805	11016445	See you next week.
11047270	11048691	Thank you for watching
