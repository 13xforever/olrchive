7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	27000	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Steam allows you to share games with your family, buzz begins around a new geometry wars, a beloved music game continues its lineage onto the Wii U, Final Fantasy is headed to cell phones, and Loki reviews Grand Theft Auto V.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio here on September the 15th of 2013 with the 519th episode of our show.
45000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	58000	I want people to buy my anime sales.
58000	68000	Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Slow your roll here. What are we talking about? You are digging through your vault and getting rid of some things. Last week you were trying to hawk Rare Games.
68000	73000	Yeah, which I'll still take 300 bucks for Final Fight Guy in the box with the manual.
73000	75000	And now what? It's anime sales.
76000	89000	Although I may have a buyer for my most expensive one, but I have two Beat X sales, two Fushigi Yugi sales, and the other one that I have up is Dragon Ball Z.
89000	91000	Is that what this show is for you? A place to hawk your wares?
91000	101000	Yes it is. No. But I would rather this stuff go to people who I know would appreciate it and that I would at least be able to see a picture of it from time to time.
101000	102000	Oh, there you go.
102000	104000	Hey, that was mine.
104000	107000	Alright. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
107000	108000	Hi.
108000	110000	Loki, what are you selling on this show tonight?
112000	115000	I have DVDs on eBay right now, but that's about it.
115000	116000	That's about it, huh?
116000	118000	Not really selling anything.
118000	127000	Well, as I mentioned, we are live here and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
127000	130000	vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
131000	134000	Probably an Ouya next week because I really don't play that anymore.
134000	135000	You'd be selling your Ouya?
135000	136000	Yeah, I think so.
136000	137000	Yeah. Boy, the Ouya's...
137000	139000	I think Dan would give you five bucks for it.
139000	141000	Oh, I'm looking for a little bit more than five bucks.
141000	147000	The Ouya stuff, I know we have some stories on it coming up later, but it certainly seems like it's going downhill fast.
147000	151000	And what's wrong? What went wrong in Ouya town?
151000	157000	It's just the support, the whole thing's been kind of mishandled from the beginning.
157000	167000	Like even with just shipping, first shipping the Kickstarter stuff, there are some people that have Kickstarter that still haven't received their units yet.
167000	168000	Oh, wow.
168000	175000	When that thing went to retail back in June and Kickstarter, you know, backers still haven't received their units, that's a little messed up.
175000	178000	And then on top of that, how they handled this whole...
179000	181000	Are they sitting in a DHL warehouse somewhere?
181000	187000	Probably. It's probably some DHL black hole. I don't necessarily blame, you know...
187000	189000	I would be so mad if I was one of those people.
189000	191000	I would blame them for going so cheap as to where...
191000	198000	You know, DHL is just the big problem right there, but the fact that you chose to use them, you know, that's not a good idea.
198000	206000	I mean, just use the, well, you know, the post office because you're shipping across, you know, the ocean, but...
206000	212000	They had to be cost effective though. I mean, you know, a $99 system means you're gonna take some budget corners, right?
212000	217000	Well, that's still mishandled though. I mean, charge more for shipping then or something, or charge shipping.
217000	224000	I don't know what you need to do, but yeah, this is really handled poorly and just their customer service is just terrible.
224000	234000	And on top of that, now with this whole, you know, free the games thing, it's just not working out to what they want it to be or what people want it to be.
234000	238000	It's being abused and, as we'll get into later, they don't fucking care.
238000	245000	So what happens now to these other Android consoles? Do you think Ouya's kind of wrecked it for everybody?
245000	250000	Or do you think that maybe, you know what, there's a rumored Amazon console, wasn't there a Mad Catz?
250000	251000	I can't keep track of them all now.
251000	256000	I think that a lot of it is gonna be, people are gonna be a little cautious about these micro consoles and stuff.
256000	260000	I don't think it's ruined it. I mean, definitely people are gonna be comparing any console that comes out to the Ouya.
260000	270000	But in the case of the Mad Catz console and stuff, that just plays straight up Android games that you can get on the Google Play Store and you can tie your Google Play account to.
270000	279000	So I don't think they're really in that much trouble since it can be, you can basically map your controller to work with games that don't even use controllers and stuff like that.
279000	282000	So I think that's kind of cool and that might end up working out for them.
283000	298000	And then like the GameStick and stuff where they have their own stores, that might be a little bit tricky when they have their own marketplace and they're kind of separating themselves from everybody else because they want a piece of the money from the games they're selling on there.
298000	300000	I don't know, it's just, we're gonna have to wait.
300000	308000	Because right now, I mean really, there's only one console out there. It's just the Ouya, the GameStick, which was supposed to come out months ago, also been delayed and delayed.
308000	317000	That's not coming out, I think, at the end of October now. So, I mean, then again, they announced that they were coming out in September, so by the time we get into October, they can announce November, who knows.
317000	322000	So, I think, I don't know. I think the PSP TV, though, could be pretty good.
322000	325000	Do you think, well, before you, you mean the PS Vita TV?
325000	326000	Whatever.
326000	328000	PSP TV, I think, would be a little bit dated at this point.
328000	330000	Well, that's what people wanted, so you can do with that.
330000	340000	Well, yeah, that's true, whatever. Well, anyway, before you cut corners there, I was gonna say, a lot of people, I think, were predicting that this was gonna screw Kickstarter, too.
340000	345000	Because, in a way, the Ouya, in these unfulfilled orders and so forth, were giving Kickstarter a bad name.
345000	351000	But then, you look at something like Mighty No. 9, and you're like, well, no way, Kickstarter still has a TARDIS team.
351000	356000	No, no, there's plenty that they're doing to give themselves a bad name. It's not even necessarily this.
356000	361000	There's a lot of shady things that go on in Kickstarter that they just kind of allow, you know.
361000	369000	Like, I've mentioned a few times about that whole, like, you know, my nine-year-old wants to make an RPG, fund my project type thing, and how that was a big ol' scam.
369000	374000	Or, at least, it's very, it's heading in that direction quite quickly.
374000	378000	You know, and there's been a lot of other, like, scams.
378000	382000	And a lot of them even, like, with this Ouya thing, which we'll probably get into a little bit more.
382000	387000	I mean, I heard about that Great Iron Thunder and stuff, and where it was being backed by family members.
387000	396000	I mean, there was, like, 187 people backed it, and they had, like, or 193 people backed it, and they had, like, $187,000 raised.
396000	403000	I mean, that's a little odd. That's way off of the norm as far as, you know, the percentages of backers.
403000	408000	And then, legitimate projects that are also trying to, you know, be backed that same method, you know, that free games thing.
408000	414000	They're not even making their funding goals because they just, they're not cheating. They're going legit, and they just can't make the money.
414000	420000	You know, $50,000 for a goal for, first off, for an Android game seems a little high.
420000	421000	Yeah.
421000	426000	I mean, and considering that they're doubling that budget when they match, you know, the funds, $100,000 for an Android game.
426000	434000	I mean, that's, especially on the Ouya. I mean, you're talking, like, you know, I mean, there's some probably high-end projects on there,
434000	442000	but a lot of these Ouya games are being developed by a team of, like, maybe one person to, like, maybe five, you know, very small teams.
442000	444000	I don't think you need $100,000.
444000	449000	I think the tough thing, too, with these is that these sites are really about pre-ordering.
449000	455000	It's essentially, these are all pre-order sites, and if the rewards aren't good, I don't think people are going to buy into it.
455000	461000	And some of the Kickstarters that I've seen fail just did, they failed because the rewards weren't adequately priced,
461000	464000	and, you know, you've got to think about reward fulfillment.
464000	469000	You know, obviously, Ouya was having some issues with that, and, you know, that can be a big pain in the butt, too.
469000	474000	The Kickstarters I usually see that are successful are usually these games that people want.
474000	477000	There's something going to be tangible out of it. There's something that's going to be had.
477000	484000	You know, these send my nine-year-old to RPG camp or whatever aside, those are the few and far between.
484000	492000	I think, unfortunately, a lot of these more charity quote-unquote things, you have to really catch on viral or it ain't going to happen.
492000	497000	And I think there's a lot of wishful thinking out there. I had a friend just recently do an Indiegogo that didn't do so well.
497000	504000	And I kind of think a lot of that was that the, I don't think he really pushed well enough what rewards were in it.
504000	509000	Well, in Indiegogo, they've got weird stuff like Indiegogo, you can do the flexible funding, so where, you know...
509000	512000	Well, that's why he did it, because he still got half of it, at least.
512000	518000	Yeah, you get money. Well, here's the thing, if you don't make your full funding, there's no obligation to do anything with that.
518000	526000	So, if you get people convinced enough to where you can basically make some of the funding and they don't pull it out at the very end, free money!
526000	533000	Yeah, that's kind of scary. Alright, well anyway, we can talk about all these things all day long, but I want to get into games.
533000	541000	I was going to do our gaming weeks, but before we get into our gaming weeks, obviously there's one game that I know Loki has been very excited about.
541000	549000	For a very long time, and so I want to ask Loki about Grand Theft Auto 5, because I know he finally got his hands on the game this week.
549000	557000	I guess I should say this first, it came to my attention that there's some sort of embargo out there for press reviews until tomorrow morning, 10 AM.
557000	565000	As an indie site, we are under no such embargo, we were not given a media preview copy of this game or whatever.
565000	568000	Thanks to Loki's industry connection, he has other ways.
568000	572000	So if they want to avoid this in the future, they need to hook us up.
572000	577000	Well, there was a guy in Oakland selling some for $120.
577000	592000	I don't want to resort to silly blackmail. I know you're being facetious, but it's one of those things where it's like, fans of the game will find a way and some of these people work in the industry like Loki and can do that.
592000	602000	There's people that had it way before me. It's coming out of Gamestop and Targets and those people that are getting their pallets of shit.
602000	605000	You know, that stuff way before everything else.
605000	610000	Alright, so we're a whole 15 hours early, but you can't really do a full review of the game, right?
610000	612000	No, I've only played like 8 hours of it.
612000	617000	Alright, so tell us Loki's little preview of the game from your extreme fanboy perspective.
618000	624000	Honestly, even though, yeah, I am a fanboy of the series and stuff like that, it is a fantastic game.
624000	632000	It is, they have just taken, like Grand Theft Auto IV when I first played it was just a big like, holy crap, this looks amazing, that type of stuff.
632000	638000	This, Ford has nothing on the, this is just ridiculous, the amount of detail that they have.
638000	650000	And it's not just murky and kind of brown and stuff like Liberty City was, it's just, it's very vibrant and colorful and there's, you know, a lot more interactivity, a lot more detail.
650000	661000	Detail I think is the main thing there because they've narrowed it down so much, like there's tons of pedestrians walking around and they're not just doing, just walking, they're interacting with things.
661000	668000	You can hear conversations going on. There's, you know, tons of things to do in the game, just all sorts of stuff to see.
668000	675000	Like I've only played it for 8 hours and I haven't even been to most of the map in the game. It's just huge.
675000	684000	And one of the things I do like about it though is the characters that they have created in it are great, they're very interesting.
684000	692000	And each one has like their own kind of stuff going on and then at the same time their kind of stories intertwine with each other.
692000	702000	And so you kind of figuring out how, how that's happening because you have Franklin who's kind of this, you know, gangster guy that's trying to go legit.
702000	709000	He's just trying to get out of that life and stuff and just trying to make money, make an honest living I guess.
709000	718000	And then you have Michael who's this retired bank robber who's, you know, killed people and done all sorts of crazy stuff.
718000	726000	Then you have Trevor who's just fucking nuts. And so you have all these characters and how they interact and stuff. It's just, it's ridiculous.
726000	736000	Can we talk a little bit about the vastness and the things to do in the game because even in the short like 3 minutes I saw in the studio before we went live tonight,
736000	745000	I was like, wow, I can tell that the size of this game and the size of the continent that you're on is way bigger than previous Grand Theft Auto games.
745000	755000	And you were in this plane and you were flying and I was really taken aback by the detail and the ground and that the city was in the distance and you could even see like the fog around the city.
755000	758000	Like it was very impressive looking for a current gen game.
758000	766000	Yeah, it is very, I'm just amazed that they can do that on, you know, these current gen consoles. I mean, it looks really good.
766000	776000	And even just like the details with, you know, as time progresses through the night and stuff when you're driving around, you know, at night people will be street racing.
776000	782000	You'll see that going on. You'll see cops chasing after, you know, just cop cars going by and stuff.
782000	791000	You know, if you see a car or something like that crash or you catch a car and fire, you know, eventually the fireman will come and put out the fire and all sorts of stuff like that.
791000	793000	But tell me, can you drive a piano?
793000	796000	You can't drive a piano. That's just, that's a mod.
796000	799000	But can you drive to Pianu?
799000	808000	But they've got like, for example, they have the Santa Monica Pier or their version of it and it's got a roller coaster you can go on.
808000	811000	It has, you know, the Ferris wheel you can go on.
811000	820000	One of the missions you had to be a play as Michael, your daughter was hanging out with these, you know, porn directors and stuff like that.
820000	822000	And they thought that she's going to go shoot porn.
822000	824000	Gasp! Gasp! Pornography!
824000	828000	And so he dives off the pier to go swim to their yacht that they're on.
828000	832000	And of course, you know, the water looks amazing compared to like four.
832000	834000	It's just, it's so detailed.
834000	838000	And when you dive in there, I forgot, oh, hey, that's right, there's underwater.
838000	845000	It's just, you know, this huge underwater area that you can see and just the detail in there.
845000	849000	And there's sharks. You can get eaten by a shark. That's actually an achievement.
849000	850000	Is there a sharknado?
850000	852000	There's not a sharknado.
852000	853000	Wait for the DLC.
853000	855000	There's all sorts of animals, though.
855000	861000	There's a deer in one of the, the first mission you play as Trevor that runs out in front of your car.
861000	864000	And I tried to miss it both times, but it's scripted that it'll hit your car.
864000	868000	I'm trying to think about some of the other crazy stuff.
868000	870000	You know, they have the strip club and stuff.
870000	873000	Yeah, I heard it took you no time to find some titties in the game.
873000	879000	There's full frontal or topless women in the game, unlike the pay season four.
879000	881000	You know, straight up boobies in this one.
881000	890000	And, and they even have a little mini game portion of it where you're supposed, you can touch the strippers while the, you know, secured, the bouncers aren't looking and stuff like that.
890000	892000	Can you invite someone in for some coffee?
892000	896000	If, if you, you can, you can get them, you can do a booty call with them.
896000	898000	Yeah, if you want it later on.
898000	902000	You know, of course, you know, the same, the prostitute stuff is.
903000	915000	What else did I do? There's one, one portion of the game where Michael takes drugs and he has this massive trip where he sees aliens trying to abduct him.
915000	917000	And so he has to take him down the minigun.
917000	922000	There was a funny thing that was done with this website.
922000	927000	It's like a Facebook type thing, life. It's like a life stalker or something like that.
927000	928000	How appropriate.
929000	936000	And you have to infiltrate their headquarters in order to sabotage something. And it really goes weird.
936000	944000	But do we, do we still have the classic Grand Theft Auto mainstay? Are you still allowed to get the services of a hooker and then kill them?
944000	945000	Yes, of course.
945000	947000	So are there male prostitutes and male strippers too?
947000	948000	No.
948000	950000	See? Patriarchy.
951000	952000	No, I'm serious.
952000	963000	But, but to, to your, to be fair, though, there is male full frontal nudity in the game, but not full frontal female nudity in the game.
963000	964000	So we get Wang.
964000	965000	Yes.
965000	970000	That's patriarchal. That's, that's unfair. It's matriarchal. In fact, it is.
970000	973000	Well, we could use a little bit more matriarchy, OK?
973000	974000	But yeah.
974000	977000	No, I do agree. To be serious, I do agree. Fair is fair.
977000	986000	But one of the first things I did was I, I stole a jet from the airport and I tried to land it on a highway and I accidentally hit a billboard and crashed.
986000	989000	The second time I did that, though, I did actually manage to land it.
989000	993000	It's just, there's gonna be a ton of stuff to do in this game.
993000	999000	They're saying already 100 hours, at least, of gameplay in this and I could, I could definitely see that.
999000	1001000	It's interesting. The storyline is great.
1001000	1007000	And plus, if you just don't want to do the storyline, there's so much to do and there's so many activities and just stuff to fuck around with.
1007000	1011000	There's some characters from Grand Theft Auto IV that do make a return.
1011000	1021000	In fact, you know, I don't want to spoil anything, but there is one character in particular from IV that meets his untimely demise, the very first mission of Trevor's, you know.
1021000	1024000	So it gets interesting.
1024000	1028000	I'm sorry. I'm just laughing here because I'm watching our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1028000	1033000	And of course, Dr. Sakura was in there going, you know, when are we going to get our game with male strippers and prostitutes?
1033000	1039000	And then, oh, never mind. Never mind. Never mind. Y'all, I'm fine. We got cock. We're good. I'm good. I'm good.
1039000	1042000	There's cock and boobs. I'm happy. There's equal representation.
1042000	1049000	OK, so if you want a game that has male prostitution in it and Saints Row 2.
1049000	1054000	Saints Row 2 has whoring as a side mission. You can whore as both male or female.
1054000	1058000	So you can man whore in that or, you know, all sorts of stuff.
1058000	1062000	See, I would have to make like a special man whore.
1062000	1067000	All right. Look, going to our chatroom for some other comments, live.vognetwork.com.
1067000	1073000	Alan Alchemy says Grand Theft Auto IV was too bleak. The story was great, but it was all very super serious.
1073000	1079000	Hopefully Five injects a tiny bit of the insanity we've come to love from Grand Theft Auto III and Saints Row.
1079000	1084000	There's a lot of these people that you meet on the street, kind of like the stuff in Grand Theft Auto IV.
1084000	1087000	We can meet like these random strangers and do things they call them.
1087000	1094000	It's like freaks and strangers missions or something like that. And there's one that's a member of the paparazzi.
1094000	1099000	And so this first thing you're doing is you're riding the first mission you have with him, you're riding or driving a motorcycle.
1099000	1105000	He's taking pictures on the back of the motorcycle, trying to get like crotch shot of some celebrity or whatever.
1105000	1110000	The second one is you find out, oh, hey, this one celebrity is really into anal sex.
1110000	1115000	Let's go take a picture of her having anal sex in her backyard. And so, yes, that's what you do.
1115000	1119000	You sneak up on her. You take a picture of her having you record her having anal sex.
1119000	1124000	And then she comes and chases after you with her boyfriend. She's like trying to run you down with her car.
1124000	1126000	It's like a Paris Hilton type.
1126000	1131000	That's that's that's not so much like insane, like Saints Row, Saints Row IV or whatever.
1131000	1137000	That's just you nasty. Like Grand Theft Auto V, what you're describing is just you nasty.
1137000	1143000	Dungeon Busters said in chat that an adult game that's actually adult, but fifth dreams retort.
1143000	1148000	Not an adult game would entail not being able to pay your bills, access your pregnancy and your car breaking down on the way to work.
1148000	1153000	It's not entirely graphic. It's just, you know, her pants are down. The guy's pants are down and there's something going on.
1153000	1156000	I mean, you can't see anything. It's not like, you know, very detailed.
1156000	1158000	I believe you said anal sex.
1158000	1160000	There's also dog sex in the game.
1160000	1164000	Why do you keep bringing up anal sex on the show?
1164000	1168000	Yes, the first mission that you have, Chop, he has sex with a dog, too. So.
1168000	1170000	Oh, my God. You're nasty.
1170000	1172000	It's dog sex because there's two dogs.
1172000	1176000	Yeah, that's why you can put that on the back of the box.
1176000	1180000	My review, you like dog fucking.
1180000	1183000	You're like Grand Theft Auto V along with Raven, of course.
1183000	1186000	You know, you're nasty. It's a great game. It seriously is.
1186000	1192000	You know, all strange is society. It's great. It's got a bunch of really interesting characters.
1192000	1197000	Tiger Claw in chat says, I heard you can also smoke weed in Grand Theft Auto V.
1197000	1198000	Yes, you can.
1198000	1201000	Does it lower your heart rate and decrease depression?
1201000	1205000	No, it doesn't really do anything other than, you know, trip up the screen for a little and he talks like weird stuff.
1205000	1213000	He like spouts off weird like ideas like they should forget something about the Internet he was rambling on about.
1213000	1217000	But so reading the Internet drove him to smoke weed. Not surprised.
1217000	1222000	Let's see. D'Artatia says, so is this Loki's game of the year?
1222000	1228000	Probably. Yeah, it's most likely it's it's really, really good.
1228000	1231000	I mean, I've only played eight hours of it yet, so I don't know.
1231000	1238000	You know, a lot of the missions that they're showing off, like, you know, talking about in the press, I haven't really gotten to yet.
1238000	1240000	But so far, it's been interesting.
1240000	1247000	I did the first heist mission, which was fun, and I don't know, it's just it's going to be good.
1247000	1252000	And I know tomorrow you're going to see a lot of perfect ten views or at least high nines.
1252000	1254000	High nines, perfect tens. I guarantee it.
1254000	1256000	And a couple dog fucks.
1256000	1261000	Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, dog fucking lovers have been so underserved in the gaming community.
1261000	1265000	Well, now a game for y'all. You nasties.
1265000	1267000	Let me ask this question.
1267000	1275000	I also saw a GIF on on Reddit where it shows Franklin running up to a cow in like a field.
1275000	1279000	He kicks over the cow. So there's all sorts of like animal violence and stuff in this game.
1279000	1283000	Oh, I'm sure animal violence is hilarious, Loki.
1283000	1286000	It's a fake. It's not real.
1286000	1289000	OK, I'm not saying go kick a real cow. It's it's fake.
1289000	1293000	It's a digital cow. All right. Digital violence is OK.
1293000	1295000	Which actually that does lead me to something.
1295000	1296000	Go ahead.
1296000	1301000	Did you see I reposted on my Facebook a while back, but Fox News put up a poll.
1301000	1304000	Do you think that violent video games cause violence?
1304000	1306000	I was all over the Internet. Yeah.
1306000	1310000	Well, yeah. But it was like 90 percent of the responses was no.
1310000	1314000	Well, yeah, but that's because 4chan, I'm sure, did something to the poll.
1314000	1317000	Like when I looked at it the first time, it was a little more even.
1317000	1321000	When I look gives two fucks what some Internet poll has to say.
1321000	1324000	But just wait for all the news to come out after this.
1324000	1329000	You know, thank you for that was the point I was getting to.
1329000	1334000	Oh, is I, you know, usually bring up something to make a point.
1334000	1338000	The point I was getting to is that I wonder what they're going to say after,
1338000	1342000	you know, the game is officially out and there's reviews of it and say,
1342000	1345000	well, our poll was skewed because that game man came out yet.
1345000	1346000	And maybe you can.
1346000	1350000	I'm picturing a meme in my head with the Game of Thrones guy where it says,
1350000	1352000	Brace yourselves.
1352000	1356000	Cable News gets Grand Theft Auto 5 this week or something like that.
1356000	1358000	Now, now, now. This is Cable News.
1358000	1361000	We won't be talking about Grand Theft Auto 5 for like another 10 years.
1361000	1364000	They'll realize it, you know, after Grand Theft Auto 7 comes out.
1364000	1366000	Grand Theft Auto 5 is super viral.
1366000	1368000	Abor, abor, abor, abor.
1368000	1371000	You can also drive a riding lawnmower in the game, which is awesome.
1371000	1372000	Can you re-
1372000	1374000	But not a piano. What's up with that?
1374000	1376000	Because pianos don't drive.
1376000	1379000	I have seen, for real, a motorized piano. Thank you.
1379000	1381000	Can you reenact scenes from The Happening?
1383000	1386000	Plants do not attack you, as far as I'm aware.
1386000	1388000	What? No!
1388000	1391000	But, but I do hear, because I've been reading a lot of Reddit,
1391000	1395000	I do hear, though, that there is possibly, because what, they,
1395000	1397000	here's the great thing about Grand Theft Auto.
1397000	1400000	This is how you do an homage to your older games.
1400000	1404000	All the cheat came, all the cheat codes from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
1404000	1406000	work in this game, by the way.
1406000	1407000	Huh.
1407000	1408000	Which is awesome.
1408000	1411000	Some people could care less about the story.
1411000	1413000	They just want to run around and kill people.
1413000	1416000	They did, like, a lot of the things that, you know, there's all these, like,
1416000	1419000	there's a killer in the woods, you know, in San Andreas.
1419000	1424000	You know, that was one of the big myths of San Andreas.
1424000	1428000	And now I think they did put that in there as an Easter egg.
1428000	1430000	All right.
1430000	1433000	Let me ask one more question, then we'll get into the rest of our gaming weeks
1433000	1436000	and the games that Jamie and I have been playing this week.
1437000	1441000	Since we are talking about another game from the same generation,
1441000	1444000	I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is from the same generation,
1444000	1446000	but the way you describe Grand Theft Auto 5,
1446000	1450000	and from what I've seen, really makes it sound like it pushes things so much further.
1450000	1454000	What do you think really changed to allow Grand Theft Auto 5
1454000	1458000	to push the boundaries in ways that Grand Theft Auto 4 apparently didn't,
1458000	1461000	even though at the time we thought it was pushing the boundaries?
1461000	1464000	You know, I'm surprised at how they were able to do it.
1464000	1469000	They must have really gone through and just tweaked the shit out of their engine,
1469000	1472000	because they've gotten in a way now where they basically have made it,
1472000	1475000	okay, listen, we can make this map as big as we want it to be.
1475000	1478000	You know, storage being the only limitation.
1478000	1480000	Storage and, I guess, RAM.
1480000	1483000	But the detail is ramped up so much from 4.
1483000	1487000	There's, you know, first off, there's animals in there.
1487000	1488000	There's a ton more cars.
1488000	1490000	The detail's a lot bigger.
1490000	1491000	It's more colorful.
1491000	1493000	There's a lot more to do.
1493000	1497000	They have this whole ambient soundtrack in there
1497000	1502000	for when you're not listening to stuff that actually is contextual to what you're doing.
1502000	1504000	There's more animations.
1504000	1507000	There's just a lot more better AI.
1507000	1510000	They've basically taken every aspect of Grand Theft Auto 4,
1510000	1513000	split it all apart, and improved upon everything.
1513000	1517000	You know, combat in the game is a lot better.
1517000	1521000	One of the things I did notice, I have run into a couple glitches.
1521000	1523000	Let's be honest, there were a few glitches.
1523000	1526000	I ran into one where I was using Franklin's special ability,
1526000	1530000	which slows down time when you're driving to be able to maneuver quickly.
1530000	1535000	And I hit a fence in a certain way that when I undid the,
1535000	1539000	or when I turned off the power or whatever they had,
1539000	1541000	it flipped my car upside down.
1541000	1543000	I got stuck on top of a fence, which is kind of funny.
1543000	1545000	And then there was another one.
1545000	1548000	It was one of the other things.
1548000	1552000	Oh, I used to be able to run and jump and grab onto a wall and stuff like that,
1552000	1556000	but a lot of times it doesn't quite work the same way in 5.
1556000	1559000	And so you'll end up running to jump to grab something,
1559000	1562000	and instead it'll kind of flop against the wall and slam into the wall,
1562000	1565000	which is kind of funny.
1565000	1569000	But I don't know. It's just very...
1569000	1572000	If you've played 4, you just need to check out 5,
1572000	1574000	and it's going to be very obvious what they've done.
1574000	1576000	It's just improved kind of all around.
1576000	1579000	I'm pretty sure anybody who touched 4 is probably making their plans to get 5.
1579000	1581000	But here's the thing with 5.
1581000	1584000	I think even just in sandbox games in general,
1584000	1586000	I think this is a good example of what to do.
1586000	1589000	There's a lot of improvements with just...
1589000	1592000	Even though the world could be the same size,
1592000	1596000	the city is bigger, but it just seems a lot bigger
1596000	1599000	even in the same amount of space that they had before,
1599000	1602000	just all the detail that they packed in.
1602000	1604000	I lied. I thought of another question before we get to gaming weeks,
1604000	1607000	because before the show, TigerClod sent me this link
1607000	1609000	wondering if we were going to talk about it tonight,
1609000	1611000	and I thought now was a good time to bring it up.
1611000	1614000	There's an actual petition on change.org
1614000	1617000	that quite simply says to Rockstar Games,
1617000	1620000	don't make a PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5,
1620000	1622000	and the title of this is,
1622000	1625000	So PC Gamers Learn Their Lesson and Stop Stealing Games.
1625000	1628000	That is the most stupid thing I've ever seen.
1628000	1632000	How are most people playing Grand Theft Auto 5 right now if they're not in the press?
1632000	1634000	They probably stole it, so...
1634000	1638000	Playing it on PC has nothing to do with the ability to pirate a game.
1638000	1642000	I always thought the allure of PC was, well, for one,
1642000	1645000	some people like the keyboard and mouse and some people like PC,
1645000	1647000	but modding is huge on PC.
1647000	1651000	Well, you've got people like me who have problems with controllers.
1651000	1653000	Loki, care to comment?
1653000	1655000	There will be a PC version at some point.
1655000	1657000	There will be a PlayStation 4 version at some point.
1657000	1659000	It's already leaked out. It's in the configuration files
1659000	1661000	that they make reference to that stuff.
1661000	1663000	So it's coming. It's just they haven't announced it yet
1663000	1665000	because why would you cannibalize your sales
1665000	1667000	for this current gen?
1667000	1669000	It'll come out maybe a year later.
1669000	1671000	With DLC or something.
1671000	1673000	The thought was before, they were saying,
1673000	1677000	oh, well, you see, the PC version came out later for 4
1677000	1679000	than it did with...
1681000	1685000	I guess it came out later for 4 than it did for Max Payne or something.
1685000	1688000	Well, yeah, because 4 had an exclusivity thing on it
1688000	1691000	where it only came out on Xbox at launch.
1691000	1695000	And then later on, once that exclusivity ran up,
1695000	1697000	then it came out on PlayStation 3
1697000	1699000	and that's when the PC version came out as well.
1699000	1703000	So with that not being the case anymore,
1703000	1705000	I think it's just going to be that they're going to wait
1705000	1707000	for some systems to sell
1707000	1710000	and they're going to wait for the sales to start dipping down a little bit
1710000	1713000	because why would you say,
1713000	1715000	oh, yeah, by the way, the PlayStation 4 version's coming out
1715000	1717000	and no one's going to buy it because they're going to buy a new system?
1717000	1719000	Brad from Pod Culture asks,
1719000	1722000	now will Grand Theft Auto 5 be one of those $9.99 upgrades?
1722000	1724000	No way, Jose.
1724000	1728000	I mean, the $10 upgrade stuff is mostly for stuff this year anyway.
1728000	1731000	It's to encourage people to make the leap sooner rather than later.
1731000	1735000	So a game like Grand Theft Auto 5 kind of doesn't need the upgrade program.
1735000	1737000	It'll sell.
1737000	1739000	Also, if I may,
1739000	1742000	I would like to encourage people not to use change.org
1742000	1744000	because they sign you up for 50 million mailing lists
1744000	1746000	every time you sign a petition.
1747000	1749000	Unless you're going to sign this petition, then by all means go ahead.
1749000	1751000	No, if you're going to sign this petition,
1751000	1753000	then just don't tell me about it because I'll probably berate you.
1756000	1758000	Let's see.
1758000	1760000	Going to our chat room for more comments,
1760000	1762000	live.vognetwork.com, Datatrack says,
1762000	1765000	is it sad that all I really enjoyed was the electronic music
1765000	1767000	from the old Grand Theft Autos?
1767000	1770000	Well, that makes me think, how's the soundtrack for the game?
1770000	1772000	It's pretty good.
1772000	1774000	I also like the electronic music,
1774000	1776000	I haven't really been messing with the radio stations
1776000	1778000	because I forget, I think there's two electronica stations,
1778000	1780000	but I can only find one of them.
1780000	1784000	I do like how they change the way you do the radio stuff.
1784000	1787000	Now you hold down a button and then you select it from a,
1787000	1790000	there's like a radio selection that you select it from.
1790000	1792000	But yeah, there's a lot of music in the game,
1792000	1794000	a ton of music.
1794000	1796000	I think there's like 15 radio stations in it.
1796000	1799000	And even, like I said, when you're not listening to the radio
1799000	1801000	and you're just in a mission and stuff,
1801000	1803000	the contextual soundtrack that they have in there is really nice.
1804000	1811000	And plus, the other thing too is if you're sensitive to the N-word,
1811000	1813000	you might not want to pick up this game.
1813000	1815000	Just saying.
1815000	1817000	Well, all the other games kind of use that word
1817000	1820000	and other provoking words.
1820000	1822000	Yes.
1822000	1827000	There's a lot of, you know, because of Franklin's missions and stuff,
1827000	1830000	it has to do with gang banging and stuff.
1830000	1833000	So, I don't know, it's just interesting.
1833000	1835000	Seriously, check out the game.
1835000	1836000	I love this.
1836000	1838000	My phone just went off on Twitter.
1838000	1839000	I just got a tweet.
1839000	1841000	I retweeted it so you all could see there.
1841000	1844000	A tweet here from Marcus Boi, B-O-I, on tweet.
1844000	1847000	It says, Grand Theft Auto 5, you nasty addition.
1847000	1849000	And look at the box art.
1849000	1851000	Look carefully.
1851000	1854000	It's inserted there in the corner.
1854000	1855000	Oh, our listeners rule.
1855000	1856000	That's awesome.
1856000	1857000	Thank you for that.
1857000	1858000	I needed that.
1858000	1859000	Alright.
1859000	1861000	Is that all we're going to say on Grand Theft Auto 5 right now?
1861000	1862000	That's fine.
1862000	1864000	I'm sure you'll talk about it plenty more in the coming weeks.
1864000	1865000	Yes, plenty more.
1865000	1867000	When you have more time to get your hands on it.
1867000	1869000	Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week.
1869000	1870000	And how was your gaming week?
1870000	1871000	Dark Sakura.
1871000	1872000	What other games have you been playing this week?
1872000	1874000	Final Fantasy XIV.
1874000	1876000	I'm almost 21.
1876000	1877000	They finally fixed my account.
1877000	1879000	I'm so happy.
1879000	1880000	I played Animal Crossing.
1880000	1881000	You didn't have to call them and get on them either.
1881000	1882000	No.
1882000	1883000	It just magically happened in the middle of the night.
1883000	1884000	It just happened on Monday.
1884000	1887000	What they were doing is they were actually handing out other
1888000	1890000	basically, like, for people who had the collector's edition,
1890000	1892000	they were handing out new collector's edition codes
1892000	1894000	so that you could put it on the proper account.
1894000	1898000	And then they said they would close whichever one was inactive.
1898000	1901000	So I actually went ahead and closed the inactive account myself
1901000	1903000	so that my characters would be okay.
1903000	1908000	And I played a little bit of Dragon Age Origins.
1908000	1911000	I'm going to be starting over on that one
1911000	1914000	just because I really do not like how my character turns out.
1914000	1917000	And I kind of... I was really...
1917000	1921000	I felt nauseous playing through the female city elf thing.
1921000	1922000	I was just really nauseous.
1922000	1927000	I don't want to finish the character.
1927000	1930000	And what else did I play?
1930000	1932000	Oh, yeah, I played some more Fractal,
1932000	1937000	which Fractal is my game that I don't really...
1937000	1939000	I mean, I care if I beat the level or not,
1939000	1941000	but it's one that I don't mind the challenge
1941000	1944000	because I'll get so close.
1944000	1946000	It's really a difficult game
1946000	1948000	once you get up into the higher levels.
1948000	1951000	And I am just short of beating level 20,
1951000	1954000	which I'm pretty proud of myself for making it that far
1954000	1959000	because there really is a lot to keep track of in that game.
1959000	1962000	Also, one of our listeners gifted...
1962000	1967000	I thought we were all gifted with a copy of Don't Starve,
1967000	1969000	but it came on my account.
1969000	1970000	I don't think I got that.
1970000	1971000	Oops.
1971000	1972000	It's fine.
1972000	1975000	Well, one of our listeners gifted me with Don't Starve, then.
1975000	1978000	So I haven't started it yet, but it's installed.
1978000	1979000	Okay.
1979000	1980000	I wanted to check that out,
1980000	1984000	so when the whole lending thing that we'll talk about later comes into play,
1984000	1986000	I'll have to check that out.
1986000	1988000	See, that's a really good thing
1988000	1991000	because for all of us who are into different games,
1991000	1993000	that gives us a chance to review everything.
1993000	1994000	Or was it today?
1994000	1995000	Because I haven't checked today.
1995000	1996000	No, it was a couple days ago.
1996000	1997000	Okay.
1997000	2000000	I was actually just half asleep, heard my email beep, and checked.
2000000	2001000	I was like, oh.
2001000	2005000	No, actually, I just want to say a big thank you to...
2005000	2007000	Well, A, I want to thank all of the listeners
2007000	2009000	who take the time to listen to this show every week
2009000	2013000	because it often kind of comes to light how many of you there are
2013000	2016000	that maybe aren't actively participating with the show,
2016000	2017000	but that are just listening,
2017000	2020000	whether it be on Stitcher or Apple Podcast app or whatever.
2020000	2022000	So I just want to say thank you for listening, for one.
2022000	2028000	But B, those of you guys that take the time and money
2028000	2034000	to actually buy us a game is such a cool, unexpected, nice thing.
2034000	2039000	Actually, one of our listeners, Codeman, got me out last this week,
2039000	2041000	which is supposed to be a super scary game.
2041000	2047000	And I think it's to egg me on to do a playthrough on Twitch TV
2047000	2048000	to do a playthrough of that.
2049000	2055000	But I just want to say I'm always very humbled by the generosity there.
2055000	2059000	Well, hopefully this week I'll have a chance to give it a better play
2059000	2063000	just because I've got nothing to do except school.
2063000	2066000	And now all the major holidays are over, thankfully.
2068000	2069000	And there's also...
2069000	2074000	Now, it's not a game, but I don't know if I've told people about it.
2074000	2076000	I might have mentioned it.
2076000	2079000	It's a neat little app, is what it is.
2079000	2082000	And I've been playing with it.
2082000	2084000	It's called Art of Glow.
2084000	2088000	And basically all it is is you draw and it animates everything
2088000	2089000	that you draw in different colors.
2089000	2092000	You can change how it does.
2092000	2095000	But I've actually been making kind of a game with it
2095000	2097000	by seeing how I can control the colors on it.
2097000	2099000	It's actually just a fun little waste of time.
2099000	2102000	But it's not a game, per se.
2102000	2103000	It's just a neat thing.
2103000	2105000	So I've been telling people about it.
2105000	2106000	It's called Art of Glow.
2106000	2107000	Is it free?
2107000	2109000	There's a free version, I believe.
2109000	2112000	And then that Final Fantasy XIV Libra came out,
2112000	2114000	which I've been playing around in.
2114000	2115000	Yes.
2115000	2118000	I do like that on Final Fantasy XIV,
2118000	2122000	every free company or whatever has a forum on the official thing.
2122000	2125000	If you go in and look, you can actually look at everybody's little character.
2125000	2128000	So I guess I should plug real quick,
2128000	2132000	if you are playing Final Fantasy XIV and you want a free company to join,
2132000	2134000	you probably would have to roll a new character
2134000	2137000	unless you're already on Midgarcimer as a server that we play on.
2137000	2139000	But we do have our free company there.
2139000	2140000	It's called End of Line.
2140000	2144000	And it's been active, and we're already rank 5 or whatever.
2144000	2148000	Shane's really good about getting that 5% experience boost perk every day.
2148000	2149000	So yeah, it's good.
2149000	2150000	Yeah.
2150000	2151000	We're having a fun time.
2151000	2152000	I'm actually on my third dungeon.
2152000	2153000	Nice.
2153000	2155000	So when people want to run it with me.
2155000	2157000	Not to sound, but I lost count.
2157000	2158000	I think I'm on Dungeon 11 or 12.
2158000	2161000	But it's nice that they have all that to kind of keep you going.
2161000	2162000	So it's good.
2162000	2164000	Well, and I like that actually people who are higher level
2164000	2166000	can go back and play with people who are lower level.
2166000	2167000	Oh yeah.
2167000	2169000	Instead of, you know, just...
2169000	2171000	That was a big annoying thing about WoW,
2171000	2173000	is that if I had friends at different levels, I couldn't...
2173000	2175000	Right. No, that is great.
2175000	2177000	Because yeah, and I totally...
2177000	2179000	Well, I think I did help you run a dungeon the other night, right?
2179000	2180000	So even though...
2180000	2181000	You grabbed my first two with me.
2181000	2183000	Yeah, so even though I was level like 35 or whatever,
2183000	2186000	I was able to kind of level sync down to where you were at.
2186000	2188000	And it wasn't a face roll thing.
2188000	2189000	It was actually still challenging.
2189000	2190000	I had to be alert.
2190000	2196000	It wasn't necessarily difficult, but it was still, you know, a game.
2196000	2199000	And right now, you know, like, because I've had high holy days
2199000	2201000	this past, you know, couple weeks,
2201000	2203000	and I've had that crap with my account going on.
2203000	2208000	So for me, I actually feel like I'm starting to catch up a little bit better, you know.
2208000	2213000	But it was still nice that, you know, I can do that to play with folks.
2213000	2215000	Which I would say I hope you had a happy holiday,
2215000	2217000	although I know it's not really happy.
2217000	2218000	So I hope you had an insightful...
2218000	2219000	An easy fast. Nope.
2219000	2221000	An easy fast. That's what they... Okay.
2221000	2223000	For Yom Kippur, don't tell...
2223000	2227000	Okay, everybody who does not know anything about Judaism,
2227000	2231000	never tell someone happy Yom Kippur because it's not a happy holiday.
2231000	2233000	You fast for 25 hours.
2233000	2235000	That alone does not sound happy.
2235000	2237000	With no water or food.
2237000	2238000	Oh my gosh.
2238000	2240000	Because you're supposed to afflict yourself.
2240000	2241000	Oh.
2241000	2242000	And, you know, no...
2242000	2246000	And this also was on Shabbat, so it was like no internet, no nothing, no work.
2246000	2248000	No fun.
2248000	2252000	But you spend the day basically being apologetic and introspective.
2252000	2257000	So if you want to wish somebody something, you can tell them Shana Tova,
2257000	2259000	you know, good new year, because it's right after Rosh Hashanah,
2259000	2261000	you can tell them to have an easy fast.
2261000	2263000	And that would be a pleasant thing to say.
2263000	2266000	Can I tell you like I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over?
2266000	2267000	Yes, you can.
2267000	2268000	Fist bump.
2268000	2270000	Can you eat a juicy hamburger in front of them?
2270000	2271000	No.
2271000	2272000	It's so good.
2272000	2273000	Now you're being insensitive.
2273000	2275000	There's synagogue all day anyway, right?
2275000	2278000	Yeah, there's synagogue all day and there's no hamburgers at synagogue.
2278000	2279000	No in and out at synagogue.
2279000	2280000	No standing in the window.
2280000	2281000	All right.
2281000	2282000	No, I'll tell you.
2282000	2285000	Well, actually we have police at our synagogue, so they'd probably say,
2285000	2287000	move along, move along.
2287000	2288000	No, I like that.
2288000	2289000	I will use that next year.
2289000	2290000	I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over.
2290000	2291000	Ew.
2291000	2292000	All right.
2292000	2295000	Just give me Adelbertos and then we'll say it's good.
2295000	2296000	All right.
2296000	2299000	Loki, how was your gaming week outside of the big one we talked about?
2299000	2303000	I played, actually, well, one sort of new game.
2303000	2306000	It was an old game, but new on PC.
2306000	2311000	I played Burnout Paradise because, hey, I got that in the Origin bundle,
2311000	2312000	so why not?
2312000	2317000	And it runs fantastic on PC, so played a bit of that.
2317000	2320000	And what else?
2320000	2325000	A little bit of Saints Row IV on PC, although I've kind of run out of things
2325000	2328000	to do in it, so I didn't play it for very long.
2328000	2330000	I was just checking out some of the new mods in there.
2330000	2333000	I have a hydraulics mod now that I All Ninja worked on,
2333000	2334000	so that's pretty sweet.
2334000	2337000	And what else?
2337000	2345000	Oh, also played a little bit of Call of Duty, and that's pretty much it.
2345000	2347000	My gaming week, I've also been playing an unhealthy,
2347000	2351000	bingeful amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm not sorry.
2351000	2353000	But I did play some other games too.
2353000	2356000	I would take a break once in a while to play some other games.
2356000	2359000	One of the big games I've been playing, of course, huge release this week,
2359000	2362000	Kingdom Hearts HD on the PlayStation 3 was one I had to pick up
2362000	2364000	on the day it was released, and I've been playing that a little bit.
2364000	2366000	I haven't really been binging on Kingdom Hearts,
2366000	2368000	but I've been playing it enough.
2368000	2372000	It's so gorgeous in HD, even right from the very beginning.
2372000	2374000	You remember the very beginning of Kingdom Hearts,
2374000	2376000	like the stained glass princess floors?
2376000	2377000	You have to show me after the show.
2377000	2379000	Oh, it's so beautiful.
2379000	2382000	In the HD and everything, and the televisions,
2382000	2384000	those colors just really jump.
2384000	2386000	It's a really pretty game to look at.
2386000	2389000	And of course, it's the game you remember from the PlayStation 2.
2389000	2391000	It's not like they really changed the game.
2391000	2393000	Except, well, it is the final mix,
2393000	2396000	but I find those changes to be a little bit minor,
2396000	2399000	but I know for the Kingdom Hearts fans, it's a big deal,
2399000	2402000	and the fact that it's out in the U.S. for the first time.
2402000	2404000	So that's cool.
2404000	2408000	I don't know if it's that I got older or worse at video games,
2408000	2410000	or they changed something in the game,
2410000	2415000	but I'm having kind of a hard time being able to beat things
2415000	2417000	that I used to be able to beat really easy.
2417000	2420000	Like, earlier today, I was playing in the Olympus Coliseum.
2420000	2422000	I was doing the Cerberus Boss, and it's like,
2422000	2424000	I can't beat this guy.
2424000	2426000	Like, am I really this bad?
2426000	2428000	And it even took me a couple times to even just get to him,
2428000	2431000	and I'm like, I don't remember this giving me so many problems.
2431000	2434000	I get really frustrated with the camera still, too.
2434000	2436000	Granted, they did make some changes.
2436000	2439000	Some of the things that they had done with Kingdom Hearts 2
2439000	2441000	in regards to control and things,
2441000	2444000	they went back and did with this, which I'm thankful for.
2444000	2447000	I'm so thankful for the fact you can invert the X and Y cameras
2447000	2450000	and all that, too, and just kind of customize that.
2450000	2452000	So nice.
2452000	2454000	But yeah, I don't know.
2454000	2456000	Still, sometimes I have problems getting the camera
2456000	2458000	to do exactly what I want it to do,
2458000	2460000	and it's the whole fact that the character gets stuck
2460000	2463000	right in front of the camera and some of those weird issues.
2463000	2466000	But it has improved from the first game,
2466000	2471000	but the battle system can still sometimes frustrate you a little bit.
2471000	2473000	Like, that's not really going to change.
2473000	2479000	But it's still a gorgeous story, just a lot of fun to play.
2479000	2482000	And yeah, I plan on playing more of it throughout the week
2482000	2484000	and hopefully get even further in the game.
2484000	2487000	Do you have an option of Japanese dialogue?
2487000	2489000	Ooh, I don't remember.
2489000	2491000	Maybe somebody in chat can answer that for me, because I do not remember.
2491000	2493000	I just think it would be nice if they gave you the option
2493000	2495000	that you can have any of the music in Japan,
2495000	2499000	well, you know, the Itada Hikaru stuff or any of the dialogue.
2499000	2501000	I don't think so, because I don't remember that coming up
2501000	2502000	at the very start of the game.
2502000	2504000	There are different levels of difficulty, and to be fair,
2504000	2507000	I'm playing it on normal, quote-unquote, difficulty.
2507000	2512000	I didn't drop it down to easy because I didn't remember the game being that hard,
2512000	2515000	but I guess maybe I was playing on easy the first time.
2515000	2517000	I didn't realize it. I don't know. So, whatever.
2517000	2522000	And Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com confirms, nope.
2522000	2525000	Ooh, I mean, not that I mind Haley Joel, but...
2525000	2528000	Yeah, well, and to be fair, the Blu-ray is packed pretty full
2528000	2530000	because it's not just Kingdom Hearts.
2530000	2533000	They also have Chain of Memories HD, which I haven't even touched yet,
2533000	2535000	but that whole game is in there waiting for you to play.
2535000	2538000	And then they have 358.2.
2538000	2542000	That isn't playable, but they turned it into, like, a three-hour movie.
2542000	2544000	So you can just watch all the cut scenes,
2544000	2547000	and I think that's where all that voice acting and all that stuff kind of came in,
2547000	2548000	the extra stuff that they did.
2548000	2552000	So that's all on one Blu-ray for 40 bucks.
2552000	2554000	So that is a great value.
2554000	2556000	A couple other games I played this week just quickly.
2556000	2561000	I played... there's some free games on PlayStation Plus right now,
2561000	2567000	so I checked out Galaga Dimensions, which is actually a couple years old.
2567000	2569000	It just happens to be free on PlayStation Plus right now.
2569000	2574000	Kind of a twin-stick shooter based very loosely on the original Galaga,
2574000	2577000	very loosely. It's more of a twin-stick shooter.
2577000	2580000	But I like... at first, I kind of didn't get it,
2580000	2583000	but the more I played it, the more I kind of got into it.
2584000	2587000	I kind of understood, like, okay, at the beginning of each level,
2587000	2589000	it's like drawing the patterns the bugs are going to fly in,
2589000	2593000	and then it's really about kind of setting off the bombs at just the right time
2593000	2596000	so that everything kind of... yeah, these chain reactions and everything.
2596000	2600000	So I like a game that kind of peels back the layers and shows its depth
2600000	2604000	the more you play it, what might look stupidly simple in the beginning.
2604000	2606000	So I do give Galaga props for that.
2606000	2608000	That was... because I remember playing it on 360 a couple years ago,
2608000	2610000	and I was kind of like, meh, don't get it.
2610000	2611000	I didn't really buy it.
2611000	2614000	But now that I have it for free thanks to PlayStation Plus,
2614000	2616000	I've been having a good time with it.
2616000	2619000	And yeah, that's really about it.
2619000	2622000	I played Star Wars Pinball for like 30 minutes too,
2622000	2627000	which was also free and does things that you would never see a regular pinball table do,
2627000	2632000	like flying X-wings and stormtroopers that pop up on the table and shoot your ball.
2632000	2635000	So there is kind of that sense of ridiculousness,
2635000	2638000	but they are well-done games from what I've played so far.
2638000	2641000	I mean, Zen does a great job with all their pinball games.
2641000	2645000	So that is pretty much my gaming week in a nutshell.
2645000	2648000	I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2648000	2649000	Robert M. in chat says,
2649000	2652000	I really can't get into Galaga Legion's DX personally.
2652000	2656000	For some reason the collision seems way too forgiving.
2656000	2659000	Yeah, I guess I could see that,
2659000	2662000	although I do notice that the game will do this slowdown thing.
2662000	2666000	Like if you're about to get hit, the game will suddenly like slow down and zoom in.
2666000	2668000	It actually does this in Pac-Man too.
2668000	2670000	I don't know if they kind of borrowed the idea from each other or what,
2670000	2671000	but it does this in Pac-Man too.
2671000	2674000	Like if you're about to die, the game will slow and that.
2674000	2678000	So it gives you a couple extra, not even a couple extra seconds,
2678000	2682000	like a couple extra milliseconds to react to it, which is kind of nice.
2682000	2687000	But I can see where that might also, just the whole collision thing in general,
2687000	2691000	might bug some more purists of bullet hell games.
2692000	2697000	Alright, that's really it as far as my gaming week and things I wanted to talk about.
2697000	2701000	So housekeeping, I don't really have a lot to say tonight.
2701000	2704000	So please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2704000	2707000	You can see that nasty thing I retweeted earlier.
2707000	2708000	That's always fun.
2708000	2713000	And follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2713000	2716000	Not a super busy week for news, if I'm not mistaken,
2716000	2718000	but a few big things to talk about tonight.
2718000	2720000	So look, you want to start us off?
2720000	2723000	Yeah, too busy of a week.
2723000	2729000	Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the announcement that was made on Sunday, actually.
2729000	2735000	There was the whole press conference thing going on in Japan for Sony.
2735000	2739000	They talked about a bunch of different game announcements and things.
2739000	2743000	One of which, of course, was the Vita TV.
2743000	2748000	Well, the Vita TV is this really small device that plugs into the TV.
2748000	2754000	It uses a DualShock 3 controller, which is not included with it unless you buy the more expensive bundle.
2754000	2763000	But it runs for about the equivalent of $99 US for the system itself or $150 with the controller bundled in.
2763000	2766000	And it acts like a Vita without the screen.
2766000	2768000	So you can play Vita games on it.
2768000	2773000	It has a spot for the memory card and for the Vita cartridges.
2773000	2777000	And you can also do the game streaming stuff that you can with the Vita.
2777000	2783000	Like, for example, you can stream PlayStation 3 games with it.
2783000	2789000	You can do PlayStation 4 games once that comes out.
2789000	2796000	The only thing that it's limited on is obviously you can't technically stream.
2796000	2800000	You can't play games that use the touch screen, obviously.
2800000	2802000	But yeah, you can play all the digital stuff.
2802000	2807000	You can watch Netflix on it because there's the Netflix app.
2807000	2812000	So all the stuff that you can do on the Vita except for the touch stuff is now on this device.
2812000	2816000	So you can play PSP games and PlayStation 1 games and all that fun stuff.
2816000	2822000	Is it just me or does it seem like some of the Vita games are kind of abandoning the touch stuff, especially the rear touch thing?
2822000	2829000	I can see that, but that's just almost the same way as a lot of the PlayStation 3 games abandoned the 6-axis stuff.
2830000	2834000	OK, this is going to sound horrible, but this is just how I've lost track of time lately.
2834000	2836000	Was that Japanese press conference this week?
2836000	2838000	It was Sunday night.
2838000	2840000	OK, that's why it was right after the show.
2840000	2842000	I actually stayed up for it. It was Sunday at 11.
2842000	2848000	I did too. So we should say at some point there's those new Vitas too, but do they even have the touchbacks?
2848000	2853000	No, they do. They're smaller and they don't have the OLED screen.
2853000	2856000	They have just a regular LCD screen.
2856000	2864000	And so they have that and they're a little bit cheaper, but they're multicolored and stuff and a little slimmer and all that fun stuff.
2864000	2869000	And I think they have one gigabyte of memory built in to the system.
2869000	2876000	Tigerclaw in chat says, why would you want to stream PlayStation 3 games on the PlayStation Vita TV when the PlayStation 3 is right next to it?
2876000	2881000	Well, this would be like the Vita TVs in your bedroom, right? And the PS3s in the living room or something like that?
2881000	2892000	That and also the fact that I think what this could be is when they actually do get to the point where they have their Gaikai streaming service available,
2892000	2899000	you don't even need a PlayStation 3 to stream PlayStation 3 games. You could play that stuff over the Vita.
2899000	2906000	I mean, eventually they're going to have it where it'll come to the Vita as far as streaming all sorts of things.
2906000	2915000	But I think this is mainly for playing Vita games, which I got to say is a great idea because even though the Vita does have the dual analog sticks,
2915000	2917000	though, it's still kind of awkward to hold.
2917000	2924000	And so I would love actually just having a dual shock available to be able to play that way, because I think that'd be great.
2924000	2931000	Yeah, I can't put my finger on it, but I really want one of these things and I don't even know why. They just look so cool.
2931000	2938000	It's a cheaper alternative. Let's put it this way. It's a cheaper alternative for a Vita and for a person like me that doesn't really play on the go.
2938000	2947000	I'm sitting on my couch anyways playing the Vita. This is fine because I'll just pop in a Vita game if I really want to play it and do that.
2947000	2956000	Hey, here's an idea. You know, I really wish they had this for like the 3DS, you know, where I can play with an external controller and play a game on my TV.
2957000	2959000	Like a Wii U controller?
2959000	2966000	No. That would be fine. Honestly, actually, that would be fine if that's the way they're going to get around having the second screen.
2966000	2974000	Although, to this day, I'm still saying that's a matter of time that they're going to have that where they will have 3DS games on the Wii U. It will happen.
2974000	2976000	The regular DS games first.
2976000	2981000	It just makes sense. Come on, they are lacking content anyways. They have a ton of fucking great 3DS games.
2982000	2984000	It seems like a simple solution.
2984000	2989000	Even DS games like Clubhouse Games and the Metroid Prime Hunters. God, there was a ton of shit on DS.
2989000	2991000	Pokemon! Come on!
2994000	3002000	Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, I want one, the Vita TV. If anything, to be able to play PSP and Vita games I missed out on on a big screen.
3003000	3006000	It's a better $99 spent than buying an Ouya.
3008000	3010000	Oh snap!
3010000	3019000	I'm all down for that. There's good Vita games out there. At the time, I didn't really want to have a Vita for all that stuff.
3019000	3028000	But this is not a bad idea. The thing is, it's not planned for the US and Europe markets yet. It's just for Japan.
3029000	3032000	I think it will eventually come out over here, but I can see why.
3032000	3040000	Because they did just drop the price of the Vita and it doesn't make sense to have another device come out and undercut your device that you wanted to sell.
3040000	3052000	So I think they're going to come out with it later on. Maybe it doesn't work. Maybe it's just not enough to push the Vita, the additional software and the price cut.
3059000	3068000	Well, let's move on and talk about Xbox for a little bit. There was a couple pieces of news about Microsoft this week. Some I'll talk about, some Jamie will talk about in a minute here.
3068000	3081000	One of them has to do with the domain, the XB1.com domain. But the way it was capitalized, it more looked like the infamous term you hear around the internet, the Xbone.com domain.
3082000	3089000	Excuse me. Gotta love the hiccups on live radio. Microsoft got this domain back this week.
3089000	3100000	Major Nelson, in a public way on NeoGaf of all places, going public and saying that the Xbone name disrespects the people that created the Xbox One.
3100000	3107000	He said, quote, I don't like it. It disrespects the teams that have put in thousands of hours already into the development of the product.
3107000	3110000	Sure it's cheeky, but I don't care for it myself.
3110000	3114000	Then maybe you should have named your fucking console Xbox One, you dumbass.
3114000	3122000	Well, isn't that what they called it? You said they should have named it. You mean they shouldn't have named it.
3122000	3124000	Should not have named it the Xbox One.
3124000	3125000	Should not have.
3125000	3126000	Should not have.
3126000	3132000	Just like, you know, if you were Nintendo and didn't want penis jokes, maybe you should have named your console the Wii. I mean, it's just a thought.
3132000	3141000	All right. Well, what's interesting about this domain is that it was originally purchased on March 20th of 2000.
3141000	3148000	So this domain was bought a long time before there was ever an Xbox One. Some people are saying, wow, they just got lucky with the guess.
3148000	3153000	I'm more thinking, well, wasn't this around the time the first Xbox came out?
3153000	3164000	And so maybe some lucky person thought that they would be calling the original Xbox the Xbox One looking back because you look at the PlayStation One, the PlayStation Two, PlayStation Three.
3164000	3170000	I think, you know, a lot of people would think that you would call that original Xbox the Xbox One.
3170000	3173000	They probably never thought that they would go back and make a new console named the Xbox One.
3173000	3174000	Right?
3174000	3175000	That doesn't fucking make any sense.
3175000	3185000	No, I think somebody just got extremely lucky and somebody was counting on Microsoft having the PlayStation naming conventions back in the day, but they just held on to the domain name for whatever reason.
3185000	3187000	And that was where they got lucky.
3187000	3190000	I suppose they were getting hits. I don't know.
3190000	3195000	Then there was some pure wank on the Internet this week. I don't know what to think of this. I'm just going to put it out there.
3195000	3196000	Y'all can discuss.
3196000	3204000	An anonymous report, so there's that right there, was talking to Edge.
3204000	3209000	These were anonymous developers saying that the PlayStation 4 is in a better state of performance.
3209000	3214000	The hardware isn't locked yet, according to this source.
3214000	3216000	The PlayStation 4 apparently more capable.
3217000	3228000	The same game running on both consoles at 1080p at 30 frames a second is on PlayStation 4, but it will run on a lower resolution and frame rate on the Xbox One as of right now.
3228000	3235000	I believe Microsoft put out a comment about this later on that was basically like, it's bullshit to summarize.
3235000	3245000	But what do you guys think? Do you think there's any, I mean, sometimes where there's smoke there's fire with this stuff, so I'll entertain it for a minute.
3245000	3253000	But the comment that they made wasn't necessarily that it was bullshit, but that it's not just about speed, it's about all the specs together that make the console and type things.
3253000	3257000	So it's like, yeah, that may be the case, but it's not going to matter.
3257000	3265000	I don't think it's going to matter anyways because you're going to have, just like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, spec-wise they were different.
3265000	3270000	So they still have to make the games perform pretty much the same on both systems.
3270000	3276000	So I think you're going to see pretty much the games playing the same on both systems. It's not going to be that dramatically different.
3276000	3286000	I think it has to play the same on both systems, or that's like, Microsoft would never put a system out there that can't handle it the same. You know what I mean?
3286000	3299000	Yeah, it's just not going to, you're not going to see something dramatically different. You're not going to have like, you know, Assassin's Creed 5 or something where it's stick figures on Xbox One and full 1080p graphics on the PlayStation 4.
3299000	3301000	It's just not going to happen that way.
3301000	3307000	Koopakid Jeremy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, are the games fun? That's all I care about.
3307000	3312000	I do agree, and it goes back to that old golden rule, right? The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3312000	3323000	But, you have to admit that if it does come out that, you know, such and such game, let's say Assassin's Creed 4 or whatever, runs at this particular speed on the PlayStation 4,
3323000	3332000	but the performance is five less frames a second on Xbox One, that's going to get out on the internet, and it's not going to make Microsoft look good.
3332000	3347000	In a way, that happened to Sony in the last generation, didn't it? Because I seem to remember with Oblivion especially, and I know I'm going way back, there was a lot of problems with PlayStation 3, and that was all over the internet, and a lot of that was blamed on the Blu-ray drive, if I remember right.
3347000	3354000	Well, there was Oblivion, Skyrim had issues, there was a lot of games that had issues on the PlayStation 3, so, yeah.
3354000	3362000	You know, and that stuff does get reported on and tweeted about and Facebooked messaged about, and it all adds up to not looking so good.
3362000	3379000	So, yeah. But I do agree at the end of the day, if the games are fun, that's the most important thing, which is what Nintendo's banking on in a big way, because these games that are going to run at 30 frames a second and what have you on Xbox One and so forth, aren't even going to be made for the Wii U.
3379000	3393000	So, Nintendo kind of has to bank on these games that are experiences that are only going to be on Nintendo, because most of them are by Nintendo, pushing that system through 2014.
3393000	3405000	Which Wonderful 101 came out today, did it not? And I'm hearing some good things about that. Still haven't played the demo, I'm a bad fan, but blame all these other things like Kingdom Hearts taking away my attention for a minute.
3406000	3411000	I wanted to check it out at some point. Alright, let's move on. You have something on Xbox as well, right?
3411000	3423000	Yes, I do, and I know I'm not the first to say something about this, I know Bobby talked about it, but it's, well, it's not necessarily on Xbox, it's taken from an Xbox idea.
3423000	3435000	And that is, well, we don't know specifically if it's taken from the Xbox idea, but it's a lot like it. It's basically the Steam Family Sharing Program.
3435000	3445000	Which is very interesting, because didn't we see something very similar to this, at least described on the Xbox One when they first made their press announcement, right?
3445000	3453000	So what this is, basically, is if, say, I have a game installed, but you want to play it and you don't own it, I can authorize you to play it.
3453000	3461000	And then that way we can share the game, but if I decide that I want to play it, you get a few minutes to save your game, or buy the game to continue playing it.
3461000	3471000	So it's a way to expose other people to a game, like, if I say, Rob, you really, really have to play Fractal. No, I mean, really, you have to play Fractal.
3471000	3477000	I can go, here, play Fractal, and you can download it and play Fractal. And then if I decide that I want to play it...
3477000	3480000	Which literally might happen, because I don't believe I own that game.
3480000	3481000	Yeah.
3481000	3487000	And I can be like, no, Jamie, Rogue Legacy, it's like Castlevania, but, like, fun, and, well, I mean, like, Castlevania is fun, but you know what I mean.
3487000	3491000	Like, it's an indie Castlevania that's a lot of fun, you need to check this game out, and I can be like, you know, here, go play this.
3491000	3499000	And then I will have to figure out if I have any space left with all the other Steam games on my system, because I have almost filled up 500 GB with games.
3500000	3501000	It's scary.
3501000	3504000	I probably should uninstall WoW now that I think about it.
3504000	3510000	But, at any rate, you know, it's, I can say, here, play Fractal.
3510000	3518000	And you can be, you can say that you have gotten into Fractal, and I was like, you know, I want to play, I want to try to beat my game now, so I want to log in.
3518000	3523000	Well, you have the option, then, to stop playing the game, you know, save your progress.
3523000	3529000	Or, you know, if you can be like, well, you know what, I'm at level 10, and I really like this game, I'm going to buy it.
3529000	3532000	Then you can buy it and keep playing, and I can go back to playing my game.
3532000	3542000	And I never have to walk into a GameStop, I don't have to hand anybody cash, I just click that little button that says, drain all the imaginary money from my bank account.
3542000	3543000	Exactly.
3543000	3552000	And the thing with this, too, is that, like, at my house, Dan didn't have a Steam account for a while, and now he has it for mostly his racing games.
3552000	3566000	And we play Borderlands together, but say that he wanted to try out, like, I just bought that, oh yeah, there's another game I didn't talk about playing, is that I played Duke Nukem 3D.
3566000	3570000	Because I bought the indie shooting thing.
3570000	3578000	But say that, you know, Dan wants to sit and play Duke Nukem 3D, and I'm not playing it, I just go, okay, you're authorized on yours, here you go.
3578000	3587000	And, you know, given that we're in the same house, you know, it doesn't really matter. I don't have to log out of my account for him to play my games.
3587000	3591000	But if you want to play your games, then he's going to get kicked out.
3591000	3594000	If I'm playing a different game.
3594000	3596000	Oh, I always thought that, oh, okay.
3596000	3600000	The way that I understood it is that it's just authorization on that game.
3600000	3603000	It's on all your games, your entire library.
3604000	3612000	So if you play any game, if you're playing Duke Nukem 3D or something like that, and he's playing Borderlands on your account, he will get kicked out of Borderlands.
3612000	3614000	While I'm at school, you know.
3614000	3617000	While you're playing Final Fantasy XIV, which isn't in your Steam library or something like that.
3617000	3623000	I mean, the only reason I linked it into my Steam is not one of my Steam games, I just run it through Steam to screencap.
3623000	3626000	Which, by the way, they booted that out, for the record.
3626000	3627000	Oh, wow.
3627000	3629000	Yeah, so I haven't been able to do my screencaps through Steam.
3629000	3630000	Well, that sucks.
3630000	3634000	I also haven't been able to do my Mass Effect 3 screencaps through Steam either, so.
3634000	3635000	That's weird.
3635000	3636000	But I can for two.
3636000	3644000	Well, it's very easy to take screenshots in Final Fantasy XIV, but granted, I get that you can't post them or do the cloud or your captions.
3644000	3647000	Well, no, you can't take screencaps during cinematics.
3647000	3649000	Oh, got it.
3649000	3652000	And that's what I was using. Steam 4 was taking screencaps during cinematics.
3652000	3653000	Tricky, tricky. Okay, I gotcha.
3653000	3654000	Yeah.
3654000	3655000	I gotcha.
3655000	3668000	Well, one thing I do want to make sure is very clear with this family sharing, because it was the same mistake a lot of people made with the Xbox version of it, which was a very kind of muddy, we didn't really know what, you know, all we knew was the negative with the DRM, we never knew the positive.
3668000	3675000	But this isn't that you can open this up to nine friends and family members and it's just open season on your library.
3675000	3679000	Down, you know, I buy a game and I basically get ten copies of that game, everybody can play it.
3679000	3680000	That is not what happens.
3680000	3687000	One person at a time in your library and that person locks your library, including from you, basically.
3687000	3700000	But you can take control back of your library at any time, but it will prevent that person from playing that game any further outside of, you know, 120 seconds or whatever to wrap it up and save or buy the game and keep going.
3700000	3706000	And I think it's a good feature and I think that they're handling it in a very intelligent manner.
3706000	3718000	You know, even if it's completely lucky at your account, like you said, what if I'm playing Final Fantasy and Dan wants to try out one of the other games I have or play through some, because I've got like the whole Doom set and all the old school games.
3718000	3720000	You know, if Dan wants to play through it, that's fine.
3720000	3726000	If I have a friend who wants to play Loom because she can't get her CD to work, I can say, oh, just play on mine, here, you're authorized.
3727000	3729000	You know, I think it works very well.
3729000	3732000	Or, you know, what other, I got another game on Steam.
3732000	3736000	Like, what if I wanted a friend of mine to play Mass Effect, the very first one.
3736000	3740000	I can be like, okay, because mine was a Steam version, here, you can play on my account.
3740000	3741000	Nice.
3741000	3743000	Here's a text mod thing, here's how to do all this crap.
3743000	3749000	You know, and it would be, I think it would be just fine.
3749000	3750000	Okay.
3750000	3755000	So, I mean, like, I think that it's a very good opportunity.
3755000	3762000	I think that it's better than demos, because people are having access to the full version of the game.
3762000	3763000	Right.
3763000	3768000	The moment that they're in, the moment they get into a game and they're inconvenienced about playing the game,
3768000	3778000	when, you know, you want your game back, that's going to give them even more encouragement to, you know, to buy the game.
3778000	3779000	Don't you think?
3779000	3787000	Yeah, I think it's a great idea where developers will kind of be able to get their game demos out there.
3787000	3789000	It's essentially kind of a demo, in a way.
3789000	3790000	Kind of.
3790000	3796000	And, you know, hypothetically, I could probably borrow one of your little games while you're out of town for a week or something,
3796000	3805000	and probably beat it in that time frame, but those cases are probably going to be less common than the cases where somebody is playing this epic RPG
3805000	3809000	and can't finish because you want to be able to play your games, so they have to buy it to finish it.
3809000	3814000	Like, for example, if I wanted you to play, god, now I can't remember the name of the game, Little Inferno.
3814000	3816000	You don't have it, do you?
3816000	3817000	I don't think so, no.
3817000	3819000	Well, I would love for you to play Little Inferno.
3819000	3820000	Yeah.
3820000	3822000	And you can beat it in a night. I beat the game in one day.
3822000	3823000	Nice.
3823000	3827000	So, it took me a few hours, but I also, you know, got all the combos and everything.
3827000	3832000	But, you know, if I wanted you to experience the joy that is this game and I'm going to be out for the night.
3832000	3833000	Mm-hmm. There you go.
3833000	3834000	What's the problem?
3834000	3839000	S2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I just wonder how it will work with MMOs, like DC Universe Online.
3839000	3841000	Will people be able to play on another person's account?
3841000	3842000	You can't.
3842000	3843000	It's free anyway, so why?
3843000	3851000	Yeah, anything that has, like, extra serial numbers or, like, basically MMOs and online games aren't going to apply.
3851000	3856000	It's anything that requires, like, you play, you can't do it. If you can't, if Games for Windows Live, you can't do it.
3856000	3859000	MMOs, you can't do it. That's pretty much it.
3859000	3863000	Stuff that requires an additional serial, like, for example, you can't play online, like you mentioned.
3863000	3864000	You need a code for that.
3864000	3865000	Mm-hmm.
3865000	3866000	So, yeah, those don't work.
3866000	3868000	I still, I'm looking forward to it.
3868000	3873000	Now, we're going to talk about this probably a little later in the show when we get into the Fugu Question of the Week.
3873000	3877000	So, if you haven't answered it yet, you might want to go answer it because we're going to read these a little later.
3877000	3883000	But, you know, when this news came out, I definitely sensed a lot of people on Twitter, especially Xbox fans,
3883000	3892000	were a little irritated that Steam announces this and gets praised, whereas Xbox really got dogged for this whole thing with the DRM and everything.
3892000	3898000	And I personally feel there are two very, this is, it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit, and I think sometimes people forget that.
3898000	3900000	I'll get into that a little later.
3900000	3903000	But we want to know what you think, and, you know, there's no right or wrong answer.
3903000	3906000	So, go answer our Fugu Question of the Week if you haven't yet.
3906000	3909000	We're going to get into those a little bit later in the game, or in the show.
3909000	3912000	For now, let's go on with some more news.
3912000	3916000	One thing, I would like to repeat what Spike said in the chatroom.
3916000	3923000	The information released indicated that games that require their own keys and accounts would not be shareable.
3923000	3924000	Yeah.
3924000	3925000	So.
3925000	3928000	Alright, so, something coming out of Kickstarter.
3928000	3936000	You'll be seeing a lot of these old game resurgences, and one of which is River City Ransom Underground.
3936000	3946000	It's a licensed, officially licensed sequel to River City Ransom, done in kind of the 8-bit style of River City Ransom.
3946000	3951000	And they kind of took the 8-bit graphics and obviously added more color to them and stuff.
3951000	3960000	But it's in the same style, and they're seeking $180,000 Canadian by October 9th.
3960000	3964000	And they'll probably make it.
3964000	3965000	It looks awesome.
3965000	3970000	Right now they're at about a third of the way, and it's only been seven days.
3970000	3972000	And it looks pretty sweet.
3972000	3975000	I looked at it. I almost put some money on it.
3975000	3984000	I'm kind of with Loki, though, where it's like, it's got to be a really good Kickstarter at this point for me to jump on beforehand.
3984000	3989000	Because there's just too much out there now where it's like, I don't want to buy all these games, I'm not going to see for a year.
3989000	3990000	Yeah, exactly.
3990000	3993000	This is expected out September of 2014.
3994000	3997000	And you know they always get, nothing ever comes out in time.
3997000	4006000	So 2015 or end of 2014, it's like, I'd rather just keep my money now and then I'll buy it when it comes out.
4006000	4008000	If I have time for it.
4008000	4011000	I don't want to back anything.
4011000	4016000	Unless it's hardware that I'm pre-ordering, like an Oculus Rift or something like that, that's a little different.
4016000	4020000	But if it's a digital game, I'll just buy it when it comes out.
4020000	4025000	I want an actual Kunio sequel, not branded under River City Ransom.
4025000	4031000	I loved going back and playing the PC Engine version of the hot-blooded downtown story.
4031000	4033000	It was fun. It was quirky.
4033000	4037000	But is that really possible at this point, or is this really, you know, we're having to settle here?
4037000	4043000	I think it's having to settle, really, but I mean, that's just sort of like, maybe not.
4044000	4053000	Well yeah, it's like, I want to wish these guys well, and good luck, and I love the idea, and I hope the game's great, but I'll see you when you come out.
4053000	4054000	Yeah.
4054000	4055000	Yeah.
4055000	4064000	Alright, now I might be tricked into kickstarting something like this if this were the way this game were to go, because I did love me some Geometry Wars.
4064000	4072000	And Geometry Wars was really, I mean, let's be real, Geometry Wars was like the best launch game on the Xbox 360.
4072000	4078000	Because it sure as hell wasn't Cameo, or some of those other 360 games.
4078000	4087000	Geometry Wars was an awesome $5 game, and then they had Geometry Wars 2, which was also one of the better Xbox Live Arcade games they ever did.
4087000	4090000	And hell, Geometry Wars was free if you happened to get Project Gotham Racing.
4090000	4098000	Right, which, you know, of course, this whole thing started as a spinoff in Project Gotham Racing, like this little inside joke that just grew into a phenomenon of sorts.
4098000	4104000	I remember, it's one of the few huge interviews we had on the show when they put out the Wii version of Geometry Wars, remember that?
4104000	4105000	Yeah.
4105000	4108000	Which was a really great game, too, which is sad, a lot of people didn't really check it out.
4108000	4112000	We had those guys on the show, and, you know, the Wii version was great, too.
4112000	4121000	Unfortunately, as you all know, Bizarre Creations was closed in 2011 after Blur didn't do so hot in some of the 007 games.
4121000	4123000	So why am I bringing it up now?
4124000	4132000	Well, Phil Spencer, who's right now the corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, said on Twitter, you know, take it or leave it,
4132000	4136000	quote, I like Geometry Wars. Great game from the old Bizarre Creations.
4136000	4140000	Activision picked up IP when they bought Bizarre Creations.
4140000	4146000	And then somebody followed up with a question like, you know, would you work with Activision on a new game or buy the rights to it?
4146000	4154000	Spencer said, quote, oh, I'll respond. Let's just say as someone who worked on Project Gotham Racing, I have a lot of love for Geometry Wars.
4154000	4156000	Conversations have been had.
4156000	4163000	Oh, that was the tweet that drove everybody crazy. Somebody's talking about it, bringing back Geometry Wars.
4163000	4170000	So I'm a little surprised that if something was going to happen, it hasn't already.
4171000	4178000	But do you think maybe this is something they're sitting on until the Xbox One or the inevitable next Project Gotham Racing game?
4178000	4181000	It would be a nice launch title. I just don't think it's going to be a launch title.
4181000	4188000	Well, no, we'd know about it by now if it was. Is there a Project Gotham? No, there's not a Project Gotham at launch because there's a Forza, right?
4188000	4193000	They're going to have a conference, though, or a presentation at Tokyo Game Show.
4193000	4197000	Microsoft, that's ironic, but, you know, they're going to.
4200000	4209000	But you never know. By the time, after all, PlayStation 4 doesn't come out until February, so they very well could launch before February. It is possible.
4209000	4217000	It is possible. Well, I hope they are able to bring this franchise back. It was great, but here's the other thing, too.
4217000	4227000	If they do bring it back, it needs to still be good. So I don't know if that's, you know, hiring back some of the people who worked on it before if they're not already happy somewhere else or what.
4227000	4236000	But don't just make another game, you know, with completely different people and then have it suck because we've seen that happen to other franchises and it's always depressing when that stuff happens.
4236000	4240000	So before we get into release dates, Darkstalkers got a story for us.
4240000	4245000	I do, and it makes me kind of happy, but kind of wary and sad at the same time.
4245000	4253000	It has to do with the next Mass Effect, because we all love some Mass Effect here. Well, at least two out of three of us like Mass Effect.
4253000	4254000	And two out of three ain't bad.
4254000	4263000	And two out of three are correct. So they are calling it, at present, Mass Effect 4, at least I guess that's their development name.
4264000	4284000	And there are a series of quotes out about that from Casey Hudson, and he's saying that they're basically reworking the universe, going to make it new, and that it's not going to be about Shepard, but that it could be about people who were in the previous Mass Effect games.
4284000	4296000	So, who knows, you could be any one of the crew, you could be the Elusive Man, which, why would anybody want to be him, because he sucks. Chainsmoker.
4296000	4311000	But they were also saying that it was supposed to be a new fictional world, so I don't know if it's supposed to be alternate universe, another story, just something else occurring within the established canon.
4311000	4321000	I personally want to see something less human-centric, but I know why they make it human-centric, because people will more easily get into the series.
4321000	4334000	And I'm actually, you know, part of me would like an MMO, but I would really rather have just another standalone game with, you know, the same awesome multiplayer that Mass Effect 3 had. Don't you think?
4335000	4341000	Sorry, I only heard the second, I'm sorry, I only heard the first half of that, my bad. I'm multitasking, leave me alone.
4341000	4353000	No, you're single-tasking. No, I was like, there had been some rumors about it being MMO-style, and I, well, I think it was-
4353000	4355000	That could be like Borderlands, though.
4355000	4368000	Yeah, I think it would be fun to play around in that universe, but I would still rather have a single-player game that has all the same cinematic, to quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, it's the best movie I've ever played.
4368000	4384000	And I would like another experience like that. I would like to, you know, see more things about the other races, not have it just be human-centric, but understand that it was focused on humans, because that would be what would get people more easily immersed in the game.
4385000	4391000	Uh, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, how about Garrus as the main character from Mass Effect 4? Well, that would make the fandom happy.
4391000	4393000	I would totally play Garrus the game.
4393000	4403000	I thought BioWare was trying to get away from that universe, though. I mean, like, that whole story in Shepherd's Crew and all that, I thought they were trying to kind of do something completely different.
4403000	4414000	But there'd be plenty, I mean, I still think that there would be plenty to go on in a post-Reaperpocalypse world, or universe, or galaxy. I should say galaxy.
4414000	4420000	Uh, SSJ100Matt says, so would this next game be the Star Trek Voyager to Mass Effect 1 through 3's Star Trek Next Generation?
4422000	4424000	I don't know, because Voyager was shit.
4424000	4432000	Hey, I liked Voyager, so I'm gonna say hopefully, although apparently it will divide the fandom epically if that happens. So we'll see.
4432000	4438000	Alright, let's travel around the universe and check out release dates coming to a planet near you, starting with the US. Loki?
4438000	4448000	Uh, there's Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver, that's on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and who gives a shit?
4448000	4460000	And, uh, I think maybe Wii U, I don't know. Who cares? There's also some stupid karaoke game, you know, Wii, Wii Sing 80's or something like that, that's on the Wii.
4460000	4467000	And, uh, you know, the only game you really should get this week, Grand Theft Auto 5, that's on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
4467000	4473000	So there you go, Grand Theft Auto 5, your shopping's done, buy it, it comes out tomorrow. Or, not tomorrow.
4473000	4475000	You're not biased at all!
4476000	4489000	I'm not, oh, I'm not biased. Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver, a game based off a YouTube series that has no Hot Wheel cars in it, it's just about fuckin' rally driving with a really stupid premise built in.
4489000	4496000	Like, oh we have all these teams, we're telling them to do this strategic driving, which is like a really short course anyways.
4496000	4501000	And then we have a karaoke title that they imported from the UK that's just lame on a Wii system.
4502000	4508000	And then you have Grand Theft Auto, the game that's gonna get perfect 10 reviews. I don't think you're gonna see perfect 10 reviews from Hot Wheels.
4508000	4514000	You're so easily wound up, I love it. Alright, going to Japan, since unfortunately no Grand Theft Auto 5 in Japan this week.
4514000	4517000	Do they get Grand Theft Auto 5 at some point? Eventually.
4517000	4523000	Alright, so instead, on the Playstation 3 this week, you have Fairy Fencer F to look forward to, over there.
4523000	4528000	And, uh, I don't think they are actual fairies, just so you know. It looks like one of those epic RPGs.
4528000	4534000	Actually, it looks kinda cool, and it's by Compile, although I know the Compile of today is not the same as the Compile of yesterday.
4534000	4536000	Compile Heart, excuse me.
4536000	4538000	But we can still give them a little love.
4538000	4543000	That's right, we can. That game does look kinda neat, so you got that coming out this week, regular and limited edition.
4543000	4550000	Phantom Breaker Extra, also in regular and limited edition on the Xbox, excuse me, on the Playstation 3 this week.
4550000	4557000	And that Phantom Breaker is a fighting game, with chicks in sailor suits.
4558000	4567000	Going on to the Xbox 360, because it is still chugging along over there for the loyal supporters in Japan.
4567000	4572000	On the Xbox 360 this week, Alan Wake gets a price reduction.
4572000	4576000	Halo 3 gets a price reduction, including Halo 3 ODST, Halo Reach, Halo Wars.
4576000	4584000	And then the Phantom Breaker Extra game I mentioned earlier is also coming out this week on the Xbox 360.
4584000	4593000	There's also a couple new Xbox console packs themselves, a 250GB one and a 4GB one that also includes Kinect.
4593000	4598000	So, I guess a soft launch, if you will, of the Xbox 360 and some new SKUs.
4598000	4600000	Hope they're cheap.
4600000	4611000	On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, Yahari Game Demo Ore no Saishin Love Komei wa Machigateru comes out this week in regular and limited edition.
4611000	4614000	I'm just trying to see quickly what this game is all about.
4614000	4619000	This one is, this is a dating sim, totally a dating sim.
4619000	4624000	Yep, totally a dating sim, but you know, everything you expect.
4624000	4629000	Beach outfits, notes written on notepaper, all that stuff.
4629000	4633000	Quickly checking the Nintendo platforms to see what we have to look forward to there.
4633000	4638000	Unfortunately, nothing on the Wii U this week. They don't have any releases until the 26th of September.
4638000	4641000	But on the 3DS this week, a little more to choose from.
4641000	4650000	Jewel Master, Nobunaga no Yabu, also Sangokushi comes out this week, all on the Nintendo 3DS.
4650000	4652000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4652000	4656000	There's some stuff. God, if it'll ever load, thank you.
4656000	4660000	Okay, so, on the 17th we have Grand Theft Auto 5 in the UK.
4660000	4666000	On the 19th, Angry Birds Star Wars 2, and what the hell just happened to my thing?
4666000	4674000	Okay, and on the 20th we have Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which, ew, snails. That's it.
4674000	4678000	Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
4678000	4681000	They're not just snails, they're snails on NOS, okay?
4681000	4687000	No, that is like my big phobia, are mollusks of that nature.
4687000	4690000	Yeah, it's even better when they moved at turbo speed, they can just...
4690000	4693000	No, no, no, no, la la la la la la la.
4694000	4699000	Okay, so, this is kind of interesting. Here we thought that this channel was just done for.
4699000	4703000	They put the bullet into it, and it was just done.
4703000	4707000	Put up from the grave like a zombie, rises G4.
4707000	4713000	A husk of, well, pretty much nothing at this point because they fired all their staff, so...
4713000	4717000	G4 will no longer become the Esquire Network.
4717000	4725000	Instead, that wonderful title goes to Style Channel, now is going to be the Esquire Channel.
4725000	4727000	But what's going to happen to Bill and Juliana?
4727000	4732000	Here's the thing about Style, though. Style was like a totally different demographic, I think, than the Esquire Channel.
4732000	4736000	Wasn't that focused more like women and stuff? And now it's like, oh, men channel.
4736000	4740000	Well, here's the thing, it was in more homes. And I think at the end of the day, that's what they're trying to do,
4740000	4745000	is they're trying to get, they're going to push the Esquire Network on a channel that's in more homes.
4745000	4749000	I don't think this is about they suddenly wanted to give G4 a reprieve.
4749000	4756000	G4 is like a lame duck network now. I mean, what the hell do you do with G4?
4756000	4758000	How do you solve a problem like the G4 network?
4758000	4763000	I don't even know how they can, I mean, the only thing I think is it's going to be the Cops and Cheaters rerun channel again.
4763000	4767000	It's the rerun network. They're not doing any original programming at this point.
4767000	4770000	Yeah, they got rid of all the original programming, all the hosts and everything,
4770000	4777000	so unless they come up with some new content, which I don't see happening, does that mean we're still going to have G4 at E3?
4777000	4782000	No, no, that's not going to happen. And BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
4782000	4789000	G4 died in 2004, end of story. And for all practical purposes, I think we banned all talk of this network in the future on the show.
4789000	4794000	However, I'm entertaining it tonight because, you know, it is interesting to think like,
4794000	4801000	well, I mean, even though I think, you know, this network is damned, it's done for.
4801000	4804000	I would have been more interested if they said, tech TV's coming back.
4804000	4812000	Well, is it possible that maybe they'll try to launch the network with this space that maybe should have been?
4812000	4817000	I mean, that's going to mean an investment or somebody's going to have to come in and buy it,
4817000	4822000	and I don't really know if that's going to happen, but it is interesting that they have all this space and nothing to do with it.
4822000	4829000	You would think that they're going to try to repackage it and launch it as something, and that might entail additional contact.
4829000	4835000	Well, you bring back Leo Laporte and Patrick Norton on screensavers, I'll sign up for cable and watch that shit,
4835000	4839000	but until then, I don't give a shit about reruns of, you know.
4839000	4843000	Just pay those twit guys in Petaluma to be on basic cable?
4843000	4844000	Hell yeah.
4844000	4850000	If they want that, they probably don't.
4850000	4852000	They've moved on. Everyone's moved on.
4852000	4853000	Everyone's moved on.
4853000	4862000	It's nice to think, I'm just saying, not that we love doing OLR, and we're all getting to be in our mid-thirties, but we're available.
4862000	4864000	We'd be cheap too.
4864000	4870000	Hey, exactly, I said I will sell out in a second. You don't understand.
4870000	4878000	I'll take a paycheck. I don't care. I'll introduce videos of cheaters if you want me to quip about something.
4879000	4885000	You know, I don't care what you want. Hey, this episode of Cops is classic. We've got this, you know, druggie guy.
4885000	4890000	He tries to jump over the fence, but a dog grabs him in the ass. That's hilarious. Let's watch that clip.
4890000	4898000	And I'll introduce things too, like, okay y'all, this is that episode of Cops where they try to arrest the drag queen, and he's all, excuse my beauty.
4898000	4901000	So, don't change the channel.
4901000	4903000	This'll be me.
4903000	4907000	Here's some shit. Watch it. I don't care.
4907000	4914000	No, you would be like Dr. Claw where you would only allow your arm to be shot on video while you're petting Midna.
4914000	4918000	While I'm petting, while trying to get Midna to sit freaking still.
4918000	4922000	Well, wasn't that an enthusiastic episode of Campus PD?
4922000	4927000	Up next, cheaters, followed by a rerun of MacGyver.
4927000	4931000	No, Rob, do you know what I would be? I would be the Kennedy.
4931000	4933000	Remember the MTV days.
4933000	4935000	I liked Kennedy. She was awesome.
4935000	4941000	Remember the, I got voted the least loved VJ, and she had the tiara and everything.
4941000	4944000	Do you want to know a story that not a lot of people know?
4944000	4945000	Okay, tell me.
4945000	4946000	That has to do with Kennedy?
4946000	4947000	Tell me.
4947000	4948000	I don't know if I should admit this on the air.
4948000	4949000	Do it.
4949000	4953000	Okay, so like many years ago when I was in high school, I was probably like a senior in high school, so it was a long time ago, right?
4953000	4955000	Would have been 96, right?
4955000	4956000	That's not a long time ago.
4956000	4960000	There used to be this show on the radio that I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of called Love Line.
4960000	4964000	And Love Line, back in the day, had Adam Carolla, right?
4964000	4968000	And Dr. Drew, which I think Dr. Drew still does it.
4968000	4969000	Yeah, he does it.
4969000	4970000	I think so, amongst all the other stuff he does.
4970000	4976000	Well, I called in one night, and I called in because Kennedy was the guest.
4976000	4983000	And I just wanted to talk to Kennedy, so I think I asked, I don't even remember what it is I asked all these years later.
4983000	4988000	But I was on an episode of Love Line talking to Kennedy, and I think it was something like,
4988000	4990000	what's your advice to somebody who's trying to get into business?
4990000	4995000	Because at that time, I was thinking that I was going to go into broadcast journalism and all this stuff in college,
4995000	4997000	and that's the type of stuff I really wanted to do.
4997000	4999000	I wanted to do that type of radio stuff.
4999000	5002000	Look where I ended up.
5002000	5005000	Thanks, Kennedy, for your shitty advice.
5005000	5007000	I wonder what happened to her.
5007000	5009000	I'm sure she's still around and doing all that.
5009000	5011000	I think she did political stuff later on.
5011000	5017000	But anyway, she said, and it's really funny because they had to dump this from the air.
5017000	5022000	She said, well, don't work for the guy in Bleep. That guy's a dick.
5022000	5025000	And Adam Carolla goes, we're on in that station, you idiot.
5025000	5027000	So they had to dump that from the airwaves.
5027000	5030000	So if you want to know what town she said, it was Portland.
5030000	5032000	Don't work in Portland.
5032000	5034000	So that's the advice I got.
5034000	5041000	So yes, if you didn't know, I was on Love Line when I was 18 or something like that.
5041000	5043000	So there you go.
5043000	5046000	Sorry, no juicy relationship questions for you.
5046000	5048000	Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.
5048000	5051000	She hosted a game show on Game Show Network, The Friend or Foe.
5051000	5054000	But that was about ten years ago at this point.
5054000	5059000	By the way, don't feel bad because my 20-year reunion is next year.
5059000	5063000	No, it's fine. I'm at peace with the fact that I'm 35. It's all good.
5063000	5068000	You know what? I'm 35 and awesome.
5068000	5071000	Now I'm 37 in a row.
5071000	5075000	All right, playing games like this one that I'll be looking forward to.
5075000	5084000	Final Fantasy Agito is going to be out on iOS and Android.
5084000	5090000	Wasn't this the game that was supposed to be part of the Final Fantasy XIII mythos and all that?
5090000	5092000	Well, this finally is coming out.
5092000	5098000	It's in the same universe as Final Fantasy Type 0, which was a PSP game in Japan.
5098000	5100000	And it's in that same universe.
5100000	5103000	It's going to be a free-to-play app for iOS and Android,
5103000	5105000	which means you'll probably get to play the first part for free,
5105000	5107000	and then you're going to have to buy everything.
5107000	5111000	The play will be divided between solo play and team play.
5111000	5114000	There will be missions based around individual characters,
5114000	5117000	and there will be bosses that you fight as team play.
5117000	5122000	We don't know what release day this is, but it is something that will come out soon.
5122000	5125000	Speaking of Square Enix, I just want to do a quick follow-up.
5125000	5128000	Last week we talked about Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call,
5128000	5131000	and it was suggested this could be a sequel to Theatrhythm,
5131000	5134000	and I was sitting here going, no, it's probably just like a year-end edition
5134000	5136000	that's going to package everything together.
5136000	5139000	Well, I was wrong. Go figure.
5139000	5147000	Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call will be coming to the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 at some point.
5147000	5149000	It will be in Japan in spring.
5149000	5155000	200-plus tracks, 60-plus characters, and a versus battle mode.
5155000	5161000	They say songs from Final Fantasy XIV, as well as Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII-3,
5161000	5167000	are some of the games featured in that, so it sounds like it's going to be even bigger and better.
5167000	5172000	200 tracks is a lot of tracks, but when it's all music from your own company,
5172000	5175000	that shouldn't be too difficult to put together.
5175000	5178000	I wonder if it will just have all the regular tracks from Theatrhythm 1.
5178000	5180000	That would be interesting if they went that way.
5180000	5185000	All right, well, let's go back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.
5185000	5189000	There was not 200-plus songs in a game.
5189000	5191000	There was like maybe five, and you liked it.
5191000	5193000	It's the Classic Game of the Week,
5193000	5196000	where Dark Sakura's going to go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
5196000	5200000	hey, you kids should check out this game because it's cooler than you.
5200000	5203000	Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5203000	5206000	The Classic Game of the Week is Valis, the Phantasm Soldier,
5206000	5211000	or as it was called, Mugensenshi Vadisu in Japan.
5211000	5214000	It was the first game in the Valis series,
5214000	5219000	and it originally came out on the MSX and PC-88 home computers in 1986.
5219000	5222000	And then later on there was a Famicom version,
5222000	5225000	and then there was a Sega Mega Drive version,
5225000	5227000	which I'm sure is the one that most people remember,
5227000	5232000	either the Mega Drive version or the re-release that came out on PC Engine CD or Turbo Duo CD.
5233000	5237000	So the game is basically a side-scrolling platformer.
5237000	5243000	You are a girl in a school uniform with a sword beating shit up.
5243000	5248000	And then later on she gets all magical outfits and everything.
5248000	5256000	But the big part with this game is that it was one of the first magical girl games that,
5256000	5259000	well, kind of magical girl games that came out,
5259000	5263000	you know, that got a US release and was really popular.
5264000	5269000	Now, the interesting thing about this is that the Famicom version was absolutely different from the game.
5269000	5279000	It had the same plot of the game, but it basically was more of a maze-style game with different paths,
5279000	5281000	so it's supposed to be a lot harder.
5281000	5287000	For the Mega Drive game, it was pretty much side-scrolling, D-pad, hack, slash, slide, jump, swing your sword,
5287000	5290000	that type of thing, and you did have magic attacks.
5290000	5295000	There was a promotional video that came out with the game's release,
5295000	5302000	but it's hard to find. I don't think you can find it anywhere, however, the entire thing is on YouTube.
5302000	5311000	So, now with Valis, if anyone does want the PC Engine version,
5311000	5315000	or I should say the PC Duo or Turbo Duo version,
5315000	5321000	it actually comes with a Valis 1 and 2 collection, so you get two games for the price of one.
5321000	5329000	But this is one of the classic RPGs that came out on Sega Systems, so definitely get it.
5331000	5334000	Alright, I've never played this game, I'm just watching the little footage.
5334000	5340000	Well, the overall story is basically, it's a Japanese schoolgirl whose name is Yuko.
5340000	5344000	Look at those fancy effects where the pillars sometimes scroll in front of her,
5344000	5349000	as opposed to behind her. That was cutting edge for the time there.
5349000	5355000	Well, but she used a sword called Valis to defend the earth and the spirit world and the dream world.
5355000	5357000	I'm looking at some of these later stages now.
5357000	5361000	Yeah, and there were more sequels, I mean, we had Valis 2, Valis 3, Valis 4.
5361000	5366000	I think I played one of the later Valis games. I seem to remember Valis 3 and 4, I think I played one of those.
5366000	5371000	Yeah, and I'm trying to remember, let me see what it was that Valis 4 came out on.
5371000	5374000	Valis was also on the NES, I'm looking at this related thing.
5374000	5377000	That's what I'm saying, the Famicom version, but it was more of a maze game.
5377000	5378000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5378000	5389000	Valis 4 was on the Super Nintendo, or as it was known in Japan as a...
5389000	5398000	No, it was actually called in America too, Super Valis 4, which was on the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.
5398000	5404000	But Valis 3 did come out on PC Engine because I do have that game.
5404000	5417000	And with Valis 3 is basically you play as Yuko, but she has a couple other characters that are there named Valna and a warrior named Cham who are also in the game.
5417000	5426000	But I might cover the later Valis games at another time, but it has to start somewhere, so going with the first Valis is pretty safe.
5426000	5430000	The Game Buster in our chat room says, I played Valis 3 on the Genesis. I think that's one of the ones I played too.
5430000	5432000	I think I played a later one because a friend of mine had it.
5432000	5436000	But still, it's nice to know where those games came from, right?
5436000	5442000	Well, there was a...
5442000	5445000	What was I trying to think? Because I think it had a different release.
5445000	5452000	Was this one ever released on Wii?
5452000	5454000	I don't think it had a Wii release.
5454000	5456000	I don't think it was.
5456000	5464000	Because this would have been perfect. The Valis 1 and 2 set for PC Engine would have been a perfect Wii store.
5464000	5469000	Well, you never know. There's always time on the Wii U Virtual Console, so you'll see.
5469000	5472000	As long as it still has life in it.
5472000	5478000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Valis, the Phantasm Soldier.
5479000	5481000	Alrighty, let's do a music break, guys.
5481000	5483000	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

5491000	5494000	We've got List List on deck for tonight because it's been a while.

5526000	5531000	We are live, episode 519 already in progress here at VOG Network.
5531000	5536000	September the 15th, 2013. Boy, this year is almost over.
5536000	5542000	But it is my favorite time of year right now because that is when pumpkin all the things come out at all the various stores.
5542000	5547000	I'm very happy. I'm not just talking about pumpkin spice lattes, so don't get me wrong. Those are really good.
5547000	5553000	Although, one of the other coffee stores has a maple that's really good too, but I love pumpkin. I love pumpkin.
5553000	5555000	I did have a pumpkin muffin not too long ago.
5555000	5556000	Yum.
5556000	5558000	It was the cream cheese.
5559000	5566000	Alan and I at Target the other day got pumpkin waffles because I guess that's like a seasoned thing now that Eggo does like seasonal waffles.
5566000	5572000	But I was very happy because Noah's, not only does pumpkin bagels this year, but they have a pumpkin walnut bagel that is real good.
5572000	5574000	It's like eating dessert for breakfast. I love it.
5574000	5577000	You know what we need to do one day when it's an I can eat wheat day?
5577000	5578000	Yeah.
5578000	5579000	We need to go to Coco's.
5579000	5580000	Okay.
5580000	5584000	Get their pumpkin pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream.
5584000	5587000	Oh, it's going to be that time of year. I hop soon too.
5587000	5588000	Oh my God.
5588000	5589000	Pumpkin all the things.
5589000	5591000	Pumpkin all the things. Alright.
5591000	5603000	During that break, which I know you guys don't get to hear it on the podcast, but we play some songs for the live listeners while we take a quick break to rest our voices, refill our drinks and so forth, use the restroom.
5603000	5607000	During that break, Loki picked one of the songs tonight that we heard tonight. What was that?
5607000	5614000	It was a parody of Prince Ali from Aladdin called DLC. That was so stupid.
5614000	5616000	Sorry.
5616000	5618000	You know how to pick them. That was sure dumb.
5618000	5619000	I thought it was funny.
5619000	5620000	Alright.
5620000	5626000	But what was awesome was the Grand Theft Auto 5 you were playing during the break. You ran over there real quick and turned it on.
5626000	5630000	You were able to show me the little roller coaster sequence on the pier. That looked pretty cool.
5630000	5631000	Yeah.
5631000	5639000	I was trying to dive into the water too, but unfortunately I picked the spot that was too shallow and so I dived in the water and smacked my head on the ground.
5639000	5640000	I did get to see it in water.
5640000	5641000	It was, yeah.
5641000	5642000	It was something.
5642000	5643000	Alright.
5643000	5652000	Anyhow, we are going to do a few rapid fire news stories here and then the Fugu question of the week coming up and then listless before too long.
5652000	5656000	So I know you guys are excited for that and you can play along with us if you are here live.
5656000	5660000	I'm sorry, podcast listeners. We don't have a way you guys can participate with us yet.
5660000	5666000	That is coming. That's a 2.0 upgrade later on. So more like 3.0 at this point.
5666000	5669000	Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with rapid fire news?
5670000	5680000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Humble Bundle 9, which I had to buy because unfortunately I am addicted to buying Humble Bundles.
5680000	5685000	I am totally addicted to buying Humble Bundles and I bought this one too, the day it was announced.
5685000	5698000	So it came with some wonderful games including Fez, Mark of the Ninja, also Brutal Legends, Trying 2, and Faster in the Light.
5698000	5708000	Of course, that's just the initial offering. Oh, and Eats Munchies. I guess that's the sequel and that's going to be in beta.
5708000	5715000	Faster in the Light and Fez, of course, are if you beat the average, which is only $4.59 right now. It actually went down in price.
5715000	5722000	I know I have to give away a copy of Mark of the Ninja at some point because I already have that game.
5722000	5728000	I'm surprised we don't have Brutal Legend yet, but the other ones I did not.
5728000	5734000	And of course they will be adding more games probably closer towards the end of the pay period there.
5734000	5739000	So another nine days, so probably announcing some more games by the end of the week maybe.
5739000	5742000	It's worth checking out.
5742000	5754000	And to go along with Grand Theft Auto 5, they have this wonderful fake website that they made called, I see, I called it Lifestalker.
5754000	5760000	It was Life Invader. Still funny. But what's kind of cool about Life Invader is it's actually a real website you can visit.
5760000	5767000	So lifeinvader.com. You can go stalk a bunch of people on there just like following them I guess.
5767000	5779000	And what's kind of cool though is it ties in with your Rockstar Social Club account and you can stalk different businesses and it actually gives you in-game discounts and perks that way.
5779000	5784000	So it's kind of a cool little thing that they had to do. And of course it plays a part in the game.
5785000	5792000	And Rockstar is taking advantage of the cloud. I noticed that when you booted up the game there was a special little icon for when Rockstar is uploading info to the cloud.
5792000	5795000	So they can do things like this where you do something on the internet that impacts your game.
5795000	5805000	Well that's also going to be mainly for the multiplayer portion with Grand Theft Auto Online because there's a way you can quick switch between the characters.
5805000	5812000	And the fourth quick switch option is your multiplayer character. So you'll be able to jump into it right away.
5812000	5818000	Jumping back to your previous topic real quick because we have a good question here from Robert M. in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,
5818000	5824000	Hey, are Humble Bundle games win Mac Linux still? I'm sure there's no Mark of the Ninja or Fez on Mac and Linux.
5824000	5828000	Didn't I read somewhere that Fez was making its Linux debut with this Humble Bundle?
5828000	5838000	Usually we'll say when they're on which platforms they're on. Sometimes the Humble Bundles aren't on all platforms. Sometimes they are. It depends.
5839000	5848000	In this case I believe, let's see here, for Fez it is making its Mac and Linux debut.
5848000	5850000	There you go.
5850000	5858000	Mark of the Ninja is making its Mac and Linux debut. So these new platforms are debuting with this Humble Bundle. That's awesome.
5858000	5867000	Like Trine 2 is not Linux but it is Mac. You usually just watch the video and it should clarify which games are and are not.
5867000	5877000	Sometimes it will also clarify what platforms they're on. For example the Origin bundle I don't think was Linux.
5877000	5880000	There's been some other ones that have not been Linux.
5880000	5883000	Well good question from the chatroom so I wanted to clarify that.
5883000	5885000	And you also get soundtracks by the way too.
5886000	5893000	Alright and then on top of that there was also another announcement this week.
5893000	5898000	Of course Apple doing their announcements of the new iPhones and stuff.
5898000	5904000	So the iPhone 5s is going to be the brand new iPhone and along with that you're going to get Infinity Blade 3.
5904000	5914000	Which is going to launch September 20th and is even more amazing because now they have the wonderful graphics chips and stuff like that in the new phones.
5915000	5918000	So yeah that will be coming soon.
5918000	5925000	And was it me or was it Infinity Blade going kind of weird? Like what's this futuristic shit in there? I don't know.
5925000	5934000	I haven't played since the first one but it looks nice. Something to look forward to if you're getting one of those new phones.
5934000	5941000	Which I'm not but it's not enough of an upgrade and I'm already locked in a two year contract with my current phone.
5941000	5947000	But if I was up for renewal I probably would be going to the 5s because I didn't have a 5 yet.
5950000	5956000	Ah it's one of these stupid pages I'm on that has an autoplay something something. Sorry about that. I don't know which one that was.
5956000	5958000	It made your comment that much more dramatic.
5958000	5964000	It did a little bit didn't it? Alright so let's hope that doesn't happen again.
5964000	5967000	So quickly I'm going to go through some news here.
5967000	5972000	Possibly a Majora's Mask remake on 3DS question mark.
5972000	5977000	Because of course we had Ocarina of Time was remade for the 3DS and it was pretty well received and did quite well.
5977000	5980000	So a lot of folks were asking for a Majora's Mask.
5980000	5984000	So there was a little bit of a tease there.
5984000	5990000	Anuma, EG Anuma that is who is the Legend of Zelda series producer was questioned by IGN about it.
5990000	5996000	Quote, please write that I laughed. Don't make it sound like that I laughed because I was troubled or inconvenienced or put out.
5996000	6000000	I don't want them to read anything into it. But if you want to say that I laughed I think that would be a good answer.
6000000	6006000	It's really up to them if we want to interpret my laughter as yeah we're making it or no we're not. I guess that's really up to them.
6006000	6012000	I didn't read jack shit into that but some people are clinging to that as oh it could be information about Anuma Jora's Mask.
6012000	6016000	Would it have been different if he said I sharted? Don't read into that.
6016000	6021000	It's like I'm just gonna make the game but there's a little bit of poo.
6021000	6025000	So that doesn't mean it's bad poo.
6025000	6029000	Anyway moving on.
6029000	6033000	Stories about DJ Max Technic EQ is something.
6033000	6035000	Oh I know what that is.
6035000	6036000	It's more epic.
6036000	6038000	It's that side. I think that side was.
6038000	6044000	Alright so I'll try to summarize it for you guys from what I remember. DJ Max Technic EQ it was announced for iOS and Android.
6044000	6055000	That was pretty much the big thing right which is interesting because DJ Max they had the PS Vita version that I liked and I thought it did well but I guess not well enough to necessitate future games.
6055000	6056000	That's sad.
6056000	6058000	Because I don't think they're making anymore on the PS Vita.
6058000	6059000	But like all games.
6059000	6063000	Did that come out over here? Was that one of those things you had to import?
6063000	6068000	No it did come out here. I think it was only available on the store.
6068000	6072000	No you could get it through Amazon in really limited quantities.
6072000	6080000	Alright and then what ought to have the epic music behind it is Star Trek Pinball.
6080000	6083000	And this is actually an arcade thing.
6083000	6086000	Star Trek will be getting a new pinball table thanks to Stern.
6086000	6089000	There's a video out there that shows the play field.
6089000	6095000	It's more hand drawn they say than more like the CG slash photoshop information we usually see.
6095000	6100000	It will have to do with the reboots so if you're not a big fan of those you might be disappointed.
6100000	6105000	But it will use elements from the reboot movies. It's not strictly based off one or the other.
6105000	6112000	That's too bad. I thought for a second there that we'd see Jean-Luc Picard teaching us about the quadruple take.
6112000	6114000	Well there was a table with Next Generation.
6114000	6115000	There was a Next Generation table.
6115000	6116000	You can do that.
6116000	6120000	Looking at the pictures that you had on there it sort of looks a little bit like the Next Gen table.
6120000	6126000	But I don't know. Dan has a friend who buys all the Stern tables when they come out.
6126000	6128000	So I'm sure I will get to see it.
6128000	6129000	Excellent.
6129000	6133000	He's got the limited edition Tron table which oh my god.
6133000	6136000	It has like this frosted glass top on it.
6136000	6137000	Nice.
6137000	6138000	Oh it's beautiful.
6138000	6141000	I only got to play it like the one time real quick at Disneyland. I want to play it again.
6141000	6143000	You know what else was pretty hot?
6143000	6147000	I was playing Metallica pinball with the speaker right by me.
6147000	6149000	Oh my god that game is awesome.
6149000	6150000	Okay.
6150000	6152000	Alright Dark Soccer what do you have for us for rapid fire news?
6152000	6153000	Metallica pinball.
6153000	6155000	No. For rapid fire news.
6155000	6161000	This one I brought up just because I know we have a few racing game fans out there.
6161000	6165000	So for anyone who is looking forward to F1 2013.
6165000	6174000	The Ferrari that was driven by Nikki Lauda is supposed to be in the game.
6174000	6179000	So for fans who are into racers there you go.
6179000	6182000	You get a classic Ferrari in game.
6182000	6185000	And then I've also been watching a lot of Top Gear.
6186000	6191000	Also in this is some pretty interesting news.
6191000	6193000	For Ridge Racer news.
6193000	6194000	Ridge Racer.
6194000	6195000	Yeah.
6195000	6200000	There is going to be a free to play PC racing game called Ridge Racer Driftopia.
6200000	6204000	That's part of Steam's early access program so it should already be out.
6204000	6206000	And thank god we finally have new Ridge Racer news.
6206000	6213000	Because I was like how can it be that we have two consoles launching this year and neither one of them have Ridge Racer.
6213000	6215000	What is up with that?
6215000	6216000	It's a shame.
6216000	6219000	I know. It's a sham is what it is.
6219000	6222000	Well the Driftopia beta has already been out for PS3.
6222000	6230000	It's a public beta and they said that the official release in Europe is supposed to be not too much later this year hopefully.
6230000	6233000	Well Steam you've officially made it. You have a Ridge Racer game.
6233000	6234000	Ridge Racer.
6234000	6238000	And happy happy happy Puyo Puyo Tetris.
6238000	6242000	I'm just trying to figure out how Puyo Puyo and Tetris would breed.
6242000	6245000	But apparently it's Tetris with.
6245000	6247000	But they're going to try. God help them.
6247000	6252000	I'm wondering if the Tetris blocks are going to have like little Puyos on them or something.
6252000	6255000	But Puyo Puyo. I love Puyo Puyo.
6255000	6261000	So hopefully it's going to be fun and not you know utterly crappy. I hope.
6263000	6265000	You know me and my Puyo Puyo.
6265000	6267000	I know. I know you do love Puyo Puyo.
6267000	6268000	Yeah.
6268000	6271000	When was the last big Puyo Puyo game that came out? I remember the DS one but that was the last one I really remember.
6272000	6274000	Wasn't that yeah just Puyo Pop?
6274000	6275000	Yeah.
6275000	6277000	Or Puyo Pop Fever?
6277000	6281000	Alright let's go to the Fugal question of the week.
6288000	6293000	Take Facebook. Take Google Plus. Smoosh them together and you get Fugal.
6293000	6297000	Every week we take to our social networks to ask a question.
6297000	6302000	And this week it has to do with something we talked about earlier in the show. The Steam Family Sharing.
6302000	6308000	This week we heard that Steam would be implementing Family Sharing which was a feature that had been teased for the Xbox One.
6308000	6314000	Many people who were critical of the Xbox One policies embraced the idea of Family Sharing on Steam.
6314000	6323000	Do you think there is an unfair double standard in play in the gaming community when it comes to Steam announcing features versus Microsoft announcing Xbox One features?
6323000	6325000	Why or why not?
6325000	6331000	I'm going to read just a few of the answers tonight because unfortunately the answers get very long with this.
6331000	6335000	But you have a lot of good stuff so I really want to encourage our community.
6335000	6337000	Go read the answers people wrote.
6337000	6342000	You can see them at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or in our Google Plus community.
6342000	6345000	Just search on Google for Orange Lounge Radio and it will come right up.
6345000	6353000	Let's go to Brandon C. who says the Xbox One features outraged people because it meant the end of used game sales.
6353000	6361000	Even before Steam and other digital stores selling and buying used PC games was not a huge market just because of the issue with CD keys.
6361000	6366000	Even if I give you the right CD key I could still use it for myself to play online for example.
6366000	6373000	Meanwhile there is an entire retail chain that is basically built around the idea of buying and selling used console games.
6373000	6378000	Critical Myth says the devil as they say is in the details.
6378000	6384000	While they are similar services in general the context in which they are being introduced is an important factor.
6384000	6394000	For me Steam's program doesn't look like it would introduce new restrictions above and beyond the PC gaming status quo where the Xbox program as understood would have.
6394000	6404000	Seattle replies and says I think the biggest reason Steam isn't catching any crap over this is the fact that Steam doesn't use your webcam and microphone to stalk you through your gaming area yet.
6404000	6408000	And offline mode is an option even though it enjoys making me rage.
6408000	6413000	It actually exists unlike what the Xbox One had before it became the Xbox One 80.
6413000	6417000	So there really isn't a double standard as much as there is a different standard.
6417000	6424000	Console games are easier to share but cost more and PC games are harder to share but tend to go on sale more often.
6424000	6430000	Degenerajani says trick question the gaming community is full of double standards but I get your point.
6430000	6434000	Honestly it's a feature that benefits Valve's market more than Microsoft's.
6434000	6440000	Imagine you're a business and your competitor announced a special feature for a product that competes with your products and services.
6440000	6444000	You realize that some of these features would be beneficial for your niche market.
6444000	6453000	Unfortunately for your competitor that company's target market rejected the product's limitations that supported those features because they would impede the experiences that consumers enjoy today.
6453000	6456000	Thus those features were removed from the product.
6456000	6464000	Common sense dictates for a business savvy company to take advantage of a competitor's wasted features to benefit that organization's products and services.
6464000	6468000	Another one here on Facebook from Alan Alchemy.
6468000	6472000	There has always been an inferred or proven portability with console games.
6472000	6477000	Packing up an entire system in a backpack and taking it to a friend's place, loaning copies of games and so on.
6477000	6485000	Microsoft wanted to get rid of that with the strict licensing and killing used games with the online sharing feature being a bandaid to help soothe the burn.
6485000	6489000	It didn't work. PC's and PC users never really had that narrative.
6489000	6494000	Yes land parties are a thing but they're associated with very specific fandoms like Starcraft.
6494000	6498000	Majority of PC users treat their rigs like immovable glaciers.
6498000	6506000	Factor in the reality of CD keys, illegal cracks often being a harbor for malware and other realities PC users have accepted for over 20 years.
6506000	6510000	Trading games or systems physically has always been cumbersome or impossible.
6510000	6518000	So Steam doing this is actually a boon on what we're used to and it's wholly intended as a value add and not a skeezy compromise.
6518000	6521000	Taking a look over on Google Plus.
6521000	6528000	Act Def says, I've actually seen more people complain about Steam's family sharing not being all that much rather than praising it.
6528000	6534000	For me personally I praised both of the Xbox One and Steam family sharing since I have to share with my brother.
6534000	6538000	And these kinds of services make it a whole lot simpler and I don't have to share accounts this way.
6538000	6541000	And lastly Travis H says, nope not one bit.
6541000	6548000	I think that after Microsoft flip flopped more times than a backward assed politician they deserve every bit of bias and scrutiny they get.
6548000	6551000	I don't even think that they knew what they were offering when they were offering it.
6551000	6557000	I also think that Microsoft is way too greedy to actually follow through with something as giving as what Steam is doing.
6557000	6561000	Steam never has failed to impress the hell out of anyone that is a member.
6561000	6564000	Daily sales, summer and winter sales, weekend deals.
6564000	6568000	Hell right now I can get all Tomb Raider games for 17 bucks.
6568000	6575000	Not to mention the 60 plus free games that are there for the taking by anyone who signs up for a free Steam membership.
6575000	6579000	But as a bias, heavy PC and Playstation gamer, I'm probably just talking crazy right now.
6579000	6582000	Kind of seems like a no brainer to me though.
6582000	6586000	Those are some of the answers. Check out Facebook and Google for more answers.
6586000	6588000	They're with the Fugu question of the week.
6588000	6590000	What do you guys think?
6590000	6596000	Is there a bias in the way we treat Steam announcements versus the way we treat Microsoft announcements?
6596000	6598000	Depends on the precedent.
6598000	6601000	Steam has done nothing but good things for the most part.
6601000	6603000	We expect to see good from them.
6603000	6605000	We know that when they are offering a service...
6605000	6608000	Yeah, I mean they're a business. They want to make money.
6608000	6616000	But we know that they really are trying to put out a service that is going to be good for their...
6616000	6618000	I'm sorry.
6618000	6620000	Yeah, for the consumer.
6622000	6623000	Loki?
6623000	6627000	I would say that it's probably more of like the service was good as it was.
6627000	6631000	But now they're adding another feature. So that's great.
6631000	6636000	Whereas Microsoft, they don't really trust them too much because of what they've done in the past.
6636000	6643000	As far as first off, all these really crazy ideas which I still don't think that they're completely against doing.
6643000	6648000	Like eliminating the whole retail marketplace so that they can basically control everything.
6648000	6656000	But at the same time, it's a service that if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.
6656000	6660000	It's not like you have to share your library with other people.
6660000	6662000	I think it's just an added feature and there's no real...
6662000	6667000	You're already doing the DRM stuff with Steam so it's not that big a deal.
6667000	6671000	And also, you're not buying games for the most part for $60 a pop.
6671000	6676000	You're buying them for very slim fractions of that.
6676000	6678000	I don't feel so bad about it.
6678000	6680000	I think for me, one big difference.
6680000	6687000	I get those tweets that say, why do we always praise Steam but we cut down at Microsoft?
6687000	6691000	For one, there was a lot of confusion with Microsoft.
6691000	6699000	Whether whatever you may have thought about Microsoft's system, they were never really clear with the positives of their system.
6699000	6702000	The negatives ended up being pretty clear when they announced that early on.
6702000	6705000	But the positives were always a bit of a haze and that was one big problem.
6705000	6710000	But here's the other big thing to remember is that Steam is not a console.
6710000	6714000	I know there's rumors about the whole Steam box and everything, but Steam is not a console.
6714000	6715000	Steam is a delivery method.
6715000	6716000	Steam is a store.
6716000	6721000	Steam is a way of acquiring licenses to play on your PC.
6721000	6723000	And your PC is ultimately the device.
6724000	6735000	And the perception, whether it's accurate or not, definitely the perception out there about the Xbox One was that that thing was going to be a fucking brick unless you did this and this and this.
6735000	6737000	And there were things that people didn't like.
6737000	6739000	The Kinect would have to be on.
6739000	6742000	The thing would have to talk to the internet every 24 hours.
6742000	6744000	Or else, you know, it doesn't do shit.
6744000	6753000	And I think that was one big problem is that, you know, well, even if Steam were to go down or your internet goes down, at least you can still do something with your PC.
6753000	6761000	You can still do all the other things that are outside of Steam like Photoshop or writing, word processing, or games that...
6761000	6762000	Complaining about Steam being down on the...
6762000	6764000	Exactly, through your cell phone or whatever.
6764000	6772000	But I think the perception is your PC is not going to be a freaking brick if these, you know, negatives, you know, were to occur or whatever.
6772000	6777000	So, again, I don't think there's any reason why Microsoft can't...
6777000	6783000	I've been hooting and hollering about this for weeks now on the show, months, is that there's no reason Microsoft can't say,
6783000	6790000	Okay, well if Steam is more of a delivery method, then why don't we invoke multiple delivery methods on the Xbox One?
6790000	6797000	You can either go buy a disc at the store, at Amazon, at Walmart, at GameStop, whatever.
6797000	6801000	Bring it home, put it in your console, and it's all the restrictions and things you're used to.
6801000	6804000	Your disc has to be in the console for it to work, et cetera, et cetera.
6804000	6812000	Or, we can have the Microsoft Store that sells digital licenses that work in this whole new way, and you can family share, and da-da-da-da-da.
6812000	6813000	Why not?
6813000	6817000	I'm literally saying Microsoft should set up two different stores.
6817000	6820000	It could appease everybody.
6820000	6822000	I'm not sure I would see the negative in that.
6822000	6826000	But anyway, that's my big thoughts on the issue.
6826000	6835000	So thank you guys for sharing yours over at Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or our Google Plus page.
6835000	6841000	So, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6841000	6846000	Blackwool says, Actually, when lightning took out my internet for five days, my PC did feel like a brick.
6846000	6851000	But to be fair, your Xbox One would have been a brick too, especially under those old policies.
6852000	6861000	So, I mean, sha100matt says, Will people change their tune if the Steam Box has the same requirements and things we didn't like about the original Xbox One?
6861000	6863000	Most likely, I think people wouldn't buy it.
6863000	6865000	The Steam Box is going to be a PC.
6865000	6866000	Yeah, I think that's what...
6866000	6867000	It's just going to be a PC.
6867000	6869000	Yeah, I don't think it will do that.
6869000	6871000	So, all right.
6871000	6876000	Datatrak in chat says, As if the normal store isn't already confusing enough.
6876000	6877000	I'm not sure I see that.
6877000	6880000	I think maybe, I mean, I don't think it's super confusing.
6880000	6883000	Well, confusing to navigate, maybe.
6883000	6884000	I'd give you that.
6884000	6886000	You know, it's not always easy to find what you want.
6886000	6888000	But, I mean, right now, it's pretty simple.
6888000	6889000	You buy the game, it's on your drive.
6889000	6890000	There it is.
6890000	6893000	Finding what you want might be another problem, but...
6894000	6900000	It's also, once again, you know, back going, you know, complaining about how it would have been.
6901000	6903000	Their marketplace would have been locked down.
6903000	6909000	There's really only one place you can get your digital content from, and that's Microsoft.
6909000	6914000	Whereas, if I want to get digital content from Steam, I have a ton of avenues for it.
6914000	6916000	I have multiple retailers out there.
6916000	6918000	I can buy a physical copy of it.
6918000	6923000	I mean, granted, you can buy a physical copy of the disc if you went to, you know, any retailer for the Xbox One.
6923000	6927000	But not a lot of people would be motivated to sell them for any sort of discount.
6928000	6931000	You can buy digital stuff through Humble Bundles.
6931000	6937000	And a lot of times, they're competing for lower prices, and you see deals on games all the time.
6937000	6940000	I just don't think you would see, you know, that's what everyone thought.
6940000	6943000	Oh, if they go all digital, we'll see better prices on games.
6943000	6947000	I don't think so, because really, they're not spending that much for the packaged media.
6947000	6952000	Remember, it only costs a few bucks, maybe two or three dollars, to actually make that packaged media.
6952000	6956000	And they're even cutting back on that by not printing the manuals anymore, or doing any of that stuff.
6956000	6962000	So, you're not going to see a huge discount in games from Microsoft, because they have it locked down.
6962000	6965000	If anything, now they can keep games at a higher price.
6965000	6971000	Just look at the Vita, for example, in the digital marketplace that was on PlayStation Network for some of the older PSP titles.
6971000	6977000	They don't drop the digital price on them, even though they're dropping price at retail, for whatever reason.
6977000	6982000	So, that's just how it works, when you have a single marketplace to get something.
6982000	6988000	Let's go back into some gaming news. And, Loki, I know you teased these stories a little earlier.
6988000	6991000	All right. So, let's talk a little bit more about Ouya's Free the Games Fund.
6991000	6993000	So, here's kind of what happened.
6993000	6996000	They announced the Free the Games Fund back in July.
6996000	7010000	It was going to be this fund that was going to match any earnings from these crowdfunded campaigns, probably through Kickstarter, if their goal was $50,000 or more.
7010000	7022000	And then, on top of that, the game that had the largest earnings, I guess, for it through Kickstarter would get an additional $100,000.
7022000	7026000	And, anything else would have been matched by Ouya.
7026000	7031000	So, at the end of August, there were two games that met that goal.
7031000	7036000	The first one being Elementary My Dear Homes, and the second one is Great Iron Thunder.
7036000	7045000	Elementary My Dear Homes, as we talked about last week, the campaign was pulled because of a bunch of fake accounts on there.
7045000	7052000	They had them named after fictional characters, sports celebrities, all these different people that definitely weren't actually backing the game.
7052000	7057000	But, they had basically put their own money into the project so that they'd meet their goal.
7057000	7065000	So then, that way, when they make their $50,000, Ouya matches that $50,000 and then they make a profit off of it.
7066000	7077000	At Great Iron Thunder, same thing, they had less than 200 people back it and somehow they had about $180,000 and then they're getting that matched by Ouya.
7077000	7084000	Basically, the thing with Great Iron Thunder, yeah, is $171,000 from 183 backers.
7085000	7098000	So, obviously there was some sort of fraud going on there because it just seems a little fishy that these few people are not even requesting any sort of, they're not like, you know, selecting a $10,000 option.
7098000	7106000	They're selecting no prize or gift whatsoever, they're just backing it with like multiple thousands of dollars.
7107000	7115000	And it was obvious that they were doing that and in the case of Great Iron Thunder, it was a really shitty looking game that they probably already had finished.
7115000	7127000	And, in fact, it is coming out at the end of this month. Kind of weird how all of a sudden they were able to turn that game around with over a few hundred thousand dollars in like two weeks.
7128000	7133000	So that was the plan all along. They're not going to make anything off the game, they're just going to make it off of this program.
7133000	7142000	So then Julie Ehrman responds back to this, basically saying that, you know, we're not going to change the program at all.
7142000	7149000	You know, we think things are good the way they are, you know, we heard your complaints that you think that these are scamming us, but we're not going to do anything.
7149000	7155000	We're not going to alter it. And because of that, there's been a lot of reaction to it.
7156000	7163000	In fact, there's even one more Kickstarter that I believe just posted, I don't know if it's been funded yet.
7165000	7169000	I was going to check that real quick here. It's called Dungeons The Eye of Drakonas.
7169000	7180000	And, yes, it has been funded. Their backing, was it $10,000 was the goal, and they hit a goal of $53,292.
7181000	7188000	And this is basically what they said. It's all, dear Pledgers, we have been honest up front with you about our situation from the start.
7188000	7193000	As you can see, we currently are only one quarter of the way to our goal before launching this Kickstarter.
7193000	7198000	Basically saying, let's see here, we're going to get to the part where they're actually funding it with their...
7199000	7209000	Basically, he goes into saying that his father decided to give five checks for a certain amount of dollars.
7210000	7216000	To people in the family so that they could each back that Kickstarter with that money.
7216000	7222000	And because of that, they said, so now you may ask, how does my father have that kind of money?
7222000	7226000	Is he rich? No, no, no, no he's not. He lives frugally in a terrible house and all that stuff.
7227000	7231000	He says, for the first time in my life, he's actually helping me with one of the projects.
7231000	7235000	So what does this mean to you? Well, it means that all the tiers are hereby unlocked.
7236000	7242000	You and previous Kickstarter Pledges will receive all three episodes and will stream to you once every few weeks.
7242000	7248000	It says, everyone wins in this situation. We're going to make an excellent video game for $65,000.
7248000	7252000	Ouya matches the funds that come in three disbursements.
7252000	7259000	First, $12,500 at the end of the Kickstarter. Second, $25,000 when the game is released.
7259000	7263000	And finally, $12,500 after the six months Ouya exclusive.
7263000	7266000	We have to finish the game before we get the second and third payments.
7266000	7270000	You all receive the fully expanded trilogy and all that stuff.
7270000	7275000	Thanks to the Ouya funds, we'll be able to afford marketing and have a booth at PAX and all that stuff.
7275000	7281000	But he funded the game so they would get over their minimum.
7281000	7284000	Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to do it in the first case.
7284000	7287000	So they fund it with their own money and they're going to pay themselves back with the matched funds.
7290000	7293000	So how are people reacting to this, including developers?
7293000	7299000	Some people, for example, Sophie Holden, who launched a game called Rose in Time on the Ouya,
7299000	7301000	is going to be pulling her game from the marketplace.
7301000	7304000	So it's basically Julie's response.
7304000	7309000	It became very apparent to me that the company does not support the indie developers who need the support the most.
7309000	7311000	And they're incapable of correcting their mistake.
7311000	7314000	I'm simply no longer comfortable supporting the company.
7315000	7322000	Basically saying these smaller developers actually need the money and not $100,000 to develop a game.
7322000	7327000	They're not getting the funding that they need to make this game.
7327000	7332000	As we talked about earlier in the show, I wonder how this is going to bode for future consoles.
7332000	7335000	All this mess going on with Ouya.
7335000	7338000	Do you think this can be saved? Do you think this can be salvaged?
7338000	7341000	It's going to have to be a hell of a game that comes out, right?
7341000	7347000	I honestly think that when we see that Gridiron Thunder game come out, which is going to be on the 30th or whatever,
7347000	7349000	it's just going to be terrible.
7349000	7353000	But it's basically checkboxing what they need.
7353000	7355000	They need the game to re-release.
7355000	7357000	They never said that it had to be a good game.
7357000	7360000	And they need it to be exclusive for six months to get the full funds.
7360000	7364000	And so they hit those checkboxes and that's it.
7364000	7368000	It doesn't need to sell well because they're going to make their money back from Ouya.
7368000	7373000	And unfortunately that's going to nix any ideas that they have as far as doing this in the future.
7373000	7379000	Because if that's all it's going to be is a bunch of abuse from people releasing shitty apps on the store,
7379000	7384000	then they're out even more money and what's this really have gained?
7384000	7386000	If anything, negative press.
7386000	7389000	I think most people bought Ouya to be an emulator. Let's be real.
7389000	7397000	I think it's starting to show that a little bit now through some of the corruption going on in other places.
7397000	7401000	Yeah, and unfortunately even a lot of these other consoles are probably getting better emulators than this thing.
7401000	7403000	Alright, let's move on.
7403000	7410000	Talk about things going a little better on the PlayStation 3 with some of the free things that they offer on the PlayStation 3.
7410000	7413000	You know a couple weeks ago I talked about the free-to-play Tekken Fighter game.
7413000	7420000	Well, news came out this week that Soul Calibur Lost Swords is a free-to-play PlayStation 3 title.
7420000	7422000	This is according to Famitsu.
7422000	7424000	It's something that's going to be coming out later this year.
7424000	7428000	I don't know if that means in the US as well, but we know that's for Japan.
7428000	7431000	It is confirmed it will release in Europe at some point.
7431000	7437000	Namco Bandai did file a trademark for this back in July, so we knew something was coming,
7437000	7440000	but I think a lot of people thought maybe like handheld game or spin-off game or something.
7440000	7443000	This will be a free-to-play game.
7443000	7446000	Siegfried and Mitsurugi are the first characters that are confirmed to be playable in it,
7446000	7448000	but here's the thing about it.
7448000	7452000	It's a single-player game, not really a head-to-head fighter game.
7453000	7458000	Well, they say it is a free-to-play fighter, but I don't know exactly how that's all going to work out
7458000	7460000	if they say it's single-player.
7460000	7465000	There's only very, very low-resolution screenshots out there thanks to Famitsu Magazine's scam.
7465000	7468000	If you wish to buy more resolution, it's going to cost you some money.
7468000	7470000	Exactly.
7470000	7473000	Well, you know, the Tekken one really wasn't bad, and that was Namco Bandai as well,
7473000	7477000	so if they kind of used that as a model, it could be a good thing.
7477000	7480000	I'm very curious to see what happens with that.
7480000	7482000	All right.
7482000	7488000	Well, that's the news for right now, but I think we're going to put the news on hold a little bit
7488000	7491000	so we can do some listless.
7494000	7496000	Ah, I love hearing that music.
7496000	7499000	It always means we're going to have a good time here on Orange Lawn's radio.
7499000	7506000	So what we're going to do, we're going to put together the definitive list around a certain topic,
7506000	7511000	and the way listless works, if you don't remember, is that each of us, as well as a guest,
7511000	7516000	who I'll introduce here in a minute, will give our top three answers on this topic,
7516000	7521000	and then we go around, and the tricky part is we have to eliminate one of the answers off the board.
7521000	7524000	But remember our new twist for listless 2.0?
7524000	7529000	If a host has two answers eliminated, that third answer gets immunity.
7529000	7534000	You guys get to play along and ultimately vote once we've made our list of, let's see,
7534000	7538000	there'll be four people, there'll be 12 answers, and then it gets narrowed down to eight answers.
7538000	7547000	So once we're down to eight answers on the board, you guys get to vote live along with us at live.vognetwork.com.
7547000	7554000	So let's introduce our special guest tonight, since three doesn't make for a very good listless,
7554000	7559000	we always like to invite a fourth person from the indie podcast community to come play with us.
7559000	7564000	So tonight we have Captain Spike with us on the line. Are you there, Captain?
7564000	7565000	Ahoy, can you hear me?
7565000	7567000	Yes, I can. How you doing, Spike?
7567000	7569000	Doing rather well, thank you. How are you?
7569000	7573000	Good. So you are one of the two hosts, of course, of gamebuoy.org.
7573000	7576000	I know you've been on the show previously to tell us all about that,
7576000	7580000	but what have you guys been talking about lately on gamebuoy.org?
7580000	7587000	Well, this weekend we contrasted Capcom's position a year ago to its position this month
7587000	7590000	in relation to how poorly Lost Planet 3 sold.
7590000	7595000	Ooh. Yeah, it's interesting what's going on with Capcom, isn't it?
7595000	7598000	It's really one of those things where you look at it and go,
7598000	7601000	what in the hell are they thinking? Or did you guys come to a different conclusion?
7601000	7606000	No, rather certainly. I would say that three of the big gems or jewels
7606000	7610000	coming out of the Japanese game development scene right now
7610000	7615000	are tied to staff that they sort of brought up into the world.
7615000	7619000	It's really funny to see them flailing and floundering
7619000	7623000	as all of these really important voices in Japanese games
7623000	7628000	are coming onto sort of their big opuses, so to speak.
7628000	7633000	Spike, actually. I perked up for just one moment because I thought you said R-Type.
7633000	7636000	Oh gosh, I didn't, but...
7636000	7640000	Maybe next time. Maybe there'll be a Game Buoy Micro on that whole series in the future.
7640000	7644000	If people want to check out that discussion, where can they find that?
7644000	7648000	You can find that over at gamebuoy.org.
7648000	7653000	Gamebuoy.org. I had to do that since Slidekick isn't on the show tonight, unfortunately.
7653000	7658000	Okay, so tonight's topic for Listless is about the Xbox One,
7658000	7661000	and I'll tell you the specific topic in a minute, but Spike,
7661000	7665000	quickly, your thoughts in a nutshell on Xbox One. Do you have one preordered?
7665000	7669000	It's the first console in the last decade that I haven't preordered,
7669000	7673000	but if I can find one day one, I'll probably end up buying it.
7673000	7677000	That's kind of what I did with Wii U. I was like, I'm not going to buy it,
7677000	7680000	I'm not going to buy it, I'm not going to buy it, and then I look at my Target app,
7680000	7683000	oh, it's in stock, fuck, and I bought it, you know, so we'll see.
7683000	7687000	Alright, so tonight's Listless is all about the Xbox One,
7687000	7693000	and the topic tonight is thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.
7693000	7698000	Well, you know, the Xbox has taken a lot of kind of kicks in the face
7698000	7703000	when it comes to their DRM policy, and then, you know, the whole 180 reversals
7703000	7707000	they've done on other things, and now this whole thing with Steam
7707000	7710000	got the family sharing, and everybody praised Steam.
7710000	7713000	What did you think about all that, Spike, before we begin?
7713000	7718000	Do you think people were fair in praising what Steam was doing versus what Xbox was trying to do?
7718000	7723000	You know, I had loaded up your Facebook for Orange Lounge Radio to comment on this,
7723000	7726000	but I saw comments there that reflected exactly my thought,
7726000	7730000	which is that the PC marketplace has operated so different for so long
7730000	7735000	that it's really not the same thing. There isn't an expectation of being able to resell
7735000	7740000	and have the portability, as Alan Alchemy had called it,
7740000	7743000	of your games and being able to take your software other places.
7743000	7748000	For PC, that's not really a thing, so I don't think people are, you know,
7748000	7752000	that expectation that exists in the console market for games to stay open
7752000	7755000	I don't think exists in the PC market.
7755000	7760000	All right, well, if you are playing along with us at live.vognetwork.com,
7760000	7762000	you're going to see that pop up right on your screen.
7762000	7765000	We're going to put up the board there for Listless tonight.
7765000	7770000	The thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again,
7770000	7774000	because, you know, everybody just really wants to be popular at the end of the day.
7774000	7777000	They need to get their mojo back. They need to...
7777000	7778000	That song just popped into my head.
7778000	7779000	What song?
7779000	7780000	The Not A Surf song.
7780000	7782000	I'm popular.
7782000	7785000	Well, unfortunately, you get Come On Down as your theme song tonight.
7785000	7786000	That's what you get. All right.
7786000	7790000	Captain Spike, since you are our guest, we're going to let you go first tonight.
7790000	7796000	What is your number three answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet tonight?
7796000	7800000	By the way, sorry, before you answer, if you want to play along in our chat room,
7800000	7806000	live.vognetwork.com, sometimes we steal chat answers and replace our own with chat answers.
7806000	7809000	So shout out your answers in chat as we go along with this.
7809000	7812000	All right, Spike, what is your number three thing?
7812000	7816000	And we're talking about popular on the internet, right? Not actual popular?
7816000	7818000	Popular on the internet was what was said.
7818000	7821000	So serious or funny, whatever you want to do.
7821000	7826000	Oh, good. Bye, Sega. Rename the Xbox One as the Dreamcast 2.
7829000	7835000	So rename it to the Dreamcast 2. Didn't that come up as an answer in another list list at some point?
7835000	7836000	I don't remember.
7836000	7838000	I think that was name of system, maybe?
7838000	7841000	Perhaps, yeah. Thing to name the system.
7841000	7843000	All right, well, that could do it.
7843000	7849000	Yeah, there was a lot of posts on Twitter and so forth not that long ago on 9999,
7849000	7853000	remember the Dreamcast, XOXO, love you, 5ever, right?
7853000	7859000	I remember sitting on the ground outside waiting in line at Arden Fair Mall.
7859000	7863000	All right, so there it is up on the board. Rename it to the Dreamcast 2.
7863000	7866000	All right, Loki, what is your number three answer?
7866000	7872000	My number three answer would be they need to drop the price of that system at least $100.
7873000	7875000	Say $101 just to make it $1.
7875000	7878000	Just to make it $1 less.
7878000	7879000	$398.
7879000	7885000	The Xbox $1 less. It is important, right? All right, drop the price at least $101.
7885000	7889000	All right, my turn is next. We're going to do ladies last tonight.
7889000	7897000	My answer is embrace what people really want and give us the pornography channel.
7897000	7902000	That's right, pornography app because, you know, porno is always the answer.
7902000	7910000	Why can't we just embrace what the people really want? I don't understand.
7910000	7912000	It helped VHS win that war.
7912000	7917000	All right, let's go on to DarkSakura, your number three answer.
7917000	7920000	What could the Xbox One do to be popular on the Internet again?
7920000	7923000	A pack-in with every online order. Waffle Iron.
7923000	7926000	Free Waffle Iron with every online order.
7926000	7930000	Forget a game or a controller.
7930000	7933000	Give people what they really want and that's waffles.
7933000	7940000	They're already waffling.
7940000	7946000	You're kind of dumb and amazing at the same time right now.
7946000	7948000	See, I made a pun.
7948000	7952000	Yeah, I get it. A free waffle iron because they're waffling.
7952000	7953000	Oh, good lord.
7953000	7957000	All right, Captain Spike, I don't know how you're going to one-up that, but good luck to you.
7957000	7965000	Good luck to you as you go into your number two answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.
7965000	7970000	Fling Phil Fish to the moon.
7970000	7974000	What do you have against Phil Fish?
7974000	7976000	Can I just say everything?
7976000	7978000	I suppose that's a valid response.
7978000	7987000	But how would that sell Xboxes if they, like, it would be something that, like, you could only watch it on the Slingshot app or something?
7987000	7991000	It would get the Xbox One popular on the Internet.
7991000	7995000	Yeah, sure. I mean, tie it to a stream on your Xbox One only.
7995000	7997000	People would buy it to watch that.
7997000	7999000	Like the pay-per-view event of the millennium.
7999000	8004000	We're going to Fling Phil Fish into the moon.
8004000	8013000	All right. Loki, dare I ask, what is your number two answer tonight for thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet?
8013000	8020000	Uh, let's see. Be backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.
8020000	8024000	Very serious answers for me tonight, Loki. Why is backwards compatibility...
8024000	8025000	Sorry.
8025000	8027000	No, it's fine. Why is backwards compatibility so important?
8027000	8032000	It's not, but people bitch about it, so, you know, it would make it important.
8032000	8035000	Again, it's about being popular on the Internet when all is said and done, right?
8035000	8040000	All right, so let's put that up on the board. Loki says backwards compatibility with the 360.
8040000	8050000	My number two answer, my number two answer is, okay, so we all know everybody's losing their shit about Killer Instinct, right?
8050000	8055000	Because Killer Instinct got its big remake, even though it's interesting.
8055000	8058000	It's only going to have six to eight characters, but I guess that's a whole nother Oprah.
8059000	8065000	But I said, you know what? When we were being teased for so long about that Rare is going to bring back a classic franchise,
8065000	8069000	I had my fingers and toes crossed for a different franchise to come back.
8069000	8075000	So my number two answer is, give us the Rare remake we really want, Anticipation.
8075000	8077000	Lord.
8077000	8087000	All right, so I'm just going to shorten that to make Rare do a new Anticipation game as my number two answer.
8087000	8092000	We'll put that up on the board. All right, Dark Sakura, what is your number two answer?
8092000	8100000	A more interactive banning system, meaning like a, I'm trying to remember how to phrase this,
8100000	8104000	like a smart list where when people get certain amounts of complaints made against them,
8104000	8110000	and I'm talking about real time complaining for people on Xbox Live, that it puts a mark on them,
8110000	8115000	they get a certain number of marks, they're banned or sent to a moderator review to see if they're legit.
8115000	8118000	Or you get to sit in the chair next that flings you to the moon.
8118000	8126000	Yes. But I mean, but I mean, either that or something that completely removes the anonymity.
8126000	8128000	All right.
8128000	8130000	You know, just some way to hold people-
8130000	8131000	You should be publicly shamed.
8131000	8134000	A way to hold people accountable for being shits on Xbox Live.
8134000	8138000	All right. So I did shorten that to the more interactive banning system,
8138000	8144000	but I honestly think maybe that should just be put Dark Sakura in charge of Xbox Live.
8144000	8151000	All right, let's recap what we have on the board so far.
8151000	8156000	So thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again, rename it to Dreamcast 2,
8156000	8163000	fling fill fish to the moon, drop the price at least $101, backwards compatibility with 360,
8163000	8169000	pornography app, make Rare do a new anticipation, a free waffle iron with every order,
8169000	8172000	or a more interactive banning system.
8172000	8177000	All right. Boy, this elimination is going to be some of the hardest ever tonight.
8177000	8180000	Let's see what folks have for their number one answers tonight.
8180000	8187000	Captain Spike, your number one answer for what Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.
8187000	8194000	I call this one the Nintendo method, money hat, hipster games exclusive that everyone claims to want,
8194000	8201000	but wouldn't actually buy, like Mega Man Legends 3 or Shenmue 3.
8201000	8206000	I'm trying to think how to shorten that. Hipster exclusives.
8206000	8213000	And why would Mega Man and Shenmue more than others bring all the boys to the yard?
8213000	8219000	Because both of these games are games where everyone on the Internet claims to have loved these games
8219000	8221000	and played them, and ooh, I remember that.
8221000	8226000	But if that many people played these games, they would have been commercial success.
8226000	8231000	But mind you, a lot of people pirated them on Dreamcast.
8231000	8233000	That is true. A lot of people pirated them.
8233000	8235000	But if they really loved it, they would have spent the money on it.
8235000	8239000	That's right. You even have people in chat right now. Fifth Dream says,
8239000	8243000	Shenmue 3, motherfucker, I want it so much.
8243000	8246000	All right. Good answer, Spike.
8246000	8248000	Loki, what is your number one answer tonight?
8248000	8256000	The Xbox One gets its whole external redesign, ends up being a fully interactive, artificially controlled cute kitten,
8256000	8261000	because people love cute kittens and the Internet loves cute kittens more than anything.
8261000	8267000	So the Xbox One will do cute things. Not only will it play your games, but it will sit there looking cute.
8267000	8271000	And it is a kitten.
8271000	8276000	So the box is now an artificial kitten. There it is.
8276000	8278000	Because who doesn't love cats?
8278000	8280000	Exactly. The Internet. They don't.
8280000	8284000	That's right. Internet loves cats. And it was, how do we be popular on the Internet?
8284000	8285000	Cats.
8285000	8287000	Cats. All right. Excellent answer.
8287000	8291000	All right. My number one answer. I actually went for something serious tonight.
8291000	8295000	And I'm surprised nobody said it yet unless maybe Dark Soccer was sitting on it.
8295000	8301000	But if so, I apologize. I think the thing people want most of all, Detach Connect.
8301000	8303000	Damn it.
8303000	8305000	Is that really your number one?
8305000	8307000	You can detach it.
8307000	8308000	Huh?
8308000	8309000	You can detach it.
8309000	8311000	You know what I mean. Out of the bundle completely.
8311000	8314000	All right. So Dark Soccer, I don't...
8314000	8315000	Now I have to pull it out of my ass.
8315000	8318000	All right. Well, you do have her chat room could be shouting some answers.
8318000	8323000	Well, yeah, I was. No, because it's already going to be on PS3 and PS4.
8323000	8330000	That's what I'm getting anyway.
8330000	8339000	Making O.L.R. the official voice of Microsoft.
8339000	8342000	Now Dark Soccer, we said popular on the Internet.
8342000	8345000	Fuck you. I'm popular.
8345000	8348000	We will make people want this shit.
8348000	8353000	All right. So there it is. O.L.R. will become the official voice of Microsoft.
8353000	8355000	I just had a horrible thought.
8355000	8361000	If we ended up doing the porn app, what if it was like recording stuff with the connect?
8361000	8364000	When you're not watching. That's why it needs to be detached.
8364000	8366000	And then that's the porn channel.
8366000	8367000	All right.
8367000	8368000	Let's run down the list.
8368000	8369000	John Weil channel.
8369000	8370000	Let's run down the list real quick.
8370000	8374000	If you guys need it up so you can choose what to eliminate, go to live.vognetwork.com.
8374000	8377000	Here is the list as it stands right now.
8377000	8378000	Rename it to Dreamcast 2.
8378000	8380000	Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.
8380000	8383000	Hipster exclusives like Mega Man Legends and Shenmue 3.
8383000	8385000	Drop the price at least $101.
8385000	8387000	Backwards compatibility with the 360.
8387000	8389000	The box is now an artificial kitten.
8389000	8390000	Pornography app.
8390000	8392000	Make Rare do a new anticipation.
8392000	8393000	Detach connect.
8393000	8396000	A free waffle iron with every order.
8396000	8398000	A more interactive banning system.
8398000	8401000	And OLR becomes the official voice of Microsoft.
8401000	8403000	That is a great list tonight.
8403000	8405000	This is going to be painful tonight.
8405000	8408000	You have to choose which of these is not worthy of the list.
8408000	8410000	It's just too big of a list when it's 12.
8410000	8411000	It's too much.
8411000	8413000	So we need to narrow this down a little bit.
8413000	8416000	So Captain Spike, I'm sorry, but you got to go first.
8416000	8418000	Because we make our guests go first.
8418000	8421000	Captain Spike, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8421000	8423000	It is awful for you to put me in this position.
8423000	8424000	Sorry about it.
8424000	8428000	I'm going to take off making Orange Launch Radio the official voice of Microsoft.
8428000	8429000	Because I don't want you to sell out.
8429000	8431000	Stay independent.
8431000	8433000	He did sugar coat that in a very good way.
8433000	8437000	Yeah, but we said we'd sell out in an instant if people want to take us.
8437000	8439000	No, no, no.
8439000	8443000	I think he's just a little jealous because there was no room for gamebuoy.org in that sense.
8443000	8445000	Maybe I should just read it.
8445000	8447000	Vog and Pals.
8447000	8448000	Vog and Pals.
8448000	8449000	There you go.
8449000	8453000	Clearly Game Buoy would be the right voice for Microsoft.
8453000	8457000	You're so far up Nintendo's ass, I don't think you would know what to say.
8457000	8460000	They care about game design. I'm here for that.
8460000	8461000	Alright.
8461000	8463000	It is stricken from the list.
8463000	8467000	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8467000	8474000	Just because it's silly and, you know, they don't really make a ton of games anymore.
8474000	8478000	Buying Sega and calling it the Dreamcast 2.
8478000	8481000	You're going to eliminate the Dreamcast 2.
8481000	8482000	Yeah, I'm sorry.
8482000	8483000	You ass.
8483000	8484000	Alright, that's alright.
8484000	8486000	It is stricken from the list.
8486000	8487000	Rename it to Dreamcast 2.
8487000	8488000	Not going to happen.
8488000	8492000	Alright, so that comes to my turn.
8492000	8494000	Oh my gosh, this is so hard.
8497000	8504000	Okay, the internet is going to totally hate me for this, but I am going to say the box is now an artificial kitten.
8504000	8511000	I just, it's, it's, I like cats, don't get me wrong, but something about the eyebo like fucking freaks the shit out of me.
8511000	8514000	So I don't want that Xbox to turn into that.
8514000	8515000	Can I ever bring over my eyebo?
8515000	8516000	I want an eyebo.
8516000	8520000	So unfortunately I'm going to eliminate the artificial kitten.
8520000	8523000	Dude, I really want an eyebo because I want to see what Midna would do.
8523000	8526000	Especially now that I think of it, a box that poops is also probably out of it.
8526000	8530000	So sorry about it. It is removed from the list.
8530000	8532000	Real cats are better anyway.
8532000	8537000	Alright, so Dark Sakura, last but not least, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8537000	8538000	Anticipation.
8538000	8542000	Anticipation, because I'm sorry.
8542000	8543000	You're a brat.
8543000	8546000	The only anticipation I care about comes from Frank's mouth.
8549000	8550000	I see what you did there.
8550000	8553000	Okay, only because you phrased that in a great way.
8553000	8554000	There it is.
8554000	8556000	Make Rare do a new anticipation is removed from the list.
8556000	8560000	Very interesting the way that worked out tonight because nobody got hosed with two eliminations.
8560000	8562000	Each host got one taken off.
8562000	8564000	So fair enough, fair enough.
8564000	8568000	Well Spike, we're going to put it to a vote of the public.
8568000	8570000	But hey, I want to thank you for being here tonight.
8570000	8572000	Oh, thank you so much for having me.
8572000	8574000	Not a problem.
8574000	8576000	Let's plug your show one more time.
8576000	8578000	Where can folks hear you on the interwebs?
8578000	8581000	And what kind of fun topics do you have coming up next on your show?
8581000	8584000	That is gamebuoy.org.
8584000	8588000	Oh sorry, it just reflects to wait for someone to repeat it.
8588000	8590000	Oh, gamebuoy.org.
8590000	8596000	And coming up we have a researched episode on bootleg games.
8596000	8601000	Cheetah Man and Donkey Kong Returns 99 and that sort of thing.
8601000	8604000	Cheetah Man is awesome and horrible.
8604000	8611000	I like how you say it's a researched as opposed to so much other stuff out there on the internet like this program.
8611000	8613000	I'm not naming names.
8613000	8616000	Have you ever played Cheetah Man or any of the sequels?
8616000	8618000	I don't think so.
8618000	8620000	Be glad. Rejoice.
8620000	8622000	I'm sure it was bad.
8622000	8624000	The music is super good though.
8624000	8626000	Are we talking about Color Dreams games on the NES?
8626000	8628000	That's going to be a thing we talk about, yes.
8628000	8630000	And the 10 Gen games.
8630000	8632000	Oh my god, some of those were really horrible.
8632000	8636000	Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who was the worst NES game in history.
8636000	8638000	It was so horrible.
8638000	8640000	We're going to talk about Bible Adventures.
8640000	8642000	Yes, awesome.
8642000	8644000	Well actually I will say this.
8644000	8646000	You guys are always very well researched over there.
8646000	8649000	I don't know this about you Captain Spike, but you're like a freaking encyclopedia when it comes to games.
8649000	8651000	You know an awful lot.
8651000	8653000	Domestic and import.
8653000	8656000	People should check it out if they want to hear something really educated.
8656000	8659000	Thank you. Thank you so much for your kind words.
8659000	8662000	I love your show. I'm a long time fan. Thank you for having me.
8662000	8665000	We're long time fans of you Spike. Come back and say hi in the studio sometime.
8665000	8667000	Thank you, will do.
8667000	8669000	Take care my friend.
8669000	8671000	Spike, help us out tonight. We are about to make this answerable.
8671000	8674000	I just want to remind people as they vote on this.
8674000	8677000	You get to vote for your number one and your number two pick.
8677000	8679000	Your first click will be your number one.
8679000	8681000	Your second click will be your number two.
8681000	8683000	So think before you vote.
8683000	8686000	It is now put to the vote of the listeners.
8686000	8689000	Help us come up with the definitive list.
8689000	8692000	We will keep this open for a few minutes.
8692000	8696000	While we do a couple more stories here.
8696000	8698000	I think we're going to go to the mail bag.
8698000	8700000	We have a mail.
8700000	8702000	One email tonight.
8702000	8705000	And apparently we can get cheap Viagra.
8705000	8708000	Live.vognetwork.com
8708000	8711000	While we open up the mail bag.
8711000	8714000	If you want to send us an email about Viagra or otherwise.
8714000	8717000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
8717000	8720000	Maybe you could send us a well researched email on bootleg games.
8720000	8723000	And we can one up what Game Boy is doing.
8723000	8726000	I have to make a mention of something by the way.
8726000	8729000	I've seen a lot of people try to do stuff on GoFundMe.
8729000	8733000	And I wonder if I put up a GoFundMe if people would send me to Comiket.
8735000	8737000	But what are they going to get out of it?
8737000	8739000	Me at Comiket.
8739000	8742000	I'll bring back toilet paper.
8742000	8745000	Alright. What's that email we got tonight?
8745000	8749000	Okay we got something from CatastrophicMaggie who I chat with all the time on Steam.
8749000	8754000	Evening all is your very favorite CatastrophicMaggie. Smile.
8754000	8758000	I've been pretty psyched for Telltale's new game A Wolf Among Us.
8758000	8760000	Which is a prequel to the Fables comics.
8760000	8762000	I like the Fables comics for the record.
8762000	8764000	You guys haven't mentioned it yet.
8764000	8767000	Apart from Jamie who I'm continually pestering on Steam anyway.
8767000	8769000	Have you seen anything about it yet?
8769000	8771000	Mainly just the trailer.
8771000	8775000	In other news. I honestly haven't seen anything on it by the way.
8775000	8779000	In other news I've always wanted to go to one of the big American cons.
8779000	8782000	So given VoG's ties with Dragon Con nowadays.
8782000	8784000	I'm going to aim for that one in 2015.
8784000	8786000	So you'd better be there Rob.
8786000	8788000	2015? Not 14.
8788000	8790000	Well it takes time to save up.
8790000	8792000	No you're right. It does take time. I'm just saying.
8792000	8796000	If I have as good of a time next year as I did this year and I don't see why I wouldn't.
8796000	8800000	I would absolutely go back every year as long as I can afford it.
8800000	8802000	Hear you later, Maggie.
8802000	8808000	So I don't know how well it's going to do to play the trailer on the air.
8809000	8811000	No I don't really want to play it on the air.
8811000	8813000	But where can people look that up? Is that just on YouTube?
8813000	8814000	It's on YouTube.
8814000	8815000	Well people can look that up on YouTube.
8815000	8816000	So it's A Wolf Among Us.
8816000	8819000	Well there you go. You can just Google that and you'll find that.
8819000	8823000	And I pretty much do kind of chat with Maggie every day come to think of it.
8823000	8825000	Yeah he chats with me on Steam once in a while too.
8825000	8828000	And he was good enough to. He's the one that got me.
8828000	8830000	Oh god and now I forgot the name of that game.
8830000	8833000	That other scary game. Paranormal. The one that I played.
8833000	8835000	That was another scary game that I played a little bit.
8835000	8838000	Maggie's been trying to get me into Shin Megami Tensei.
8838000	8841000	Which I probably will play it eventually.
8841000	8844000	I've got a bunch of games on my plate, man.
8844000	8847000	Okay. So that's it.
8847000	8850000	One email apart from Viagra.
8850000	8857000	Which I don't know about you but I have no problems with that part of anyone's anatomy.
8857000	8863000	Alright. We are going to move on with some news.
8863000	8867000	Again you can vote in the list list tonight. Live.vognetwork.com.
8867000	8872000	Oh before we get to the news we have to get to the angst with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
8872000	8876000	Why do we do a segment called the FUs of the Week on the video game show?
8876000	8883000	Because if you were me fighting the Cerberus boss in Kingdom Hearts earlier today there was a lot of rage.
8893000	8902000	I'm going to give a big FU to anti-Semitism.
8902000	8905000	Not just because of things that happened earlier.
8905000	8907000	But because it's...
8907000	8912000	And this is the people who are like, oh well we're Christians and we're persecuted here in America.
8912000	8917000	No you're not. You don't have to have the cops at your Christmas services.
8918000	8923000	To keep people from breaking into your cars or throwing bricks at your place of worship.
8923000	8925000	So an FU to that.
8925000	8928000	FU to intolerance in general.
8928000	8930000	Yeah. FU to intolerance.
8930000	8934000	And the cops have been really good about it every year.
8934000	8937000	They just make a presence and we don't have any trouble.
8937000	8941000	But I just don't think it's horrible that it's necessary.
8941000	8942000	Absolutely.
8942000	8945000	So FU to that.
8945000	8947000	Alright, Logie.
8947000	8951000	FU to Logan's Roadhouse.
8951000	8956000	Their fried cheese hamburger because it was not good.
8956000	8961000	You would think that a patty of fried cheese would be good on a burger.
8961000	8963000	But it was not.
8963000	8965000	That's why you need to go to squeeze in.
8965000	8968000	I've been to squeeze in and their burgers are not good.
8968000	8974000	And I was sorely disappointed because it sounded awesome like a cheese grip.
8974000	8979000	They burn the shit out of their burgers and they don't season the patties at all.
8979000	8980000	So they tasted like crap.
8980000	8984000	I can't remember like the last really good hamburger I had where I went like,
8984000	8986000	Mmm, that is a tasty burger.
8986000	8990000	Red Robin's burgers are pretty good if you put a ton of their seasoned salt on it.
8990000	8992000	It makes their burgers taste really good.
8992000	8993000	I like In-N-Out.
8993000	8995000	Rob, I'm going to have to take you to California Burger.
8995000	8996000	Oh, I like Smash Burger.
8996000	8997000	I took Alan there.
8997000	8998000	Oh yeah?
8998000	8999000	He really likes it.
8999000	9000000	Nice.
9000000	9003000	Oh, he sent me a picture and I was like, that burger is drenched in mayonnaise.
9003000	9004000	That looks disgusting.
9004000	9007000	Well, they put, you can get it without.
9007000	9008000	Thank God.
9008000	9010000	They do like Thousand Island dressing and other stuff too.
9010000	9012000	Yeah, that's all the devil's work.
9012000	9015000	I love mayonnaise for the record.
9015000	9018000	My F.U. of the week goes to mayonnaise first and foremost every week.
9018000	9026000	And my other F.U. goes to, you know, as much as I love this time of year pumpkin everything.
9026000	9027000	It's making me die.
9027000	9031000	My F.U. to all the sugar that I'm eating right now.
9031000	9035000	It's making me gain weight when I should be trying to lose it to do sexy cosplay next
9035000	9037000	year at Dragon Con.
9037000	9039000	So F.U. to sugar.
9039000	9041000	Can I add another one, Rob?
9041000	9042000	No.
9042000	9043000	Let's go to the next story.
9043000	9044000	Yes, you can add another one.
9044000	9049000	A big F.U. to all of the people who are sending poor hussy death threats.
9049000	9052000	I know you don't like the, this is a Homestuck thing by the way.
9052000	9053000	Oh.
9053000	9055000	I know you don't like what happened in the last update.
9056000	9058000	A lot of us were like, oh shit.
9058000	9062000	But it's no reason to send somebody freaking death threats.
9062000	9064000	It's a story.
9064000	9067000	And I have to commend him for being very positive about the whole thing.
9067000	9068000	Well good.
9068000	9076000	It's a very, it's a very mature sign when the author who is apparently receiving said, you know,
9076000	9081000	teenage crap is being very gracious and focusing on the good parts of the fandom.
9081000	9084000	So good for you.
9084000	9085000	Alright.
9085000	9088000	A few more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your calls
9088000	9092000	at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9092000	9093000	But not just yet.
9093000	9094000	We still have a couple more stories first.
9094000	9095000	Loki.
9095000	9096000	Alright.
9096000	9099000	So let's talk a little bit about Duke Nukem Forever.
9099000	9100000	Yeah.
9100000	9106000	Apparently, I don't know if you guys remember, but a few months ago there was this whole
9106000	9114000	lawsuit with 3D Realms trying to get their royalties from Gearbox and all that stuff.
9114000	9118000	Apparently, you know, they were owed $2 million.
9118000	9121000	But apparently they've dropped the case.
9121000	9124000	I'm not sure if they've settled it or what the case is.
9124000	9129000	After reviewing evidence regarding our business affairs and without any money exchanging hands,
9129000	9134000	we have satisfactory resolved any and all differences we perceived against Gearbox.
9135000	9138000	And so they've apologized.
9138000	9139000	Hmm.
9139000	9141000	I don't know what that means.
9141000	9142000	But.
9142000	9143000	Boy.
9143000	9144000	Yeah.
9144000	9147000	Kind of interesting how that all ended with an apology.
9147000	9148000	Yeah.
9148000	9149000	Basically, here's the press release.
9149000	9152000	It says, who am I concerned after reviewing the evidence regarding our business affairs
9152000	9156000	and without any money exchanging hands, we have satisfactory resolved any and all differences
9156000	9158000	that we perceived against Gearbox.
9158000	9163000	In all sincerity, we regret the misunderstanding that instigated our lawsuit and now that
9163000	9167000	we better understand and appreciate the actual nature of our business matters,
9167000	9172000	we have voluntarily withdrawn our claims against Gearbox with genuine apologies to Randy
9172000	9177000	for any damage that our lawsuit may have caused the relationship.
9177000	9180000	So seriously, or sincerely, Scott Miller.
9180000	9182000	So in other words, they hugged it out.
9182000	9183000	Essentially.
9183000	9184000	I guess.
9184000	9186000	I don't know.
9186000	9191000	Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't any royalties to be made because it made no money.
9191000	9193000	I don't know what the case may be.
9193000	9194000	But whatever.
9194000	9195000	They're frenzies now.
9195000	9196000	So yeah.
9196000	9197000	All right.
9197000	9202000	Well, last but not least, our longtime music game fans will probably be happy to hear this.
9202000	9207000	This was always a adorable little music game series that not everybody knows about.
9207000	9212000	But maybe you should hear about Taiko Drum Master, which is also known as Taiko no Tatujin.
9212000	9216000	Taiko Drum Master Namco Bandai will be bringing it to the Wii U.
9216000	9222000	Famitsu has mentioned that you can play Taiko Drum Master Wii U version with a taiko drum accessory.
9222000	9226000	It'll be available for the Wii, Wii remotes, or the Wii U game pad.
9226000	9231000	The game pad controls will be optimized to be simple for game players.
9231000	9234000	I'm hoping you're not going to beat that game pad with a stick.
9234000	9235000	I'm sure it's like tapping or something.
9235000	9237000	They're doing a little different.
9237000	9243000	Baton change mode is a new mode where between two to four players will work together in playing one song.
9243000	9247000	There'll also be Nintendo crossover content like Mario Luigi Masks.
9247000	9252000	And one of the songs that will be playable in the game, Wild Pokémon Battle Medley.
9252000	9257000	So we'll have a little bit of that crossover there to make it even more appealing to Nintendo fans.
9257000	9259000	So there you go.
9259000	9260000	No word on when.
9260000	9265000	You can just look forward to it, I guess next year, I would think at this point.
9265000	9267000	So there you go.
9267000	9270000	Do you guys ever play Taiko no Tatujin?
9270000	9272000	It's been a long time, but I like that game.
9272000	9274000	Last time I played it was on PSP.
9274000	9278000	I don't think I've played it since they originally put the US PlayStation 2 one out.
9278000	9280000	I have the US ones.
9280000	9286000	And because Dan actually, back when he got to take home Field Destroys, that's how I got mine.
9286000	9287000	Okay.
9287000	9289000	It worked. I don't know.
9289000	9293000	All right. Well, now's the part of the show where we're going to open it up to your calls.
9293000	9297000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9297000	9300000	You can give us a call to talk about whatever you'd like to.
9300000	9304000	Perhaps something we've talked about tonight or something that we missed.
9304000	9306000	You can also still vote on list lists.
9306000	9313000	We'll close that up at the end of the show, the very end tonight, once everybody has had a chance to call in or what have you.
9316000	9319000	Loki, do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls?
9319000	9321000	Just one, Grant. That's auto-related.
9321000	9331000	It's been found by digging through the files of the game that it makes reference to PC and PlayStation 4 in the form of Orbis.
9331000	9335000	So most likely those versions will be coming.
9335000	9343000	And I would assume that an Xbox One version would be coming as well unless there's some sort of financial exclusive trickery or whatever that they're going to be pulling.
9343000	9346000	All right. Let's go to the phones because we are getting a call.
9346000	9348000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9348000	9350000	Hello, it's Shane.
9350000	9352000	Hey, Shane. How are you doing?
9352000	9355000	I am running a dungeon, so I'm doing pretty well.
9355000	9357000	In Final Fantasy XIV, you're multitasking?
9357000	9360000	Well, I might not pay attention to the phone call.
9360000	9364000	Well, thanks for calling when you had so much attention to give us tonight.
9364000	9368000	How is Final Fantasy XIV going for you? You're all the way in Endgame, right?
9368000	9384000	Uh, yeah. I am actually running a dungeon that's for max level and it seems pretty terrible so far because the tank left when the three of us that joined said we've never ran this one before, so we just auto-quit the dungeon.
9384000	9386000	What a jerk.
9386000	9389000	I know, right? She got his name so I could publicly shame him.
9389000	9391000	You should. Do that in the future.
9391000	9399000	Quickly, I know you'll talk about some of this on Horde House this week, but what is there to do when you get to the Endgame in Final Fantasy XIV? What happens when you get to 50?
9399000	9411000	Gear up for the actual Endgame? Because that's what I'm doing right now. I'm running the hard mode Primal Battles, so I got a weapon from there already, which is pretty awesome. It took only two tries.
9411000	9417000	And I'm running level 50 dungeons to get currency to get better gear.
9417000	9420000	So after the grinding of leveling up comes more grinding?
9420000	9423000	Yeah, but it's not bad. I'm having fun with it.
9423000	9428000	Alright, well that's important. Alright. Well, did you call to talk about XIV tonight or what did you want to talk about tonight?
9428000	9431000	No, I called to talk about the 2DS.
9431000	9437000	Oh, yes. The Nintendo 2DS was announced, what, last week? About a week ago? Two weeks ago?
9437000	9439000	Two weeks ago? Two weeks ago? Something like that.
9439000	9454000	Well, a lot of internet anger about this thing. How dare Nintendo put this thing out because it looks stupid, basically, was the verdict of the internet courtroom. What do you want to say about it?
9455000	9462000	Well, if you know my job, I kind of get Nintendo stuff early, and so I have my 2DS.
9462000	9472000	And I have to say that I just barely, barely like it less than my 3DS XL. It is a wonderful system.
9472000	9473000	Really?
9473000	9490000	Yeah, it's comfortable to hold. The way the design, the slate design is awesome. Like, I don't know, if the screens were a little bit bigger, I probably wouldn't play my XL at all. It's that nice to me.
9490000	9493000	What do you think people on the internet are getting wrong about this thing?
9494000	9507000	Um, I'm not, I'm not sure they are, because it's not, it's geared really more towards, like, an entry-level, first-time, current generation of Nintendo handheld experience.
9508000	9525000	So these people that are, like, saying, oh, this is awful, why would anybody get this, it's not geared towards them. It's geared to, like, the 5 and 6-year-olds that didn't have one before, or the person that didn't want to shell out $170 to play the latest Mario or Pokémon.
9525000	9532000	Now, you can shell out $130, and you don't get the 3D features, but you still get a really great experience.
9532000	9535000	I know a teenager who wants a 2DS.
9535000	9537000	Pretty much for that reason.
9537000	9555000	Yeah, it's great. I really hope a lot of people get their hands on it. If you are going out to GameStops or Walmarts or Targets this week, you might run into a Nintendo app and they might be able to show you one, so you can play around with it and see how you really feel about it.
9556000	9565000	But I love it. And the little case that you can buy extra is adorable, and it's also shaped like a piece of toast, so it's pretty cool.
9565000	9572000	Would you really have dropped the $129 or whatever the price is? Would you really have dropped that amount of money on this device?
9572000	9584000	If I didn't have any form of 3DS, yes. If I had a regular 3DS and then got to mess with this, yes. But because I have an XL, personally, no.
9584000	9591000	But that's just because I already have an XL, and I think this is just slightly under the XL in terms of how great it is.
9591000	9594000	Pokémon's almost here, right?
9594000	9595000	Yeah, it is.
9595000	9597000	Are you excited about that?
9597000	9598000	What?
9598000	9599000	Are you excited about that?
9599000	9602000	No, I'm not excited whatsoever for Pokémon.
9602000	9607000	Aren't they supposed to announce something? Didn't Twitter tease some type of announcement tomorrow?
9607000	9615000	Tomorrow at 8 AM Pacific, so it's the first time in forever for some sort of announcement that I don't have to get up early for.
9615000	9623000	There you go. Do you think it might be anything that's not about X and Y, like something of the future of Pokémon?
9623000	9630000	I'm not sure. I really don't know. I'm just as excited as everybody else is.
9630000	9637000	Alright, and before we wrap up tonight, why are you so damn excited about Pokémon X and Y? What about it is exciting?
9638000	9650000	It's taking the game to new graphical and like, I don't know what the word is I'm looking for. It's the evolution of Pokémon.
9650000	9660000	And that's exciting because, you know, black and white, it was a nice jump, but it wasn't a real jump. It was kind of like a little step up. This is a huge jump forward.
9660000	9665000	Alright. Well, Shane, if you don't have anything else, I guess we'll let you get back to your dungeon. Thanks for calling.
9665000	9674000	Alright. Bye. He makes it sound like he didn't want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call.
9674000	9682000	This is also the last call to vote in listless. You do need to be a registered VoG participant, but we don't charge money for that. We're not like that.
9682000	9688000	Just sign up at vognetwork.com and then you will see the board up at live.vognetwork.com.
9688000	9694000	And big thanks to Bobby Blackwell for coding this little game. And he had to fix it on the fly tonight because I guess it was actually broken.
9694000	9700000	When it went to tabulate, it was taking the last listless we did, which was the first one on the system, and it was combining the votes together.
9700000	9705000	So the wrong answer was winning. So, but he fixed it. So now we have the accurate results.
9705000	9711000	The last time we did listless was thing I most want to happen at E3 2013. That gives you an idea how long ago that was.
9711000	9718000	So, alright. So this is your last chance to vote in listless. Don't forget to vote for your number one and your number two answer with your first and second clicks there.
9718000	9725000	Again, phone lines are open. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9725000	9730000	I will try to bring up the Twitter topics here real quick. No other last minute stories, Logie?
9730000	9734000	No, I'm just, I'm looking through grants without a file now.
9734000	9739000	Alright, well we do have another call coming in, so let's go to the phones and we'll take that.
9739000	9741000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9741000	9743000	Holy shit, I got through. It's Ranma.
9743000	9744000	Hey, Ranma. How you doing?
9744000	9745000	Hello.
9745000	9751000	Thank you so much. The thing is, I wasn't even going to call. Let everybody else, you know, call in, you know, hey.
9751000	9762000	Yeah, you know, the phone lines haven't been lighting up as much this month as previously. Like last week I seem to remember was really tough. We barely got any calls last week either. It was weird.
9762000	9766000	Do I have to have another open Skype challenge?
9767000	9778000	No, I figure, you know, some weeks people have things to say and some weeks they don't. This was a pretty slow news week all things considered. There wasn't really anything that really ignited passion maybe in previous weeks.
9778000	9780000	I see.
9780000	9792000	I thought maybe we'd hear more about Sony and the whole, like, just from the listeners because Sony did that big thing on Sunday night, but, you know, that was a whole week ago at this point, which in internet years was about three years ago.
9792000	9795000	So, well what's on your mind, Ranma? To what do we do with this phone call tonight?
9796000	9800000	Rob, would you like to hear about the game that got me to stop playing Candy Crush Saga?
9800000	9802000	Absolutely.
9802000	9805000	Alright, you've heard of the game Namco Cross Capcom, right?
9805000	9806000	Yes.
9806000	9810000	And the now spiritual actual sequel, Project Cross Zone.
9810000	9816000	Yes, the name of our panel at GamerX was inspired by that podcast Cross Zone, yeah.
9816000	9823000	Nice. I just want you to know I have been playing this game for about three weeks straight. I have almost 50 hours logged into the game.
9823000	9824000	Wow.
9824000	9844000	I mean, this is like, I see my, I'm sitting here watching stuff on DVR to catch up and I'm like, pause, go grab the 3DS, sit down, unpause, just turn the volume down on the game, start playing, and I'm like, pause DVR, put the volume back up, put the headphones on and just keep playing.
9844000	9852000	What is it about this game that makes it so amazing? Is it just the cutscenes and this and the way you get sucked into it that way?
9852000	9862000	No, it's the fact that I call it an, it's not just a tactical RPG, it's an action tactical RPG. Real-time RPG.
9862000	9871000	Whereas before, you know, with games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars, you set your characters and you sit there and you watch them attack each other.
9871000	9872000	Mhm.
9872000	9890000	In this, you move your character to the person you want to fight and then the screen comes up, you hold down the attack button, you do one attack, then you do another series of combinations, like it could be attack and left and up and down and then right, and it'll just keep doing a series of attacks right behind each other.
9891000	9902000	But in Project Cross Zone, you can have a third person part of your team, and that person's with you, you hit the L button, they just come inside doing anywhere from 15 to 20 hit combos.
9902000	9918000	And if somebody's within your space, that's your support. You hit the R button, they come in and do more damage, and if you time it just right, before you do your special, you could do a 90 hit combo that does up to 10,000 points of damage.
9918000	9927000	You know, I'm not hearing a lot about this game. It seems to be a game that really is flying under the radar. What do you think people are missing about this game?
9927000	9942000	I think it's because you have different gaming properties in it. You have Rival Schools, you have Space Channel 5, you have .hack, Street Fighter, the Tales of series, Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Force.
9942000	9953000	It's like, it's pretty much Sega, Namco, Bandai, and Capcom just had a freaking gaming orgy. And the storyline is just phenomenal as well.
9953000	9955000	And you get to clean it up.
9955000	9956000	Yeah.
9958000	9959000	That sounds hot.
9959000	9965000	So even the storyline incorporates all this like cross IP fuckery.
9965000	9974000	I think I sent Jamie a screenshot, or I posted it on my wall for her to look at, for a little in-joke or something like that.
9975000	9980000	I believe that you did, and I can't get onto my Facebook right now.
9980000	9985000	Yeah, something about the fantasy zone. Get ready. I'm like, oh! Oh, Jamie's gonna love that.
9985000	9987000	One of Jamie's favorite quotes.
9987000	9988000	Yes.
9988000	9997000	And I've been meaning to record this one scene by having that time, but there is a scene when you're playing with Ulala and you call her out as a support.
9997000	10002000	She fires with her guns. The Opa comes in and starts blowing shit up.
10002000	10009000	And the dude from Space Harries jumps out of nowhere and just does like a series of attacks out of nowhere.
10009000	10023000	Alan Alchemy in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, no shade, but it's a fan service game with a lot of niche franchises in a format, strat RPG, that generally isn't a heavy hitter and only appeals to certain gamers, which of course makes it completely phenomenal.
10023000	10029000	Is this one of these hipster games that might save the Xbox One if tonight's list is to be believed?
10029000	10040000	Maybe, but I was just saying to a bunch of friends of mine, if they ever did a brand new Naruto video game in this style, I would sit down and play it from start to finish, because it would fit.
10040000	10041000	All right.
10041000	10042000	Yes.
10042000	10046000	Well, Rama, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?
10046000	10050000	My liberal will never forgive me from this past weekend.
10050000	10051000	How so?
10052000	10059000	I went to Nauticon, a 21 plus anime gaming convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
10059000	10060000	Oh my.
10060000	10063000	Oh, you have no idea, good sir.
10063000	10072000	Let's just say in one night I drank typically what I would have drank over three nights.
10072000	10073000	Wow.
10073000	10075000	That was like me at Dragon Con though, to be honest.
10075000	10079000	But I haven't been drinking a lot lately, so I've been well behaved.
10079000	10080000	All right.
10080000	10083000	Well, Rama, I'm glad to hear you had fun.
10083000	10093000	We can hear all about that con and more cons on your little program that you co-host here at VOG Network, Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights, right?
10093000	10094000	That's right.
10094000	10095000	All right.
10095000	10099000	Pre-show starts around 9.15, 9.20, right after our brand new neighbors at Electric Sisterhood.
10099000	10100000	Sounds awesome.
10100000	10101000	All right, take care, buddy.
10101000	10102000	You too.
10102000	10103000	Bye-bye.
10103000	10104000	Bye-bye.
10104000	10108000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10108000	10113000	We have about one more moment to take calls and we'll reveal the results of Listless as well.
10113000	10119000	I was just going real quick to see if we had any tweets.
10119000	10125000	And we did get a couple tweets from TigerCaw and one of the stories he tweeted us, I remember reading about this.
10125000	10127000	Did you hear about this on the internet this week?
10127000	10132000	JJ Abrams emotionally hurt by the latest Star Trek game.
10132000	10133000	Yeah, I saw that.
10133000	10137000	I wasn't going to post it, but I was like, that's stupid.
10137000	10140000	What did you guys think about that, that he was so hurt about it?
10140000	10141000	I could see that.
10141000	10142000	Yeah?
10142000	10143000	That game was pretty bad.
10143000	10144000	Yeah, I heard it was pretty bad too.
10144000	10147000	All right, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.
10147000	10149000	I love this icon this guy has too.
10149000	10150000	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.
10150000	10151000	Who's this?
10151000	10152000	This is Code Man.
10152000	10155000	Hey, Code Man, I love your little user picture.
10155000	10164000	It's like who I envision is you and a little creeper drawn Minecraft style with little Mickey Mouse balloons and mouse ears.
10164000	10169000	Like it's the most random collage of worlds, but I love it.
10169000	10175000	I want to make it into a shirt, but I don't know if Disney will attack me with copyrights if I make it into a shirt.
10175000	10177000	Nah, that might happen. You got to be careful with that.
10177000	10179000	You better have them go to Six Flags.
10179000	10181000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10182000	10188000	Kingdom Hearts HD Remix. It's absolutely fantastic.
10188000	10189000	Yeah?
10189000	10200000	You know, I haven't played the first one in so long, and bringing that back into my life, because I remember I was 17 when it came out and I bought it on launch day.
10200000	10208000	And I remember playing it and imagining how could any game get any better than this game?
10208000	10215000	Because I'm a huge Disney fan, I'm a huge Squeenix fan, and so I'm all over all of these games.
10215000	10224000	And so when they came together and made this fantastic game, I was just going crazy.
10224000	10231000	But when they announced that they were releasing this HD Remix, I absolutely went crazy.
10231000	10235000	And so when I popped it in and started playing it, they have changed.
10235000	10240000	Of course, I never played the final mix because it was never released in North America.
10240000	10248000	But the music sounds different, obviously the graphics are just phenomenal.
10248000	10259000	And there's so many different things now that maybe I missed when I played it earlier, or they weren't actually in there. I don't know.
10259000	10264000	I think too just the fact that it's been, what, 12 years since the game was first out.
10264000	10268000	I think you just kind of catch on to more, and you're probably a different gamer now than you were then.
10268000	10271000	So you just kind of find different things that way.
10271000	10277000	But is it just me, Codeman? Or did you lose skill over 12? Or maybe you got better, I don't know.
10277000	10281000	But why am I so bad at this kid's game?
10281000	10284000	This game is tough as hell.
10284000	10291000	I'm playing on Proud Mode, because I figured, okay, I'm going to play on Proud Mode.
10291000	10296000	I started Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and I still want to play Dream Drop Distance.
10296000	10305000	But like I said in chat earlier, I don't own any Nintendo handhelds, and I'm trying to figure out which one to buy.
10305000	10310000	Although Shane's kind of leaning me towards the 2DS. I don't know, though, because the 3D makes me sick.
10310000	10313000	I don't like 3D, but I know you can turn it off and all that stuff.
10313000	10317000	He does that to people. Look out. He's the best salesman in the video games industry.
10317000	10320000	He's the one that got me started on Final Fantasy XIV, but I don't want to talk about that.
10320000	10326000	But I don't know. It's so tough.
10326000	10331000	I'm anticipating the infamous fight with Sephiroth.
10331000	10336000	I've beaten him several times when I was a kid.
10336000	10340000	I beat him a million times, because he was tough.
10340000	10346000	The platinum, I can't remember what it was called, but it was the platinum whatever that you fought him.
10347000	10350000	He was the hardest character in the whole game.
10350000	10355000	I'm anticipating that fight, because I know now I started playing it again, and I'm like,
10355000	10360000	God, this game is so difficult. And I don't remember it being that difficult when I was a kid.
10360000	10363000	No kidding. I'm still getting my butt whipped by Cerberus.
10363000	10367000	But I seem to recall, and I think I might have had to do this the first time I played 2,
10367000	10372000	you can actually skip that fight and go on to the next world, and then go back and do it later.
10372000	10374000	It's a lot easier, so I think that's what I'm going to end up having to do.
10374000	10377000	Ah, I probably should have done that.
10377000	10379000	Enough about my problems.
10379000	10382000	Let's see, what else did I want to ask you about?
10382000	10384000	Because there was something else.
10384000	10388000	Oh, you were kind enough to gift me a copy of this game Outlast on Steam.
10388000	10390000	What am I in for?
10390000	10394000	First off, thank you. I want to publicly thank you.
10394000	10397000	Although, as I understand it, maybe I should also be saying curse you.
10397000	10401000	What inspired you to get me this game?
10401000	10408000	Well, you know, because I've watched your livestreams.
10408000	10412000	I don't really get a whole lot of time to do anything, really.
10412000	10416000	So I have to watch your livestreams when you post them like a nerd.
10416000	10422000	But I watch your livestreams that I find how hilarious when you play.
10422000	10427000	Like, Paranormal wasn't as bad because I don't think that game...
10427000	10430000	I don't know. That game's kind of cheesy to me.
10430000	10434000	I played it, and some of the scares were fine.
10434000	10437000	But then when you played Slender Man, that was hilarious.
10437000	10440000	So I'm trying to figure out something in my head.
10440000	10447000	I was like, okay, so what can I buy Rob to play that would be the funniest, scariest,
10447000	10454000	and all-around entertaining livestream that he plays.
10454000	10458000	But this game Outlast came out, and one of the guys that I talked to
10458000	10462000	that was on my podcast, he was like,
10462000	10465000	this game is the scariest game I've ever played in my whole entire life.
10465000	10467000	And so I was like, okay, well maybe this is the game that I should...
10467000	10469000	And I never really heard a whole lot about it.
10469000	10473000	I mean, I watch, you know, whatever.
10473000	10476000	But I don't really play games like that, so I thought,
10476000	10478000	okay, well maybe I should gift that to him.
10478000	10481000	So I gifted that to you, and you are in for a ride, my friend.
10481000	10483000	I hear. It's something else.
10483000	10487000	I'm not a big fan of the blood and gore, and apparently there's plenty of that in Outlast.
10487000	10490000	But I will make good on a livestream at some point.
10490000	10493000	I'm not sure when, but soon. We'll see. We'll see.
10493000	10496000	You've got to tear me away from Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts for a little bit first.
10496000	10499000	But I do really appreciate it, Coatman.
10499000	10501000	You know what you're talking about.
10501000	10505000	Coatman, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, get lists done and all that stuff.
10505000	10508000	But any last quick thoughts for us?
10508000	10513000	If you're not playing the Kingdom Hearts HD remix, you should definitely pick it up.
10514000	10517000	I've got to party with that guy sometime.
10517000	10519000	That guy, he sounds like a fun character.
10519000	10522000	He is a very fun character. If you ever go to New York City,
10522000	10524000	you look him up and say Rob Roberts sent you.
10524000	10526000	He'll show you a good time.
10526000	10529000	I have a friend in New York that will be with him pretty soon,
10529000	10531000	so yes, I will definitely look him up.
10531000	10535000	Or shit, go to any anime convention on the entirety of the East Coast,
10535000	10537000	and you'll probably run into him.
10537000	10539000	Oh, I'm sure. He's dressed up as Luigi, right?
10539000	10542000	Sometimes. I heard he might retire that soon.
10543000	10545000	You'll have to, or maybe that was Rama.
10545000	10547000	I don't want to speak for him.
10547000	10551000	You will have to just listen to Anime Jam Session to get all the latest.
10551000	10552000	Alrighty.
10552000	10554000	Alright, you take care my friend.
10554000	10555000	Alright, thanks.
10555000	10556000	Alright, bye bye.
10556000	10559000	Thanks for the calls guys, but we are going to close up the Skype line for now.
10559000	10562000	If you had something you wanted to say and you didn't get through,
10562000	10565000	you should absolutely email us.
10565000	10567000	Mailbag at orangelauntrady.com
10567000	10571000	or you can always tweet us, such as Tigerclaw did with one other story
10571000	10575000	that I want to read here real quick about the PlayStation 4 sharing options
10575000	10577000	and the whole game recording.
10577000	10582000	Apparently, things coming out about how you're going to have to break the DRM
10582000	10585000	of the high bandwidth digital content protection
10585000	10588000	if you want to stream outside of the built-in game streaming,
10588000	10591000	which as you know could be shut off for certain games
10591000	10594000	because PlayStation 4 doesn't have component cables,
10594000	10597000	and that's how people were getting around it on the PlayStation 3.
10597000	10602000	There's ways to strip that out.
10602000	10608000	There's like, uh, there are, there is apparently like a box you can get that strips it out,
10608000	10612000	like an HDCP stripper, but when you do that, you're breaking the law.
10612000	10617000	You are violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it prohibits.
10617000	10620000	Oh yeah, they're going to send cops to your house right away.
10620000	10622000	That's right. They will call the po-po.
10622000	10625000	It's just like when you rip off that tag on your mattress.
10626000	10628000	Someone's been ripping that tag.
10628000	10631000	No, it's only if you resell it after ripping off the tag.
10631000	10634000	You don't get arrested for ripping off the tag.
10634000	10637000	The seller does, just so you know.
10637000	10642000	Alright, by the way, I have to read this amazing drag from Alan in chat.
10642000	10644000	I love this. Alan Alchemy in our chat room.
10644000	10649000	This is a response to Tigerclaw's article earlier about how JJ Abrams was emotionally hurt by the game.
10649000	10653000	Perfect way to end the show here with Alan Alchemy literally dragging this.
10654000	10659000	Well, Star Trek fans are emotionally hurt by his shit show fanfic of Wrath of Khan
10659000	10662000	and saying he doesn't like pretentious intellectual Star Trek and never did.
10662000	10663000	Sorry about it.
10666000	10667000	For the record?
10667000	10670000	Four for you, Alan Alchemy. You go, Alan Alchemy.
10672000	10673000	Yeah, for the record?
10673000	10674000	I wasn't hurt.
10676000	10678000	Then again, I'm the DS9 fan.
10679000	10684000	Alright, that's going to about do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10684000	10688000	But before we get final thoughts, we have one other thing we've got to take care of.
10688000	10691000	And that is tonight's list list. Don't you want to know what won?
10691000	10692000	Yay.
10692000	10694000	So let's get to it.
10696000	10703000	Here it is, the top three as voted on by you guys at live.vognetwork.com.
10703000	10708000	The board is now away. You can no longer vote because here are the answers.
10708000	10712000	The winners. No ties tonight. This is a very clear top three tonight.
10712000	10719000	The number three answer for the thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.
10719000	10721000	The number three answer?
10721000	10724000	A more interactive banning system.
10726000	10730000	The number two answer for a thing that could make the Xbox One popular again.
10731000	10733000	Detach Connect.
10734000	10741000	And last but not least, the number one way that you will be popular all over the Internet, Microsoft.
10741000	10743000	You got to announce this tomorrow.
10743000	10745000	You buy the Xbox One?
10745000	10748000	A free waffle iron with every order.
10749000	10751000	Because they're waffling.
10752000	10753000	Get it?
10755000	10757000	Alright, there it is. Number one answer.
10757000	10758000	And besides that?
10758000	10759000	Waffle iron with every order.
10759000	10760000	Waffles.
10760000	10762000	I like waffles!
10762000	10764000	Waffles!
10764000	10768000	A big thanks to Captain Spike. Unfortunately, none of his answers made the top three.
10768000	10772000	But I will say his answer on Hipster Exclusives was the number four result.
10772000	10776000	So there it is. Mega Man Legends Assembly 3. That was the number four answer.
10776000	10779000	Followed right by Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.
10779000	10783000	So close yet so far, Captain Spike. I did love his answers.
10783000	10784000	Fly Phil to the Moon.
10784000	10787000	I know, right? I got that stuck. Like I'm having a Bayonetta moment.
10787000	10789000	Flame among the stars.
10790000	10792000	In other words...
10792000	10794000	Kiss my ass.
10797000	10799000	Alright, love it.
10799000	10803000	Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room saying anticipation would have won had Dark Soccer not been a meanie.
10803000	10804000	Well that's...
10804000	10806000	When?
10806000	10809000	That's... them's the breaks here on Listless.
10809000	10811000	Bobby, I want you to picture something.
10811000	10812000	Uh huh.
10812000	10814000	Imagine you're standing in an open field.
10814000	10816000	Imagine a world without you crying.
10816000	10819000	No. Imagine you're standing in an open field.
10819000	10820000	Yes.
10820000	10822000	And you're looking up at the sun.
10822000	10831000	And then suddenly, five letters float in front of the sun, completely blocking out its light and its S-H-A-D-E.
10836000	10842000	And on that note, we're gonna wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.
10842000	10844000	Maybe y'all sing us out tonight.
10844000	10846000	Fly me to the moon.
10846000	10850000	Well, you know the other half of the fans are saying Evangelion.
10850000	10853000	There's like 50 million versions of that song.
10853000	10855000	Or Utada Hikaru did one.
10855000	10858000	Utada Hikaru did one. I think it was on a Dance Mania album. Anyway.
10858000	10861000	I've got like the album version of that one.
10861000	10865000	Next April Fools on VOG. All we will do is play covers of that song.
10865000	10866000	Hear me out.
10866000	10867000	Alright.
10867000	10869000	Fly me to the moon.
10870000	10873000	Let's wrap it up, guys. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10873000	10875000	Thank you for participating. Thank you for being here.
10875000	10879000	Whether you were here live, whether you were listening to us on the podcast, we really appreciate it.
10879000	10883000	And all we ask, guys, tell a friend or two or five or seven about the show.
10883000	10886000	Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
10886000	10890000	You guys are what helps our fan base grow and grows our family.
10890000	10894000	And yeah, just thank you guys for your support. We so appreciate it.
10894000	10896000	We'll be back next week to do it all again.
10896000	10899000	But for now, we're going to wrap up with final thoughts tonight.
10899000	10901000	I'll go first with my final thought tonight.
10901000	10910000	My final thought is, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5 is probably going to do very well even though it's being released right before all these new consoles come out.
10910000	10913000	I really wish Final Fantasy XII would have gotten the same break.
10913000	10917000	Because Balthier and Fran are still like some of the best characters ever to come out of that series.
10917000	10919000	Maybe they'll do an HD remake.
10919000	10922000	My fingers and toes crossed. There was that rumor some time ago.
10922000	10924000	So I plan to buy the X remake.
10925000	10928000	If the X remake is as good as Kingdom Hearts, I'm on board.
10928000	10930000	They still haven't announced one that's coming out yet.
10930000	10931000	Still waiting.
10931000	10933000	Hopefully by the end of the year, I hope.
10933000	10934000	Yeah, hopefully.
10934000	10935000	We'll see.
10935000	10936000	Alright, that's my final thought.
10936000	10937000	Loki, your final thought.
10937000	10940000	I'm going to play Lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.
10940000	10944000	And hopefully now that it's out there, maybe we can livestream some of it.
10944000	10946000	Because that would be fun.
10946000	10949000	Last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
10950000	10951000	Of course.
10955000	10957000	That's all the singing you're going to get out of me.
10957000	10959000	Alright. Hey, that's something. We usually don't get singing here.
10959000	10962000	Thank you guys again so much for listening to the show.
10962000	10967000	We'll be back here to do it all again next week with episode 520 of our show.
10967000	10969000	A fifth of the way to 600.
10969000	10970000	For the record.
10970000	10973000	For the record what?
10973000	10975000	In other words.
10975000	10976000	Shut up.
10976000	10979000	You know, the more I think about it, we're going to be episode 600 before you know it.
10979000	10983000	This show might actually make it to episode 666.
10983000	10984000	I'm just saying.
10984000	10985000	Dun dun dun.
10985000	10987000	Those are like the big episodes we have left.
10987000	10989000	We have 600, of course.
10989000	10992000	We have 573, obviously, is going to be a big episode for us.
10992000	10994000	We'll explain that later if you don't know.
10994000	10998000	And then 666 would be like, we've got to do something crazy.
10998000	11001000	But if we make it to 777, we have to do like a whole Final Fantasy VII.
11001000	11003000	I'm going to be like 43.
11003000	11004000	Well, it's like the lucky seven.
11004000	11007000	I will be 43 when we get to 777.
11007000	11008000	Alright, that's it.
11008000	11009000	We're done.
11009000	11010000	Good night, everybody.
11010000	11011000	And have a great night.
11011000	11012000	Bye.
