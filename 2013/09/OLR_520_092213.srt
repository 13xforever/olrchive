Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Mighty No. 9 surpasses its stretch goals and we'll try heading to consoles.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Diablo 3 will lose its auction house next year, more of your money heads to iOS, and the tributes and memorials to Hiroshi Yamauchi begin.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 22nd of 2013 with the 520th episode of our show.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games with you guys out there in internet land and my co-hosts here in studio.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wark.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Wark.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wark.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Que.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Que.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Tonight's presentation of OLR will be presented in the language of Chocobo.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Wark, wark, wark.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That was the sound of like 500 people unsubscribing from the show all at once.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You mean we have that many?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alright.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The facts are completely made up on tonight's OLR as well.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How you doing DarkSakura? Seriously.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Caffeinated, thank you.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No seriously. How are you?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a bummer it's a radio show because if you all could see the look she was giving me right now.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think I was giving him the girl face.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Or how dare you cut me off.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But you're caffeinated, do you have your coffee?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm caffeinated. I have had healthy food today.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I still have chocolate covered mints for later.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ooh.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ooh, yummy.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I've brought delicious snacks.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Which I keep eating.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the form of my special trail mix.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Made of raw almonds.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And raw cashews.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And a roasted coconut.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But the coconut's the best part.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It totally is.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alright.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Say hello to our coconut here on the show.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Or just nut.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hi.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How are you Loki?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm fine.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My, well, throat's a little sore but I'm fine.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sorry to hear it.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm having colas.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I caught it from my son, so.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't get me sick.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, don't get us sick.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm being rude, don't get me sick.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's just, it's just the throat thing.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It could very well be also allergies because I always get, like, scratchy throat whenever

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the weather goes wet and then dry again.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, the season's changed yesterday.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know if you noticed, but it rained.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So that means summer's over and here's winter.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because we don't have a fall here.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's no transition.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's just like, boom, done.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Boom goes the dynamite.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's it.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, yeah, it rained here yesterday.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, thank gosh it rained yesterday and not two days ago because I went to an outdoor

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
concert two days ago and that would have been really terrible if it was raining.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, yeah.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Anyway, you guys are there in our chat room.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We always like to say hello to the fourth guest on the show, our chatters.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's set in October where we record dead.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And, again, that's Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Show.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And those of you that were listening live, I'm sure were aware of this.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if you're listening on the podcast, you may not be aware, our pal Bobby hit 400 episodes

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
tonight.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, claps and congratulations for Bobby.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's a great milestone.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And in true Bobby form, he had walked through the door 20 minutes before to set up in a

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
frenzy because he was working on something else for the show.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was 15 minutes late with Starbucks.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, that's our excuse, Dark Sakura.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bobby's always hard at work.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, all right.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We're going to get into gaming news and all that.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But tonight I want to start off a little bit with, you know, some sad news.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sure this is on many people's minds this week, as you probably were following the gaming,

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you know, the gaming press and pretty much every blog read a story on this.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But Hiroshi Yamauchi died this week at age 85.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you don't know that name, he was basically the head of Nintendo, the Nintendo president

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
for many years.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's the position that Satoru Iwata holds now.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And, you know, many of you know him for sure.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But Yamauchi ran Nintendo for 53 years.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So the NES, the Super NES, you know, all the stuff that led into NES because, you know,

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
they didn't start with that.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They were doing the watch games.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And even before that, it was cards and the more mechanical stuff.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's how he met Gunpei Okoye, if I'm not mistaken.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It wasn't about games at all.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think you have a mechanical.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But Hiroshi Yamauchi, he was a very interesting guy because he was a businessman in every sense of the word.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The man hardly played video games at all.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In fact, I believe rumor has it the first video game he ever played was when Tetris went to the Game Boy,

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
which to be fair was a lot of people.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was about to say.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah. I mean, he just knew how to make business decisions.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And a lot of people, of course, also know him because he owned the Seattle Mariners for quite some time.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And it was very controversial at the time because, you know, he was in Japan.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The team was here.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He didn't really have plans to come see the team.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He never came to see a game.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now, he watched them on TV and things like that, but he never came over to actually see a game.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So it was kind of controversial in that sense.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But again, businessman.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you also think about it.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Baseball is super, super huge in Japan.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A lot of makes sense.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And if I do remember correctly, thanks to one of our mutual friends and some of the players from the Mariners came over to play in Japan.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, that's right.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, you know, do you know who owns the Mariners now?

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If I'm not mistaken, I have no idea.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Howard Phillips.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Remember him from the Nintendo days?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He was Nintendo.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He was he used to be the Reggie Fils-Aime back in the day, the ginger ginger president of Nintendo.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And most people, honestly, most people our age know him from the Howard and Nestor comics from the days of the Nintendo Power.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So it's kind of funny how that all kind of goes together.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Some kind words and some reminiscing about Hiroshi Yamauchi in chat.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dungeon Buster says he was an uncanny judge of character and trends.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What Up G says hiring Miyamoto, one of his best moves ever.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
True says TMZ even showed a bit of love to Hiroshi Yamauchi, lol.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, you know, the news even kind of, you know, cut through to the mainstream because, you know, not only was he the Nintendo guy,

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
which, you know, obviously he made a boatload of money from his share of Nintendo stock when it surged thanks to the Wii and all that.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I mean, the man had a boatload of money.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Many people knew that he did not accept his pension when he retired from Nintendo.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He said, no, Nintendo needs the money.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And so I believe he donated a huge amount to cancer charities as well.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So the man did a lot of good, which should be recognized.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes, I think you think he probably had well enough in savings to live off of.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I wish that, you know, CEOs over here would do that.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, it was a very, very humble sort of sort of thing to do.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And it made a lot of mainstream coverage.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I heard not all of it was necessarily tasteful.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to say I heard that Arsenio Hall, who I didn't even realize was back on TV with a late night show.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I was like, how 1992 is that?

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But he's back on TV with a late night show.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And there was some type of joke in the monologue or something where, you know, Hiroshi Yamauchi died today.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And it sounded something like this.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And they played the Pac-Man.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Really?

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know. I'm paraphrasing the joke.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't remember the exact words, but I know it was the Pac-Man noise because it made me think,

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, if you want to get technical, sir, even though your joke is in incredibly poor taste, Pac-Man was a Namco character.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I think a lot of people would recognize the Mario death noise.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So if you had to go there, but you know what?

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then I'm writing people's disgusting jokes for them.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So whatever.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know how I found out about it, actually?

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oddly enough, I saw his picture on the Nikkei site.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then later on, I saw someone had translated from the business news that he died.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And that's how I found out.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, you know, obviously a lot of gaming in general is to thank to this man and his guidance.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Even if he wasn't necessarily a gamer himself, his business guidance led Nintendo to greatness.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I thought maybe we could just take a minute.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, obviously I think it goes without saying, we want to dedicate our show tonight to his memory and everything he's done for us.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But I thought it might be a good time to just share some Nintendo memories and maybe some early Nintendo memories.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So I want to go around the room.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm not playing my 3DS right now, am I?

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Not current Nintendo memories because your 3DS is so close to the mic, they can actually hear your Animal Crossing.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey, that's actually good background music to have the island music.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I suppose it is somewhat appropriate.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But in all seriousness, Dark Sakura, what's your first memory of the Nintendo Entertainment System?

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
When did you become an NES fangirl?

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, I know you were more, you know, you were Sega.

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I wasn't. Dan was Sega.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, okay. Excuse me. Okay.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then when did you, I was going to say, even if you were Team Sega, you still had love for Nintendo.

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know, where did...

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was pretty damn loyal to Nintendo when I was a kid.

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So where did it all come from? Where did it start?

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I went over to my friend's house and played Metroid.

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I would go hang out over at my friend's house and she had, you know, she had Super Mario Brothers and Metroid and Legend of Zelda and for that god awful game Clu Clu Fucking Land.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh my god.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I kind of like that game.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I kind of too, but I hate it too.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's one of those like, it's so niche and it's so stupid, like it's kind of cool.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like if you know how to play Clu Clu Land, that kind of makes you a gaming hipster.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, I would also go over to, now at the time, and I have to give a little background, my friend Catherine, who would just go by Catherine, her mother was a Cathy.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My mother was a Cathy. They were both Cathleens.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I have an Aunt Cathy and a bunch of people, so we would always joke which Cathy am I hanging with.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But anyway, her brother was like super into Metroid.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So we would, you know, Metroid and Metal Gear.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So it was a lot of playing that around over at her house.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then my dad finally got me mine and he got me his favorite game, which was Sky Shark.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So I was playing like shooting games in, you know, 1941 and 1942.

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And my papa, when he was alive, my dad's dad, we would play Jackal on his big screen TV where you could see every damn pixel.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And he'd say, now Maury, because he called me Maury. My middle name is Marie. He didn't like my first name for some reason.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'd say Maury, I want you to throw that grenade over the wall and then I'm going to come around and shoot him.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd be like, okay, Papa. And then playing Abadox, because for some reason he liked Abadox.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Your papa likes some really strange NES games.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I know. But he was totally into the war games and Tecmo Bowl.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And my little sister, for some reason, liked that stupid game Mag Max.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because you could just play it in loops over and over and over again. That game was awful.

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then my mom's friend was getting rid of her games.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And she gave me the golden game that kept my love of Nintendo living longer than the Super Nintendo had been in my life.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And that was Guardian Legend. And I beat the shit out of that game. I couldn't do it now, but I was pretty good at it then.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't really pin it on one thing. It's just lots of good things.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And then having a friend set his on fire. I don't know if you thought I was joking about it before, but I really was serious.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He threw it down a flight of stairs and set it on fire. And it still worked.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's back when they built consoles.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They were built tough!

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's right. There was none of this red ring or yellow light shit.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You throw them down a flight of stairs and set them on fire and they still worked.

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It still worked. Although I don't think it would have worked had he flushed it down the toilet like he wanted to.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That disgusting brown color that most Super Nintendos are these days is a badge of honor.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And it meant your mom was a chain smoker. That's what it meant in my house.

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Loki, what were some early NES memories for you?

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, I got my first NES. My parents surprised me with it with Breakthrough, Zelda, and Bubble Bobble.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So, I played the crap out of that. That and my friend's house.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because everyone had an NES, so I played different games.

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's about it.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What was it about the NES that made you love it so much?

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know. I just liked video games anyways. I had a ColecoVision before that, so...

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I did too!

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, it was just slightly better, you know?

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Better graphics?

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, better graphics, better controller. Because, you know, the ColecoVision was like a numpad with a little joystick on top.

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
At least it wasn't as bad as the Atari 5200 controller, though. That was pretty bad.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What would you say is your favorite NES game ever?

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Um...

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Probably, like, um...

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's see, Legend of Zelda or...

246
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Blaster Master?

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Metroid's good, too.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's one of my favorites, too.

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know. I mean, I know there were some NES games that I had that I played the crap out of, but...

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't really remember which ones they were.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Um...

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Mega Man 2, maybe? Yeah.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
My earliest NES memory was that, um...

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I wanted a Nintendo real bad for kind of the same reason Loki did, is that I liked video games anyway.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We had an Atari 2600.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So, of course, when I saw that there was a Nintendo out there and I got to play it at the store, I really wanted them.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I think I played it at a friend's house, too.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I finally was rewarded with one for getting straight A's in the fourth grade.

259
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I got my Nintendo Entertainment System.

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We went to Sears and bought the NES that came with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And I just played the crap out of that. I played so much Mario Brothers. It was insane.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Gray Gun era.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and the Zapper and all that stuff.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
One of the other early games I got was also The Legend of Zelda, because I didn't get the NES when it first came out.

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But by the time I bought it, The Legend of Zelda was out and I had a ton of friends in school that were playing it.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I remember before I had an NES, I overheard friends talking about it and I was super jealous.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like, I want to play The Legend of Zelda. I want a Nintendo.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You know, kind of that whole jealousy.

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, it was really great when I did get Zelda with the NES, because I played the crap out of that game.

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And it got to the point where people were asking me for advice.

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I think I've told this story on the show before, but I'll kind of quickly recap.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know, for somebody that was picked on a lot as a kid, which, you know, I'm sure a lot of us were,

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but I just remember that was a really awesome turnaround where I went from the guy that's being picked on all the time

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to the guy that will tell you how to get to whatever dungeon in the second quest,

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
so you better be nice to him type of thing.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So, that was always kind of nice.

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, my favorite NES game. See, I would have to kind of jack some of the early answers,

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and I would say probably The Guardian Legend is honestly my favorite NES game of all time as well,

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
just because of the hybrid of it.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Outside of that, honestly, I know it's really cliche, but I kind of think Super Mario Bros. 2 is one of my favorite NES games,

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
just because I just have so many memories of that.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I remember renting that game on New Year's Eve or something,

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and I played the crap out of that game one New Year's, and played it from start to finish.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And, God, I love that game so much.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't see how you could play the crap out of a crap-free game.

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Fair enough.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But, I'm going to throw, you want an obscure title?

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This is one of my other favorite NES games.

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Make me proud.

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because it was such a hybrid game.

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Did you ever play Magic of Scheherazade?

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I did.

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Not very much of it. I rented it, but it was like during exams or something.

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It was like a hybrid of Zelda and Final Fantasy, and it was kind of rad.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Now, because it kind of tried to do too much, it kind of had some flaws,

297
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but when you're like ten years old, you overlook those flaws,

298
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and you're like, this game's awesome. It has everything.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So, there you go.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Some folks in chat, GameGuru in chat says,

301
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
as for favorites, Super Mario Bros. 3, bar none.

302
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That was one of my all-time favorites too, and I think for a lot of us.

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I remember going to one of my best friends back in the day.

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
His name was Devin.

305
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I went to his house, and we stayed up until like four in the morning

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
playing Super Mario Bros. 3,

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and we were doing the whole two-player.

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who doesn't remember playing that with another person,

309
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and you would always fight the other person?

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My sister and I were just complete bitches to each other over that game.

311
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So, there you go.

312
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Some NES memories from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Again, rest in peace,

314
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and thank you for all you've done for this industry, Hiroshi Yamauchi.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank you.

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's move on and get into some of our recent gaming memories,

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
such as the games that you've been playing this week.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have to freaking replant one of my stupid perfect pears

320
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because the fucking trees die.

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You've got real problems, young lady.

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I do have real problems. I have mental problems,

323
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
like Reginald and Nedroid, which is still my favorite webcomic.

324
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Anyway, I've been playing Animal Crossing.

325
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I might open my village during the show.

326
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm still thinking about it.

327
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If enough people show interest, I will open my village.

328
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Damn, that got bit by a mosquito.

329
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So, I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV,

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and I have finally joined the Twin Adders

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
because, first of all, the flaming people suck.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I hate their stupid privilege 1% country,

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and I refuse to be a part of their whole...

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
In the beta, I was with that nation,

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but I changed it when the 14 came out.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You screw the Sultana, okay?

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That little bitch does not get any of my money.

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm gonna give it to the hippies because...

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Occupy. Occupy Ol' Da.

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Just so people kind of understand for Final Fantasy XIV,

341
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a lot of MMOs historically have had factions,

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and a lot of people break it down to good and evil,

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
but it's not always that way.

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
For instance, World of Warcraft has the Alliance and the Horde,

345
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
although the Horde is not necessarily evil or whatever.

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Those are the two factions.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They're just assholes.

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Final Fantasy XIV is a faction-free game.

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Everybody can talk to each other,

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
because usually in WoW, if you play Horde,

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but your friend plays Alliance, you can't talk to each other.

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Unless you're through real ID or whatever.

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But in Final Fantasy, that doesn't stop you.

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But you will join one of three nations throughout the story.

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you don't even have to.

356
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, technically you don't have to.

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And you can switch whenever you want.

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think those allegiances will come into PvP later on,

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but for right now it only has minor impacts on the story.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I hate PvP, so that will never happen.

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Right. Well, there's not even PvP in the game yet.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, I still hate it.

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So, I've been playing that.

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've been playing more fractal,

365
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and I have actually picked up an older game on my phone,

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and I've been playing it stupidly obsessively,

367
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
for some stupid reason, because you know me in puzzle games.

368
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've been playing Bejeweled.

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Not even Bejeweled Blitz, I haven't played that yet.

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I am playing old-school Bejeweled.

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I've been in Diamond Mine mode for like...

372
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It helps me get sleepy at night,

373
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
as I have a lot of trouble sleeping,

374
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
so I play Bejeweled at night.

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And, um...

376
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

377
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I know I played something else,

378
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but for the life of me, I can't remember.

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You'll think of it later and then shout it out randomly

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
in the middle of his ass.

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yes, I will.

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
All right.

383
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Loki, do I even have to ask how many hours

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you sunk into Grand Theft Auto 5 this week?

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't remember how many hours I sunk in,

386
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but I think it's at least 16, at least.

387
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know.

388
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm almost at the end of the campaign,

389
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and it's great.

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I love every second of it, so...

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I even got my son to play a little bit of it.

392
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's been driving...

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Wait! Wait a minute!

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait a minute!

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He likes driving the car.

396
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're letting your three-year-old son

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
play Grand Theft Auto 5?

398
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He's not killing people.

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He's driving back and forth on a beach.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Three-year-olds have no moral compass.

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It does not matter.

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No, I just...

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Loki can do what he wants,

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and I know he's not showing the bad parts of the game.

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He's just driving a car.

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You have to admit,

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the initial sentence of you saying,

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
yeah, I'm letting my son play Grand Theft Auto 5

409
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is kind of funny.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, he doesn't really know how to play.

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All he can really do is just press the gas,

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and I have to kind of steer for him,

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and he just presses the gas,

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and laughs when he hits stuff, like...

415
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like people?

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, like fences.

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know, not people.

418
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And the people are all fine.

419
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They just go to the hospital,

420
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and they come out just fine.

421
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's like when he asks, like he's all...

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And he even asks,

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
he's all, stop hitting that man.

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why'd we take that guy's car?

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So he understands that it's wrong.

426
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm like, it's okay.

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They're just letting us borrow the car.

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's okay.

429
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I just want to point out, Loki,

430
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
these episodes are recorded.

431
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They're put on the internet,

432
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and somebody will save them for a very long time.

433
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Exactly, and I took video.

434
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So it's all good.

435
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to upload video.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So someday, Loki,

437
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
when your son gets busted for street racing,

438
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
all Fast and Furious style in daddy's car,

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm going to say,

440
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
do you know why this happened?

441
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, so I drove my uncle's Trans Am when I was six.

442
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I do have video.

443
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Do I street race?

444
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I have lots of video, actually.

445
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
My brother tried to make me drive his car when I was like 10,

446
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and I cried.

447
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When I was six...

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, he had a Thunderbird.

449
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It was great, though.

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, so I was trying to get some video of him yesterday,

451
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
because he did it yesterday, too.

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He was driving over these hills in the middle of the desert,

453
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and I was like, I'm going camping,

454
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
or we're going to Trader Joe's,

455
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
or I'm driving to Safeway.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Why does the middle of the desert

457
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
make your son think about Trader Joe's?

458
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
No, that was camping.

459
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He's just pretending.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's driving like a truck.

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He's all, I'm driving the truck to Safeway,

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and stuff like that,

463
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because that's where we went today.

464
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, it's completely harmless.

465
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's not like we're running through an elderly,

466
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
old folks home or something like that.

467
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He's not murdering people with a gun.

468
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He's just driving a car or a bus.

469
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He thinks it's funny when you can push the Y button

470
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to get the guy in and out of the car.

471
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He thought that was hilarious.

472
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then he's like, look, it's turning the wheels.

473
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
WhatupG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,

474
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
has Loki let him fly a plane yet?

475
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, God, no, because the reason why is

476
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
he doesn't know how to even drive the car,

477
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
so flying a plane, it would just be over really fast,

478
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and he gets frustrated.

479
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If he hits the wall and he can't figure out how to get around it,

480
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
he just gets frustrated almost immediately.

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He has no patience.

482
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So yeah, a plane, I thought that'd be fun.

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I wanted to give him a boat because it's the ocean.

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He's not going to run into anything out there.

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But he just wanted to drive a car, so let him drive a car.

486
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Well, away from the stories about your son

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
playing the game for a minute and back to you playing the game,

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
what is it about the game that makes it so great

489
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that you come through the door of the OLR Studios and go,

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Rob, when are you getting Grand Theft Auto V?

491
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, first off, you like the sandbox games

492
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
where you can pretty much do whatever you want,

493
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and that's this game, and there's a lot of realism to it,

494
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
or I should say immersion to it.

495
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
For example, if I run over some dude or something in the mountains,

496
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
like some hiker, if I just plow over my car,

497
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
later on I may be driving, and I'll hear a news report on the radio

498
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
saying that a hiker has gone missing.

499
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And then they try to get you back because they know what you did that summer.

500
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And there's all sorts of crazy stuff.

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There's a whole thing that has to do with some hidden letters

502
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that you have to collect, and there's actually a ghost

503
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
up in the mountains and stuff.

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
There's all sorts of crazy acid trips that these guys can go on.

505
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is it really funny, though?

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because I will say, I do like sandbox games,

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but part of the reason why I love Saints Row

508
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is that it's so over-the-top.

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't think I've laughed harder at a video game

510
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
than I did the opening to Saints Row 3.

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well, Saints Row is just kind of like,

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and even playing both,

513
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I think the best analogy I've seen was someone said,

514
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Grand Theft Auto is a parody of reality,

515
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and Saints Row is a parody of Grand Theft Auto,

516
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
where you can tell that they went into incredible detail

517
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
with every single thing in this game

518
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
as far as the immersion with the internet in the game,

519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
all the different brands that are parodies of things,

520
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
whereas Saints Row 4 is making a parody of The Matrix.

521
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I mean, come on, dude. The Matrix.

522
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A 90s movie?

523
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
They're really cutting edge with their stuff. I don't know.

524
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, Saints Row is a fun game,

525
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
but it's just so...

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
When you play both, you're just like,

527
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
man, that's really just basic,

528
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
as far as what they put in there,

529
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and even, like, it feels like the effort

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
was really kind of not there.

531
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, but then again, this game took five years to develop,

532
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and Saints Row III, probably a lot less than that,

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and Saints Row 4, even less than that, so...

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't know.

535
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I just like all the detail in the game,

536
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and the writing's really good.

537
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The story's really interesting.

538
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The characters are very interesting,

539
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
especially Trevor's just nuts,

540
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and just seeing all the things that go kind of awkward

541
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and stuff in the game,

542
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and all the different conflicts that are there,

543
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it's a really interesting storyline,

544
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
so that's kind of what the draw is, I think.

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What's next for Grand Theft Auto with the online component?

546
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We were talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show,

547
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
but just to kind of retouch on it a little bit,

548
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
what do people have to look forward to in a couple weeks

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
when the online part opens up?

550
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, first off, they said, I think there's supposed to be

551
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
about 700 missions in the game,

552
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
so you're gonna be able to pull heists

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and do robberies and all sorts of stuff

554
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
on top of normal death matches and races

555
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and that kind of thing.

556
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Plus, there's gonna be editors in the game

557
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to make your own custom content,

558
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
so you can make custom death match maps,

559
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
you can make custom races,

560
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and that's just the beginning.

561
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They're eventually gonna get it to where you can do

562
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
custom missions and all other game types.

563
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And then, on top of that, they've built the game

564
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
in a way that it's just gonna keep expanding

565
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
beyond Grand Theft Auto 5.

566
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You're not just gonna be stuck in San Andreas,

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
they're gonna have it where you can,

568
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
they can basically increase the size of the map

569
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and add new cities and areas as time goes on.

570
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So, it's just gonna keep building from there,

571
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and it sounds exciting.

572
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Plus, getting to play with people again,

573
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
because, you know, it's hard to find people

574
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
for Grand Theft Auto 4 nowadays.

575
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And you're on both 360 and PlayStation 3?

576
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, and I'm kind of hoping that they both tie together.

577
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you have one of those little squads

578
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I see people advertising on Twitter?

579
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I do have a crew available.

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I will link it in the chatroom.

581
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's the VOG Network crew,

582
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and I'm trying to remember,

583
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the first thing you probably want to do

584
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
is get a membership, if you don't have it already,

585
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to the Rockstar Social Club,

586
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
which you can go to.

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's socialclub.rockstargames.com.

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And so, if you have a membership there,

589
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
you know, cool.

590
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If not, create one.

591
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And then you can look for, I think,

592
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
well, my name on there is Loki O-L-R,

593
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
or I want to say you can search

594
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
by the name of the crew as well,

595
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
which would be VOG Network,

596
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and then our little tag,

597
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
since you have it had the four letters,

598
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
is VOG N, so.

599
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay, awesome.

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah, so I'm actually trying to see real quick here,

601
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
if I can probably link it.

602
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll link it on,

603
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I had it linked on Twitter at one time,

604
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
but I'll link it again,

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
so we can add everybody before it launches.

606
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I'm sure if it's anything like it has been

607
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
with the Social Club stuff so far,

608
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it may be a little downsy by the time it launches,

609
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
because they've been having little server issues,

610
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
as with anything.

611
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Uh-oh, all right.

612
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Any other games besides Grand Theft Auto

613
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you want to talk about?

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Nope.

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
All right, then my gaming week,

616
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
pretty similar to Loki,

617
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I've been focused on mainly one game,

618
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and that game is Final Fantasy XIV,

619
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
which I've talked about ad nauseam in previous weeks,

620
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so I won't really get into too much detail.

621
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I will just say I'm a level 45 white mage,

622
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
so I'm getting a little closer to end game

623
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and all the AK runs and Efreet hard mode and all that.

624
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I do love how they wound the story into this game, though,

625
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I will say that much.

626
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You know, the story really kind of keeps you going,

627
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and it's really interesting the way they did that,

628
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
where not a lot of MMOs have been able to kind of

629
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
make those big grandiose cut scenes

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the way Final Fantasy does

631
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that makes you really want to watch, you know,

632
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
when I was playing World of Warcraft,

633
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I skipped most things,

634
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
unless it was a big cinematic,

635
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'd watch those or something else, you know,

636
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but the Final Fantasy cut scenes are so engaging,

637
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it really kind of keeps me like, oh.

638
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
For the record, the same thing works again.

639
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, with the screenshots?

640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, so you can do screenshots during cinematics.

641
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh, cool.

642
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And is it just me or is Thancred like sort of like

643
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
make you think of Tidus?

644
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
A little bit.

645
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Don't they have similar voice actors?

646
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No, he has the voice actor of both here, doesn't he?

647
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think.

648
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But it was sort of interesting hearing Fenris' voice

649
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
coming out of the Elvin guy.

650
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So I haven't heard a lot of the voice acting

652
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
because I'm on Skype a lot when I play the game with friends.

653
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So we're just chatting through it.

654
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So, yeah, I'll have to do some more live stream of it later.

655
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's just my frame rate really suffers

656
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
unless I can like get on the PlayStation 3

657
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and get one of those boxes that streams or something.

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Anyhow, I will say outside of Final Fantasy XIV,

659
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I sort of discovered a renaissance this week for pinball games.

660
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I think a lot of that is because PlayStation Plus right now

661
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is giving away Star Wars pinball with the Plus.

662
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So I downloaded that and I was checking out those tables.

663
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I really like the Episode 5 table in particular.

664
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't really care for the Boba Fett table.

665
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The clones table is pretty good too.

666
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So I was enjoying playing those tables.

667
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And then it made me realize like why did I never get Zen Pinball 2 on PlayStation?

668
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then I realized that was free too.

669
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I had tables from one that imported.

670
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So it's like I already had like all these tables to play in Zen Pinball 2.

671
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So I checked that out and it came with the Vita version.

672
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
All of it did because, you know, they have that whole cross thing.

673
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I actually had a reason to play my Vita.

674
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I was playing Zen Pinball on the Vita.

675
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I got to say love, love, love that you can rotate the Vita

676
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
so that it's a vertical screen.

677
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And so you have the vertical play field like you expect a pinball game to be, right?

678
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's nothing new.

679
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And you use the touch screen. I know it's not new.

680
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The WonderSwan did that.

681
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I know it's not new, but okay, how long ago was the WonderSwan

682
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and do we ever have it in America?

683
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The PSP did that.

684
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You know I'm giving you crap.

685
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But the PSP wasn't giving me these games free either.

686
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And the PSP did not have the touch screen on the front.

687
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So the cool thing about the Vita is you just tap the touch screen.

688
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Left side is left flipper, right side is right flipper.

689
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And then you kind of drag down to do the bumper.

690
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It makes a lot of sense.

691
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So it's a nice little time waster in that regard.

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So yeah, if you have PlayStation Plus and you have a Vita

693
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and you like pinball, I don't know why you're not getting this game.

694
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You should really think about doing that

695
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
because it's a great little time waster on the Vita.

696
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I did find the link for the crew thing.

697
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It is just VOG Network.

698
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.

699
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And that's how you get to it.

700
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We already have nine people.

701
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And once we get more people,

702
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll start divvying up where people are

703
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
because you can actually have a hierarchy of players and stuff.

704
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, I will briefly mention

705
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
where a lot of the VOG people are playing Final Fantasy XIV

706
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
since I know you've got your game and I've got mine.

707
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We are on the Midgarcimer server,

708
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and our free company is called End of Line.

709
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We have 45 characters in our thing right now.

710
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
To be fair, a lot of it is like friends of friends.

711
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's not just exclusively people that listen to VOG stuff.

712
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But it's a good group of people.

713
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And yeah, you can check that out.

714
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
All the information is at vognetwork.com

715
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
in the Hoard House forums

716
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
because technically Hoard House is my show about online games.

717
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So everything you need to know is in the Hoard House forums

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
at vognetwork.com.

719
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And you should probably post the Grand Theft Auto stuff

720
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to the OLR forum.

721
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah, I was going to at some point. I need to create a logo.

722
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh, okay.

723
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Well, you know you have a graphic designer right here.

724
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, no, they have a little app thing in there.

725
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So I have to create a logo.

726
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I just haven't done it yet.

727
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

728
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, I think that's enough of our gaming week.

729
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Housekeeping, I'll just quickly say, don't forget,

730
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
we're on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

731
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And we are on Facebook.

732
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

733
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Alright, enough talk. We've done a lot of reminiscing about old gaming

734
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and new gaming. Let's get into gaming news

735
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and what is going on in the industry this week.

736
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Loki.

737
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Val's going to announce something tomorrow.

738
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's probably going to have something to do with the Steam Box

739
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
since they were talking or

740
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Gabe was teasing something about

741
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
a Linux. Well,

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the Steam Box actually last week, so

743
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think that's what it is.

744
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And it's going to

745
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
be announced 10 a.m.

746
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Pacific time tomorrow.

747
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Which is sad because

748
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
by the time most people hear this

749
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
because obviously we have our live audience

750
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
but the podcast people will already

751
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
know what this news is.

752
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
At least the first of the three announcements.

753
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's three announcements.

754
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
There's Circle. Circle in brackets.

755
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And Circle plus Circle.

756
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Obviously, we are having

757
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
a lot of fun with this on Bobby's show tonight.

758
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
A lot of folks going

759
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
three things. Half-Life

760
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
3. Have you ever noticed

761
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
like, I don't know, I'm sure someone's noticed this before

762
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
but like the Half-Life logo and stuff

763
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
looks like a stick figure arm holding a crowbar.

764
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I never

765
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
really thought of that.

766
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's kind of funny. It actually does look like

767
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
a stick figure holding up a crowbar. So speculation

768
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
just rampant wank speculation on what these

769
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
announcements could be. I think

770
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
more information on the Steam Box is a given.

771
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And I'm going to repeat

772
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
some of the things I said on the call on Bobby's show

773
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
because it's my guess and that hasn't changed

774
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
in 15 minutes or however long it's been.

775
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I think Half-Life

776
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
3 is not the announcement. I think

777
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Left 4 Dead 3 is going to be the announcement.

778
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I think that's, you know, they will be

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
hyping up towards a third game in

780
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
a series but it's going to be Left 4 Dead 3. Which is not

781
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
bad news. You know, it's been

782
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
a few years since Left 4 Dead 2. I can see them doing

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
you know, Steam Box

784
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Left 4 Dead 3 troll

785
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
announcement and then, you know,

786
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Half-Life 3. No, I kind of think

787
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the other announcement, you know, Dota 2

788
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
is so huge for Valve right

789
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
now, especially internationally.

790
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I kind of think one of the big 3 announcements

791
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
has to be about Dota and

792
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I would think maybe if they

793
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
announce the Steam Box, maybe there's some way that

794
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Dota interface, like I think they're going to try

795
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to get Dota 2 in your living room.

796
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So maybe like, controller

797
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
support for Dota or something along those lines.

798
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's cool but at the same

799
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
time, the announcement

800
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
of Half-Life 3 could really throw a

801
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
monkey wrench into like next gen, you

802
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
know, consoles and stuff like that

803
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and the people's needs for that

804
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
stuff. I'm interested in Steam Box, I mean

805
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
depending on what the specs are and what

806
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
it's able to run, I mean, because I do have my

807
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
laptop so I don't

808
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
necessarily need another gaming PC

809
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
although my first gaming

810
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
PC has kind of fallen

811
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
apart, so maybe I do need

812
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
a new gaming PC.

813
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Rob Roberts, what if

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Portal 3 is the announcement? You know,

815
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I just,

816
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
because Valve is so allergic to the

817
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
number 3, I don't want to say I'd be

818
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
disappointed if Portal 3 is the announcement, quite

819
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
no, but I would be kind of

820
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
surprised that that's the game they're

821
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
so quick to go back and visit again.

822
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I just would be a little bit surprised. What if it's Left

823
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
for Dead 3, Portal 3, and

824
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Half-Life 3? I think

825
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
a lot of the internet would probably poop their

826
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
pants, and rightfully so. I think

827
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that would be a lot of great news. Three things about

828
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
three,

829
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
you know, there's also the possibility, though,

830
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that Valve is doing something we haven't

831
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
heard of yet, a completely new IP

832
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and I think that would be okay too.

833
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So, yeah, Circle, or

834
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Bracket Circle, and Bracket

835
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Circle, and Bracket plus Bracket, or

836
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Circle plus Circle.

837
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Well, Circle plus Circle, that

838
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
sounds like Portal to me. Gosh, you're talking

839
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
about Hollywood squares all of a sudden, Circle

840
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
gets the square. Alright,

841
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
um, alright.

842
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Portal 3, I

843
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
just, it would have to be a different

844
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
test subject.

845
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So now my brain is thinking around all of that.

846
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, you know, I will say this,

847
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
speaking of Dota, which I brought up

848
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
a minute ago, there's a video circulating

849
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
where they're gonna have a, or it might be out now,

850
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the GLaDOS Announcer Pack for Dota 2,

851
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and it's hilarious.

852
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I know I linked it on my Twitter earlier this week.

853
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's Oda, the DS Silent.

854
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They had

855
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
some hilarious, well god, what

856
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
was one of the lines, I should try to find it on my

857
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Twitter real quick, because one of the whole, like,

858
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
welcome to Dota things was so

859
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
funny. Um,

860
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
oh gosh, I'm gonna try and find this real quick.

861
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Anything else you wanted to say about Portal 3,

862
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Dark Soccer, while I try to dig this up?

863
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Um, no, other than, it was pretty

864
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
cool hearing her in Pacific Rim.

865
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Oh yeah?

866
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, they actually did the

867
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
modulation effect without the flanging,

868
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
so it was sort of interesting.

869
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay, I found it, I found what I was looking for.

870
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Zanes, welcome to Dota.

871
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't forget your little plastic

872
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
sword, and all your chins.

873
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Little bit of shade from GLaDOS there.

874
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I love that, play it again.

875
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Play it again? Alright.

876
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I love her, she's such a sassy bitch.

877
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't forget your plastic sword and all your chins.

878
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Here we go, one more time.

879
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Zanes, welcome to Dota.

880
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Don't forget your little plastic sword,

881
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and all your chins.

882
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
This video is like 21 minutes of GLaDOS now,

883
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
so there's more.

884
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And your giant flagon of gravy, welcome to

885
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Medieval Times.

886
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
How many in your party tonight?

887
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I love it.

888
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That would make me play the game.

889
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Doesn't that make you want to play Dota 2?

890
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Just for that sassy bitch.

891
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
By the way, I have to sort of

892
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
derail a little bit. Did you see the person

893
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
cosplaying GLaDOS?

894
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There was

895
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
video and pictures up of this girl.

896
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
A lot of people cosplay GLaDOS, but yes.

897
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No, no, not doing the

898
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
whole anthropomorphic version.

899
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Hanging from a harness.

900
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
With a mask

901
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and everything.

902
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And moving around and everything

903
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and doing the voice and all that.

904
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That was cool.

905
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Some folks in chat

906
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
are, as far as the 3s go,

907
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I see GameGuru says

908
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Team Fortress 3

909
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
could be a possibility.

910
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But Act F follows that up saying,

911
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't see Valve making a Team Fortress 3 anytime soon.

912
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It does seem like they are still adding

913
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
every day to Team Fortress 2.

914
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It would seem a little

915
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
soon for a 3.

916
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
More hats. More tie-ins to other

917
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
products, more like.

918
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Alright, well moving on to another company.

919
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I want to talk a little bit about what Microsoft

920
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
talked about this week. They were

921
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
at Tokyo Game Show, believe it or not, showing off

922
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
some things going on there. One of the

923
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
things that was talked about though, that unfortunately

924
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
yet another perceived negative

925
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
for Microsoft's system

926
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
was in a quote from Albert

927
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Pinello, who's the Senior Director of Product

928
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Management. Quote, We don't support

929
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
vertical orientation. Do it

930
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
at your own risk. It wouldn't be

931
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
a cooling problem. We just didn't design the

932
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
drive for vertical. Because it's a slot

933
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
loading drive, we just didn't design it

934
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
for both. I don't think this is a big

935
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
deal whatsoever. I only

936
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
bring it up because I saw it all over

937
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Twitter and Facebook and

938
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so people are talking about this, but I

939
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm going to be honest,

940
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I kind of think if you're out there

941
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
going, oh my god, Microsoft

942
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
fucks up again, you can't have your thing vertical,

943
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I kind of think you're looking for

944
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
a reason to dump on Microsoft at this point.

945
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't think it's that big a deal.

946
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's not going to throw off the feng shui

947
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
of your living room cabinet or something.

948
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, it's the size of a cable box anyways.

949
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Stack your cable box. But I'm just saying

950
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and who cares, so it doesn't

951
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
doesn't

952
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
stand up or whatever.

953
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The whole thing is because idiots before

954
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
kept knocking it over and they had a whole issue

955
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
with that. Blaming it on the slot

956
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
loading disk drive is kind of dumb.

957
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I would just say it's because you guys are fucking idiots

958
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and you keep knocking that shit over. I mean, look at

959
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the 360. You guys

960
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
doesn't the Wii have a slot drive

961
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and most people put that vertically? The Wii has a slot

962
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
drive. The PlayStation 4 has a slot drive.

963
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But the Wii also has that little

964
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
cradle so it's a little harder to knock it over.

965
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, but you know,

966
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
plastic is expensive. I know. And I think

967
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that thing probably weighs a metric ton

968
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
so, you know. But I just, I don't

969
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't know. I mean, there are some people that are

970
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
legitimately like, I like to have my consoles

971
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
vertical, blah blah blah. The Xbox One is

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
about the size of an original Xbox

973
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Duke controller so

974
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
it's, I can see why.

975
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But yeah, I mean, come on. It looks

976
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
like it'd be very unstable standing up

977
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
sideways. If you want to stand

978
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
it up sideways, um, you know

979
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
assuming that it still would work

980
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
that way, um, I'm

981
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
sure that there would be a third party solution to

982
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
like, brace that thing up so that it

983
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
doesn't fall over. But, I mean, come

984
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
on. It's just, they just don't want you to

985
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
knock it off your shelf. Remember

986
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
cats are evil. They will knock that shit over.

987
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Especially if you're not- No, they'll throw up on your rug.

988
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Well, both. They will do both.

989
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They will knock it over, then they'll throw up on it and on

990
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
your rug. Well, another interesting

991
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
quote from Mr. Pinello, uh, quote,

992
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
we found, interestingly enough, that 80%

993
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
of people, believe it or not, have their

994
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Xbox 360 horizontally.

995
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I will have you know that I'm not part of

996
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
the 80%. I have vertical

997
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
all the way. Unless it's near my cat, in which

998
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
case it's horizontal.

999
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I have my 360 horizontal.

1000
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Most of my consoles go horizontal.

1001
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The only one that didn't was the Wii.

1002
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And that's because I sort of got

1003
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the perception that that was designed to go vertical.

1004
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But Wii U doesn't go vertical, if I

1005
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
remember right. Right? It's like rounded

1006
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
on the edges. You can't stand that thing.

1007
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes you can. Well,

1008
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
with putty. You really shouldn't stand

1009
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
it up. You can make a stand.

1010
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Alright, now you're making a good challenge.

1011
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well, I'm sure it's like they're saying here

1012
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
about the Xbox One. Do it at your own

1013
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
risk. Throw your

1014
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Wii U down a flight of stairs and set it on

1015
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
fire for all we care. You know what, mine's actually

1016
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
horizontal.

1017
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Just because of how our- you've seen the shelves in

1018
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
my house. That's how they're- and then the

1019
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
cat sits on it.

1020
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Alright.

1021
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Ziba in chat says

1022
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
mine is vertical too, so

1023
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
let's see. Tigerclaw says

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I remember when the PlayStation 1 had

1025
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
trouble reading discs and the only fix

1026
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
putting it upside down.

1027
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's right, I remember that too. Oh yes. And then

1028
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
no, no, no, no. There was the other fix.

1029
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Sideways. Mhm. When you

1030
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
did have to hold that thing

1031
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
vertically.

1032
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I remember people would use

1033
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
paper clips or something to hold the

1034
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
door open, basically.

1035
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That was for the swap trick. Oh, my bad.

1036
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah. Back

1037
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in the day. Spring.

1038
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Spring.

1039
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh, no, no, no. We did it old school.

1040
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We had the paperclip. We figured

1041
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
out the right way to bend the paperclip so that

1042
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
we could just go fump. I remember when you

1043
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
got me that little cartridge that plugged into

1044
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the back of the PlayStation 1. Yes, we ordered like, what, 50 of them?

1045
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Not 50, but we ordered a bunch of them.

1046
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Those things were awesome, and I never had

1047
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
a problem playing import games after that. Yeah.

1048
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Those things were awesome. Anyhow, moving on.

1049
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh, yeah. It's my turn, isn't it?

1050
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Mhm. You know what? Put down the

1051
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Animal Crossing and get to the story. I'm busy

1052
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
chatting with people. You're busy trying to

1053
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
navigate the new iOS 7 over there, I see.

1054
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
God, actually, yeah.

1055
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, um,

1056
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
this is slightly old news. It came out

1057
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
toward the beginning of the week, but

1058
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Blizzard is going to be closing down

1059
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Diablo 3's Auction House, and that's going to

1060
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
happen on March 18th next year.

1061
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Um, their

1062
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
actual statement saying

1063
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that, and I'm quoting, it became increasingly

1064
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
clear that despite the benefits of the

1065
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Auction House system, and the fact that

1066
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
many players around the world use it, it

1067
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay

1068
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
kill monsters and get cool loot.

1069
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've

1070
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
decided to remove the gold and real money

1071
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Auction House system from Diablo 3.

1072
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Bravo.

1073
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So that means

1074
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
it's, does that still need to be connected

1075
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
online? Because, you know, people are

1076
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
jumping to that conclusion that that

1077
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
will be the next thing that happens, but we

1078
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
don't know for sure, but that was the

1079
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
crutch that they were, that was

1080
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
why it had to be online, was to preserve

1081
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
the integrity of the Auction House. So

1082
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
now we just don't know.

1083
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But it would be logical

1084
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that in a later patch, they're going

1085
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
to say, you know, we're going to patch

1086
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
out the always online requirement.

1087
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That would be great. Then I'd play it again.

1088
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I wonder if that wouldn't be a quiet thing, or maybe

1089
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
they'll do it under LAN play. I think

1090
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that would be huge if they were to do a patch

1091
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
that not only removes the Auction House, but

1092
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
then does LAN play without battle net.

1093
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I mean, that would be huge. But,

1094
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't know. Could they, like, add

1095
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
because remember, you know, before, like, with

1096
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Starcraft 2 and stuff, well, Starcraft

1097
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
2 I don't think had LAN play anyways, but

1098
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
couldn't they do, like, some sort of

1099
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
competitive thing then with

1100
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Diablo 3? Well, they were talking

1101
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
about doing PvP, and there technically

1102
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
is, like, an arena, but it's really

1103
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
bare bones. It's not a

1104
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
fancy PvP system like what you'd see in Warcraft

1105
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
or anything. Well, they're also saying something

1106
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
else, too. I'm going to read this quote.

1107
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
We feel that this move, along with the Loot 2.0

1108
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
system being developed concurrently with

1109
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Reaper of Souls, will result

1110
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
in much more rewarding game experience

1111
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
for our players. So,

1112
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I think that

1113
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
they're looking to change quite a few things

1114
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
about the way it plays. There's definitely kind of

1115
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
a soft reboot of the game happening here.

1116
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It might be enough to make me play it again.

1117
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Well, a lot of folks were really

1118
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
excited about the console versions because

1119
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
well, in fact, some of the reviews of the

1120
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
console versions, the PS3 and 360, say

1121
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
it is the definitive version of Diablo 3.

1122
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Weren't you saying you wanted to get it? Well, yeah.

1123
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week because

1124
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
it was only a demo, but I did play the Diablo 3

1125
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
demo on PlayStation, which is out there

1126
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you can download. It's

1127
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
weird for me because I

1128
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
did play Diablo 3 the whole way

1129
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
through. I beat it. I played enough of it.

1130
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's really weird to go from

1131
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Clicky Fest to

1132
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
aiming because you don't

1133
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
have a mouse. So, you aim

1134
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and it locks on to monsters.

1135
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's just a different way of playing the

1136
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
same game. It's really weird.

1137
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But I liked it, but it is just really

1138
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
different. And the inventory system is completely different

1139
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
too. I mean, they really had to change

1140
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
everything to support the controller. Now,

1141
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
what if they had a controller

1142
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
version for the PC?

1143
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Like, would

1144
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
you still keep playing on PC if you could

1145
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
do it with a controller?

1146
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No, at this point I prefer

1147
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
the mouse because that's just the way I played

1148
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
the game and I think it is a different balance

1149
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
between controller and mouse. I don't

1150
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
see them mixing those. I don't think

1151
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
they're going to mix the console version

1152
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
with the PC version. But

1153
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I am interested enough in the console

1154
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
version. My problem is that $60 price

1155
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
tag when I already have the game

1156
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
on PC no matter if I got it for

1157
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
free or what have you.

1158
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You're not quite the target

1159
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
audience.

1160
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Audience. I'm not. Since you already

1161
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
own the PC version. You're right. I'm not the target

1162
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
audience. But I will say this. I'm

1163
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
very interested in PlayStation 4

1164
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
version. Hopefully the

1165
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
inevitable price cut

1166
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
three months after it's out version. So, how does it look

1167
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
visually compared to the PC version considering

1168
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that they're going to have a PlayStation 4 version? I

1169
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
can't imagine that you'd be able to improve

1170
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
The resolution is not quite as

1171
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
crisp to me as it is on

1172
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
PC. I even see that

1173
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit.

1174
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And I think a lot of that just depends on what video

1175
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
card you're packing. I saw it a lot in Final Fantasy

1176
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
14 looking at the videos.

1177
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Because I found

1178
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
some high res play through

1179
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
videos from the PS3.

1180
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And compared with my

1181
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but I have my maxed all the way.

1182
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And it looks amazing.

1183
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So, I mean it doesn't look bad by any means.

1184
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You have to get really nitpicky. But I would

1185
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
see where they could probably make some graphical

1186
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
improvements on PlayStation 4.

1187
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So.

1188
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So I'll be checking that out

1189
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
later. But I'm happy to hear about the removal

1190
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
of the auction house. Just that you know I don't

1191
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't think that many people were using it

1192
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to be honest. No. I'm totally

1193
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
with that. Yeah.

1194
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Alright. Let's move on. Loki.

1195
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Alright. So let's talk

1196
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
a little bit about

1197
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Blizzard again. And this

1198
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
kind of ties in with

1199
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I think we were talking about it a few weeks ago.

1200
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Where they were

1201
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Vampity was trying to kind of

1202
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
separate themselves from

1203
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Activision Blizzard and kind of

1204
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
drum up some money I guess

1205
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
by selling their shares and that kind of stuff.

1206
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
However

1207
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
that's been kind of halted because

1208
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
there's a lawsuit

1209
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
taking place in Delaware.

1210
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Apparently I guess

1211
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
one of the

1212
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
some of the shareholders didn't like the idea.

1213
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I think they said basically the shareholder

1214
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
has sued the company to prevent

1215
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
this from happening claiming that

1216
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
it's a huge waste and meant to

1217
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
cover a power grab.

1218
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And so because of that

1219
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the court actually

1220
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
halted it right now and

1221
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
basically in order for it to continue they have to

1222
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
appeal and get a majority

1223
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
vote from the non-Vivendi

1224
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
stockholders.

1225
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So

1226
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
interesting that that kind of happened.

1227
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Now I'm not really sure as far as

1228
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
like a power

1229
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
power grab

1230
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
thing is supposed to be. I don't understand their

1231
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
angle there with that.

1232
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm not sure I see it either and I kind of don't think this is going to go much

1233
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
of anywhere.

1234
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It is interesting to bring this up immediately

1235
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
after that previous story because some are

1236
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
speculating tinfoil hat

1237
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
that the removal of the

1238
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Diablo 3 auction house is directly tied to the fact

1239
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
they're not with Vivendi anymore.

1240
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That now that they're a little more

1241
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
independent per se that they dropped

1242
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it even though they are still part of Activision

1243
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
but maybe Vivendi was the real

1244
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
problem. Yeah see that's what

1245
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I thought with like the kind of go

1246
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
completely different game different company

1247
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
with Deep Silver

1248
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
or I should say THQ and Saints Row

1249
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
that's why I thought with all the DLC

1250
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
hoaring that oh it was THQ making

1251
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the Volition do that kind of shit.

1252
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And then Saints Row 4 came

1253
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
out and they hoard the DLC just as much

1254
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
so I

1255
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
was proven wrong there so who knows.

1256
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Although you have to admit

1257
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
that free

1258
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
GAT 5 DLC

1259
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
on Tuesday was brilliant.

1260
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's not brilliant. It seriously

1261
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
is not. No

1262
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I understand the joke. I understand the joke.

1263
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah haha it's funny you know

1264
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Gap 5

1265
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and we're going to confuse people with the hashtag

1266
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and oh it's going to be hilarious and stuff

1267
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and then the game sells 800 million

1268
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
dollars worth and then they

1269
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
kind of quiet and go into a corner

1270
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
because you know

1271
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
it's just

1272
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
cool. Yeah it's

1273
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
fun to poke fun at Grand Theft Auto

1274
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
because your game

1275
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
started off as kind of a clone of it and

1276
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
the problem is

1277
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
they have these little DLC packs and yeah I

1278
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
understand it's free for a day and I did download it because

1279
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
it's free. I'm not going to pass up some of them for free.

1280
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's just

1281
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
$2.99 here

1282
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
$2.99 there $2.99 there for all

1283
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
stuff that's already in the game

1284
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and just being unlocked.

1285
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Come on I mean and

1286
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm really waiting to see what the first DLC pack

1287
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
was because if it's anything as far as

1288
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
like sparse in content

1289
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
like it was with the third

1290
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm just I may be done with the series

1291
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
just because I don't like that

1292
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
kind of practice where it's just

1293
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
we're just not we're going to totally

1294
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
just drop the ball and not give a shit and

1295
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
push stuff out really fast and try to make a quick buck

1296
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
because it shows.

1297
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Alright well

1298
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
moving on let's go to another story

1299
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
you know Grand Theft Auto 5

1300
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and Saints Row 4 will not be

1301
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
on this console but maybe later we'll

1302
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
see and the PlayStation 4

1303
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
of course is out in a couple weeks

1304
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and some live streamers you know

1305
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
the people that do Twitch TV as we've

1306
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
all done in the past and what have you

1307
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
were a little bit

1308
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
concerned that the PlayStation 4

1309
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
may not really allow you to live

1310
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
stream the way you want to

1311
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
now I'm not talking about the built in

1312
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
live streaming but remember we heard that

1313
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
prior that some

1314
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
companies may actually be able to

1315
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
not have you live stream certain parts

1316
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
of the game or whatever we don't know

1317
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
how that functionality is going to be limited

1318
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
so some people want to handle it their way

1319
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and actually have the PlayStation

1320
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
4 through HDMI their capture box

1321
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
but there was a concern that would not

1322
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
work because on the PlayStation

1323
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
3 you can't do that right

1324
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
now you can't capture through HDMI

1325
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
unless you you know do some nefarious

1326
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
you know it's component

1327
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
to HDMI yeah a lot of folks do

1328
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
component cables instead and capture that way

1329
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and stream that way yeah because that's what I have

1330
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
to do with my Elgato you have to

1331
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
they have a special adapter

1332
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
that you plug in well live streamers

1333
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
around the world I'm sure happy to hear this week

1334
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Brad Douglas who's the head of third party

1335
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
relations at Sony said

1336
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
the PlayStation 4 will support

1337
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
video capture via HDMI

1338
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
now my

1339
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
question is I

1340
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
always thought it was the Blu-rays

1341
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
fault that a lot of this was blocked

1342
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
on the PlayStation 3 so

1343
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
have they figured out a way on the PlayStation 4

1344
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
to enable the encoding when

1345
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
it's in Blu-ray mode because I would think

1346
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
that's a given I would think that even though this news

1347
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
is out there they've got to

1348
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
not allow you to put the Blu-rays up it's too easy

1349
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
they probably found a way to

1350
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
turn on and off the HD

1351
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
encryption thing

1352
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
so my real question building on that

1353
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and yes I'm being tinfoil hat again

1354
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
but if they can turn it on and off

1355
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
it will what's to say this is going to be

1356
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
any different from the built in twitch streaming

1357
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
at the end of the day

1358
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
what do you mean

1359
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
that

1360
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
you know if they can turn it off and on won't they

1361
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
be able to turn it off you know when they

1362
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
want like let's say a developer doesn't want the ending of

1363
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
the game broadcast can't they shut it off

1364
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
maybe

1365
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I guess it's possible

1366
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
so also important

1367
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to put out there one of the big reasons why

1368
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
people want to do their own HDMI grabs

1369
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
it's for I guess I shouldn't really say

1370
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
it's more the twitch TV people but a lot

1371
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of the YouTube people who want to record

1372
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
a gigantic amount of footage

1373
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and then edit through it later on

1374
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
that's the real asset

1375
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
there to being able to do the HDMI

1376
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
just to be clear it's both

1377
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
a win for live streamers and

1378
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
live to tape

1379
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
streamers

1380
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
did you see the stupid announcement

1381
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
that they did earlier this week it was

1382
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
about like

1383
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
yeah you'll be able to hook up your PlayStation 4

1384
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
to your Xbox One's

1385
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HDMI in I'm like dude you can hook anything

1386
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
up to it cause it has HDMI in

1387
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
if it has HDMI out you're gonna hook it up

1388
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
it's not gonna go oh no no no

1389
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
sorry that's a PlayStation 4 we gonna play nice

1390
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
with them I mean they're not gonna

1391
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
do that it's a fucking HDMI in

1392
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
that's like saying hey I just learned that

1393
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I can plug my PlayStation 4 into the wall

1394
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
yes actually if you

1395
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
put a PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One

1396
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Nedry will come up on the screen and go

1397
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
ah ah ah you didn't say

1398
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
the magic word ah ah ah

1399
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
that reference straight out

1400
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
of 1994 y'all look it

1401
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
up hey to be fair they did a

1402
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
3D re-release not too long ago so

1403
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
it is somewhat rare okay okay fair

1404
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
enough and there's gonna be a fourth movie

1405
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
as long as we don't have any fucking

1406
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
gymnastic people in that I mean

1407
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
it's gonna be all good

1408
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I wanna see them go a little ridiculous with that

1409
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I want like you know raptors in trench coats

1410
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and stuff and they're like oh clever girl

1411
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
obviously we're talking about Jurassic Park

1412
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
so obviously we blew the cover on that I gotta say

1413
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
though Jurassic Park 4

1414
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I wanted to either be like really good like the first

1415
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
one was which is I enjoyed the first movie say what

1416
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you will but at the time you know when I was in high

1417
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
school and that came out that movie was awesome right

1418
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
or I wanted to be like over the top

1419
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
show girls bad

1420
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
but you know what

1421
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
3 was pretty bad you know what though

1422
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm thinking with the technology today

1423
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
we can have it both and you know why

1424
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that's because you have Jurassic Park 4

1425
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
and say that'll be a great movie or something

1426
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
let's just hope that is a great movie and then you have

1427
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Asylum putting out like

1428
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Cretaceous

1429
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Part 5 or something like that

1430
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
that'll be fucking terrible

1431
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
okay good point good point

1432
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
or the sci-fi movie you know

1433
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Dinosaur Hurricane you know

1434
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't know

1435
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
actdeft in chat piggybacking on this

1436
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
whole not the Jurassic Park part but the whole like

1437
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Sony Playstation 4 on an Xbox

1438
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
one actdeft in chat says what's

1439
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
next Sony making computers with

1440
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Windows in them oh my

1441
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
gosh oh my

1442
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
gosh or Sony developing

1443
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
apps for Microsoft Windows

1444
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
no shame

1445
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
alright let's move

1446
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
on Dark Soccer you got a story and then release

1447
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
states I might

1448
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
so um

1449
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I hate mobile sites so much

1450
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm telling you Chrome

1451
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you can do the desktop sites on Chrome

1452
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
yeah but I'm opening the links out of email

1453
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
well

1454
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that's your problem

1455
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
well it's going to be everyone's problem because the stupid thing doesn't want to load

1456
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
can't you change your default browser

1457
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
oh wait I'm sorry it's iOS

1458
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
actually I think

1459
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
you can in the new one can't you

1460
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I could be wrong I don't know

1461
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
there we go

1462
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
have you played with iOS 7 Loki?

1463
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
fuck no I haven't updated my

1464
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
iPod is seriously like I don't even

1465
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
know if iOS 7 supports my iPod

1466
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I have an iPod touch 4 and I think

1467
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
they said ah fuck you

1468
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
ah fuck you

1469
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
sorry Jimmy I was trying to buy you time

1470
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
thank you well we did tease

1471
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
this at the start of the show

1472
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
and um we've talked about

1473
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
before about the state of Atlas that they

1474
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
filed for bankruptcy

1475
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
their debt was

1476
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
2.45 billion yen

1477
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
which is quite a bit of money

1478
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and so um

1479
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
the company that's come out

1480
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
on top for the purchase

1481
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
is Sega Sammy

1482
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
or I just like to say

1483
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Sega because we all know who's

1484
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
wearing the pants in that relationship

1485
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
or as we all like to say growing up Sega

1486
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Sega pretty good

1487
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
that they bought somebody because they don't have

1488
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
anything fucking coming out

1489
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
nothing Sega needs to buy their building

1490
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
back in San Francisco like

1491
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
they're the one company that sends me updates

1492
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
to their release calendar like

1493
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
every week on the ball you know

1494
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
on Friday every week

1495
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and there's always no changes have

1496
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
been made no changes have been made

1497
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
nothing is coming out

1498
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
well at any rate it came

1499
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
out on Nikkei that

1500
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
they are going to be acquiring

1501
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
the whole thing for a 14

1502
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
for 14 billion

1503
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
yen which is

1504
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
roughly 141 million dollars

1505
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
to purchase the

1506
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
company

1507
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
so this

1508
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
probably means that

1509
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
we might see

1510
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
them continuing with the

1511
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Shin Megami Tensei games

1512
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
that's a given

1513
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
but I can't wait for the crossovers

1514
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
with other Sega games

1515
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you know when there's the inevitable Sega

1516
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
racing

1517
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
with Danica Patrick and the cast of Persona 5

1518
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
that would be so weird

1519
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
so

1520
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Technus in chat says

1521
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Sega Atlas

1522
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and 5th Dream says Atlas Sega

1523
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
but anyway the company itself hasn't made

1524
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
the announcement on it yet

1525
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
but it is public on Nikkei

1526
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
so take it for what you will

1527
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
some folks

1528
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
disappointed

1529
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I don't know how to really use that word

1530
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
in this context but some folks

1531
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
were disappointed slash surprised

1532
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
slash I don't know that it wasn't Nintendo

1533
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
who bought Atlas

1534
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
thinking that Nintendo might want to grab

1535
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Persona as an exclusive for the Wii U

1536
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and DS and so forth

1537
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
would have been a pretty big

1538
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
thing so any thoughts on

1539
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that why maybe Nintendo didn't decide

1540
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
to do it? I think Nintendo's got

1541
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
their own thing going on

1542
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
you know I think they're looking

1543
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
if they're going to purchase a company

1544
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
my thought is that they would purchase one that has

1545
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
a little bit more that would

1546
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
work with them and given

1547
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
that Nintendo's already been working with Sega

1548
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
it doesn't

1549
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
mean that we're going to see any fewer

1550
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Atlas games come out on

1551
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
on

1552
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Brain Fart

1553
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
on Nintendo systems

1554
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I think also it's just that they don't

1555
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
sell a lot of copies

1556
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
people recognize it and

1557
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
it's definitely a series that a lot of

1558
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
hardcore gamers are into and I

1559
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
mean they have a lot of series that hardcore gamers

1560
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
are into but their best selling game

1561
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
is just kind of moderate selling

1562
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
for any other company that's the thing

1563
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and I think to

1564
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
buy the company for a lot

1565
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
of money doesn't make any sense because you're

1566
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
not going to make your money back very fast

1567
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
so that's probably

1568
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
why and I mean if you think

1569
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
about it it's not going to make anything

1570
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
really exclusive because

1571
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
most of the games come out in 3DS and stuff

1572
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
anyways PlayStation 3

1573
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
occasionally but I don't think

1574
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I don't know maybe it would

1575
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
you know

1576
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
coax them into making more

1577
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
games for the Wii U or a game

1578
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
for the Wii U because they don't have any

1579
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
so I don't know

1580
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Alright well let's travel around the world and check out some

1581
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
release dates

1582
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Okay so in the

1583
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
US there's a few games coming out

1584
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
they have this Batman Arkham

1585
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
bundle which is you know the last two Batman

1586
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Arkham games, Arkham City and

1587
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Arkham Asylum

1588
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 on

1589
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
DS and 3DS

1590
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Did that movie necessitate a sequel?

1591
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Apparently from a small company

1592
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
called Game Mill, yes it did

1593
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
so you know movie tying games

1594
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
do well in 3DS

1595
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Provolution Soccer 2014

1596
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000

01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000

FIFA 14 on PlayStation 3

01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and Xbox 360 and Vita

1600
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
well technically it's FIFA 12

1601
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
but you know they've reskinned it

1602
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
a few times so FIFA 14

1603
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
totally brand new addition

1604
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000

and last but not least

1610
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
if you are looking

1611
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
to pick up a 3DS

1612

1621
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
together and look at some release dates there?

1622
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I wish! There's a lot coming out

1623
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000

01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I can't believe my sister is that cute

1639
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
that was a funny anime

1640
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
so that well if you want

1641
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
there's the HD complete box version of that

1642
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
which I imagine the anime included

1643
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
The anime is basically this guy

1644
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
who's little sister likes to play dating sims

1645
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
but the ones in particular that she likes

1646
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
are big brother little sister dating sims

1647
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
That sounds awkward

1648
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It is but it is hilarious

1649
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I'm also quite like I'm just blown away

1650
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
for a minute by the fact that you understood me

1651
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
speaking Japanese

1652
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm getting a little like wow

1653
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I always thought it was the big joke that I can't

1654
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
pronounce any of these names but

1655
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Well it was certain things

1656
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
certain parts of the

1657
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Well the moment you said Ore no Imouto

1658
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I was like oh god is he gonna say

1659
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
and then the moment you said Kawaii

1660
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I was like oh yeah that's it

1661
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Fair enough

1662
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Painkiller Hell and Damnation

1663
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
That sounds like a Loki kind of game there

1664
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
These are all still Playstation 3

1665
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000

1666
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000

Shutsugeki Otometashi no Senjou 2

1669
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That's a price reduction however

1670
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
so don't get too excited about that

1671
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
On the Xbox 360 far less to look forward to

1672
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Armored Core Verdict Day

1673
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and Painkiller Hell and Damnation

1674
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
come out there

1675
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm trying to see if Painkiller is a

1676
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
riff on a franchise we have here

1677
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't recognize this

1678
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's a game that came out a while ago on PC

1679
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Painkiller Hell and Damnation

1680
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
also came out as well

1681
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's a really hard game

1682
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
like first person shooter in hell

1683
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and you have all sorts of crazy weapons and stuff

1684
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
but yeah

1685
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It's also out here

1686
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
on Playstation 3

1687
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
at some point as well

1688
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Alright we're going to the Playstation Vita

01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
those of you interested in importing it though

1692
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
might want to take the opportunity

1693
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000

01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
that's it

1751
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
alright just a couple more stories for you guys

1752
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
and then the classic game of the week

1753
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Loki? alright so let's

1754
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
talk about some Nintendo announcements

1755
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
here they're bringing

1756
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Wii Sports back

1757
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
as part of Wii Sports Club

1758
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
it's Wii Sports

1759
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
in HD

1760
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
let me pause

1761
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
for a second and let that sink

1762
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
in because I don't really see how HD's

1763
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
going to improve this but sure why not

1764
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
anyways so they're going to have Wii Sports

1765
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
which is not a bad thing because people play

1766
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Nintendo for Wii Sports nowadays

1767
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and it's coming to the

1768
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
eShop on November 7th

1769
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and they're going to start

1770
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
with a few games so they're

1771
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
going to start with boxing

1772
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
was it actually I'm sorry

1773
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
bowling, tennis, and baseball and boxing

1774
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
golf starting off with tennis and bowling

1775
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
and then boxing

1776
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
baseball and golf are going to be coming later on

1777
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
they're going to feature enhanced controls

1778
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
with Wii Motion Plus

1779
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
so probably just the versions that are from Wii

1780
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Sports Resort and

1781
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
online multiplayer

1782
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
versus mode

1783
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
that's pretty cool

1784
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Nintendo's going online

1785
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
with something that's always exciting because it never

1786
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
fucking happens

1787
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
it says it'll allow players to register and create

1788
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
state or regional clubs

1789
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
so people will be able to play casually

1790
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
against members of

1791
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
their own club or take on rival clubs

1792
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and then Wii Sports

1793
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Club I guess they have

1794
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
this weird thing that you can do as well

1795
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
if you don't want to buy the games outright

1796
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
they can 24 hour period

1797
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
to try the games

1798
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
that are available after the trial

1799
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
there's a day pass available for

1800
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
$1.99 or permanent purchase

1801
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
for $10

1802
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
per individual sport

1803
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
it's a little high

1804
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
if you ask me

1805
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
it's what, five games?

1806
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
yeah I mean when you consider that no one plays

1807
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
baseball and no one really plays

1808
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
well but I kind of like that

1809
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
that let's be real I only want

1810
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
the tennis and the bowling as I'm sure a lot

1811
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
there's a few people who want the others but I only want the

1812
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
tennis and the bowling and those are the ones I want to

1813
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
play online so that's kind of nice that I

1814
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
can only buy those

1815
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and it's really

1816
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
fascinating to me that they are

1817
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
basically opening up the idea of

1818
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
you know people

1819
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
only really play these games when other people

1820
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
are over and they're having a party

1821
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
so they're basically building in a rental system

1822
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
on demand where it's like

1823
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
you can rent the game for $2 for a day

1824
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
and instant Wii tennis party

1825
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
it's

1826
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
interesting Nintendo is clearly

1827
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
testing something here

1828
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
they're testing a lot of things

1829
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
testing people's patience

1830
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
here's something else they're testing

1831
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
so Wii Fit U is going to be available

1832
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
November 1st as a download

1833
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
and then later

1834
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
on December 13th they'll be coming out

1835
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
as like a bundle and so

1836
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
November 1st

1837
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
you will have one month to demo

1838
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
the game and

1839
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that's if you have a Wii Balance board

1840
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
and then if you decide and you

1841
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
like the game then you need to

1842
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
purchase a fit meter which is their

1843
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
little pedometer thing that's going to tie into it

1844
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and then I guess

1845
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
the fit meter is priced at $20

1846
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and that's also coming out on November 1st

1847
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and then once you

1848
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
have that if you want to buy

1849
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
the package that's going to be coming

1850
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I guess December 13th

1851
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and then the full game download is coming

1852
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
February 1st

1853
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
it's a little different I guess

1854
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
so how's your Wii Fit

1855
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Wii Fit board holding up?

1856
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
my Wii Fit Balance board right now true story

1857
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
is propping up

1858
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
the television you see over there

1859
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
because you'll notice it has to be propped up a bit

1860
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
to get over the sound board and we didn't have

1861
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
anything that was just the right height except the

1862
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Wii Balance board mine was

1863
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
under my TV like just under

1864
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I just have it stashed away down there and I put

1865
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
it away I don't even know what again now I need

1866
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to see if the damn thing still works because I

1867
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
have to admit I'm curious about Wii U

1868
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Plus or Wii U Fit Plus

1869
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
whatever the fuck it's called

1870
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
that game the fitness game

1871
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
you want the thing I want the

1872
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
hot new thingy that everybody's got

1873
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
well and and it's it's

1874
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
kind of fascinating to me that it's like alright

1875
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
so here's the deal yo

1876
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
if you had Wii Fit before

1877
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
you get it on this day and it's like

1878
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
free for a month but then if you want to keep it

1879
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
you gotta buy this thing but if you don't have any

1880
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
of it we'll have it all out on this day

1881
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
and then you can download it on this like I'm like

1882
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'm like

1883
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I've gone cross eyed from how

1884
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
they're trying to get return customers well

1885
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
yeah and I don't like I'm not saying it's necessarily

1886
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
a bad idea but it's the whole

1887
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
thing is just very like it's not what

1888
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I expect out of Nintendo

1889
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
at all I guess that's

1890
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
a good thing though because if you think about it

1891
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
that means if I was a supporter of Wii Fit

1892
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I can get this upgrade

1893
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
for 20 bucks and let's be real

1894
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
it's probably not gonna be

1895
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
much different than the Wii versions

1896
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
it will be an upgrade that incorporates

1897
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
the pedometer or what have you so

1898
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
it's kinda refreshing that

1899
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I can get that for 20 bucks

1900
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
assuming my stinkin' balance board will

1901
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
still work after having a TV sitting on it for

1902
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
two years um

1903
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Didn't I try to borrow it once and it didn't work?

1904
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Hey here's a fantastic idea

1905
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I mean it's just so out there and crazy

1906
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
why don't they fuckin' have it tie in with

1907
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
the 3DS that has a goddamn pedometer built

1908
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
into it oh but that would be too

1909
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
fuckin' difficult for them now would it?

1910
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I would imagine what they're really

1911
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
going after are those like the what are

1912
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
they called the Fitbits? The things

1913
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that people can wear on their hands like the bracelets

1914
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
that's what they're going after right? That makes me think of

1915
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
what was the thing they used to have

1916
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
the monitor

1917
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
oh hell I don't remember the Genki monitor or something

1918
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
yeah something like that Genki monitor

1919
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
well then there was I don't know there was that

1920
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
um ridiculous game on the

1921
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
that was on the DS I think that everybody

1922
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
walks or whatever that was that

1923
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
you put the little thing in your pocket and it would just

1924
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
that was on the Wii was that on the Wii?

1925
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
yeah thanks Konami

1926
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
no that was on the DS

1927
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
no it was on the Wii

1928
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
it was a part it was a music game

1929
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
that was walking

1930
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
no no we're thinking of two different games

1931
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I know what you're talking about but there was another

1932
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
game that like it came with two

1933
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
little pedometers and you plugged it into your

1934
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
DS or something and it said you walked

1935
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
500 steps today let's

1936
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
upload it to the internet and see how far the world

1937
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
has walked to the moon would you walk

1938
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
500 miles? it was like a non-game game you know what that

1939
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
makes me think of oh my god it makes me think

1940
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
of Noby Noby Boy on my phone

1941
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
kind of because like you have to make him

1942
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
grow and then he has to reach girl

1943
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
or it's how long it takes girl to reach earth

1944
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
or some shit

1945
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Dark Tetsuya says walk it out

1946
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
that was the one that was the Konami game I believe

1947
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and then

1948
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
VX Chase and XV

1949
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
says I want Pokemon Pikachu

1950
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
pedometer integration

1951
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
that was a thing too I forgot about that

1952
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
one of the Pokemon games had that thing too

1953
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I miss my Pikachu

1954
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
so

1955
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
alright anyhow

1956
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
let's talk about this as long as we're on Nintendo

1957
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
because this news gets me very excited

1958
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I want this

1959
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
version of the game to happen and it's Soul Calibur

1960
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
2 HD on

1961
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
the Wii U sit down

1962
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
it's not confirmed yet but

1963
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
what is being talked about is that

1964
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
GamesRadar talked to Namco Bandai

1965
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
at a pre-Tokyo game

1966
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
show event I believe to see

1967
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
if the development team would consider

1968
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
bringing Soul Calibur 2 HD to

1969
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the Wii U because as you know right now

1970
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
the game is only coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

1971
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and PlayStation Network but I think

1972
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
many of us remember the GameCube

1973
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
version as being the definitive version because it had

1974
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Link remember

1975
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
so even though it's cool that you know

1976
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Spawn and Heihachi are going to be

1977
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
in the other ones we want Link

1978
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and we want it on Nintendo so

1979
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
GamesRadar was told that if the game

1980
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
does well it's a possibility

1981
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
they even encouraged

1982
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
people to spam the producer's Twitter

1983
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
if they're interested

1984
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
it's not, it doesn't have anything

1985
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
to do with the fucking popularity of the game

1986
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
it has to fucking do with the fact that

1987
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
no there's not a lot of

1988
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
console sales and I'm betting that

1989
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Tekken or Tekken Tag

1990
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Tournament 2 probably fucking bombed

1991
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
on the Wii U that's why

1992
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
it's not coming to the goddamn Wii U

1993
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
it's not because they just

1994
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
yeah but if they're writing it for 360

1995
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I thought the Wii U was supposed to be built

1996
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
so that it could like take 360

1997
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
ports really easy I understand

1998
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
it could take ports really easy but the thing is

1999
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
why spend the money to port a game

2000
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
if you're only going to make X amount of sales

2001
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
it costs money to do a port regardless of how easy

2002
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
it is it's still

2003
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
and my thought is you're saying that it has

2004
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
to sell well in order to do the port

2005
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and I'm like well I

2006
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I don't want to buy the game twice

2007
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
so if I buy it on

2008
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
PlayStation that's it I'm not going to buy it again

2009
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
it's free to play no you're thinking of

2010
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
a different Soul Calibur game Soul Calibur HD is not

2011
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
you're thinking of the new, the one we talked about

2012
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
last week I thought that was the free to play one

2013
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
not Soul Calibur HD

2014
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Soul Calibur HD is

2015
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
that was some new game in the series

2016
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
it's on PlayStation 3 it's not

2017
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
no you're mixing, you're crossing your Soul Calibur

2018
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
wires you're forging a new

2019
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Destiny for the game I was thinking about

2020
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
the Soul Calibur 2 HD

2021
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
that was, that's one of

2022
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
the three import GameCube games I have

2023
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
was Soul Calibur

2024
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
2 just so we could have Link

2025
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
so we could have it early

2026
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
SSJ100Matt says

2027
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
ugh I hate it when they pull that shit

2028
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
quote if it makes enough money, such a cock tease

2029
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
do it or don't do it, stop stringing people

2030
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
along, amen

2031
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
just do it

2032
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
talking about fitness

2033
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and all this stuff

2034
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
it's just probably people asking them about it that's all

2035
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
it's not that they came out and said we have an

2036
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
idea for a game we're going to make

2037
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
but only if it sells well

2038
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
yeah only if it sells well so everybody go buy it

2039
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I mean they're not Konami or something

2040
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
we have no intention of ever making it

2041
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
unless you pre-order X amount of copies

2042
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
ha ha ha

2043
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
alright

2044
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
that definitely does it for that story

2045
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
let's go back to a time

2046
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
when you know it was

2047
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
a whole lot easier than this

2048
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
and there was really

2049
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
only two consoles

2050
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
either you Ninten did

2051
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
or you Sega didn't

2052
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
it is the classic

2053
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
game of the week Dark Soccer is going to take

2054
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
a trip down memory lane and find a game that she

2055
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
thinks hey, you should be playing this game

2056
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
forget these HD

2057
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
remasters and all this shit

2058
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
go back and play a classic

2059
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
in 4x3, love it

2060
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I also have an announcement after this too

2061
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
about the segment

2062
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
okay, hmm, nevermind

2063
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I would have told you ahead of time

2064
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I was like you're going to fucking surprise me with some shit here girl

2065
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
alright here it is

2066
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

2067
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
the game of the week is Mischief Makers

2068
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
the game is known in Japan

2069
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yuke Yuke Troublemakers

2070
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
or as it's known on OLR, Dark Sakura

2071
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
what?

2072
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Mischief Makers, get it?

2073
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
okay

2074
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
anyway, it is a game

2075
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
developed by Treasure

2076
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
and published by Amix

2077
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
in Japan and published by Nintendo

2078
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
in the US

2079
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
it was on the Nintendo 64

2080
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
it came out in 1997

2081
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
as one of the first

2082
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Nintendo 64

2083
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
and so your main character is the

2084
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
ultra intergalactic side-bot

2085
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
G-Marina Lightyears

2086
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
or as she's also known, Marina

2087
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
who is a robotic maid

2088
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
so you go through the game

2089
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and it's

2090
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
pretty average side-scrolling

2091
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
thing except it's a treasure game

2092
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
so you know weirdness is going to

2093
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
ensue

2094
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
so she can pick up her enemies, objects, weapons

2095
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and even some energy

2096
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
or projectiles

2097
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and they can be thrown or shaken depending on whatever the object is

2098
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
and crystals can come out

2099
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
and whenever some

2100
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
other objects are shaken

2101
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
there may be another effect that happens

2102
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and then

2103
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
you have another character named Teron

2104
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
who's able to play in other levels

2105
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
and has punches

2106
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
and kicks and blocks

2107
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
and he can hang from the ceiling

2108
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
and he can jump

2109
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
three times consecutively

2110
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
there's a golden gem in every level

2111
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
and what it does

2112
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I don't know what is up with

2113
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
OS

2114
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
anyway

2115
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
so if you have

2116
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
the gems, they're used in the final cutscene

2117
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
of the game

2118
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
by adding

2119
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
one to three seconds to the ending

2120
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
so the extended ending

2121
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
has extra

2122
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
character development for the

2123
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
villains and other

2124
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
secrets that happen

2125
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
so the way that you get the gold gem

2126
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
it differs

2127
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
from stage to stage

2128
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
so I suggest finding a walkthrough

2129
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
if you're going to play it

2130
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
so you have other gems in the game

2131
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
they're red, blue, green, and like I said

2132
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
the gold one

2133
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
and some of them give health for Marina

2134
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
red giving the lowest, gold being the highest

2135
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
and then each stage

2136
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
is numbered like a Super Mario Brothers level

2137
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
like a 1, 1, 2, you know

2138
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
etc. and the worlds

2139
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
have different elements like world 1

2140
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
is grasslands, world 3 is snow

2141
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and you have different cutscenes

2142
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
you also get a thing

2143
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
called a clancer ball

2144
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
where Marina can throw

2145
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
herself out of it and aim

2146
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
toward another ball and

2147
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
these pots store

2148
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
different items in it so if you get the right

2149
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
items you can make very interesting things happen

2150
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
so like I said it was done

2151
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
by Anix and Treasure

2152
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Treasure is like

2153
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Treasure did Gunstar Heroes

2154
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
they did

2155
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Silhouette Mirage

2156
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
if you want your

2157
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
bizarre games

2158
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
and I think

2159
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
that it was

2160
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
also one of the last

2161
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
titles they did in a cartridge

2162
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
format

2163
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
because

2164
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
it was one of their early ones

2165
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
that did not come out

2166
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
on a Sega system as well

2167
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
they thought that Nintendo 64

2168
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
was going to be the best choice for their projects

2169
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
of course we know how well that happened

2170
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
you know

2171
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
it's like I said

2172
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Treasure has a track record

2173
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
for doing quality games

2174
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
with very interesting

2175
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
elements of gameplay in it so

2176
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
the game got kind of

2177
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
extra views I mean

2178
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
it's definitely

2179
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
geared toward the Treasure fans

2180
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
but not many people were

2181
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
too into it because of the limitations

2182
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
of the Nintendo 64 in terms of

2183
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
graphics and the way that the game

2184
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
it was just like a very glorified

2185
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
SNES game with 3D in it

2186
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
however

2187
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I know I keep saying it

2188
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
but it is a Treasure game

2189
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
so if you like Treasure games

2190
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
this will definitely be up your alley

2191
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and it's got really

2192
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
fun animation and really

2193
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
adorable

2194
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
artwork

2195
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
it's one of my favorites it's one of the

2196
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Nintendo 64 games that I still own

2197
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
so that is my game

2198
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
of the week is Mischief Makers

2199
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
or UK UK Troublemakers

2200
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
UK UK means go go

2201
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
now you just love

2202
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
to do these Treasure games

2203
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
is there any Treasure games you haven't done yet?

2204
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I'm not saying it's a bad thing

2205
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I'm sure there's Treasure games I haven't done

2206
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I mean

2207
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I've only done

2208
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
did I do Bongio?

2209
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Treasure did Bongio didn't they?

2210
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm trying to think if you did that

2211
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I think you did at some point

2212
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
well there it is

2213
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
there it is your classic game of the week

2214
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Mischief Makers by Treasure for the Nintendo 64

2215
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
so now Dark Sakura

2216
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
would like to make an announcement

2217
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I feel like saying

2218
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
parquet

2219
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
is a little crown like the 80s commercials

2220
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
so many of our listeners will not understand

2221
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
that is so lost

2222
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
on so many

2223
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
that's always what pops into my head every time

2224
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
you play the stupid little fanfare

2225
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
is some kid with the crown

2226
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
parquet was the little thing that would talk

2227
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
parquet

2228
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
oh my god this show has dissolved into butter

2229
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
commercials Dark Sakura what's your damn

2230
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
announcement?

2231
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
my announcement is that

2232
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I have

2233
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
on the way here

2234
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
that I am reevaluating what I do in terms

2235
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
of systems for the games and I am now

2236
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
going to be doing it with a year cut off

2237
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
so starting

2238
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
with

2239
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
October I'm going to be doing

2240
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
games that came up through 2003

2241
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
so that

2242
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm keeping a consistent 10 year

2243
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
gap so that's going to start bringing

2244
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
in I think

2245
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
later PS1 games

2246
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
GameCube games

2247
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
the end of the Dreamcast cycle

2248
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
and I believe PS2

2249
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
we're going to start seeing PS2 games

2250
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
come in for classic games I seem to remember

2251
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
about a year ago you did an early

2252
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
PlayStation 2 game and a lot of people

2253
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
were like that's not classic

2254
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
no y'all we're getting older

2255
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
because these games are 10 years old

2256
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I think that's fair so I'm

2257
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
on top of that I have to say

2258
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
that no I'm not doing Halo

2259
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
chatters

2260
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
chatters are trolling

2261
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
what started

2262
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
the thought in my head

2263
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it took a while to develop you know the entire

2264
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
drive here I was looking back

2265
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
at my shelves going

2266
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
oh my god some of this is

2267
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
crap

2268
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
we do have a lot of shit games

2269
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I mean for all of the

2270
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
you know 300 plus worth

2271
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
dollar games that we own we have

2272
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
some shit and I have some games

2273
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
that are kind of shit that I have just because I

2274
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
fucking wanted them like Gatchamon

2275
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
and the shooting I got it because

2276
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
it was Gatchamon game shut up I have

2277
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Kitty the Cool which I got so

2278
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I could burn you a copy

2279
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
if you will remember that

2280
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
somebody bought me the Hello Kitty GameCube

2281
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
game and it's not that great

2282
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
so you know what's funny

2283
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
with you setting your

2284
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
10 year limit I want to really

2285
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
explain to you what this means

2286
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
because you are doing games

2287
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
that are 10 years or older

2288
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
you could feasibly be

2289
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
doing games that we

2290
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
talked about their launch on this

2291
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
program I was

2292
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
thinking about that and maybe I should

2293
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
you know put it at our launch date

2294
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
and earlier but I think 10 years

2295
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
is a good limit and it opens up

2296
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm just thinking like oh my god she could

2297
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
now granted I love you SSJ 100

2298
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Matt for linking the Parquet commercial

2299
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
granted we didn't

2300
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
expand from the music games only

2301
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
to all games until about what

2302
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
2004, 2005

2303
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
so we still have a few years

2304
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
to go before you really hit that mark

2305
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
where yes we talked about these games when they first came out

2306
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
but the whole thing

2307
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I'm thinking of is that now we talk about some of

2308
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
these games and

2309
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
they are classic we're seeing

2310
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
HD remakes because

2311
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
they are classic oh god Rob

2312
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
sorry this is linked by SSJ

2313
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
100 Matt in chat finish your thought and then I'll play this

2314
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
ok but

2315
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
by now they are classic

2316
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and you know we have to stay

2317
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
and it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing

2318
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
only games from 10 years ago

2319
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I still have a shit ton

2320
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
of Cliccovision games and

2321
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Intellivision to be fair you've

2322
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
been doing this segment since episode I mean

2323
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
this segment has evolved since the early days

2324
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
of the show because it used to be what it used to be your advice

2325
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
column you had your link and then the website of the

2326
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
yeah so now you have your classic so you've only been doing

2327
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
classic games since what episode 250 yeah

2328
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
but that's still 270

2329
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
games but that's that you've covered

2330
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
exactly it's not even at a

2331
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
halfway point anymore that I

2332
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
started doing this and for the record

2333
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I do kind of miss the website of the week just because

2334
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
the guy from

2335
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Weebil and

2336
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Bob messaged us

2337
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that was pretty cool

2338
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
that was like a nerdgasm

2339
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
in my book ok now if I

2340
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
get you know a shout out from

2341
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
you know

2342
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
from Homestuck people or from

2343
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
the guy the person that does Nedroid

2344
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Diary I would be even happier

2345
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
because those are

2346
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
my favorites but

2347
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
yeah I figured by now it's time

2348
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
it's time to grow up

2349
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
it's time to acknowledge that I don't want

2350
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
to grow up I'm an O.L.R.

2351
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
kid there's a million games O.L.R.

2352
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
that I can play with

2353
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Lord but

2354
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I'm thinking at this

2355
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
point enough of our listeners

2356
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
who might have been

2357
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
a little too young for us back in the

2358
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
day yes might

2359
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
appreciate something that's a little bit more

2360
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
in their realm of experience from

2361
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
time to time fair enough fair enough

2362
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
black wolf is trying he says

2363
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000

you know Bobby it will happen

2366
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000

2368
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
you too can bribe dark soccer

2369
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
for the classic game of the week

2370
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000

so sorry to the live Atari commercials

2378
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I will have to bump that in post production

2379
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
to make it actual volume for the podcast

2380
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
listeners yeah that did not come through very well for

2381
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
live sorry about that very very quiet

2382
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
the imperial commercials where the kids would

2383
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
take a bite of their toast with their

2384
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
imperial butter on it and then

2388
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I'm old shut up by the way I want to

2389
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
point out in chat room SSG-100

in a row

2395
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
using this show

2396
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
for your own nefarious purposes

2397
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
boy oh boy alright

2398
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
you know what

2399
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I've been doing this free for a long time

2400
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
at least

2401
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
you can get a pizza you know what

2402
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I think that's fair you know we've done this show

2403
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
what five hundred and twenty weeks out of our lives

2404
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
at least let's get a pizza out of it

2405
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
do you remember when I was

2406
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
trying to get Pinkberry to sponsor us for how long

2407
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I know right Pinkberry listen

2408
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
but you remember when I was doing

2409
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
pump up the volume yeah and yes

2410
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
it was totally named after the movie

2411
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and Loki did my intro for that

2412
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
to everybody knows because it was used

2413
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
in the movie and he said

2414
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
tune in and give her a dollar

2415
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
someone sent me a dollar

2416
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I did the intro

2417
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
you did my intro yeah you did

2418
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
you did my intro I remember it

2419
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I'll dig it up Loki I don't remember

2420
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I think you probably need the copy of it again

2421
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
we should play it during part B Rob

2422
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
that's a tough task for me to find it

2423
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I can't guarantee I have it

2424
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000

2425
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000

2458
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
episode of our show

2459
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
September 22nd

2460
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
2013 and uh

2461
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
a big thanks of course to everybody who turns up

2462
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
to listen to the show live

2463
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and in podcast form

2464
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
uh I know for live tonight

2465
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
we're going up against what the Emmys are tonight

2466
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
although I mean I don't know why these award

2467
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
shows are such a big deal but maybe I'm just

2468
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
jaded from doing this on Sunday night for so long

2469
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
but I know the Breaking Bad finale

2470
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
is tonight too and I'm sure a lot of people

2471
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
are excited about that

2472
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
but that's why they have DVR

2473
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
that's why you tape it and watch it later

2474
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
but speaking of recording

2475
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
speaking of recording and watching it

2476
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
later I know a lot of people listen to us on the podcast

2477
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
feed uh be it through Stitcher

2478
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
or iTunes or whatever

2479
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I mean there's a lot of ways to know

2480
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
some people might still be rocking this on the PSP

2481
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
which does remind me to also

2482
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
say um olrpsp.com

2483
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
has closed

2484
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
uh I think well I think it was

2485
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
this week that it finally was turned back over

2486
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
to GoDaddy who I'm sure has a spam site up

2487
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
in its place um so

2488
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
that is no longer accessible

2489
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
at that website but if you do have a PSP

2490
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
and you have badly

2491
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
you're like oh what was I missing at olrpsp.com

2492
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
even though it's so out of date

2493
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I don't even think it ever it still tries to access

2494
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
the stream at our old network

2495
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
but not even their current stream

2496
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
like an old stream at the old network

2497
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
uh you can still visit the graphics

2498
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Loki did do a bang up job on the site

2499
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
orangeloungeradio.com

2500
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
slash psp you just have to do it the long way

2501
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and I'm pretty sure the old games radio

2502
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
streamer does not work anymore

2503
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm pretty sure it goes to their old feed

2504
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
because I think it had broke it had been broke

2505
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
at one point when they switched servers and

2506
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
everybody was like Loki update it Loki update it

2507
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and you were like no

2508
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I have an updated site here

2509
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I'm not gonna start now

2510
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
the studio points out there's also a bitly

2511
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
so bit.ly slash

2512
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
olrpsp will also get you there

2513
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
so there you go

2514
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
um anyhow uh

2515
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
thanks again to all you guys who listen and participate with the show

2516
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
speaking of live participators

2517
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
uh it was brought to our attention

2518
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
during the release date segment that we go over

2519
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
that we missed one big release

2520
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
that's coming out this week probably because

2521
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
it's in the download space but

2522
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
some of our chatters namely Alan Alchemy

2523
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
and ActDeft very excited about

2524
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition

2525
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Deluxe Plus which is

2526
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
on PC I know they've been hoarding it

2527
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
on Steam uh Wednesday September

2528
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
25th uh and then

2529
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
also the DLC pack for

2530
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
consoles will be the same day because I believe

2531
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
it's new to PC I don't think it's been out on PC

2532
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
yet so it'll be on Steam 9.25

2533
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and then the DLC upgrade

2534
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
uh will hit consoles on September 25th

2535
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
so that's it sounds like they're adding a lot

2536
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
to it like they probably could have done a third

2537
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
game out of it but they're not so

2538
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
just wanted to throw that out there because after

2539
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
all they could have done a third game

2540
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
but they didn't they could have

2541
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
not unlike

2542
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
another company we know right

2543
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Half Life 2 DLC

2544
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
episode confirmed they need to talk to Capcom

2545
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
and learn about counting to three

2546
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
pretty much the third game for Pac-Man

2547
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
3 on Steam

2548
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Half Life 3 confirmed

2549
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
maybe that's one of the big announcements who knows

2550
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
alright uh let us get into

2551

2554
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
mentioned this yet well that's

2555
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000

01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
hurry up and wait Loki

2558
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
so Disney Infinity is getting

2559
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
some free toy boxes

2560
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
um as part of DLC

2561
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
and um

2562
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
the first one or I should say

2563
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
one of them is gonna be the Tron Highway

2564
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
so yes you're gonna

2565
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
finally be able to get your Tron stuff in the

2566
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
toy box mode which is pretty fantastic

2567
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
um

2568
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
and I guess it's gonna offer

2569
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
some uh cool stuff racing

2570
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I guess along tracks and stuff

2571
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
um some of the other ones are coming out too

2572
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Sugar Mania so there you go

2573
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
there's your uh your Sugar Rush

2574
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
stuff right there Monster Rally

2575
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and Cosmic Platformer

2576
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
oh and

2577
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I like this one um

2578
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
it's a trap is one that's

2579
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
also being released

2580
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
cause you know Disney

2581
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
owns Lucas now so

2582
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
wow funny

2583
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I don't think that's necessarily gonna be a

2584
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Star Wars theme but it would be hilarious

2585
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
they're teasing you into thinking it is

2586
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
yes they know what they're doing

2587
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
they know what they're doing um

2588
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
so yeah so that's gonna be available

2589
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I guess um

2590
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
sometime soon doesn't

2591
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
really say oh October 3rd

2592
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
is when those are gonna be available so

2593
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
it's kinda cool

2594
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
hey you know what you may be able to just pick up

2595
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Disney Infinity cause I may be selling them on eBay

2596
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
soon yeah

2597
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
cause I don't have time to play with Grand Theft Auto

2598
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
taking up my entire life

2599
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Gravity Rush

2600
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
is getting a sequel and

2601
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
um I believe that's still coming to the Vita

2602
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
and they were kinda they teased it

2603
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
with a trailer that came out

2604
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
of um

2605
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
uh what was it uh

2606
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
what the fuck was this weekend

2607
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
or this week Tokyo Game Show

2608
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
hello thank you um

2609
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
um so yeah so far confirmed

2610
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
for the Vita but um no word yet on

2611
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
when um if that's gonna be other

2612
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
systems PlayStation 4 that kind of stuff

2613
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I would think keep it on the Vita it was a pretty good

2614
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Vita exclusive game although

2615
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I mean they practically well they still give it away

2616
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
if you well if you have PlayStation Plus you know

2617
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
you have to be on board with that but yeah so

2618
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
that's pretty cool um it's worth your time

2619
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
though yeah and uh

2620
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
no word on when that's

2621
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
coming out and then last but not least one of the

2622
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
cool pieces of integration

2623
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
for Grand Theft Auto

2624
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
5 is this iFruit companion

2625
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
app that you can get on iOS

2626
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
um very disappointing that it's not an

2627
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Android yet but with it you can do a bunch

2628
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
of cool stuff including customizing your car

2629
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
you can customize the license plates that are on your

2630
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
car and they actually appear in game

2631
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
as well oh that's kinda cool um

2632
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
you can even raise Chop which

2633
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
is the dog that Franklin

2634
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
um ends up getting and

2635
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
uh you can train him and stuff

2636
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and walk him just like you can with

2637
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
intent dogs except you know with a little bit

2638
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
of a twist including um

2639
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
you know he'll fetch

2640
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
grenades and severed hands and stuff

2641
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
like that um and they're gonna be adding apps

2642
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
to it as well so um

2643
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
it's pretty cool and it's free

2644
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
so if you have you know an iOS device

2645
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
then pick it up

2646
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
if you have an Android device don't

2647
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
download any ones that are out there because they're all scam

2648
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
apps they're all scam right now

2649
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I love that they have that tie in

2650
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
though that's awesome they have a lot of ties that it actually

2651
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
goes in your game yeah they have that and social

2652
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
club stuff you know there's actual real

2653
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
websites you can visit you get in game

2654
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
discounts and stuff with and

2655
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
just all sorts of crazy stuff Final Fantasy

2656
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
14 has an app but it doesn't like it's

2657
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
it's like the Warcraft armory you can like

2658
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
look up characters and stuff in game but you can't really

2659
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
do anything with it otherwise but

2660
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
kinda neat I like seeing the

2661
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
whole tie in there now that's second screen right

2662
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
alright sort of yeah

2663
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
alright speaking of second screen

2664
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
something on the Wii U popped up

2665
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
a message mentioning

2666
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
that Mario and Sonic at the Sochi

2667
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
2014 Winter Games will be available

2668
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
on the eShop on November 8th

2669
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
all controversy

2670
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
about the Winter Games and where it's being held

2671
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
aside these Mario

2672
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
and Sonic games have done very

2673
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
very well a lot of you guys

2674
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
probably really

2675
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I mean cause they're not really for hardcore gamers

2676
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
they're really geared for casual gamers and

2677
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
kids but these games do insanely

2678
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
well like it's one of the biggest properties

2679
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
on the Wii so this is

2680
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
a pretty big deal this is happening on the Wii U

2681
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
there was a reveal

2682
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
trailer if you think back to the Nintendo Direct

2683
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
then there was another trailer

2684
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
that said there will be 16 events in the game

2685
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Wii Motion Plus Wii U gamepad

2686
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
both being used some will use both

2687
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
the biathlon uses the Wii

2688
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
remote for skiing and then the gamepad for the sniping

2689
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
so there you go that will

2690
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
all be out November 8th

2691
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
so uh

2692
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Wii balance board support I see

2693
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
no probably not probably a little soon

2694
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
for that I don't know so

2695
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
there you go

2696
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I'm

2697
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
as much as I don't want to get too political on this show

2698
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
obviously you all know I have some strong opinions

2699
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
on certain subjects and so

2700
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
you know obviously I can't

2701
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
condone some of these laws

2702
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
that we've heard about in Russia

2703
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
that are just back in the stone age

2704
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
so is Birdo not gonna be

2705
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
allowed to play in these games?

2706
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I was gonna

2707
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
say something serious but we'll just leave it at that

2708
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
fair enough

2709
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
you play PC 4.0

2710
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I didn't even realize Uplay was a thing on PC

2711
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I knew it was on the consoles

2712
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I guess Ubisoft wants their buy to

2713
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
the PC gaming market as well

2714
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
there will be a new version of it in October

2715
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
and it will have new features including

2716
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Twitch TV integration

2717
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
well it's something that's bundled with

2718
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
all the Ubisoft games so if you have it on Steam

2719
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
you still have to log into your fucking Uplay

2720
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
bullshit yeah

2721
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I must not own any Ubisoft games on PC

2722
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I have on consoles

2723
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I have a couple Just Dance games

2724
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
and Zombie You

2725
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
and Blood Dragon

2726
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I don't remember if Far Cry 2 did

2727
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
but yeah

2728
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
well there you go

2729
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Uplay will also be available on the Xbox One and the

2730
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
PlayStation 4 when those consoles make their retail

2731
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
debuts but I don't know

2732
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
like I imagine

2733
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
those consoles are already streaming anyway

2734
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
so whatever

2735
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
and then last but not least

2736
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
for all two of you

2737
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
at Orange Lawns Radio that will care about this news

2738
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
La Mulana 2

2739
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
it is out there

2740
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
folks no all kidding aside

2741
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
this is an indie game that gets a lot of attention

2742
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
partially for

2743
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
its throwback to the retro days partially because

2744
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
of how difficult it is but

2745
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
La Mulana 2 apparently

2746
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
not available on PC until next year

2747
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
but it was

2748
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
spotted at Tokyo Game Show 2013

2749
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
and there's even like a little

2750
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
logo out there La Mulana 2

2751
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
the zeroth body the night spirit

2752
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I don't know how else to read that the zeroth body

2753
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
sounds right there it is

2754
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
and you will probably die

2755
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
many more times than

2756
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
zero playing La Mulana 2

2757
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I think Dark Tetsuya

2758
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
needs new underwear now he might

2759
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
so in other news

2760
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
speaking of people who need new underwear

2761
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I'm thinking of my husband now

2762
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Strider HD

2763
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
this is

2764
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
did you watch the trailer Rob?

2765
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
yes I did

2766
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
it is hot

2767
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
it's supposed to be a Metroidvania

2768
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
type game

2769
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
which people are a little bit sort of

2770
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
back and forth on but for the most part

2771
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
it's gotten some really positive reviews

2772
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and so I'm looking forward to it coming out

2773
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
but I just wanted to mention

2774
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
that it is getting really good reviews

2775
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
previews I guess would be really

2776
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
yeah but

2777
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I think that everyone owes it to themselves

2778
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
to dedicate themselves to the religion

2779
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
of Hiryu

2780
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
and definitely check out the

2781
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
you know think about it

2782
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
think about it this way Loki hasn't

2783
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
shut up about Grand Theft Auto 5

2784
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I haven't shut up about Final Fantasy 14

2785
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Dark Sakura will have her day when this

2786
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
game comes out

2787
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I need a moment

2788
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I need a moment

2789
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I'm a little warm

2790
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I'm a little warm

2791
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
do I need to get some paper towels

2792
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
this is getting gross

2793
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
someone fetch a towel

2794
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Austin now this is a cool game

2795
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and I was watching a little bit of the play on this

2796
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
it was one of the fastest

2797
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
greenlit games ever

2798
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
and it went in five

2799
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
days

2800
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
a game by Polish developer Blue Brick

2801
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
called Superhot

2802
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
and basically what it is

2803
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
it's

2804
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
basically your characters are like

2805
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
black outlines against

2806
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
all white but normally

2807
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
shaded environment

2808
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
with lots and lots of red blood

2809
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
the thing about this is that time

2810
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
only moves when you move

2811
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
so if someone shoots at you

2812
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
you can stop walking

2813
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
and the bullets stop

2814
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
and you can dodge them

2815
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
dodge them

2816
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
so it just seemed like a really neat concept

2817
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
and we've seen something like this done with

2818
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
you know bullet time and max pain

2819
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
but nothing to the extent of

2820
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
actually having it stop

2821
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
so the only way to win is not to play the game

2822
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
yes

2823
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
you have to

2824
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
you definitely have a goal within the game

2825
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
but

2826
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
you can move around the things that are in your way

2827
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Loki you just lost the game

2828
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
and last but never least

2829
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
and I'm looking forward to this as well

2830
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Bayonetta actually is

2831
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
having a theatrical release

2832
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
an animated theatrical release

2833
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
that will be out in November in Japan

2834
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
and I will have to talk to people who live there

2835
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
to tell me

2836
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
how it is

2837
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Krista go watch the movie for me

2838
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
so

2839
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
it's named Bayonetta

2840
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Bloody Fate and it will be out on November 23rd

2841
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
you know it's gonna be out

2842
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
and people will fan sub it

2843
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
of course

2844
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
fan subbers gonna sub

2845
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
alright

2846
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
are we ready to get to the foogle

2847
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
question of the week? I sure hope so

2848
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
because if not

2849
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
you're gonna check out for a minute

2850
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I guess

2851
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
we love to hear from listeners

2852
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
so every week we ask a

2853
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
question at facebook.com

2854
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
slash orange lounge radio and our google plus

2855
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
page available for a search

2856
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
available when you search for orange

2857
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
lounge radio a lot of comments

2858
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
this week I'm not gonna be able to read them all

2859
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'm so sorry but

2860
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
a lot of great feedback on the question this week

2861
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
let me tell you what the question is

2862
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
it was announced this week that Wii Sports would become the

2863
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
latest game to get an HD version or

2864
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
remaster if you will

2865
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
this is in addition to other HD remakes

2866
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
we've seen this year Kingdom Hearts for example

2867
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
and even previously with God of War

2868
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
and so forth so what's your opinion

2869
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
on HD remakes? Do you enjoy

2870
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
them or do you think it's not a good use of

2871
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
developer resources?

2872
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Redertainment on google plus says

2873
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
HD remaster or remake might be good if

2874
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
the game is a revered classic but Wii Sports

2875
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
come on what's next

2876
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Golf for the NES? Wait

2877
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I've played Golf for the NES it's the

2878
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 mini game

2879
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
E3

2880
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
VL or Evel says

2881
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I think it gives the new generation of gamers

2882
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
a chance to experience past games who are

2883
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
put off by older graphics

2884
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
gamers who missed old gems in the past

2885
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
like Shadow of the Colossus are

2886
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
able to experience the game now due

2887
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
to wider availability without paying the high

2888
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
eBay cost. Personally

2889
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I'll pay for the game again if they add

2890
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
new content along with the updated

2891
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
visuals like the Wind Waker HD with its

2892
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
gameplay tweaks and the gamepad support

2893
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
or have additional bonus content

2894
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
all DLC in the Resident Evil HD

2895
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
games which could cost

2896
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
which would cost more if obtained

2897
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
separately. Good thoughts

2898
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
you know though if somebody is really

2899
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
going to ignore a classic game because of

2900
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
graphics though I really think

2901
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
they're missing out I mean there's just some

2902
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
classic games you can't really HD

2903
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
like Kaboom on the Atari

2904
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
2600 that is a classic

2905
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
game but you can't like yeah

2906
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I mean there's some they tried Tetris

2907
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
right? The only thing that did

2908
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
kicks right was Miss New World

2909
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
and

2910
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
to be fair the Tetris on the Game Boy

2911
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
or I think the DS Tetris was

2912
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
amazing that was a great version

2913
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
of Tetris. And let's not forget Gals Panic

2914
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
is awesome. Of course of course

2915
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
so those are some of the answers from Google Plus

2916
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
let's get to some of the answers from

2917
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Facebook

2918
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Andrew S says I wouldn't mind a Tony Hawk

2919
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Underground or as my friend and I

2920
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
refer to it as Thug Remaster

2921
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
it would bring

2922
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
it would bring it out of PS2 graphics

2923
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Renee our buddy

2924
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
from Koopa Club says

2925
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
to HD or not to HD

2926
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
that is the question

2927
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
whether it is nobler the developer

2928
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged

2929
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
reviewers for not offering new

2930
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
and instead recycling the same game format

2931
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
and content or to take arms against

2932
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
a sea of troubles from development, programming

2933
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and marketing and by providing new content

2934
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
either limited or a completely

2935
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
new game altogether and by

2936
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
opposing end them to try to

2937
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
release an HD version in timely fashion

2938
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I see what you did there

2939
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
and you get a slow clap

2940
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
it is a tough

2941
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
question that they have to ask

2942
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Red the Haze says I like

2943
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
HD remakes as it lets people try

2944
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
out older games they may have missed

2945
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
with updated graphics and performance

2946
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
as much as I think Wii Sports HD

2947
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
is a good idea for new Wii U owners to

2948
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
try out Wii Sports it just feels

2949
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
icky for them to try something like this for what

2950
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
was a free pack-in title

2951
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
especially with the lack of unified account system

2952
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
on with Nintendo consoles

2953
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
other than that HD remakes are great

2954
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Degenerate Johnny

2955
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
says the fact of the matter is that

2956
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
many of us gamers cling to the memories

2957
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
and experiences of the games we have played earlier

2958
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
in our lives an HD remake

2959
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
offers the chance for us to relive those

2960
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
memories with a fresher feel to it

2961
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
that is part of the answer I am going to

2962
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
cut the rest of it for time

2963
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
For the Fallen Dreams 13 says

2964
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I enjoy HD remakes of games because

2965
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
it's just about making a game I was already in love

2966
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
with bigger, brighter, and more

2967
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
aesthetically pleasing given the

2968
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
developer does it justice

2969
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
also not everyone's older consoles

2970
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
still work dot dot dot

2971
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
that's an answer I personally agree with

2972
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
unless you're me

2973
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Dart Charger says

2974
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
as someone who has invested in a lot of HD

2975
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
remakes I feel they sound cooler

2976
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
than they actually end up being

2977
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
the nostalgia is often

2978
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
fleeting with few exceptions

2979
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Scott W says

2980
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I enjoy HD remakes as long as they bring something

2981
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
extra like Final Fantasy 10 HD

2982
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
with the international content included

2983
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Kingdom Hearts looks great too

2984
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Ziba says I enjoy the HD remakes

2985
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
definitely the nostalgia feeling that's best

2986
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
it's even better when they add some special things

2987
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
to keep interest going

2988
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Eddie K says it's a lazy but effective

2989
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
way to make money

2990
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
nostalgia sells huge in the

2991
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
video game industry

2992
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Virtual Phil also

2993
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
from Koopa Club says I guess if you have the money

2994
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
to burn then it's cool but like

2995
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
DuckTales HD was fun for 10 seconds

2996
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
and now everyone is all over the next

2997
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
HD remake they tend to be

2998
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
a bit gimmicky

2999
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
and that was followed by the colon x face

3000
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
you know what

3001
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Dan is still playing that game

3002
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
because he's achievement hunting on it

3003
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Tiger Claw

3004
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
says an HD remake of a game would be worth

3005
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
it if they add some new content to it

3006
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
the problem is they tend to be a shot for shot

3007
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
remake of the original game where you

3008
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
know where all the items are located

3009
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and how to beat the levels

3010
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I'm down for an HD version of Wii Sports as long as

3011
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
they add online multiplayer to it

3012
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and lastly

3013
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Gamer Girl says don't know if this counts

3014
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
but I am really loving DuckTales

3015
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Remastered I think they should come out with

3016
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
more because a lot of the younger generation

3017
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
doesn't even know the mind blown

3018
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
that they're missing out on

3019
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
again some of the answers I'm so sorry I had to cut some of those for time

3020
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Facebook.com slash orange launch radio

3021
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
if you want to read all of the answers in their entirety

3022
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
a big thank you to all of you that

3023
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
took the time to answer that I did read them all

3024
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
so what are your guys thoughts

3025
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
quickly on HD remasters

3026
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I think they're great I agree with the guy

3027
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
that said you know what the old consoles don't

3028
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
always work I like the stuff like

3029
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
trophy support and so on and

3030
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
it's just icing on the cake when they go back and make

3031
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
it a little bit better

3032
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I'm kind of

3033
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't know how

3034
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I feel about it to be honest because

3035
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I hardly ever go back and buy them

3036
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
except for the ones that are like super

3037
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
nostalgic that really

3038
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
are a true update like you know like

3039
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
DuckTales was you know that was a big

3040
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
nostalgic kick I have it Dan

3041
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
has it I'm not

3042
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
getting the Final Fantasy

3043
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
X set because

3044
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I already have X, X-2

3045
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
and I have X

3046
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
International so

3047
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
no I have X-2 International

3048
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
so sort of like what's the point

3049
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I actually have the Japanese version of X

3050
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I'm a sheep I'm totally getting X

3051
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I want it really bad

3052
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
that being said

3053
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I kind of want the HD

3054
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Kingdom Hearts but I'm probably just going to wait and play yours

3055
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
an effective

3056
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
solution because I'm

3057
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
unemployed so I have

3058
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
to measure frugality

3059
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
and realism versus

3060
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
you know

3061
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
needs

3062
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
versus wants

3063
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Final Fantasy 14 I bought the collector's edition

3064
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
that was my anniversary

3065
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
present Grand Theft Auto 5

3066
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
is my anniversary present to my husband

3067
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
because I am an awesome wife

3068
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
so

3069
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
we make it for occasion so if

3070
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
it came out if a really awesome

3071
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
HD remake came out and it's a round

3072
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
like Strider well Strider's not really

3073
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
a remake though we're fucking getting that you know that

3074
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
but it falls in the

3075
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
same category as DuckTales but also Strider

3076
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
is Dan's favorite

3077
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
game in the fucking universe

3078
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
for Strider you'll eat ramen for a week

3079
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
he made me play through the

3080
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Genesis version when I moved out here to see

3081
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
if he wanted to bury me

3082
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
well he didn't say that aloud

3083
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
but I have a feeling that my ability to beat

3084
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Strider was one of the requirements

3085
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
of marriage and what did he have to do for you

3086
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
fair is fair right?

3087
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
what did he have to do for me?

3088
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
not irritate me?

3089
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I don't know

3090
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
he kept me supplied in video games

3091
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
for the last 15 years so I feel good about that

3092
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
fair enough he hasn't kicked me

3093
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
out for being a shiftless layabout for the

3094
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
last two years it's not my fault

3095
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'm not employed but still fair

3096
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
enough alright let's talk about some other

3097
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
gaming news and what else is going on in the industry

3098
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Loki why don't you start us off

3099
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
okay so let's talk some more Grand Theft

3100
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Auto it sold

3101
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
one billion dollars

3102
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
worth of copies in the first

3103
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
three days and

3104
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
that's a

3105
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
record in fact it broke

3106
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
a record for day one sales too

3107
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
800 million dollars

3108
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
the previous

3109
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
landmark I think was

3110
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 which only

3111
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
did I want to say 450

3112
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
million

3113
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
and also

3114
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
it hit a billion dollars faster in Call of Duty

3115
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Black Ops 2 as well they hit a billion dollars

3116
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
in 15 days instead of

3117
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
three

3118
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
so yes it's the largest entertainment

3119
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
launch in history

3120
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
not bad

3121
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
fun fact

3122
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
in the history of films

3123
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
only

3124
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
17 movies

3125
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
have grossed a billion dollars

3126
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
worldwide and that's total

3127
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
17 movies total now

3128
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
the oldest one of the 17

3129
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
is

3130
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
1993

3131
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
this is like the Jurassic Park episode because

3132
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
the movie is the oldest

3133
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
one on the list there because you know it costs more to see

3134
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
a movie these days than it used to if you were to change

3135
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
for inflation

3136
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
like Gone with the Wind or something would probably be up there but

3137
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
yeah only 17 movies have ever done a billion

3138
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
dollars worth of business and that was over

3139
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
the course of being in the theater

3140
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
for what we Titanic the number

3141
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
two grossing movie of all time two billion

3142
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
dollars done but that was

3143
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
what that was in theaters for like six months

3144
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
and then re-released in the

3145
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
whole IMAX thing right

3146
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
so I mean this is huge that a video game did that

3147
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
practically overnight no movies done it

3148
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
overnight or three days

3149
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
still

3150
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
even can some

3151
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
folks guess some of the other movies the top 17

3152
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
on the list just for fun

3153
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
well I know the top grossing movie

3154
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
for 24 hours was Harry Potter

3155
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
and the

3156
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
it was Harry Potter and the

3157
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Deathly Hallows part 2 is number

3158
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
four on the all time list it was 91 million

3159
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
dollars in 24 hours that

3160
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
was the the video

3161
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
or DVD I'm sorry the

3162
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
movie record for top grossing

3163
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
24 hours I can tell you what the top two were no fair

3164
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
peaking but okay well I haven't because my

3165
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
glasses because

3166
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I remember the news past when avatars are past

3167
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Titanic avatar is the number one movie of all time

3168
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
and Titanic would be number two Titanic would be

3169
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
number two correct just quickly

3170
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Marvel's the Avengers number three

3171
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
because of Jaws Iron Man

3172
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
three number five Transformers

3173
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Dark of the Moon number six that surprised

3174
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
me Lord of the Rings The Return

3175
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
of the King number seven Skyfall

3176
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
number eight The Dark Knight

3177
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Rises number nine that

3178
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
surprised me too because I always thought The Dark Knight

3179
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
did better but I guess with the year difference

3180
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
and then lastly number ten I

3181
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
won't read the whole list but Pirates of the Caribbean Dead

3182
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Man's Chest is number ten so just

3183
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
kind of a fun little comparison those are the movies

3184
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
that have raked a billion dollars

3185
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
so

3186
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
neat and they're just getting started

3187
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
mm-hmm

3188
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
alright

3189
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
well moving on to a game

3190
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
that will sadly probably not to break a billion

3191
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
dollars because we're just not sure if the game is ever

3192
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
going to come out here or not it was

3193
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
spotted on Steam Greenlight this week

3194
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Ghosts and Goblins Online

3195
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
you know how they can get that to break a billion dollars

3196
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
charge one dollar for every life

3197
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
hahaha

3198
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
good work

3199
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
dead

3200
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Ghosts and Goblins Online this has a long history

3201
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
you want to talk about an old game it was originally

3202
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
supposed to be a multi-platform release in 2003

3203
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
but then development

3204
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
stopped before it was completed

3205
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
then there was a second attempt that was also

3206
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
canned C9

3207
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
did the whole Steam Greenlight

3208
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
campaign and they were bringing back

3209
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Ghosts and Goblins Online with co-op platforming

3210
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
PVP combat and frequent

3211
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
updates that do new items and upgrades

3212
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
but

3213
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I say was because then

3214
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
it got pulled

3215
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Capcom actually had this pulled

3216
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
and we're not totally sure on what it was

3217
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
but their statement was quote

3218
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
the Steam Greenlight page for Ghosts and Goblins Online

3219
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
that went live yesterday was wrongly

3220
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
posted by the game's Korean

3221
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
developer C9 and the page has

3222
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
now been removed. Ghosts and Goblins

3223
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
was released last year in

3224
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Korea, China and Taiwan and I seem to

3225
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
remember that now that there was the

3226
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Ghosts and Goblins because I remember we talked about it on the show

3227
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
we were like oh of course we don't get it

3228
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
here but they get it over there and there are

3229
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
no plans for the title to be

3230
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
released in Europe or North America

3231
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
hmm but

3232
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
very strange that that

3233
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
showed up on Steam Greenlight I mean

3234
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
that's more than just one person pushing a button

3235
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
accidentally you know what I mean? That's very

3236
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
strange to me

3237
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
but honestly the game

3238
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
itself looks very different

3239
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
than what you guys remember from

3240
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
you know the classic

3241
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
days of gaming when that was on the early

3242
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
consoles and the arcades and so forth

3243
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
so I kind of think

3244
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
as much as this sounds great on paper

3245
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
it's probably not

3246
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
a game to really

3247
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
look forward to big time

3248
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
so alright

3249
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
let's move on. DarkSaga

3250
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Do I gotta? Of course I do

3251
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
well

3252
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
this is something that

3253
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
you know we've seen

3254
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
the Kickstarter on it

3255
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
was Mighty No. 9 well guess what

3256
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
it is heading to the Wii U

3257
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
it reached its

3258
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
goal of 2.2 million on Kickstarter

3259
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
which also means that it's going to be on

3260
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
PS3, Xbox 360

3261
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
as well as Wii U

3262
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
there's still 14 days left on it

3263
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
and if they hit 2.4 million by

3264
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
October 1st it's going to have a challenge

3265
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
mode I want to see it on PC

3266
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
that'd be nice

3267
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
but you know what

3268
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
fuck it I want this game

3269
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I might who doesn't?

3270
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
well I guess we found

3271
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
out in the Fookle question the other week not everybody

3272
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
does I suppose if it wasn't that

3273
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
$20 could buy

3274
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
me probably a week of food

3275
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I'd probably put the money on the game just saying

3276
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I thought they were releasing it on PC

3277
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I mean I don't know why

3278
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
they are now

3279
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
and they're doing that oh no yeah I'm sorry PC was

3280
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
the original sorry PC was the original

3281
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
and then the console was added which was

3282
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
the 360 the Wii U they were doing it through Steam

3283
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
that was it but now right

3284
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
yeah but now the Playstation 4 is

3285
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
the stretch goal or did they hit that too

3286
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
see that it just says PS3

3287
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I don't know why I said PC

3288
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
they just said

3289
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U

3290
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
the next

3291
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
goal is challenge mode

3292
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
they are up to 2.4 million

3293
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
so they just hit challenge mode they just hit that today

3294
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
oh they did? they just hit it today

3295
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
end stage boss

3296
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
end stage boss is the next one they have to hit

3297
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
if they can get all the way to 3.3 million

3298
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
they'll be a Playstation 4 and Xbox One

3299
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
version it could happen

3300
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
they've got 8 days to go

3301
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
so it's got to happen

3302
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
pretty quick I kind of don't think it's going to make

3303
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
the Playstation 4 and Xbox One

3304
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I think we'll be lucky if we get to this beck and call

3305
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
online however

3306
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
if it still sells enough copies

3307
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
of it outside of their

3308
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Kickstarter true it could happen anyway

3309
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
that's very true I mean it's coming out next year

3310
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
it just might happen it might

3311
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
we'll see

3312
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
alright well let's

3313
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
move on Loki a few more stories

3314
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
here and then the mailbag

3315
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
so with all this talk about next

3316
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
gen stuff we've talked a little bit about

3317
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
this whole upgrade program that they're supposed

3318
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
to have for Xbox

3319
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
One and Playstation 4 well here's

3320
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
how it's going to work a little bit on the Playstation 4

3321
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
to play a

3322
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
digital Playstation 4 version

3323
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
of an eligible retail

3324
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Playstation 3 game you have to redeem a

3325
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
code that comes with the game

3326
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
if you buy it on the Playstation store

3327
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
so if you buy like say a digital copy

3328
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
of you know battlefield

3329
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
or something like that it

3330
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
will automatically unlock

3331
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
the game on Playstation 4

3332
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
when you play it if

3333
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
you happen to use that code to download

3334
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I think the digital version it will require you to still

3335
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
have the disc and the drive and they're

3336
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
saying that the next gen versions

3337
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
of the games

3338
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
will appear for like 10 bucks

3339
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I guess if you have that code as well

3340
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
and then

3341
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
one game though that isn't

3342
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
going to require an additional fee to upgrade

3343
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
it is Final Fantasy 14

3344
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
you will get a free transfer

3345
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
from Playstation 3 to Playstation 4

3346
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
however it is a one time transfer

3347
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
so once you've done it you lose rights to

3348
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
your Playstation 3 game unless of course

3349
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
you buy another copy that part was weird

3350
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
to me because I don't understand you know in Final Fantasy 11

3351
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
you had all of it

3352
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
if you had like a 360 disc you could

3353
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
sign on with your PC account

3354
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I mean granted you had to

3355
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
people still got a code because they bought the game on

3356
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
360 or whatever but it was just I don't know

3357
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
it's kind of like you could do all of it

3358
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
but yeah

3359
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
well I'm

3360
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
still excited at least that you know I'll have the

3361
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Playstation 4 version because I plan on getting a

3362
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Playstation 4 and it will be nice to have Final Fantasy 14

3363
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
on it so why play it on

3364
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Playstation 3 when I have the Playstation 4

3365
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
and that will be I don't understand why they I mean

3366
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
it's not like you can

3367
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
play the game

3368
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
you know for free or something

3369
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
like you can play on two systems

3370
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
at the same time or something

3371
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
we're running out of space on this TV to hook

3372
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
in a new console so if we plug in a new console

3373
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
something's getting moved to the bedroom

3374
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and so the thought is that obviously

3375
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
like oh we're getting the Playstation 4 let's put the

3376
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Playstation 3 well technically

3377
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Alan has both consoles there on the

3378
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
bedroom TV but we'll move the PS3

3379
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
with all our save files on it to the bedroom

3380
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
but I'm actually kind of thinking

3381
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
the 360 might be the one to get

3382
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
exiled to the bedroom

3383
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
so we'll see I don't know

3384
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
what the Wii U

3385
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I mean the Wii U you don't need that screen you can play

3386
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
second screen you technically don't even need

3387
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
it hooked up to anything honestly though I'm

3388
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
playing more Wii U than I'm playing Xbox 360

3389
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
these days truth

3390
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
system selector

3391
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
is that true facts? true facts

3392
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
that reminds me I need to get on virtual

3393
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
console and get Super Mario Brothers for a dollar

3394
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
or whatever they're charging for it you know

3395
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
what I probably have like five copies

3396
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
of Super Mario Brothers but not on

3397
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
two screens at the same time you know

3398
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
what Rob you're spoiled

3399
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
and she does if she has a

3400
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
DS copy of the game or a 3DS

3401
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
copy of a game true that's true which

3402
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I think I do true I don't

3403
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
know what I have you know since we were talking

3404
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
about NES memories and I

3405
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
know I've told this story on the show many

3406
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
times but I don't care I'm telling it again

3407
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
one of my earliest memories

3408
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
of Dark Sakura was when I

3409
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
was when I went to her house that she

3410
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
had with Dan out in a

3411
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
city or part of town oh

3412
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
the hood house I walked

3413
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
in the house and Dan had

3414
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
all these guys over all his guy friends

3415
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
were over and there were TVs all

3416
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
over the house every

3417
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
single person was playing I

3418
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
believe it was The Legend of Zelda

3419
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
it was everybody was playing Zelda

3420
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
with Nintendo so I took it to

3421
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
TVs and I was like Jamie you've got

3422
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
like 10 copies of

3423
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
The Legend of Zelda all going at the same time

3424
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
what the hell's going on here and she said

3425
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
it's our land party it's our local area

3426
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Nintendo party they all started

3427
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Zelda at the same time and they're trying to see

3428
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
who's gonna beat it first and Dan's currently in

3429
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
the lead that's why I married him

3430
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
you know they still do that right

3431
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
or no you hadn't married him yet but he was you know

3432
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
that's why it took us a while to get married but

3433
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
you know he still does stuff like that

3434
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
or he'll have Jeff over

3435
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
and they'll take turns

3436
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
playing through a game just to see how

3437
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
they can speed run it together now that

3438
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
is Nintendo gaming on

3439
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
two screens at once or in that case

3440
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
god there was literally there's like a TV

3441
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
on the dining room table a TV in the living

3442
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
room a TV in the back room

3443
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
like any place they could put a fucking

3444
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
TV with Nintendo it was

3445
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
in that house I'm like your electric

3446
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
bill must be scary that was back when we

3447
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
were happy to have our 60 megahertz processor

3448
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
computer well yeah it was

3449
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
over 10 years it was before OLR started

3450
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
it was a while ago and there was his

3451
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
friend that had the PC

3452
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
built into a old metal

3453
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
toolbox nice that was pretty cool

3454
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
yeah that was that was pretty

3455
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
fun all right anyhow

3456
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
sorry to digress there a little bit

3457
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
but let's talk about let's talk about a

3458
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
classic game of sorts from

3459
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
another day here at Orange Laundry

3460
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
we used to talk about a lot pop

3461
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
in music remember pop in music

3462
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
if you haven't seen this game

3463
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
you know you know the board game

3464
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble right

3465
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
imagine a music

3466
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
game controlled with nine of those

3467
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
pop-o-matic bubbles that is what pop in music

3468
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
basically is and

3469
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
you might have seen this like it sometimes shows up in

3470
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
like if see Japanese arcades like there's a very

3471
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
famous scene in Lost in Translation that movie

3472
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
with Bill Murray that had pop

3473
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
in music in it I did that a couple weeks ago

3474
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
so yeah pop in music

3475
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
out there and it is coming to iOS

3476
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
that is the news

3477
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Konami has announced an iOS version

3478
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
of pop in music we don't know much more than that

3479
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
we're all just kind of crossing our

3480
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
fingers and our toes that it's not based

3481
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
off the Nintendo Wii U version

3482
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
and that it is far better

3483
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
than beat and groovy on the 360

3484
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
which was I want pop in music

3485
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I want pop in music

3486
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I hope it's good I hope it has the Goonies

3487
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
theme in it that's one game I will not get rid of

3488
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I had so much fun because you know what I played

3489
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
it was pop in music what's the last one

3490
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Party I got to play

3491
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
the gachamon theme and I was

3492
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
singing along with it and the lady

3493
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
running the place was like we're giving

3494
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
me a look because I knew the lyrics

3495
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
hey shut up I like gachamon

3496
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I remember there was

3497
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
a pop in music machine that was all anime

3498
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
music and they used to have it on arcade infinity

3499
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
yeah arcade infinity had that and then

3500
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I was playing cat's eye

3501
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
yeah nice

3502
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
that's right I forgot that there were

3503
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
licensed songs in pop in music at one point

3504
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
yeah it was really fun

3505
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
and oh the Yamato theme

3506
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
song

3507
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
well it came out over here

3508
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
wasn't the star trek theme in there

3509
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
randomly too? I think it was

3510
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
everything's been in that game

3511
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
everything's been in that game but I freaking love pop

3512
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
in music

3513
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
just traveling back

3514
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
through the past and so forth

3515
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I could do pop in music as a classic

3516
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
you could yeah I could

3517
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
but will I? I don't know I did DDR

3518
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
wait till we get to episode 573

3519
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
you need to hold off a little bit

3520
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
maybe alright

3521
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000

it's not exactly about games

3542
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
but it's up our alley Rob definitely up our

3543
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
alley hey OLR crew

3544
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
AZHP here I have a question that's not

3545
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
quite gaming related but that I

3546
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
know is not allowed

3547
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
hey hush you

3548
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
but I know is a topic near and dear

3549
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
to many of the OLR hosts heart

3550
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
many as in two of us

3551
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000

3556
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000

3557
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
of taking my girlfriend to Disneyland for

3558
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
anniversary in late November do it

3559
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I was wondering if you guys had

3560
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
any recommendation for how many days we should spend

3561
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
one or two two and whether or not

3562
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
we should get a park cop or pass or just go

3563
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
in one of the parks get to

3564
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
get your park

3565
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
offer trust me because yeah

3566
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
get it and which

3567
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
park is better in your opinion is

3568
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
quote better

3569
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
the main park if you have

3570
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
to pick one but California

3571
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
adventure has tons of fun stuff and the good thing

3572
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
is that when one side is

3573
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
busier usually the other side is a

3574
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
lot less busy and you can drink in California

3575
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
adventure which sometimes you need

3576
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
to get through the other park

3577
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
my honest my honest advice

3578
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
if your girlfriend's never been to Disneyland is that

3579
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
did I catch that in the email that the girlfriend had never

3580
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
been or hadn't been in a long time it doesn't say

3581
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
if either of you have not been to Disneyland

3582
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
in a very long time or

3583
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
you know you've never been

3584
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
take the two days to go so

3585
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
that way you can spend one day in each

3586
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
park type of thing Disney does have a deal

3587
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
it's not a park hopper per se but it's one

3588
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
day one park for like two days

3589
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
you know but again just kind of

3590
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I think the park hoppers are a little better for what

3591
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Jamie said you can hop literally hop from one

3592
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
park to the other but don't forget the California

3593
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
adventure ever since they finished their

3594
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
remodel with Cars Land

3595
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
and you know redoing some of the rides

3596
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
it is a premium it's not a joke

3597
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
anymore it's a premier park it's a

3598
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
fun place to go you can spend an entire

3599
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
day there easy the next thing in the email takes

3600
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
me to that point we are from San Francisco

3601
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
so the draw of an authentic northern California

3602
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
experience from Disney's California adventure is not

3603
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
a factor for us they're changing it well

3604
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
that's gone yeah don't worry about it because

3605
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
that I mean well like they have a

3606
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Ghirardelli shop in the wharf area

3607
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
but I mean they completely change like the thing to

3608
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
represent the palace of fine arts is now

3609
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Ariel's freaking grotto ride or whatever

3610
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
it's not what it used to be no it's not

3611
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
they even took down at the time it was the

3612
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
world's largest ceramic mural

3613
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
the Whoopi Goldberg movie is gone

3614
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
and that's saying a lot but definitely

3615
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
go see the Aladdin thing trust me

3616
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
go see the Aladdin thing it's awesome

3617
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
um I do

3618
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
like the toy story roller coaster

3619
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
shooter midway madness that's

3620
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
super fun just make sure to bring Advil

3621
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
because your arm will hurt when you're done

3622
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
and I like not if you're a guy

3623
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
no you should be used to that

3624
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
back and forward motion just

3625
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
maybe not no it is kind of low

3626
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
isn't it let's keep going with the email

3627
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
la la la la la

3628
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
and I like the one roller coaster

3629
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
that's in the dark and stuff oh there's a lot of

3630
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
easy ways to practice I mean

3631
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
you know what

3632
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
anyway I'd like to hear the host's thoughts

3633
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
and recommendation tell your girlfriend

3634
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
she might need to practice

3635
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
only if she's in to reach around

3636
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
stand across the room this poor emailer

3637
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
was not anyway I'd like

3638
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
to hear the host's thoughts and recommendations so I can

3639
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
start budgeting and planning this thanks and

3640
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
keep up the great work yours truly

3641
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
AZHP

3642
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
yes we actually

3643
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I took Dan to see Aladdin

3644
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
and I saw Bobby saying that you

3645
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
took him to see I did when we went

3646
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
after E3 I took Dan

3647
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
and I went to see Aladdin and we sat next to an

3648
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Australian guy and his son and his son

3649
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
was so adorable but we kept chatting with the guy and

3650
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
told him places to eat and that type of thing

3651
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
see Bobby and I did both

3652
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
parks in one day but he's been before

3653
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
and there's a lot of things that Bobby's

3654
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
like I don't need to do that

3655
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I don't need to do that like Bobby didn't want to do

3656
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
like the upside down roller coaster

3657
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
you know there's certain things on his list

3658
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
so there wasn't an upside down one

3659
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
at California Adventure there is oh yeah

3660
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
California but it's not even that bad

3661
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
it's so smooth

3662
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
my other suggestion would be if you and your girlfriend

3663
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
can kind of put out a list and you kind of find that

3664
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
you know there's

3665
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
some rides we don't really want to do

3666
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
maybe you can do them both in a day

3667
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
but I would say take the time to take it slow

3668
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
if you want to make it

3669
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
really romantic dude

3670
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
get some reservations at Carthay Circle

3671
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
or Blue Bayou

3672
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I think Carthay Circle is

3673
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
really good

3674
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
the food's really good

3675
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Blue Bayou is a classic you have to kind of decide

3676
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
if you really want to get laid do both

3677
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
well you know

3678
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I typically do Blue Bayou when I'm there for my birthday

3679
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
and lunch is cheaper and still

3680
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
romantic

3681
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
yeah and you get free desserts if it's your birthday

3682
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
at any rate

3683
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
actually

3684
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
this is what you should do

3685
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
get dessert reservations

3686
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
for Fantasmic

3687
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
have you ever done that?

3688
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
not for Fantasmic I've done World of Color dinners

3689
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
but for Fantasmic you basically have a big dessert bar

3690
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
and you get to sit

3691
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
and getting to sit during Fantasmic

3692
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
is the best part

3693
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
but you get like

3694
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
really good ice cream desserts

3695
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and cake and stuff

3696
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I went with Kristin and Megzy for that

3697
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
and it was fun

3698
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
alright we could have a Disneyland podcast but we better move on to the next email

3699
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
just talk to us later trust me

3700
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says

3701
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
OLR helping you get laid for

3702
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
520 episodes and counting

3703
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
last email

3704
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
greetings OLR

3705
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I decided to send you guys an email

3706
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
since you have been getting very few recently

3707
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I'm a long time listener and a second time emailer

3708
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I wanted to share my thoughts

3709
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
on Grand Theft Auto 5 and the PS3

3710
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
with you the game looks great and I have enjoyed

3711
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
the past games ever since GTA 1

3712
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
on the PC however I don't own

3713
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
a PS3 or Xbox 360

3714
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
so I cannot currently play Grand Theft Auto 5

3715
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
with the recent price drop of the PS3

3716
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
I am tempted to pick up one

3717
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
and it's 199 euro

3718
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
the one with the 12 gigabyte

3719
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
and flash storage but I am not

3720
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
sure if this is a wise purchase

3721
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
with the new consoles coming out the system is

3722
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
dying and money is tight as I'm

3723
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
saving it for a new PC for work

3724
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
do you think it is worth

3725
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
waiting for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5

3726
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
is there any indication

3727
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
that this time around there won't be a PC

3728
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
version they've already seen coding for the PC

3729
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I think there's going to be a PC version it's just

3730
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
not going to be right now

3731
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
on top of that you won't have to worry about graphics

3732
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
since you're saving up for a new PC right

3733
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
it would be

3734
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
interesting to hear your thoughts on the purchase of a console

3735
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
near the end of its life cycle but with new machines

3736
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
on the horizon is it still worth

3737
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
it because it is a blu ray player

3738
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
and does Netflix and all that

3739
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I mean yeah it's fairly cheap

3740
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I mean it depends on what

3741
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
your needs are you know you can build a PC

3742
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
that has a blu ray player in it too and does Netflix

3743
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
we have a PC hooked up to our

3744
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
TV right now at my house

3745
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
the only thing that we do not do

3746
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
on that thing is watch blu rays

3747
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
which we use our PS3 for

3748
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
so it's just a matter

3749
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
and you might even find system refurbs

3750
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
that are even cheaper

3751
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
so you'd have to check

3752
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I'm not sure that you've got craigslist

3753
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
but I'm sure that you've got

3754
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
thrift stores and the equivalent

3755
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
of flea markets

3756
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
places like that

3757
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
so you might even look into finding one

3758
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
at any other place

3759
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I would say too don't forget that this generation

3760
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
of consoles will not be backwards compatible

3761
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
with the upcoming

3762
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
you know what I mean the PS4 will not play

3763
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
PS3 games and the Xbox One will not play

3764
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
360 games I know there's

3765
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
the Gaikai rumblings out there and so forth

3766
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
but we haven't really seen that gel together yet

3767
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
we don't know what that's going to look like right now

3768
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
so you know something to consider

3769
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
if there are a lot of console games you do want to play

3770
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
out of this generation then go ahead and take the plunge

3771
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
and get one of the consoles because

3772
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
this is your chance although PC

3773
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
certainly there's a lot on

3774
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
you know of the stuff on PC I think you really

3775
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
have to evaluate where are the

3776
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
games I want to play

3777
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
and I think in that it's okay to assume

3778
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
in that case I will be able to play Grand Theft Auto

3779
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
5 on PC in a year

3780
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
can you wait an entire year?

3781
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I'm almost certain it's going to be less

3782
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
than that but

3783
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
we'll see

3784
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I guess it does come down

3785
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
to in the end how badly do you want it

3786
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
and how quickly can you recover the

3787
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
money that you spend on it

3788
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
me personally

3789
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
if something was coming out

3790
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
well you know what I'm not actually going to

3791
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
say that I've done it

3792
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I got a 3DS

3793
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
because I wanted to fucking play Animal Crossing

3794
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
and what did I do?

3795
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I asked around on the internet

3796
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
if anyone was selling their 3DS

3797
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
and lo and behold

3798
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
uh, sidekick was

3799
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
and so I

3800
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
bought his for two

3801
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
shout out for gamebooey.org

3802
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
two network cards

3803
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
and then we went right out and bought Animal Crossing

3804
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
and then Dan picked up

3805
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
the last

3806
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
fire emblem for the Wii

3807
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
so

3808
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I'm not one to talk

3809
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
freaking buy it

3810
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
you really do

3811
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
have to weigh out how badly

3812
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
do you want it and I'll tell you this

3813
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I've played Animal Crossing every day

3814
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
since I bought it

3815
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
which is saying something for me playing

3816
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
a game every day

3817
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
so if you're going to play Grand Theft Auto 5

3818
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
every day then you know

3819
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
it's probably a worthwhile purchase

3820
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
um

3821
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
and yeah you do get the benefit

3822
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
of a blu-ray player it's probably still a cheaper

3823
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
blu-ray player I think when Becky bought

3824
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
hers, my best friend

3825
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
when she bought her actual

3826
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
dedicated blu-ray player

3827
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
it cost her about maybe

3828
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
150 something

3829
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
dollars which would

3830
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
probably be less in euros

3831
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
but it only plays blu-rays and you're

3832
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
getting a game system out of it that does Netflix

3833
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
and does all this other stuff

3834
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
and like Rob said there's no backwards compatibility

3835
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
so

3836
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
weigh that and decide what you will

3837
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
so to continue with the

3838
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
end of this email

3839
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I love listening to this show on my commute to work keep it up

3840
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
thank you

3841
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000

Martin

02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
PS you should have Jim Sally as a regular guest

3845
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000

3846
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000

I want to go to Belgium

3851
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
you know what else we could do

3852
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
though if we were in Belgium Rob

3853
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
broadcast live from that emailers house

3854
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
besides that we could go

3855
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
we could actually cheaply travel

3856
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
and meet all of our friends that live in

3857
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Europe we could go talk

3858
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
to our official Swede

3859
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
we could go hang out

3860
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
with Sil we haven't heard from AK Ripper

3861
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
in forever I would love to do an OLR

3862
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
episode with Sil it would be amazing

3863
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
and then we can go find

3864
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Mr. Kidman didn't they used to have those

3865
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
contests like for MTV or whatever back in the day

3866
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
where like MTV would broadcast at your house

3867
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
if you want a contest we need to have like an

3868
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
OLR comes to your house contest

3869
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
whoever pays the most

3870
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
wins

3871
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I'll be a fun

3872
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
kickstarter thing I want to go to Europe

3873
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
let's do a GoFundMe

3874
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
OLR goes to Europe

3875
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
alright

3876
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
if that's it for emails

3877
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
yes all two

3878
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
of them I will tell you

3879
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
send more next time

3880
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
mailbag at

3881
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
orangeloungeradio.com

3882
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
if we don't get enough emails this next segment

3883
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
will only get angstier

3884
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
FUs of the week

3885
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I'm fairly pissy Rob

3886
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
why? cause of stuff

3887
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
ok so I have a list

3888
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
fuck you to my air conditioner

3889
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
because when I turn on the air conditioner

3890
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I don't want a face full of the inferno

3891
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I want a face full of cold

3892
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
thankfully it's cool enough outside

3893
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
FU I'm not gonna say FU

3894
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
because the rain made today a lot nicer

3895
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
but it rained for Sacramento

3896
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
for this time of year

3897
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
and we're going into our rainy season

3898
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
but it freaking rained and I was at Apple Hill

3899
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I was trying to enjoy myself

3900
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
instead I'm having to slog up

3901
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
a red muddy hill

3902
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
and then

3903
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I thought I was taking a picture

3904
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
of a pig's cute little tail

3905
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
no I took a picture of a pig taking a piss

3906
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
it's on my tumbler for any reason

3907
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
also FU to

3908
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
guys who want their woman to take care of them

3909
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
and not do anything to contribute

3910
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
of course FU to the other way around

3911
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
it takes an equal fucking partnership

3912
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
it takes two to make a thing

3913
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
go right

3914
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
well true

3915
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
if you are in a relationship

3916
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
don't expect a free ride

3917
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
do your fucking part

3918
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
I'm not gonna say FU

3919
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I'm gonna say FU

3920
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I'm gonna say FU

3921
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
if you are in a relationship

3922
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
don't expect a free ride

3923
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
do your fucking part

3924
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
okay

3925
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
it takes two to make it out of sight

3926
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
just

3927
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
FU to my throat hurting

3928
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I hate that

3929
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
that's annoying

3930
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
my FU of the week

3931
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
goes to

3932
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Thunder Valley Casino

3933
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
in Lincoln California

3934
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
fuck them

3935
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
and one of their machines ate it whole

3936
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
but here was the best part

3937
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I took my mother to go see Kathy Griffin

3938
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
at Thunder Valley Casino because my mom

3939
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
loves Kathy Griffin

3940
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
by the way FU to Kathy Griffin sorry honey

3941
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
you just weren't that funny

3942
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
like you're funnier in your bravo specials

3943
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I could tell we were being workshopped

3944
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
sorry hun just wasn't working for me

3945
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
you know the one time I saw George Carlin

3946
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
was on one of his workshops too

3947
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I've seen Margaret Cho on a workshop tour

3948
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
and it was like half and half you know

3949
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
so where was I

3950
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
oh yes my mom loves Kathy Griffin right

3951
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
so I want to take my mom out to something she enjoys

3952
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
and she gave me $20

3953
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
because she's like I want to help pay for the ticket

3954
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
even though the ticket was like $70

3955
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
so I want to help pay for the ticket I'm like okay

3956
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
so I took her $20 put it in a slot machine

3957
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
right in front of her

3958
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
and I was like your $20 is gone

3959
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
mom she's like Rob

3960
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
that's why you don't gamble Rob

3961
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
you should know better than to gamble

3962
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
you know what though I'm very sad

3963
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
that the buffet wasn't open for you guys

3964
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
it was open it was just very crowded

3965
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
the buffet there

3966
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
and for me who's not a huge buffet fan

3967
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
their buffet is fucking good

3968
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
but the coffee shop was good too

3969
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Alan took a picture of that burger

3970
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
and you know they do have fatburger there

3971
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
but my mom didn't want to go to fatburger

3972
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
my mom wanted to go

3973
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
and you know Rob

3974
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I don't want to eat at the buffet Rob

3975
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
people just cough and sneeze on everything

3976
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
that's how you get sick

3977
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
buffets give you diarrhea Rob

3978
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I adore your mom you know

3979
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
and your impersonation is hilarious

3980
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,000
did you see the vine I posted of my mom

3981
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I had to delete the tweet

3982
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Rob I didn't say you could put that on the internet Rob

3983
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
put it on tumblr

3984
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
she didn't say I couldn't play it on my show though

3985
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I'll have to bring that up

3986
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I'll bring that up later

3987
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
let's do a news story

3988
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and then I'll come back to this topic

3989
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
let's talk about the ever

3990
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
continuing saga

3991
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
and the Ouya Frida Games program

3992
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,000
well Ouya has removed one of the games

3993
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
from the Frida Games program

3994
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
and that would have been the one that was

3995
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Dungeons the Eye of Drakonas

3996
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
you know the one that they

3997
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,000
blatantly admitted that their family paid for

3998
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
you know the back

3999
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
or the backing of that kickstarter

4000
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
so they have been removed

4001
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and you know they of course

4002
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,000
saying oh appears we were thrown under the Frida Games bus

4003
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Ouya gets their fall guy and Gridiron keeps their money

4004
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
but the thing was though

4005
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Gridiron I don't believe

4006
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I believe they dropped out of the whole Frida Games thing

4007
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
they said they cancelled the kickstarter project

4008
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
or yeah they have no plans to develop

4009
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I guess on the Ouya or something like that

4010
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
because I remember they said they made a ton of

4011
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
they got a ton of backers as it was

4012
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
so they didn't need to develop exclusively on the Ouya anymore

4013
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and also on top of this

4014
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
the whole Frida Games fund has been tweaked

4015
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
now no longer will

4016
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
the games have to be

4017
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Ouya exclusive

4018
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
instead

4019
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:21,000
they are saying for every $10,000 in rewards issued by Ouya

4020
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
in matching crowd funding efforts

4021
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
developers will need to agree

4022
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
in one month of exclusivity

4023
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,000
but they could still publish on PC at the same time

4024
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,000
so they don't have to just launch on the Ouya

4025
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and then also they are saying that instead of $50,000 as a minimum

4026
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
the requirement is now $10,000

4027
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
so $10,000 and then for every $10,000 raised after that

4028
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
they will be backed

4029
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
another $10,000 I guess

4030
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
and they also have to have a minimum of 100 backers to be eligible

4031
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
is this going to fix the problem

4032
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,000
that this thing has been having or is this too little too late

4033
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I think it's too little too late

4034
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
and at the same time I still think people will try to game it

4035
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I mean because

4036
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
you know the gridiron thunder thing

4037
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I don't think the whole reason that they are saying

4038
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
oh we need funding to finish this game

4039
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
but the game is literally coming out in like two weeks after it's done

4040
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I'm sorry I just don't buy for

4041
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
oh we need that $100,000 to finish the game in two weeks

4042
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I could see like a game that's coming out like

4043
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
a year from now or something

4044
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
ok then you need the funding

4045
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
but if a game that's already pretty much done

4046
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
and they are just putting it out two weeks later

4047
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I think it was just to make up some money

4048
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
ok we have this really shitty game we made

4049
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
it's going to be an exclusive the Ouya

4050
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
but who gives a shit because we made our money back anyways

4051
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
from them matching our funding

4052
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
so I think that's what the scam was there

4053
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
and I still think that you can see that

4054
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
someone has a game that's ready to go

4055
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
and why not let's put it on Kickstarter

4056
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
put the goal at $10,000

4057
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
and if they can hit it

4058
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
they make another $10,000 on top of it

4059
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
and it could be a good game

4060
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
at the same time I think it could help indie guys

4061
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
but it's been exploited three times already

4062
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
so you know

4063
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I don't know

4064
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I noticed that you are selling your Ouya on eBay

4065
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
at this point and do you want to give a quick plug

4066
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
how somebody can get a hold of that

4067
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
you can follow me on Twitter

4068
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
it's just on eBay

4069
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
$32 right now

4070
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
yeah BlackWolf points that out in our chatroom

4071
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
at live.vognetwork.com

4072
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Loki's Ouya is only $32 on eBay right now

4073
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
and $32 with a

4074
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
there's still the unused code

4075
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
remember they did that stupid thing

4076
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
you're our elite

4077
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
you Kickstarter backers and we're going to give you

4078
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
$13.37

4079
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
store credit on the Ouya shop

4080
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
but they didn't use that store credit

4081
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
so that code is in there

4082
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
so really it can track about $13 off that

4083
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
so it's still a pretty good deal

4084
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
and it works

4085
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
once again

4086
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I don't have time for all this stuff

4087
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
and I need to slim down

4088
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
you know

4089
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
money is tight of course

4090
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
it happens

4091
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
especially this time of year

4092
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
alright can we go back to stories about my mom

4093
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
alright so we're at the Kathy Griffin concert

4094
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
and they're playing pop music

4095
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
and my mom doesn't listen to pop music right

4096
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
so she hears this song

4097
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
by Will.I.Am and Britney Spears

4098
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
have you heard this song?

4099
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
this is what's playing

4100
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
my mom hears this

4101
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
so my mom can hear this

4102
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
in the lyrics and she's looking at me

4103
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
because Alan's sitting in between us

4104
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
she leans over and she looks at me

4105
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
and she gives me that look

4106
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Rob, what is this song Rob?

4107
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
like you wrote the song?

4108
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
like I wrote the song

4109
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
and then there's a later part in the song

4110
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
where it goes

4111
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
you are now now

4112
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
it's this part

4113
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
oh shit

4114
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
live radio

4115
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
just play the part

4116
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
and when that came up

4117
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
my mom looked at me and goes

4118
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Rob did Britney Spears just call herself

4119
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
a bitch?

4120
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I think that was Britney comma bitch

4121
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
if it works like a duck

4122
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
right? so I decided

4123
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
so what do you do? you have to capture the moment live

4124
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
so I whip out my cell phone

4125
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
and I make a vine

4126
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
what do you think of this song?

4127
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
I think Britney Spears is a skank

4128
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
what's vine?

4129
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
oh you don't know vine?

4130
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
it's like twitter but with videos

4131
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
you can only do 6 second videos

4132
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and they loop

4133
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
so that's the vine I made

4134
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
is my mom's opinion

4135
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
on will.i.am and Britney bitch

4136
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
what do you think of this song?

4137
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I think Britney Spears is a skank

4138
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
if she knew I was playing that on the internet

4139
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
right now she would kill me

4140
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
she was so pissed that I uploaded that to twitter

4141
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
she was so mad

4142
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
she was so mad

4143
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
that I uploaded that to twitter

4144
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
no this was literally her concern

4145
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Rob

4146
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I don't want Britney Spears to see that

4147
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
like Britney follows

4148
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
like Britney follows my mom

4149
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I'm like Britney doesn't follow you

4150
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
well one of her friends

4151
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
might tell her

4152
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I think that she's been called worse

4153
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
right?

4154
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
and let's be real

4155
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
she is kind of a skank

4156
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
but she is entitled to be a skank

4157
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
if she chooses that

4158
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
it is her choice as a woman to be a skank

4159
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
to be free with her love

4160
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
she's also a mother

4161
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
and that's what feminism is all about

4162
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
the right to make choices

4163
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
and not be judged by the man

4164
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
or whatever

4165
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I wish I could show my mom

4166
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
all the love she's getting in chat right now

4167
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Act F says love Rob's mom

4168
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
gamer girl says hahaha

4169
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Rob's mom rocks

4170
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
she does rock

4171
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I hope we can get her on the show in the future

4172
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I adore your mom

4173
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
but I don't think your mom and my mom should ever be in the same room

4174
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
no they should not

4175
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
especially when my mom's on one of her pissy rants

4176
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
alright

4177
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
one more story tonight

4178
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
and then we're going to open up the skype line

4179
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
at 1877 game OLR

4180
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
or our username on skype orange lounge radio

4181
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
and this last story has to do about a game

4182
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I don't think we've talked about this a lot on OLR

4183
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
but I know a lot of you guys have played this

4184
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
here too

4185
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
it's called slender the arrival

4186
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
have you played slender man at all?

4187
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
you may have seen my livestream

4188
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I did on twitch right

4189
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
I remember them in super mario galaxy

4190
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
no no no no no

4191
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
this game is scary as hell

4192
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
and I literally screamed

4193
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
while playing this game

4194
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
actually I think slender the arrival is the sequel

4195
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
that has whatever

4196
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
well here's the thing guys

4197
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
it's about to get support officially

4198
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
for the oculus rift

4199
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
as if the game wasn't

4200
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
scary enough

4201
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
now you can immerse yourself in the world

4202
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
and become best friends with the fence like I did

4203
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
in slender the arrival

4204
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
yep it is

4205
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
officially getting oculus rift support

4206
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
apparently this was actually teased at pax 2013

4207
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
but this is something that is actually happening

4208
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
in a patch

4209
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
that just came out for the game

4210
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
it's like a beta mode there

4211
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
good luck with that

4212
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
so all I'm hoping is that maybe bobby

4213
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
maybe in a years time bobby

4214
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
will be a little more willing to

4215
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
subject his oculus rift to

4216
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
some other things

4217
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
so before I have the gummy bears

4218
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
maybe I can play a little slender man in oculus rift

4219
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I'm still waiting he got a youtube of me playing

4220
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
the oculus rift

4221
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
and I'm sure it's funny

4222
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
fifth dream

4223
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
to my bff friends

4224
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
it wasn't me it was my mom

4225
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
alright yeah but you made it where britney

4226
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
can see it rob not anymore

4227
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I had to delete the tweet

4228
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
we need to get my mom on the show

4229
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
it's still out there if you know where to look

4230
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000

4231
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
so there it is slender man on oculus rift

gemit which if you listen to horde house

4235
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I'm sure you've heard him he's contributed to the show

4236
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
a number of times he hosts his own show

4237
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
except it is also live on sunday night

4238
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
so unfortunately we're up against each other but

4239
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
gemit does some amazing live streams

4240
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
of oculus rift

4241
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
if you think I scream like crazy

4242
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
you should see gemit

4243
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000

02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
it's time to go to twitter

02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000

researching vacuum forming

4257
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000

02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000

4278
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
jmo1986

02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000

4280
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
game show 2013

4281
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
telling people I meet in line about

4282
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
olr and vog network and

4283
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
spreading the word

4284
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
you sir get a fast clap

4285
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
we ask at the end of every show

4286
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
if you like what you hear tell a friend

4287
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
or two about the show you are doing that

4288
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
you are a good man

4289
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
yes you do you get the official

4290
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
olr gold star tweet of the week

4291
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
we just made that up

4292
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
but you get it

4293
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
let's see

4294
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
act deft sends us a tweet

4295
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
developer way forward

4296
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
wants to make a my little pony game

4297
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
and rallies bronies

4298
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
to tell hasbro to make it a reality

4299
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
way forward

4300
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
of course made duck tails

4301
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
what they made contra 4

4302
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
some of their games have been a little hit and miss

4303
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
but more so probably hits than misses

4304
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
talk to act division because I think they're the one that has a hasbro license

4305
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
do they?

4306
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
least they do for transformers

4307
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
and they

4308
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
no wasn't skull girls able to get some my little pony

4309
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
stuff or was that no no it was like characters

4310
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
made by the same person

4311
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
it wasn't skull girls it was that

4312
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
the fighting is magic thing

4313
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
where they now it's something different

4314
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
yeah

4315
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I don't remember who has like the family party

4316
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
games now because it used to be

4317
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I thought it was act division

4318
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
then it was or EA

4319
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
and now it's Ubisoft

4320
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
maybe I don't know that keeps getting tossed around

4321
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
wow I've never seen quite a

4322
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
more polarizing tweet in our chat room

4323
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
blackwool says don't do it way forward

4324
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
spend your time on better projects

4325
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
and rama says fuck yes way forward

4326
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
it will happen mark my words

4327
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
and act dev says game loft

4328
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
has the mlp game

4329
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000

4330
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
if they can make

4331
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
mick kids they can make

4332
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
a fucking my little pony game I don't even care

4333
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I don't care there's been a my little

4334
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
pony game and I think it was on the Nintendo

4335
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
back in the day and it was the good

4336
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
my little pony the kind I

4337
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I grew up with so fuck it

4338
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
if they can make sneak king

4339
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
you go ahead with your bad self and make my pony

4340
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
where the fuck are my goddamn new 360

4341
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
connect games for burger king

4342
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
seriously that was promised to me like

4343
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
five years no not five years ago but like

4344
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
a few years ago

4345
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I'm very disappointed that there's not a follow up

4346
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
to sneak king because that was a fucking

4347
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
brilliant shit right there

4348
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
all right uh tiger claw says it's an

4349
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
interesting tweet uh Lucasfilm

4350
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
will combine video games and movies

4351
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
to act the post production

4352
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
process kind of

4353
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
interesting there I'm kind of reading

4354
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
into this too it's uh coming from

4355
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
a website he links us to the enquirer

4356
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
not to be confused with the trash you see at the

4357
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
checkout counter uh but this

4358
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
says video game engines will be

4359
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
used in filmmaking with the two disciplines

4360
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
combining to eliminate the

4361
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
movie post production process

4362
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
well this actually kind of makes sense you

4363
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
know video games are getting so realistic

4364
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
these days that I'm sure

4365
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
they can probably mix in

4366
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
you know some of the stuff

4367
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
they do with movies like in the engines

4368
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
really kind of ramp up the process

4369
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
with uh making some of this that'd be fun

4370
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
like you can move characters around

4371
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
in the movie and stuff interactive

4372
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
movies it's like using

4373
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
the force for real uh tiger claw

4374
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
also sends his tweet the playstation 4

4375
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
exclusive deep down

4376
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
set to be free to play

4377
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
or wouldn't it be even funnier if you could

4378
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
reskin the characters that are in the movie

4379
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
or something like that anything's possible

4380
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
I want Jar Jar to look stupider

4381
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
uh more stupid

4382
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
quickly before I go to the phones capcom

4383
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
announced to Tokyo game show 2013 that the

4384
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
playstation 4 exclusive deep down will be

4385
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
free to play uh you might remember

02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
this had come out at uh what was it E3

4387
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
or something they were showing that off so that's kind of

4388
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
surprising yeah so very cool

4389
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
uh more on that in a minute but first we're gonna go to

4390

people hating on the MLP game

4395
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
but okay I know it's

4396
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000

4397
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
yeah yeah well I'm not gonna

4398
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
talk about that I wanna talk about another thing

4399
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
alright something a little less controversial

4400
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
that's fine what's up Agdeft?

4401
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
kinda controversial uh

4402
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
but still

4403
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
uh people selling humble

4404
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
bundle games fuck those people

4405
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000

02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
bad especially when it's sorry

4408
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Agdeft I know it's your call but you got me

4409
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
going especially when it's

4410
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
oh man when it was all charity

4411
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
like that EA bundle was all charity

4412
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
those people that were buying the codes and

4413
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
selling them on eBay scum

4414
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
and then what when they got confronted it was just like

4415
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
well you know the demands out there so

4416
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
you know we're just you know people don't have to buy em

4417
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
bleh

4418
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
yeah I really hate those people

4419
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I even uh

4420
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
there's a Facebook group I follow

4421
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
uh it's a local group

4422
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
that sells or resells games

4423
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
and anime stuff and all that

4424
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
and there was

4425
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
one people there was a person that sold

4426
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
the origin bundle

4427
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
and like

4428
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
maybe four times

4429
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
the price he paid uh

4430
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
for all the games and I was

4431
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
like dude seriously

4432
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
those games were sold like

4433
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
for a fraction of the price

4434
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
you paid and they were

4435
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
especially they were all

4436
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
for charity so it's like

4437
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
what the fuck

4438
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
and now the same thing happened

4439
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
with another person

4440
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
in the same group

4441
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
she's selling the humble bundle

4442
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
the nine games

4443
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
and other

4444
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
bundles for like

4445
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
the original price and I'm like

4446
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
seriously what the fuck

4447
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
yeah I'm gonna admit Agdeft and I know

4448
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
some people do this but I'm just

4449
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
gonna say it even makes me uncomfortable

4450
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
when people just give away one or

4451
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
two codes you know I don't

4452
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
and I've called out other

4453
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
podcasts not by name but I've called out

4454
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
shows, podcasts,

4455
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
websites, blogs that

4456
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
give away bundle codes

4457
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
that are piecemealed from

4458
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
somebody else's bundle the games they didn't

4459
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
want and like it's

4460
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
one thing when it's between friends

4461
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
and so forth but you know

4462
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
let's not forget

4463
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
a lot of this money goes to charity

4464
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
and it goes to the developers

4465
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
when you piecemeal it like that you're

4466
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
kind of taking it away from them

4467
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
and it's like these bundles are such a great

4468
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
deal like it's just I don't know like I

4469
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I get really bothered by it

4470
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
I play devil's advocate though I mean sometimes like

4471
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
especially with humble bundle nine I know I have some extra

4472
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
games I need to give away I already

4473
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
have those games and like

4474
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I'm buying the bundle and I'm getting it anyways

4475
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
like and I can't I can't

4476
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
redeem it twice you know what I mean

4477
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
again it's one thing if you're giving it to a

4478
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
friend or you know somebody like

4479
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
even somebody like a Twitter follower that you know for

4480
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
a long time I mean that's kind of one thing

4481
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
but it's just like another to like use

4482
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
it to profit yourself

4483
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
and your own brand

4484
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
if that makes sense what I'm saying because I'm still like

4485
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
like follow this website and

4486
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
get a chance to blah blah blah

4487
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
you might you know you might

4488
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
still be like oh okay I'm unloading my free

4489
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
codes but if you think about it

4490
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
that why doesn't your friend that wants to

4491
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
take the code just pay five dollars

4492
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
to the site and have the

4493
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
four bucks go to charity or whatever you know

4494
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I don't see a problem if it's already over like

4495
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
that bundle is already done

4496
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
yeah yeah I'm I'm it's it's not

4497
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
as bad let me just let me just put this away

4498
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
I don't mean to be all like if you do this I hate

4499
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
you I'm not saying that at all

4500
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I'm just saying you know think about it

4501
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
shouldn't we be encouraging

4502
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
people to go buy the bundle themselves

4503
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
because eventually the money

4504
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
does go to charity right

4505
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
and especially in the case of the EA bundle

4506
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I mean one can argue like

4507
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
you know and I think Act Deft you had a funny story

4508
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
about this like you know I bought a bundle

4509
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
but I don't fucking want Fez

4510
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I am staying a hundred miles away from Fez

4511
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
it's that's

4512
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
kind of a different set than what I'm

4513
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
I'm talking about you know what I mean

4514
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
that the irony part of that is

4515
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
that I that I that I gave money to

4516
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
the developers and forgot to take

4517
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
out the uh the part of Fez

4518
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
so oh well no well

4519
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
yeah I don't think you can piecemeal it that way

4520
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I do get uh what you're

4521
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
saying because I I did it

4522
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
uh with my

4523
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
uh separate codes but I

4524
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
gave it to people that maybe wanted the game

4525
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
and I didn't uh like profit

4526
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
from it I didn't

4527
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
want more followers I didn't want

4528
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
more people to follow me on

4529
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Twitter or Facebook I guess

4530
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
hey who wants a code for

4531
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
this game and this game oh yeah

4532
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I want one and and

4533
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
some were uh close friends so

4534
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
I don't mind that

4535
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
but yeah like you said like

4536
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
oh follow me and

4537
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
get a code or something like that yeah that's

4538
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
that's pretty shit I don't mean to be

4539
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
like calling people out or whatever maybe

4540
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
maybe a little bit but because Bobby's in chat going

4541
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
I shouldn't give away my bastion code on the show

4542
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Rob hates me and I'm like no that's not what

4543
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
it is I don't hate you I'm just saying

4544
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
think about it this way

4545
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
think about it this way shouldn't we

4546
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
really be encouraging people to go buy the bundles

4547
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
and give the money to charity and so forth

4548
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
and then maybe after the fact you know a long

4549
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
time when when that's no longer an option

4550
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
maybe give away the the

4551
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
bastion code or whatever it is that I think

4552
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
is acceptable yeah you know if you're

4553
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I've got probably got duplicate codes for some

4554
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
games because I bought multiple bundles

4555
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
and I don't mind if it's a friend of mine

4556
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
giving away a code yeah and me neither

4557
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I usually just give them to Dan

4558
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
there you go so anyway

4559
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
sorry active I just want to clarify

4560
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
before the hate mail started rolling in

4561
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
oh well that that's pretty much

4562
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
it like I said

4563
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
even then I don't

4564
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
mind people giving away the codes

4565
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
it's selling them yeah for a profit

4566
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
that's yeah that's

4567
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
the really bad stuff if you're selling these on

4568
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
eBay if you're flipping this on eBay then

4569
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I hate you then it's okay to say that

4570
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Rob hates you I would I would absolutely

4571
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
hate you if you flip these on eBay for a profit

4572
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
so

4573
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000

about I would say six seven years

4622
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
now wow I think the reason why

4623
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I remember is cause um just

4624
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
one podcast I listened to and I don't know why

4625
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I remember this but it was like

4626
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
y'all's fourth birthday

4627
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
and uh

4628
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
I think at a certain point um

4629
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Dark Soccer had said like

4630
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000

02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
too except now she couldn't do it

4637
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
this year cause she'd have to put up a toe

4638
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
as well

4639
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I stick my nose in the air

4640
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
right so that's just how I keep tabs on

4641
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
how long I've been listening so it's uh

4642
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
it's great to finally call in this time

4643
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000

4644
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
cedar names or whatever you want

4645
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000

4665
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
obviously Grand Theft Auto 5 is occupying

4666
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
a lot of my time uh

4667
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
got it on PS3 since I've uh

4668
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
kind of chosen to boycott any

4669
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
type of Xbox related

4670
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
not Microsoft but uh

4671
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Xbox related um products but uh

4672
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
um yeah other than that

Borderlands 2 I know is

4675
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000

4681
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000

4684
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000

02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000

4700
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I'm fantasizing right now Rob

4701
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
CPK I haven't had

4702
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000

4705
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
a good week and then I can go alright we'll

4706
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
figure something out because honestly I'm in love with

4707
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
a pair of Gorgonzola pizza I

4708
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
like um

4709
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I like the barbecue chicken pizza

4710
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
but you can kinda get that at the grocery store I know it's not

4711
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
the same thing the Jamaican Jerk is pretty good yeah

4712
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
but but I'd say when I'm feeling extra

4713
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
trafe it's the shrimp scampi

4714
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
pizza with extra garlic

4715
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
alright now you're making me hungry

4716
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
damn you alright 1877

4717
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
game OLR our username on skype is

4718
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
orange lounge radio we can probably squeeze in one more call

4719
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
and you know I love the long time listener

4720
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
first time caller calls like yes

4721
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
sort of I think he said he called in once before but

4722
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I still love it's been a little while

4723
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
by the way but I love the regular

4724
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
if I said how many we were now I'd have to drop

4725
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
the mic there I'll do this

4726
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
we're this many

4727
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
I put it on the table they can't see you

4728
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
so unless I take a picture

4729
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
and then you'll get mad at me for taking a picture

4730
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
no then I'll channel your mom

4731
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
ah but I want that on the internet Britney Spears

4732
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
might see it

4733
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I don't want Britney's friends to post it

4734
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
as if Britney Spears gives two shits

4735
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
about orange lounge radio you know I had a friend

4736
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
that went to high school with Britney Spears really

4737
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
he said she was a total bitch

4738
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
alright I got a few more tweets

4739
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
here uh SSG100 Matt

4740
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
sent us a tweet about this I want to get your

4741
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
thoughts on these all in one

4742
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
classic gaming machines like the

4743
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Retro N5

4744
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
gaming purist friendly?

4745
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I've seen reviews

4746
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
of some of those the key word is

4747
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
purist and I'm going to say if the word is purist

4748
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
then no they're not gaming

4749
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
purist friendly because pretty much these

4750
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
things are emulators in a box

4751
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
and so they are going to have the slightest

4752
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
things wrong with them but if you

4753
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
just want shit tons of games

4754
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
in a box to play on the TV

4755
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
99.9% of people don't really care

4756
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
and so whatever go for it

4757
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
with the big problem with some of those

4758
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
by the way in reviews that I've watched cause Dan and I

4759
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
watch reviews for a number of those things

4760
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
typically it's sound cause keep in mind

4761
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
especially with the Super Nintendo it had that

4762
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Sony sound processor you're

4763
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
not going to get the same quality

4764
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
it'll come out sounding it'll

4765
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
miss sounds or something you'll be wrong with it

4766
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
just so you guys know on the

4767
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Retro N5 if you hadn't heard of this

4768
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
it has five cartridge slots

4769
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
look at that the NES

4770
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom

4771
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
the Genesis and Mega Drive

4772
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
the Famicom so you can play

4773
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
not only NES games but Famicom games and then

4774
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
they have a GBA, GBC,

4775
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
GB slot that plays all those

4776
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
games so Game Boy games on that

4777
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
as well and you can hook that up to the tele

4778
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
and play those games

4779
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
HDMI output that's pretty cool

4780
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
that makes me think of is there's

4781
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
this person Dan watches a lot

4782
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
of this one

4783
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Engineer

4784
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
who basically just like tries to build

4785
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
smaller portable versions of systems

4786
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
I forgot what his name is but there was another

4787
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
link from that channel of a person who

4788
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
built a

4789
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
like a 30 game system

4790
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
just by using the parts

4791
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
out of their old systems

4792
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
you know use the CDX bit to build

4793
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
all the Genesis bits and

4794
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
and had like this series

4795
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
to have it run off of one power

4796
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
supply and one hookup cable

4797
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
so they got

4798
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
I think one successfully working version

4799
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
of it but it ended up being some

4800
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
prohibitively expensive thing but it legit runs

4801
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
on the actual hardware

4802
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room

4803
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
at live.vognetwork.com says if you're really

4804
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
a purist you'll play your original game

4805
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
carts on a 300 pound 22 inch

4806
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
CRT TV from 1993

4807
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
you know what though

4808
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Alan brings up a good point with that and that

4809
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
is the one plus side about these

4810
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
systems is that it plays

4811
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
through HDMI port

4812
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
let's be real a lot of modern TVs

4813
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
you can't hook up classic game

4814
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
consoles to them you cannot hook up

4815
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
an Atari 2600 to an HDTV

4816
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
without some mega converters

4817
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
that will cause loss of quality

4818
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
that's why things like game room were so awesome

4819
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
I thought they had RF adapters for that stuff

4820
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
yeah but you're having to you have to change

4821
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
RF adapter into RCA

4822
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
you have to run it through a converter which in those

4823
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
things can sometimes be expensive

4824
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I don't have systems I can't play anymore

4825
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
but the Nintendo you can still use like even the

4826
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
original NES had RCA plugs

4827
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
but it was only yellow

4828
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
that's why you buy an old ass VCR

4829
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
and you hook it up through that

4830
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
well they actually

4831
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
do have a number of adapters now

4832
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Dan gets them at Radio Shack

4833
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
that are RF converters

4834
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
because that's how he

4835
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
gets his

4836
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Intellivision, not Intellivision I'm saying

4837
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
the Atari 5200 to play on

4838
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
flat screen monitors

4839
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
by using the HDMI hook up with an RF converter

4840
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
but we have one system that

4841
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
will not play on anything new

4842
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
and that's our Odyssey 2

4843
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
it is so old

4844
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
For the Fallen Dreams is in our chat room as well

4845
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
it says remember when channel 3 and 4 was the game input channel

4846
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Pepperidge Farm remembers

4847
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
I remember well because

4848
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
in Sacramento you had to use channel 4

4849
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
because channel 3 is a legit

4850
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
channel here, it's NBC here

4851
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
so you have to use channel 4 because

4852
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
you could never get a signal on channel 3

4853
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
it's noisy because of the

4854
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
KCRA

4855
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
3 was a used channel in Mobile

4856
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
but I would still use it because it would actually be clearer

4857
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
for my screen signal

4858
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
yes it's true

4859
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
there's a channel 4 in the Bay Area but the signal is very weak

4860
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
here in Sacramento

4861
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
but I would always get pissed off because

4862
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
my brothers would try to steal the remote

4863
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
and they were little brats

4864
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
well they're still brats

4865
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
but they're older brats

4866
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I will never

4867
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
forget being young

4868
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:41,000
and trying to get the channels

4869
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
from San Francisco

4870
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I don't remember why I was doing this

4871
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
but one time there was something

4872
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I really wanted to watch that the CBS channel

4873
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
here wasn't airing

4874
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
so I had to try and get the

4875
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
antenna just right

4876
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
I could get channel 12 out of Chico

4877
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
just right

4878
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
and it's like don't let go of it

4879
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
you won't be able to see the Charlie Brown special

4880
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
or whatever stupid thing channel 12 was airing

4881
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I had a fun day when I was sick

4882
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
and staying home

4883
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
now keep in mind the town I was born in

4884
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
is Dothan Alabama

4885
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
which is a good 4 hours away if you drive through Alabama

4886
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
it's like 3 and a half if you go through Florida

4887
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
so I was sitting

4888
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
going through the static channels

4889
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
because I would do that for fun

4890
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
don't ask I was weird

4891
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
porn

4892
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
no I was 8

4893
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
it doesn't matter

4894
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
and so one day

4895
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I managed the Dothan channel

4896
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
came through

4897
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
and I was sitting watching WGN

4898
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
that was the Chicago station that would get through

4899
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
cable but it was like

4900
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
whatever the Dothan station

4901
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
that I used to watch soaps with my granny

4902
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I was watching TV

4903
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
all day on the static ass Dothan channel

4904
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
and then figured out

4905
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
that if you put tin foil on your rabbit ears

4906
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
you can get a really

4907
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
good signal

4908
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
because at night they're allowed to increase the power

4909
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
so you can get stations from

4910
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
all the way to the midwest

4911
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
I think we can get stations

4912
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
I know we can get them from Colorado, Seattle

4913
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
we can get them on AM

4914
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
and I know where I get that from is my dad

4915
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
because I remember growing up my dad had one of those

4916
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
it was a radio that did the shortwave

4917
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
and he used to listen to stations

4918
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
out of the Netherlands

4919
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
and things like that

4920
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
not that he could understand it

4921
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
now we have internet radio for that

4922
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
well remember when OLR started

4923
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
on Live 365

4924
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
and we went to that award ceremony

4925
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
when they were kind enough to nominate us that one year

4926
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
and then forget to read our name

4927
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
a lot of the people we met

4928
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
in that community were all guys

4929
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
and girls that used to do like ham radio

4930
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
and that type of

4931
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
I never realized until that day

4932
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
how many people

4933
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
from the ham radio, shortwave radio

4934
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
kind of just naturally fell into

4935
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
internet broadcasting

4936
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
as a natural place

4937
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
well you know some of those stations

4938
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
that do the weird signals

4939
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking about

4940
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
there's one that's out of Russia

4941
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
that every so often

4942
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
dialogue would come across

4943
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
and it sounded like someone was just holding up

4944
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
a microphone to a machine that was going beep

4945
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
all day at a certain signal

4946
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
I listen to that because sometimes

4947
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
it's pretty fun and you can hear

4948
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
odd things going on in the background

4949
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
or the ones that give the weird frequencies

4950
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
or the ones that I'm interested in

4951
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
and every so often you can pick those up on shortwave

4952
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
as well

4953
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
alright, well that's going to do it

4954
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
nobody else is giving us a call

4955
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
and we are through all of our tweets tonight

4956
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
so I want to thank both our callers tonight

4957
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
and if somebody else had something to say

4958
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
be it live or podcast

4959
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
don't forget you can always email us

4960
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
mailbag at orangelandradio.com

4961
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
or you can tweet us like some of our listeners did tonight

4962
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
at twitter.com

4963
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
twitter.com

4964
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
it is definitely time to wrap up

4965
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
the show here

4966
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
I don't listen to the radio anymore

4967
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
in my car

4968
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I miss DJs

4969
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I think AM is still a good way to get traffic

4970
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I know we have it on iPhones

4971
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
and all that, but I still

4972
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
on the phones, all you can see is it's red

4973
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
and it's not always accurate

4974
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
because I think a lot of them are running off Caltrans

4975
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
reports, but when you listen to traffic

4976
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
on AM radio, they'll tell you

4977
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
we're flying over the bridge and it is backed

4978
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
up all the way to this point

4979
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
I like being able to hear that

4980
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
so when we drive to the Bay Area

4981
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
you better break out the Travel Connect 4

4982
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
you're going to be here a while

4983
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Alan and I listen to 740 a lot when driving to the Bay Area

4984
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
to get their traffic updates

4985
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
and I use my cell phone to listen to

4986
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
music for the most part because I have an iPhone

4987
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
yeah, I love Stitcher

4988
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
and all that stuff and podcasts

4989
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I just play my own stuff

4990
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
I actually have a playlist called Random Mix

4991
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
that's video game music

4992
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:19,000
anime, J-pop, and all the other weird crazy stuff I listen to

4993
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
well you know they are saying, it's funny we bring up AM radio

4994
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
they're saying that AM radio

4995
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
I saw a story on this this week or last

4996
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
on one of the big websites like Google or Yahoo

4997
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
that AM radio is kind of dying

4998
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
it's a dying art form

4999
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
because so many people have switched to internet

5000
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
and iPod and running that in their cars

5001
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
and so forth, which is great news for us

5002
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
and what we do

5003
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
but kind of a sad day

5004
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
it's the same thing that I run into

5005
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
being that when I

5006
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
picked my major

5007
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
my focus was print media

5008
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
as far as design for print

5009
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
when it's all

5010
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
really now print design is

5011
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
more of a

5012
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
special field now

5013
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
it's dying too, it's just sad

5014
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
because nothing smells as good as a print shop

5015
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
alright, we need to wrap up

5016
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
we can reminisce all freaking night

5017
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
and some of you might like that

5018
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
but I think it is time to wrap up the show

5019
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
thank you guys again for downloading Orange Launch Radio

5020
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
and checking out our show, we really appreciate it

5021
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
and you know what we say, if you like the show

5022
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
please tell a friend or two

5023
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
or five about the show

5024
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
talk about us in a convention line

5025
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
like somebody on Twitter did there this week

5026
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
help spread the word because that's all we've got

5027
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
we don't have an AM radio station

5028
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
backing us and putting ads out there

5029
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
or anything like that, so word of mouth

5030
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
is all we got, thank you guys as always

5031
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
for your support of the show, let's go around

5032
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
and get everybody's final thoughts tonight

5033
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
we'll start with you, your final thought tonight

5034
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
my final thought

5035
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
is I'm going to play more

5036
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
Grand Theft Auto

5037
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
that's a good final thought

5038
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight

5039
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
I hate Dreamweaver

5040
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
and my final thought tonight is that

5041
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
if you are in the Sacramento area

5042
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
you need to make plans on October 12th

5043
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
to come see the Rocky Horror Picture Show

5044
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
at the Colonial, starring yours truly

5045
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
well, co-starring me, but I will be in it

5046
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
so, there you go

5047
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
that's it

5048
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
we're done, we're out of here

5049
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
we'll see you next week, right?

5050
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
I sure hope so, have a great week everybody

5051
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
happy gaming, and we'll be back in 7 days to do it all again

5052
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
good night

5053
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
see you next week

5054
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
thanks for watching!
