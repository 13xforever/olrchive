Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio here on September the 15th of 2013 with the 519th episode of our show.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want people to buy my anime sales.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Slow your roll here. What are we talking about? You are digging through your vault and getting rid of some things. Last week you were trying to hawk Rare Games.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, which I'll still take 300 bucks for Final Fight Guy in the box with the manual.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And now what? It's anime sales.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Although I may have a buyer for my most expensive one, but I have two Beat X sales, two Fushigi Yugi sales, and the other one that I have up is Dragon Ball Z.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that what this show is for you? A place to hawk your wares?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes it is. No. But I would rather this stuff go to people who I know would appreciate it and that I would at least be able to see a picture of it from time to time.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, there you go.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, that was mine.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Alright. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Loki, what are you selling on this show tonight?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have DVDs on eBay right now, but that's about it.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's about it, huh?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Not really selling anything.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, as I mentioned, we are live here and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Probably an Ouya next week because I really don't play that anymore.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'd be selling your Ouya?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, I think so.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah. Boy, the Ouya's...

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think Dan would give you five bucks for it.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, I'm looking for a little bit more than five bucks.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The Ouya stuff, I know we have some stories on it coming up later, but it certainly seems like it's going downhill fast.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And what's wrong? What went wrong in Ouya town?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's just the support, the whole thing's been kind of mishandled from the beginning.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like even with just shipping, first shipping the Kickstarter stuff, there are some people that have Kickstarter that still haven't received their units yet.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, wow.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When that thing went to retail back in June and Kickstarter, you know, backers still haven't received their units, that's a little messed up.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then on top of that, how they handled this whole...

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are they sitting in a DHL warehouse somewhere?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Probably. It's probably some DHL black hole. I don't necessarily blame, you know...

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I would be so mad if I was one of those people.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I would blame them for going so cheap as to where...

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know, DHL is just the big problem right there, but the fact that you chose to use them, you know, that's not a good idea.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I mean, just use the, well, you know, the post office because you're shipping across, you know, the ocean, but...

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They had to be cost effective though. I mean, you know, a $99 system means you're gonna take some budget corners, right?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, that's still mishandled though. I mean, charge more for shipping then or something, or charge shipping.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know what you need to do, but yeah, this is really handled poorly and just their customer service is just terrible.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And on top of that, now with this whole, you know, free the games thing, it's just not working out to what they want it to be or what people want it to be.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's being abused and, as we'll get into later, they don't fucking care.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So what happens now to these other Android consoles? Do you think Ouya's kind of wrecked it for everybody?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Or do you think that maybe, you know what, there's a rumored Amazon console, wasn't there a Mad Catz?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't keep track of them all now.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think that a lot of it is gonna be, people are gonna be a little cautious about these micro consoles and stuff.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't think it's ruined it. I mean, definitely people are gonna be comparing any console that comes out to the Ouya.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But in the case of the Mad Catz console and stuff, that just plays straight up Android games that you can get on the Google Play Store and you can tie your Google Play account to.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I don't think they're really in that much trouble since it can be, you can basically map your controller to work with games that don't even use controllers and stuff like that.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I think that's kind of cool and that might end up working out for them.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then like the GameStick and stuff where they have their own stores, that might be a little bit tricky when they have their own marketplace and they're kind of separating themselves from everybody else because they want a piece of the money from the games they're selling on there.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know, it's just, we're gonna have to wait.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because right now, I mean really, there's only one console out there. It's just the Ouya, the GameStick, which was supposed to come out months ago, also been delayed and delayed.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's not coming out, I think, at the end of October now. So, I mean, then again, they announced that they were coming out in September, so by the time we get into October, they can announce November, who knows.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, I think, I don't know. I think the PSP TV, though, could be pretty good.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you think, well, before you, you mean the PS Vita TV?

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Whatever.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
PSP TV, I think, would be a little bit dated at this point.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, that's what people wanted, so you can do with that.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, yeah, that's true, whatever. Well, anyway, before you cut corners there, I was gonna say, a lot of people, I think, were predicting that this was gonna screw Kickstarter, too.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because, in a way, the Ouya, in these unfulfilled orders and so forth, were giving Kickstarter a bad name.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But then, you look at something like Mighty No. 9, and you're like, well, no way, Kickstarter still has a TARDIS team.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, no, there's plenty that they're doing to give themselves a bad name. It's not even necessarily this.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There's a lot of shady things that go on in Kickstarter that they just kind of allow, you know.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Like, I've mentioned a few times about that whole, like, you know, my nine-year-old wants to make an RPG, fund my project type thing, and how that was a big ol' scam.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Or, at least, it's very, it's heading in that direction quite quickly.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You know, and there's been a lot of other, like, scams.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And a lot of them even, like, with this Ouya thing, which we'll probably get into a little bit more.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, I heard about that Great Iron Thunder and stuff, and where it was being backed by family members.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, there was, like, 187 people backed it, and they had, like, or 193 people backed it, and they had, like, $187,000 raised.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, that's a little odd. That's way off of the norm as far as, you know, the percentages of backers.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then, legitimate projects that are also trying to, you know, be backed that same method, you know, that free games thing.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They're not even making their funding goals because they just, they're not cheating. They're going legit, and they just can't make the money.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know, $50,000 for a goal for, first off, for an Android game seems a little high.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean, and considering that they're doubling that budget when they match, you know, the funds, $100,000 for an Android game.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, that's, especially on the Ouya. I mean, you're talking, like, you know, I mean, there's some probably high-end projects on there,

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but a lot of these Ouya games are being developed by a team of, like, maybe one person to, like, maybe five, you know, very small teams.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't think you need $100,000.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think the tough thing, too, with these is that these sites are really about pre-ordering.

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's essentially, these are all pre-order sites, and if the rewards aren't good, I don't think people are going to buy into it.

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And some of the Kickstarters that I've seen fail just did, they failed because the rewards weren't adequately priced,

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and, you know, you've got to think about reward fulfillment.

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You know, obviously, Ouya was having some issues with that, and, you know, that can be a big pain in the butt, too.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The Kickstarters I usually see that are successful are usually these games that people want.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's something going to be tangible out of it. There's something that's going to be had.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, these send my nine-year-old to RPG camp or whatever aside, those are the few and far between.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think, unfortunately, a lot of these more charity quote-unquote things, you have to really catch on viral or it ain't going to happen.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I think there's a lot of wishful thinking out there. I had a friend just recently do an Indiegogo that didn't do so well.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I kind of think a lot of that was that the, I don't think he really pushed well enough what rewards were in it.

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, in Indiegogo, they've got weird stuff like Indiegogo, you can do the flexible funding, so where, you know...

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, that's why he did it, because he still got half of it, at least.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, you get money. Well, here's the thing, if you don't make your full funding, there's no obligation to do anything with that.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, if you get people convinced enough to where you can basically make some of the funding and they don't pull it out at the very end, free money!

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah, that's kind of scary. Alright, well anyway, we can talk about all these things all day long, but I want to get into games.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was going to do our gaming weeks, but before we get into our gaming weeks, obviously there's one game that I know Loki has been very excited about.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For a very long time, and so I want to ask Loki about Grand Theft Auto 5, because I know he finally got his hands on the game this week.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I guess I should say this first, it came to my attention that there's some sort of embargo out there for press reviews until tomorrow morning, 10 AM.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As an indie site, we are under no such embargo, we were not given a media preview copy of this game or whatever.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Thanks to Loki's industry connection, he has other ways.

106
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So if they want to avoid this in the future, they need to hook us up.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, there was a guy in Oakland selling some for $120.

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want to resort to silly blackmail. I know you're being facetious, but it's one of those things where it's like, fans of the game will find a way and some of these people work in the industry like Loki and can do that.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There's people that had it way before me. It's coming out of Gamestop and Targets and those people that are getting their pallets of shit.

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, that stuff way before everything else.

111
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Alright, so we're a whole 15 hours early, but you can't really do a full review of the game, right?

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No, I've only played like 8 hours of it.

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Alright, so tell us Loki's little preview of the game from your extreme fanboy perspective.

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Honestly, even though, yeah, I am a fanboy of the series and stuff like that, it is a fantastic game.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is, they have just taken, like Grand Theft Auto IV when I first played it was just a big like, holy crap, this looks amazing, that type of stuff.

116
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This, Ford has nothing on the, this is just ridiculous, the amount of detail that they have.

117
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And it's not just murky and kind of brown and stuff like Liberty City was, it's just, it's very vibrant and colorful and there's, you know, a lot more interactivity, a lot more detail.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Detail I think is the main thing there because they've narrowed it down so much, like there's tons of pedestrians walking around and they're not just doing, just walking, they're interacting with things.

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can hear conversations going on. There's, you know, tons of things to do in the game, just all sorts of stuff to see.

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like I've only played it for 8 hours and I haven't even been to most of the map in the game. It's just huge.

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And one of the things I do like about it though is the characters that they have created in it are great, they're very interesting.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And each one has like their own kind of stuff going on and then at the same time their kind of stories intertwine with each other.

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And so you kind of figuring out how, how that's happening because you have Franklin who's kind of this, you know, gangster guy that's trying to go legit.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He's just trying to get out of that life and stuff and just trying to make money, make an honest living I guess.

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then you have Michael who's this retired bank robber who's, you know, killed people and done all sorts of crazy stuff.

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then you have Trevor who's just fucking nuts. And so you have all these characters and how they interact and stuff. It's just, it's ridiculous.

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can we talk a little bit about the vastness and the things to do in the game because even in the short like 3 minutes I saw in the studio before we went live tonight,

128
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was like, wow, I can tell that the size of this game and the size of the continent that you're on is way bigger than previous Grand Theft Auto games.

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And you were in this plane and you were flying and I was really taken aback by the detail and the ground and that the city was in the distance and you could even see like the fog around the city.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Like it was very impressive looking for a current gen game.

131
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, it is very, I'm just amazed that they can do that on, you know, these current gen consoles. I mean, it looks really good.

132
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And even just like the details with, you know, as time progresses through the night and stuff when you're driving around, you know, at night people will be street racing.

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You'll see that going on. You'll see cops chasing after, you know, just cop cars going by and stuff.

134
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know, if you see a car or something like that crash or you catch a car and fire, you know, eventually the fireman will come and put out the fire and all sorts of stuff like that.

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But tell me, can you drive a piano?

136
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You can't drive a piano. That's just, that's a mod.

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But can you drive to Pianu?

138
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But they've got like, for example, they have the Santa Monica Pier or their version of it and it's got a roller coaster you can go on.

139
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It has, you know, the Ferris wheel you can go on.

140
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
One of the missions you had to be a play as Michael, your daughter was hanging out with these, you know, porn directors and stuff like that.

141
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And they thought that she's going to go shoot porn.

142
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Gasp! Gasp! Pornography!

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And so he dives off the pier to go swim to their yacht that they're on.

144
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And of course, you know, the water looks amazing compared to like four.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's just, it's so detailed.

146
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And when you dive in there, I forgot, oh, hey, that's right, there's underwater.

147
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's just, you know, this huge underwater area that you can see and just the detail in there.

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And there's sharks. You can get eaten by a shark. That's actually an achievement.

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Is there a sharknado?

150
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There's not a sharknado.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wait for the DLC.

152
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There's all sorts of animals, though.

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's a deer in one of the, the first mission you play as Trevor that runs out in front of your car.

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And I tried to miss it both times, but it's scripted that it'll hit your car.

155
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm trying to think about some of the other crazy stuff.

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You know, they have the strip club and stuff.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, I heard it took you no time to find some titties in the game.

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's full frontal or topless women in the game, unlike the pay season four.

159
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, straight up boobies in this one.

160
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And, and they even have a little mini game portion of it where you're supposed, you can touch the strippers while the, you know, secured, the bouncers aren't looking and stuff like that.

161
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can you invite someone in for some coffee?

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If, if you, you can, you can get them, you can do a booty call with them.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, if you want it later on.

164
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, of course, you know, the same, the prostitute stuff is.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What else did I do? There's one, one portion of the game where Michael takes drugs and he has this massive trip where he sees aliens trying to abduct him.

166
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And so he has to take him down the minigun.

167
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There was a funny thing that was done with this website.

168
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's like a Facebook type thing, life. It's like a life stalker or something like that.

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
How appropriate.

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And you have to infiltrate their headquarters in order to sabotage something. And it really goes weird.

171
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But do we, do we still have the classic Grand Theft Auto mainstay? Are you still allowed to get the services of a hooker and then kill them?

172
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, of course.

173
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So are there male prostitutes and male strippers too?

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

175
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
See? Patriarchy.

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No, I'm serious.

177
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But, but to, to your, to be fair, though, there is male full frontal nudity in the game, but not full frontal female nudity in the game.

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So we get Wang.

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

180
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's patriarchal. That's, that's unfair. It's matriarchal. In fact, it is.

181
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, we could use a little bit more matriarchy, OK?

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But yeah.

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No, I do agree. To be serious, I do agree. Fair is fair.

184
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But one of the first things I did was I, I stole a jet from the airport and I tried to land it on a highway and I accidentally hit a billboard and crashed.

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The second time I did that, though, I did actually manage to land it.

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's just, there's gonna be a ton of stuff to do in this game.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're saying already 100 hours, at least, of gameplay in this and I could, I could definitely see that.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's interesting. The storyline is great.

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And plus, if you just don't want to do the storyline, there's so much to do and there's so many activities and just stuff to fuck around with.

190
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There's some characters from Grand Theft Auto IV that do make a return.

191
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
In fact, you know, I don't want to spoil anything, but there is one character in particular from IV that meets his untimely demise, the very first mission of Trevor's, you know.

192
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So it gets interesting.

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing here because I'm watching our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

194
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And of course, Dr. Sakura was in there going, you know, when are we going to get our game with male strippers and prostitutes?

195
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then, oh, never mind. Never mind. Never mind. Y'all, I'm fine. We got cock. We're good. I'm good. I'm good.

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There's cock and boobs. I'm happy. There's equal representation.

197
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
OK, so if you want a game that has male prostitution in it and Saints Row 2.

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Saints Row 2 has whoring as a side mission. You can whore as both male or female.

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So you can man whore in that or, you know, all sorts of stuff.

200
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
See, I would have to make like a special man whore.

201
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
All right. Look, going to our chatroom for some other comments, live.vognetwork.com.

202
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Alan Alchemy says Grand Theft Auto IV was too bleak. The story was great, but it was all very super serious.

203
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hopefully Five injects a tiny bit of the insanity we've come to love from Grand Theft Auto III and Saints Row.

204
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There's a lot of these people that you meet on the street, kind of like the stuff in Grand Theft Auto IV.

205
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We can meet like these random strangers and do things they call them.

206
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's like freaks and strangers missions or something like that. And there's one that's a member of the paparazzi.

207
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And so this first thing you're doing is you're riding the first mission you have with him, you're riding or driving a motorcycle.

208
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He's taking pictures on the back of the motorcycle, trying to get like crotch shot of some celebrity or whatever.

209
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The second one is you find out, oh, hey, this one celebrity is really into anal sex.

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's go take a picture of her having anal sex in her backyard. And so, yes, that's what you do.

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You sneak up on her. You take a picture of her having you record her having anal sex.

212
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then she comes and chases after you with her boyfriend. She's like trying to run you down with her car.

213
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's like a Paris Hilton type.

214
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's that's that's not so much like insane, like Saints Row, Saints Row IV or whatever.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's just you nasty. Like Grand Theft Auto V, what you're describing is just you nasty.

216
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dungeon Busters said in chat that an adult game that's actually adult, but fifth dreams retort.

217
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Not an adult game would entail not being able to pay your bills, access your pregnancy and your car breaking down on the way to work.

218
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's not entirely graphic. It's just, you know, her pants are down. The guy's pants are down and there's something going on.

219
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I mean, you can't see anything. It's not like, you know, very detailed.

220
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I believe you said anal sex.

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's also dog sex in the game.

222
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why do you keep bringing up anal sex on the show?

223
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes, the first mission that you have, Chop, he has sex with a dog, too. So.

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, my God. You're nasty.

225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's dog sex because there's two dogs.

226
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, that's why you can put that on the back of the box.

227
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
My review, you like dog fucking.

228
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're like Grand Theft Auto V along with Raven, of course.

229
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know, you're nasty. It's a great game. It seriously is.

230
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, all strange is society. It's great. It's got a bunch of really interesting characters.

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Tiger Claw in chat says, I heard you can also smoke weed in Grand Theft Auto V.

232
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes, you can.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Does it lower your heart rate and decrease depression?

234
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, it doesn't really do anything other than, you know, trip up the screen for a little and he talks like weird stuff.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He like spouts off weird like ideas like they should forget something about the Internet he was rambling on about.

236
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But so reading the Internet drove him to smoke weed. Not surprised.

237
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's see. D'Artatia says, so is this Loki's game of the year?

238
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Probably. Yeah, it's most likely it's it's really, really good.

239
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I mean, I've only played eight hours of it yet, so I don't know.

240
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, a lot of the missions that they're showing off, like, you know, talking about in the press, I haven't really gotten to yet.

241
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But so far, it's been interesting.

242
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I did the first heist mission, which was fun, and I don't know, it's just it's going to be good.

243
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And I know tomorrow you're going to see a lot of perfect ten views or at least high nines.

244
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
High nines, perfect tens. I guarantee it.

245
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And a couple dog fucks.

246
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, dog fucking lovers have been so underserved in the gaming community.

247
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, now a game for y'all. You nasties.

248
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let me ask this question.

249
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I also saw a GIF on on Reddit where it shows Franklin running up to a cow in like a field.

250
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He kicks over the cow. So there's all sorts of like animal violence and stuff in this game.

251
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, I'm sure animal violence is hilarious, Loki.

252
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's a fake. It's not real.

253
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OK, I'm not saying go kick a real cow. It's it's fake.

254
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's a digital cow. All right. Digital violence is OK.

255
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Which actually that does lead me to something.

256
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Go ahead.

257
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Did you see I reposted on my Facebook a while back, but Fox News put up a poll.

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Do you think that violent video games cause violence?

259
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was all over the Internet. Yeah.

260
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, yeah. But it was like 90 percent of the responses was no.

261
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, yeah, but that's because 4chan, I'm sure, did something to the poll.

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like when I looked at it the first time, it was a little more even.

263
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When I look gives two fucks what some Internet poll has to say.

264
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But just wait for all the news to come out after this.

265
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You know, thank you for that was the point I was getting to.

266
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, is I, you know, usually bring up something to make a point.

267
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The point I was getting to is that I wonder what they're going to say after,

268
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you know, the game is officially out and there's reviews of it and say,

269
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
well, our poll was skewed because that game man came out yet.

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And maybe you can.

271
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm picturing a meme in my head with the Game of Thrones guy where it says,

272
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Brace yourselves.

273
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Cable News gets Grand Theft Auto 5 this week or something like that.

274
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Now, now, now. This is Cable News.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We won't be talking about Grand Theft Auto 5 for like another 10 years.

276
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They'll realize it, you know, after Grand Theft Auto 7 comes out.

277
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 is super viral.

278
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Abor, abor, abor, abor.

279
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You can also drive a riding lawnmower in the game, which is awesome.

280
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can you re-

281
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But not a piano. What's up with that?

282
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Because pianos don't drive.

283
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have seen, for real, a motorized piano. Thank you.

284
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Can you reenact scenes from The Happening?

285
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Plants do not attack you, as far as I'm aware.

286
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What? No!

287
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But, but I do hear, because I've been reading a lot of Reddit,

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I do hear, though, that there is possibly, because what, they,

289
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
here's the great thing about Grand Theft Auto.

290
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is how you do an homage to your older games.

291
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
All the cheat came, all the cheat codes from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
work in this game, by the way.

293
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Huh.

294
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Which is awesome.

295
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Some people could care less about the story.

296
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They just want to run around and kill people.

297
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
They did, like, a lot of the things that, you know, there's all these, like,

298
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
there's a killer in the woods, you know, in San Andreas.

299
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know, that was one of the big myths of San Andreas.

300
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And now I think they did put that in there as an Easter egg.

301
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
All right.

302
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let me ask one more question, then we'll get into the rest of our gaming weeks

303
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and the games that Jamie and I have been playing this week.

304
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Since we are talking about another game from the same generation,

305
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4 is from the same generation,

306
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but the way you describe Grand Theft Auto 5,

307
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and from what I've seen, really makes it sound like it pushes things so much further.

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What do you think really changed to allow Grand Theft Auto 5

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
to push the boundaries in ways that Grand Theft Auto 4 apparently didn't,

310
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
even though at the time we thought it was pushing the boundaries?

311
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know, I'm surprised at how they were able to do it.

312
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They must have really gone through and just tweaked the shit out of their engine,

313
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
because they've gotten in a way now where they basically have made it,

314
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
okay, listen, we can make this map as big as we want it to be.

315
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know, storage being the only limitation.

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Storage and, I guess, RAM.

317
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But the detail is ramped up so much from 4.

318
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
There's, you know, first off, there's animals in there.

319
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There's a ton more cars.

320
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The detail's a lot bigger.

321
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's more colorful.

322
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
There's a lot more to do.

323
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They have this whole ambient soundtrack in there

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
for when you're not listening to stuff that actually is contextual to what you're doing.

325
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's more animations.

326
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
There's just a lot more better AI.

327
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They've basically taken every aspect of Grand Theft Auto 4,

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
split it all apart, and improved upon everything.

329
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You know, combat in the game is a lot better.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
One of the things I did notice, I have run into a couple glitches.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Let's be honest, there were a few glitches.

332
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I ran into one where I was using Franklin's special ability,

333
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
which slows down time when you're driving to be able to maneuver quickly.

334
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I hit a fence in a certain way that when I undid the,

335
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
or when I turned off the power or whatever they had,

336
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
it flipped my car upside down.

337
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I got stuck on top of a fence, which is kind of funny.

338
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then there was another one.

339
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It was one of the other things.

340
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, I used to be able to run and jump and grab onto a wall and stuff like that,

341
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
but a lot of times it doesn't quite work the same way in 5.

342
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And so you'll end up running to jump to grab something,

343
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and instead it'll kind of flop against the wall and slam into the wall,

344
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
which is kind of funny.

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But I don't know. It's just very...

346
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If you've played 4, you just need to check out 5,

347
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and it's going to be very obvious what they've done.

348
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's just improved kind of all around.

349
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm pretty sure anybody who touched 4 is probably making their plans to get 5.

350
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But here's the thing with 5.

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I think even just in sandbox games in general,

352
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think this is a good example of what to do.

353
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There's a lot of improvements with just...

354
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Even though the world could be the same size,

355
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the city is bigger, but it just seems a lot bigger

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
even in the same amount of space that they had before,

357
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
just all the detail that they packed in.

358
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I lied. I thought of another question before we get to gaming weeks,

359
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
because before the show, TigerClod sent me this link

360
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
wondering if we were going to talk about it tonight,

361
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and I thought now was a good time to bring it up.

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There's an actual petition on change.org

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that quite simply says to Rockstar Games,

364
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
don't make a PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5,

365
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and the title of this is,

366
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So PC Gamers Learn Their Lesson and Stop Stealing Games.

367
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That is the most stupid thing I've ever seen.

368
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
How are most people playing Grand Theft Auto 5 right now if they're not in the press?

369
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
They probably stole it, so...

370
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Playing it on PC has nothing to do with the ability to pirate a game.

371
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I always thought the allure of PC was, well, for one,

372
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
some people like the keyboard and mouse and some people like PC,

373
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
but modding is huge on PC.

374
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, you've got people like me who have problems with controllers.

375
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Loki, care to comment?

376
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
There will be a PC version at some point.

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There will be a PlayStation 4 version at some point.

378
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's already leaked out. It's in the configuration files

379
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
that they make reference to that stuff.

380
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So it's coming. It's just they haven't announced it yet

381
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
because why would you cannibalize your sales

382
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
for this current gen?

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It'll come out maybe a year later.

384
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
With DLC or something.

385
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The thought was before, they were saying,

386
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
oh, well, you see, the PC version came out later for 4

387
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
than it did with...

388
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I guess it came out later for 4 than it did for Max Payne or something.

389
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well, yeah, because 4 had an exclusivity thing on it

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
where it only came out on Xbox at launch.

391
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And then later on, once that exclusivity ran up,

392
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
then it came out on PlayStation 3

393
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and that's when the PC version came out as well.

394
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So with that not being the case anymore,

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I think it's just going to be that they're going to wait

396
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
for some systems to sell

397
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and they're going to wait for the sales to start dipping down a little bit

398
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
because why would you say,

399
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
oh, yeah, by the way, the PlayStation 4 version's coming out

400
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and no one's going to buy it because they're going to buy a new system?

401
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Brad from Pod Culture asks,

402
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
now will Grand Theft Auto 5 be one of those $9.99 upgrades?

403
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No way, Jose.

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean, the $10 upgrade stuff is mostly for stuff this year anyway.

405
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's to encourage people to make the leap sooner rather than later.

406
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So a game like Grand Theft Auto 5 kind of doesn't need the upgrade program.

407
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It'll sell.

408
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Also, if I may,

409
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I would like to encourage people not to use change.org

410
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
because they sign you up for 50 million mailing lists

411
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
every time you sign a petition.

412
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Unless you're going to sign this petition, then by all means go ahead.

413
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No, if you're going to sign this petition,

414
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
then just don't tell me about it because I'll probably berate you.

415
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's see.

416
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Going to our chat room for more comments,

417
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
live.vognetwork.com, Datatrack says,

418
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
is it sad that all I really enjoyed was the electronic music

419
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
from the old Grand Theft Autos?

420
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, that makes me think, how's the soundtrack for the game?

421
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's pretty good.

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I also like the electronic music,

423
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I haven't really been messing with the radio stations

424
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
because I forget, I think there's two electronica stations,

425
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
but I can only find one of them.

426
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I do like how they change the way you do the radio stuff.

427
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Now you hold down a button and then you select it from a,

428
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
there's like a radio selection that you select it from.

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But yeah, there's a lot of music in the game,

430
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
a ton of music.

431
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think there's like 15 radio stations in it.

432
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And even, like I said, when you're not listening to the radio

433
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and you're just in a mission and stuff,

434
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
the contextual soundtrack that they have in there is really nice.

435
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And plus, the other thing too is if you're sensitive to the N-word,

436
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
you might not want to pick up this game.

437
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Just saying.

438
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Well, all the other games kind of use that word

439
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and other provoking words.

440
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yes.

441
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There's a lot of, you know, because of Franklin's missions and stuff,

442
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
it has to do with gang banging and stuff.

443
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So, I don't know, it's just interesting.

444
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Seriously, check out the game.

445
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I love this.

446
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
My phone just went off on Twitter.

447
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I just got a tweet.

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I retweeted it so you all could see there.

449
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
A tweet here from Marcus Boi, B-O-I, on tweet.

450
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It says, Grand Theft Auto 5, you nasty addition.

451
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And look at the box art.

452
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Look carefully.

453
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's inserted there in the corner.

454
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, our listeners rule.

455
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's awesome.

456
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Thank you for that.

457
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I needed that.

458
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Alright.

459
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Is that all we're going to say on Grand Theft Auto 5 right now?

460
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That's fine.

461
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sure you'll talk about it plenty more in the coming weeks.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yes, plenty more.

463
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
When you have more time to get your hands on it.

464
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And how was your gaming week?

466
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Dark Sakura.

467
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What other games have you been playing this week?

468
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Final Fantasy XIV.

469
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm almost 21.

470
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They finally fixed my account.

471
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm so happy.

472
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I played Animal Crossing.

473
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You didn't have to call them and get on them either.

474
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
No.

475
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It just magically happened in the middle of the night.

476
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It just happened on Monday.

477
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What they were doing is they were actually handing out other

478
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
basically, like, for people who had the collector's edition,

479
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
they were handing out new collector's edition codes

480
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
so that you could put it on the proper account.

481
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then they said they would close whichever one was inactive.

482
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So I actually went ahead and closed the inactive account myself

483
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so that my characters would be okay.

484
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I played a little bit of Dragon Age Origins.

485
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going to be starting over on that one

486
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
just because I really do not like how my character turns out.

487
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And I kind of... I was really...

488
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I felt nauseous playing through the female city elf thing.

489
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I was just really nauseous.

490
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't want to finish the character.

491
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And what else did I play?

492
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, yeah, I played some more Fractal,

493
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
which Fractal is my game that I don't really...

494
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I mean, I care if I beat the level or not,

495
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
but it's one that I don't mind the challenge

496
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
because I'll get so close.

497
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's really a difficult game

498
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
once you get up into the higher levels.

499
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And I am just short of beating level 20,

500
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
which I'm pretty proud of myself for making it that far

501
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
because there really is a lot to keep track of in that game.

502
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Also, one of our listeners gifted...

503
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I thought we were all gifted with a copy of Don't Starve,

504
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
but it came on my account.

505
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't think I got that.

506
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oops.

507
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's fine.

508
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Well, one of our listeners gifted me with Don't Starve, then.

509
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So I haven't started it yet, but it's installed.

510
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Okay.

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I wanted to check that out,

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so when the whole lending thing that we'll talk about later comes into play,

513
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'll have to check that out.

514
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
See, that's a really good thing

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
because for all of us who are into different games,

516
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that gives us a chance to review everything.

517
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Or was it today?

518
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Because I haven't checked today.

519
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
No, it was a couple days ago.

520
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay.

521
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I was actually just half asleep, heard my email beep, and checked.

522
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I was like, oh.

523
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
No, actually, I just want to say a big thank you to...

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well, A, I want to thank all of the listeners

525
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
who take the time to listen to this show every week

526
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
because it often kind of comes to light how many of you there are

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that maybe aren't actively participating with the show,

528
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
but that are just listening,

529
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
whether it be on Stitcher or Apple Podcast app or whatever.

530
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So I just want to say thank you for listening, for one.

531
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But B, those of you guys that take the time and money

532
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to actually buy us a game is such a cool, unexpected, nice thing.

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Actually, one of our listeners, Codeman, got me out last this week,

534
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
which is supposed to be a super scary game.

535
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I think it's to egg me on to do a playthrough on Twitch TV

536
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
to do a playthrough of that.

537
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But I just want to say I'm always very humbled by the generosity there.

538
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, hopefully this week I'll have a chance to give it a better play

539
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
just because I've got nothing to do except school.

540
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And now all the major holidays are over, thankfully.

541
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And there's also...

542
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Now, it's not a game, but I don't know if I've told people about it.

543
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I might have mentioned it.

544
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's a neat little app, is what it is.

545
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And I've been playing with it.

546
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's called Art of Glow.

547
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And basically all it is is you draw and it animates everything

548
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that you draw in different colors.

549
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You can change how it does.

550
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But I've actually been making kind of a game with it

551
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
by seeing how I can control the colors on it.

552
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's actually just a fun little waste of time.

553
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But it's not a game, per se.

554
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's just a neat thing.

555
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So I've been telling people about it.

556
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's called Art of Glow.

557
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Is it free?

558
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There's a free version, I believe.

559
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And then that Final Fantasy XIV Libra came out,

560
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
which I've been playing around in.

561
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes.

562
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I do like that on Final Fantasy XIV,

563
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
every free company or whatever has a forum on the official thing.

564
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If you go in and look, you can actually look at everybody's little character.

565
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So I guess I should plug real quick,

566
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
if you are playing Final Fantasy XIV and you want a free company to join,

567
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
you probably would have to roll a new character

568
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
unless you're already on Midgarcimer as a server that we play on.

569
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But we do have our free company there.

570
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's called End of Line.

571
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And it's been active, and we're already rank 5 or whatever.

572
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Shane's really good about getting that 5% experience boost perk every day.

573
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So yeah, it's good.

574
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah.

575
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We're having a fun time.

576
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm actually on my third dungeon.

577
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Nice.

578
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So when people want to run it with me.

579
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Not to sound, but I lost count.

580
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think I'm on Dungeon 11 or 12.

581
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But it's nice that they have all that to kind of keep you going.

582
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So it's good.

583
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Well, and I like that actually people who are higher level

584
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
can go back and play with people who are lower level.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh yeah.

586
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Instead of, you know, just...

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That was a big annoying thing about WoW,

588
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
is that if I had friends at different levels, I couldn't...

589
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Right. No, that is great.

590
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because yeah, and I totally...

591
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, I think I did help you run a dungeon the other night, right?

592
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So even though...

593
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You grabbed my first two with me.

594
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, so even though I was level like 35 or whatever,

595
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I was able to kind of level sync down to where you were at.

596
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And it wasn't a face roll thing.

597
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It was actually still challenging.

598
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I had to be alert.

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It wasn't necessarily difficult, but it was still, you know, a game.

600
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And right now, you know, like, because I've had high holy days

601
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
this past, you know, couple weeks,

602
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and I've had that crap with my account going on.

603
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So for me, I actually feel like I'm starting to catch up a little bit better, you know.

604
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But it was still nice that, you know, I can do that to play with folks.

605
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Which I would say I hope you had a happy holiday,

606
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
although I know it's not really happy.

607
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So I hope you had an insightful...

608
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
An easy fast. Nope.

609
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
An easy fast. That's what they... Okay.

610
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
For Yom Kippur, don't tell...

611
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Okay, everybody who does not know anything about Judaism,

612
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
never tell someone happy Yom Kippur because it's not a happy holiday.

613
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You fast for 25 hours.

614
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That alone does not sound happy.

615
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
With no water or food.

616
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh my gosh.

617
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Because you're supposed to afflict yourself.

618
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh.

619
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And, you know, no...

620
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And this also was on Shabbat, so it was like no internet, no nothing, no work.

621
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
No fun.

622
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But you spend the day basically being apologetic and introspective.

623
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So if you want to wish somebody something, you can tell them Shana Tova,

624
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
you know, good new year, because it's right after Rosh Hashanah,

625
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
you can tell them to have an easy fast.

626
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And that would be a pleasant thing to say.

627
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Can I tell you like I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over?

628
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yes, you can.

629
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Fist bump.

630
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Can you eat a juicy hamburger in front of them?

631
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No.

632
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's so good.

633
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Now you're being insensitive.

634
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There's synagogue all day anyway, right?

635
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah, there's synagogue all day and there's no hamburgers at synagogue.

636
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
No in and out at synagogue.

637
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No standing in the window.

638
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
All right.

639
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
No, I'll tell you.

640
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, actually we have police at our synagogue, so they'd probably say,

641
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
move along, move along.

642
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
No, I like that.

643
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I will use that next year.

644
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'll totally buy you Taco Bell when it's over.

645
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Ew.

646
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
All right.

647
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Just give me Adelbertos and then we'll say it's good.

648
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
All right.

649
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Loki, how was your gaming week outside of the big one we talked about?

650
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I played, actually, well, one sort of new game.

651
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It was an old game, but new on PC.

652
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I played Burnout Paradise because, hey, I got that in the Origin bundle,

653
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
so why not?

654
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And it runs fantastic on PC, so played a bit of that.

655
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And what else?

656
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
A little bit of Saints Row IV on PC, although I've kind of run out of things

657
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to do in it, so I didn't play it for very long.

658
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I was just checking out some of the new mods in there.

659
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I have a hydraulics mod now that I All Ninja worked on,

660
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
so that's pretty sweet.

661
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And what else?

662
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, also played a little bit of Call of Duty, and that's pretty much it.

663
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
My gaming week, I've also been playing an unhealthy,

664
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
bingeful amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm not sorry.

665
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But I did play some other games too.

666
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I would take a break once in a while to play some other games.

667
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
One of the big games I've been playing, of course, huge release this week,

668
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Kingdom Hearts HD on the PlayStation 3 was one I had to pick up

669
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
on the day it was released, and I've been playing that a little bit.

670
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I haven't really been binging on Kingdom Hearts,

671
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but I've been playing it enough.

672
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's so gorgeous in HD, even right from the very beginning.

673
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You remember the very beginning of Kingdom Hearts,

674
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
like the stained glass princess floors?

675
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You have to show me after the show.

676
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh, it's so beautiful.

677
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In the HD and everything, and the televisions,

678
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
those colors just really jump.

679
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a really pretty game to look at.

680
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And of course, it's the game you remember from the PlayStation 2.

681
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's not like they really changed the game.

682
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Except, well, it is the final mix,

683
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
but I find those changes to be a little bit minor,

684
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but I know for the Kingdom Hearts fans, it's a big deal,

685
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and the fact that it's out in the U.S. for the first time.

686
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So that's cool.

687
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know if it's that I got older or worse at video games,

688
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
or they changed something in the game,

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
but I'm having kind of a hard time being able to beat things

690
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that I used to be able to beat really easy.

691
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like, earlier today, I was playing in the Olympus Coliseum.

692
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I was doing the Cerberus Boss, and it's like,

693
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I can't beat this guy.

694
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like, am I really this bad?

695
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And it even took me a couple times to even just get to him,

696
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and I'm like, I don't remember this giving me so many problems.

697
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I get really frustrated with the camera still, too.

698
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Granted, they did make some changes.

699
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Some of the things that they had done with Kingdom Hearts 2

700
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
in regards to control and things,

701
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
they went back and did with this, which I'm thankful for.

702
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm so thankful for the fact you can invert the X and Y cameras

703
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and all that, too, and just kind of customize that.

704
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So nice.

705
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But yeah, I don't know.

706
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Still, sometimes I have problems getting the camera

707
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to do exactly what I want it to do,

708
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and it's the whole fact that the character gets stuck

709
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
right in front of the camera and some of those weird issues.

710
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But it has improved from the first game,

711
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but the battle system can still sometimes frustrate you a little bit.

712
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Like, that's not really going to change.

713
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But it's still a gorgeous story, just a lot of fun to play.

714
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And yeah, I plan on playing more of it throughout the week

715
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and hopefully get even further in the game.

716
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Do you have an option of Japanese dialogue?

717
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Ooh, I don't remember.

718
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Maybe somebody in chat can answer that for me, because I do not remember.

719
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I just think it would be nice if they gave you the option

720
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
that you can have any of the music in Japan,

721
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
well, you know, the Itada Hikaru stuff or any of the dialogue.

722
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't think so, because I don't remember that coming up

723
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
at the very start of the game.

724
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
There are different levels of difficulty, and to be fair,

725
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm playing it on normal, quote-unquote, difficulty.

726
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I didn't drop it down to easy because I didn't remember the game being that hard,

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but I guess maybe I was playing on easy the first time.

728
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I didn't realize it. I don't know. So, whatever.

729
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com confirms, nope.

730
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Ooh, I mean, not that I mind Haley Joel, but...

731
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah, well, and to be fair, the Blu-ray is packed pretty full

732
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
because it's not just Kingdom Hearts.

733
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They also have Chain of Memories HD, which I haven't even touched yet,

734
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
but that whole game is in there waiting for you to play.

735
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And then they have 358.2.

736
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That isn't playable, but they turned it into, like, a three-hour movie.

737
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So you can just watch all the cut scenes,

738
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and I think that's where all that voice acting and all that stuff kind of came in,

739
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
the extra stuff that they did.

740
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So that's all on one Blu-ray for 40 bucks.

741
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So that is a great value.

742
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
A couple other games I played this week just quickly.

743
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I played... there's some free games on PlayStation Plus right now,

744
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
so I checked out Galaga Dimensions, which is actually a couple years old.

745
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It just happens to be free on PlayStation Plus right now.

746
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Kind of a twin-stick shooter based very loosely on the original Galaga,

747
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
very loosely. It's more of a twin-stick shooter.

748
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But I like... at first, I kind of didn't get it,

749
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
but the more I played it, the more I kind of got into it.

750
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I kind of understood, like, okay, at the beginning of each level,

751
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
it's like drawing the patterns the bugs are going to fly in,

752
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and then it's really about kind of setting off the bombs at just the right time

753
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
so that everything kind of... yeah, these chain reactions and everything.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So I like a game that kind of peels back the layers and shows its depth

755
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the more you play it, what might look stupidly simple in the beginning.

756
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I do give Galaga props for that.

757
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That was... because I remember playing it on 360 a couple years ago,

758
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and I was kind of like, meh, don't get it.

759
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I didn't really buy it.

760
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But now that I have it for free thanks to PlayStation Plus,

761
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I've been having a good time with it.

762
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And yeah, that's really about it.

763
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I played Star Wars Pinball for like 30 minutes too,

764
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
which was also free and does things that you would never see a regular pinball table do,

765
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
like flying X-wings and stormtroopers that pop up on the table and shoot your ball.

766
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So there is kind of that sense of ridiculousness,

767
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
but they are well-done games from what I've played so far.

768
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I mean, Zen does a great job with all their pinball games.

769
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So that is pretty much my gaming week in a nutshell.

770
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

771
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Robert M. in chat says,

772
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I really can't get into Galaga Legion's DX personally.

773
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
For some reason the collision seems way too forgiving.

774
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, I guess I could see that,

775
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
although I do notice that the game will do this slowdown thing.

776
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Like if you're about to get hit, the game will suddenly like slow down and zoom in.

777
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It actually does this in Pac-Man too.

778
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know if they kind of borrowed the idea from each other or what,

779
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
but it does this in Pac-Man too.

780
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Like if you're about to die, the game will slow and that.

781
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So it gives you a couple extra, not even a couple extra seconds,

782
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
like a couple extra milliseconds to react to it, which is kind of nice.

783
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But I can see where that might also, just the whole collision thing in general,

784
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
might bug some more purists of bullet hell games.

785
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Alright, that's really it as far as my gaming week and things I wanted to talk about.

786
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So housekeeping, I don't really have a lot to say tonight.

791
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Not a super busy week for news, if I'm not mistaken,

792
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but a few big things to talk about tonight.

793
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So look, you want to start us off?

794
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah, too busy of a week.

795
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the announcement that was made on Sunday, actually.

796
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There was the whole press conference thing going on in Japan for Sony.

797
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
They talked about a bunch of different game announcements and things.

798
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
One of which, of course, was the Vita TV.

799
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Well, the Vita TV is this really small device that plugs into the TV.

800
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It uses a DualShock 3 controller, which is not included with it unless you buy the more expensive bundle.

801
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But it runs for about the equivalent of $99 US for the system itself or $150 with the controller bundled in.

802
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And it acts like a Vita without the screen.

803
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So you can play Vita games on it.

804
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It has a spot for the memory card and for the Vita cartridges.

805
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And you can also do the game streaming stuff that you can with the Vita.

806
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Like, for example, you can stream PlayStation 3 games with it.

807
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You can do PlayStation 4 games once that comes out.

808
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The only thing that it's limited on is obviously you can't technically stream.

809
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You can't play games that use the touch screen, obviously.

810
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But yeah, you can play all the digital stuff.

811
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You can watch Netflix on it because there's the Netflix app.

812
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So all the stuff that you can do on the Vita except for the touch stuff is now on this device.

813
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So you can play PSP games and PlayStation 1 games and all that fun stuff.

814
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Is it just me or does it seem like some of the Vita games are kind of abandoning the touch stuff, especially the rear touch thing?

815
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I can see that, but that's just almost the same way as a lot of the PlayStation 3 games abandoned the 6-axis stuff.

816
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
OK, this is going to sound horrible, but this is just how I've lost track of time lately.

817
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Was that Japanese press conference this week?

818
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It was Sunday night.

819
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
OK, that's why it was right after the show.

820
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I actually stayed up for it. It was Sunday at 11.

821
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I did too. So we should say at some point there's those new Vitas too, but do they even have the touchbacks?

822
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
No, they do. They're smaller and they don't have the OLED screen.

823
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They have just a regular LCD screen.

824
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And so they have that and they're a little bit cheaper, but they're multicolored and stuff and a little slimmer and all that fun stuff.

825
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And I think they have one gigabyte of memory built in to the system.

826
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, why would you want to stream PlayStation 3 games on the PlayStation Vita TV when the PlayStation 3 is right next to it?

827
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Well, this would be like the Vita TVs in your bedroom, right? And the PS3s in the living room or something like that?

828
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That and also the fact that I think what this could be is when they actually do get to the point where they have their Gaikai streaming service available,

829
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you don't even need a PlayStation 3 to stream PlayStation 3 games. You could play that stuff over the Vita.

830
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I mean, eventually they're going to have it where it'll come to the Vita as far as streaming all sorts of things.

831
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But I think this is mainly for playing Vita games, which I got to say is a great idea because even though the Vita does have the dual analog sticks,

832
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
though, it's still kind of awkward to hold.

833
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And so I would love actually just having a dual shock available to be able to play that way, because I think that'd be great.

834
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, I can't put my finger on it, but I really want one of these things and I don't even know why. They just look so cool.

835
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's a cheaper alternative. Let's put it this way. It's a cheaper alternative for a Vita and for a person like me that doesn't really play on the go.

836
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm sitting on my couch anyways playing the Vita. This is fine because I'll just pop in a Vita game if I really want to play it and do that.

837
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Hey, here's an idea. You know, I really wish they had this for like the 3DS, you know, where I can play with an external controller and play a game on my TV.

838
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Like a Wii U controller?

839
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
No. That would be fine. Honestly, actually, that would be fine if that's the way they're going to get around having the second screen.

840
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Although, to this day, I'm still saying that's a matter of time that they're going to have that where they will have 3DS games on the Wii U. It will happen.

841
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The regular DS games first.

842
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It just makes sense. Come on, they are lacking content anyways. They have a ton of fucking great 3DS games.

843
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It seems like a simple solution.

844
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Even DS games like Clubhouse Games and the Metroid Prime Hunters. God, there was a ton of shit on DS.

845
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Pokemon! Come on!

846
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, I want one, the Vita TV. If anything, to be able to play PSP and Vita games I missed out on on a big screen.

847
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's a better $99 spent than buying an Ouya.

848
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh snap!

849
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm all down for that. There's good Vita games out there. At the time, I didn't really want to have a Vita for all that stuff.

850
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But this is not a bad idea. The thing is, it's not planned for the US and Europe markets yet. It's just for Japan.

851
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I think it will eventually come out over here, but I can see why.

852
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Because they did just drop the price of the Vita and it doesn't make sense to have another device come out and undercut your device that you wanted to sell.

853
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So I think they're going to come out with it later on. Maybe it doesn't work. Maybe it's just not enough to push the Vita, the additional software and the price cut.

854
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Well, let's move on and talk about Xbox for a little bit. There was a couple pieces of news about Microsoft this week. Some I'll talk about, some Jamie will talk about in a minute here.

855
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:21,000
One of them has to do with the domain, the XB1.com domain. But the way it was capitalized, it more looked like the infamous term you hear around the internet, the Xbone.com domain.

856
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Excuse me. Gotta love the hiccups on live radio. Microsoft got this domain back this week.

857
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Major Nelson, in a public way on NeoGaf of all places, going public and saying that the Xbone name disrespects the people that created the Xbox One.

858
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
He said, quote, I don't like it. It disrespects the teams that have put in thousands of hours already into the development of the product.

859
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Sure it's cheeky, but I don't care for it myself.

860
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Then maybe you should have named your fucking console Xbox One, you dumbass.

861
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, isn't that what they called it? You said they should have named it. You mean they shouldn't have named it.

862
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Should not have named it the Xbox One.

863
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Should not have.

864
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Should not have.

865
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Just like, you know, if you were Nintendo and didn't want penis jokes, maybe you should have named your console the Wii. I mean, it's just a thought.

866
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
All right. Well, what's interesting about this domain is that it was originally purchased on March 20th of 2000.

867
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So this domain was bought a long time before there was ever an Xbox One. Some people are saying, wow, they just got lucky with the guess.

868
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm more thinking, well, wasn't this around the time the first Xbox came out?

869
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And so maybe some lucky person thought that they would be calling the original Xbox the Xbox One looking back because you look at the PlayStation One, the PlayStation Two, PlayStation Three.

870
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I think, you know, a lot of people would think that you would call that original Xbox the Xbox One.

871
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
They probably never thought that they would go back and make a new console named the Xbox One.

872
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Right?

873
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That doesn't fucking make any sense.

874
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:05,000
No, I think somebody just got extremely lucky and somebody was counting on Microsoft having the PlayStation naming conventions back in the day, but they just held on to the domain name for whatever reason.

875
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And that was where they got lucky.

876
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I suppose they were getting hits. I don't know.

877
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Then there was some pure wank on the Internet this week. I don't know what to think of this. I'm just going to put it out there.

878
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Y'all can discuss.

879
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
An anonymous report, so there's that right there, was talking to Edge.

880
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
These were anonymous developers saying that the PlayStation 4 is in a better state of performance.

881
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The hardware isn't locked yet, according to this source.

882
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
The PlayStation 4 apparently more capable.

883
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The same game running on both consoles at 1080p at 30 frames a second is on PlayStation 4, but it will run on a lower resolution and frame rate on the Xbox One as of right now.

884
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I believe Microsoft put out a comment about this later on that was basically like, it's bullshit to summarize.

885
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But what do you guys think? Do you think there's any, I mean, sometimes where there's smoke there's fire with this stuff, so I'll entertain it for a minute.

886
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But the comment that they made wasn't necessarily that it was bullshit, but that it's not just about speed, it's about all the specs together that make the console and type things.

887
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So it's like, yeah, that may be the case, but it's not going to matter.

888
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't think it's going to matter anyways because you're going to have, just like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, spec-wise they were different.

889
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So they still have to make the games perform pretty much the same on both systems.

890
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So I think you're going to see pretty much the games playing the same on both systems. It's not going to be that dramatically different.

891
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I think it has to play the same on both systems, or that's like, Microsoft would never put a system out there that can't handle it the same. You know what I mean?

892
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah, it's just not going to, you're not going to see something dramatically different. You're not going to have like, you know, Assassin's Creed 5 or something where it's stick figures on Xbox One and full 1080p graphics on the PlayStation 4.

893
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It's just not going to happen that way.

894
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Koopakid Jeremy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, are the games fun? That's all I care about.

895
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I do agree, and it goes back to that old golden rule, right? The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

896
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But, you have to admit that if it does come out that, you know, such and such game, let's say Assassin's Creed 4 or whatever, runs at this particular speed on the PlayStation 4,

897
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:32,000
but the performance is five less frames a second on Xbox One, that's going to get out on the internet, and it's not going to make Microsoft look good.

898
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:47,000
In a way, that happened to Sony in the last generation, didn't it? Because I seem to remember with Oblivion especially, and I know I'm going way back, there was a lot of problems with PlayStation 3, and that was all over the internet, and a lot of that was blamed on the Blu-ray drive, if I remember right.

899
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Well, there was Oblivion, Skyrim had issues, there was a lot of games that had issues on the PlayStation 3, so, yeah.

900
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You know, and that stuff does get reported on and tweeted about and Facebooked messaged about, and it all adds up to not looking so good.

901
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So, yeah. But I do agree at the end of the day, if the games are fun, that's the most important thing, which is what Nintendo's banking on in a big way, because these games that are going to run at 30 frames a second and what have you on Xbox One and so forth, aren't even going to be made for the Wii U.

902
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So, Nintendo kind of has to bank on these games that are experiences that are only going to be on Nintendo, because most of them are by Nintendo, pushing that system through 2014.

903
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Which Wonderful 101 came out today, did it not? And I'm hearing some good things about that. Still haven't played the demo, I'm a bad fan, but blame all these other things like Kingdom Hearts taking away my attention for a minute.

904
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I wanted to check it out at some point. Alright, let's move on. You have something on Xbox as well, right?

905
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yes, I do, and I know I'm not the first to say something about this, I know Bobby talked about it, but it's, well, it's not necessarily on Xbox, it's taken from an Xbox idea.

906
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And that is, well, we don't know specifically if it's taken from the Xbox idea, but it's a lot like it. It's basically the Steam Family Sharing Program.

907
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Which is very interesting, because didn't we see something very similar to this, at least described on the Xbox One when they first made their press announcement, right?

908
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So what this is, basically, is if, say, I have a game installed, but you want to play it and you don't own it, I can authorize you to play it.

909
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And then that way we can share the game, but if I decide that I want to play it, you get a few minutes to save your game, or buy the game to continue playing it.

910
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So it's a way to expose other people to a game, like, if I say, Rob, you really, really have to play Fractal. No, I mean, really, you have to play Fractal.

911
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I can go, here, play Fractal, and you can download it and play Fractal. And then if I decide that I want to play it...

912
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Which literally might happen, because I don't believe I own that game.

913
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah.

914
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And I can be like, no, Jamie, Rogue Legacy, it's like Castlevania, but, like, fun, and, well, I mean, like, Castlevania is fun, but you know what I mean.

915
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Like, it's an indie Castlevania that's a lot of fun, you need to check this game out, and I can be like, you know, here, go play this.

916
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And then I will have to figure out if I have any space left with all the other Steam games on my system, because I have almost filled up 500 GB with games.

917
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's scary.

918
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I probably should uninstall WoW now that I think about it.

919
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
But, at any rate, you know, it's, I can say, here, play Fractal.

920
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And you can be, you can say that you have gotten into Fractal, and I was like, you know, I want to play, I want to try to beat my game now, so I want to log in.

921
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Well, you have the option, then, to stop playing the game, you know, save your progress.

922
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Or, you know, if you can be like, well, you know what, I'm at level 10, and I really like this game, I'm going to buy it.

923
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Then you can buy it and keep playing, and I can go back to playing my game.

924
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And I never have to walk into a GameStop, I don't have to hand anybody cash, I just click that little button that says, drain all the imaginary money from my bank account.

925
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Exactly.

926
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And the thing with this, too, is that, like, at my house, Dan didn't have a Steam account for a while, and now he has it for mostly his racing games.

927
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And we play Borderlands together, but say that he wanted to try out, like, I just bought that, oh yeah, there's another game I didn't talk about playing, is that I played Duke Nukem 3D.

928
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Because I bought the indie shooting thing.

929
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But say that, you know, Dan wants to sit and play Duke Nukem 3D, and I'm not playing it, I just go, okay, you're authorized on yours, here you go.

930
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And, you know, given that we're in the same house, you know, it doesn't really matter. I don't have to log out of my account for him to play my games.

931
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
But if you want to play your games, then he's going to get kicked out.

932
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
If I'm playing a different game.

933
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Oh, I always thought that, oh, okay.

934
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The way that I understood it is that it's just authorization on that game.

935
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's on all your games, your entire library.

936
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So if you play any game, if you're playing Duke Nukem 3D or something like that, and he's playing Borderlands on your account, he will get kicked out of Borderlands.

937
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
While I'm at school, you know.

938
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
While you're playing Final Fantasy XIV, which isn't in your Steam library or something like that.

939
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I mean, the only reason I linked it into my Steam is not one of my Steam games, I just run it through Steam to screencap.

940
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Which, by the way, they booted that out, for the record.

941
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, wow.

942
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah, so I haven't been able to do my screencaps through Steam.

943
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Well, that sucks.

944
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I also haven't been able to do my Mass Effect 3 screencaps through Steam either, so.

945
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's weird.

946
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But I can for two.

947
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Well, it's very easy to take screenshots in Final Fantasy XIV, but granted, I get that you can't post them or do the cloud or your captions.

948
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well, no, you can't take screencaps during cinematics.

949
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh, got it.

950
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And that's what I was using. Steam 4 was taking screencaps during cinematics.

951
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Tricky, tricky. Okay, I gotcha.

952
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah.

953
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I gotcha.

954
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Well, one thing I do want to make sure is very clear with this family sharing, because it was the same mistake a lot of people made with the Xbox version of it, which was a very kind of muddy, we didn't really know what, you know, all we knew was the negative with the DRM, we never knew the positive.

955
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But this isn't that you can open this up to nine friends and family members and it's just open season on your library.

956
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Down, you know, I buy a game and I basically get ten copies of that game, everybody can play it.

957
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That is not what happens.

958
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
One person at a time in your library and that person locks your library, including from you, basically.

959
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But you can take control back of your library at any time, but it will prevent that person from playing that game any further outside of, you know, 120 seconds or whatever to wrap it up and save or buy the game and keep going.

960
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And I think it's a good feature and I think that they're handling it in a very intelligent manner.

961
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You know, even if it's completely lucky at your account, like you said, what if I'm playing Final Fantasy and Dan wants to try out one of the other games I have or play through some, because I've got like the whole Doom set and all the old school games.

962
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You know, if Dan wants to play through it, that's fine.

963
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
If I have a friend who wants to play Loom because she can't get her CD to work, I can say, oh, just play on mine, here, you're authorized.

964
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You know, I think it works very well.

965
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Or, you know, what other, I got another game on Steam.

966
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Like, what if I wanted a friend of mine to play Mass Effect, the very first one.

967
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I can be like, okay, because mine was a Steam version, here, you can play on my account.

968
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Nice.

969
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Here's a text mod thing, here's how to do all this crap.

970
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You know, and it would be, I think it would be just fine.

971
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Okay.

972
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So, I mean, like, I think that it's a very good opportunity.

973
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I think that it's better than demos, because people are having access to the full version of the game.

974
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Right.

975
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
The moment that they're in, the moment they get into a game and they're inconvenienced about playing the game,

976
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:58,000
when, you know, you want your game back, that's going to give them even more encouragement to, you know, to buy the game.

977
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Don't you think?

978
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, I think it's a great idea where developers will kind of be able to get their game demos out there.

979
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It's essentially kind of a demo, in a way.

980
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Kind of.

981
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And, you know, hypothetically, I could probably borrow one of your little games while you're out of town for a week or something,

982
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and probably beat it in that time frame, but those cases are probably going to be less common than the cases where somebody is playing this epic RPG

983
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and can't finish because you want to be able to play your games, so they have to buy it to finish it.

984
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Like, for example, if I wanted you to play, god, now I can't remember the name of the game, Little Inferno.

985
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You don't have it, do you?

986
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I don't think so, no.

987
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Well, I would love for you to play Little Inferno.

988
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah.

989
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And you can beat it in a night. I beat the game in one day.

990
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Nice.

991
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So, it took me a few hours, but I also, you know, got all the combos and everything.

992
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But, you know, if I wanted you to experience the joy that is this game and I'm going to be out for the night.

993
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Mm-hmm. There you go.

994
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What's the problem?

995
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
S2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I just wonder how it will work with MMOs, like DC Universe Online.

996
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Will people be able to play on another person's account?

997
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You can't.

998
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's free anyway, so why?

999
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, anything that has, like, extra serial numbers or, like, basically MMOs and online games aren't going to apply.

1000
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's anything that requires, like, you play, you can't do it. If you can't, if Games for Windows Live, you can't do it.

1001
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
MMOs, you can't do it. That's pretty much it.

1002
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Stuff that requires an additional serial, like, for example, you can't play online, like you mentioned.

1003
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You need a code for that.

1004
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Mm-hmm.

1005
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So, yeah, those don't work.

1006
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I still, I'm looking forward to it.

1007
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Now, we're going to talk about this probably a little later in the show when we get into the Fugu Question of the Week.

1008
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So, if you haven't answered it yet, you might want to go answer it because we're going to read these a little later.

1009
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But, you know, when this news came out, I definitely sensed a lot of people on Twitter, especially Xbox fans,

1010
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:52,000
were a little irritated that Steam announces this and gets praised, whereas Xbox really got dogged for this whole thing with the DRM and everything.

1011
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And I personally feel there are two very, this is, it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit, and I think sometimes people forget that.

1012
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I'll get into that a little later.

1013
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
But we want to know what you think, and, you know, there's no right or wrong answer.

1014
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So, go answer our Fugu Question of the Week if you haven't yet.

1015
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We're going to get into those a little bit later in the game, or in the show.

1016
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
For now, let's go on with some more news.

1017
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
One thing, I would like to repeat what Spike said in the chatroom.

1018
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
The information released indicated that games that require their own keys and accounts would not be shareable.

1019
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah.

1020
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So.

1021
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Alright, so, something coming out of Kickstarter.

1022
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You'll be seeing a lot of these old game resurgences, and one of which is River City Ransom Underground.

1023
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's a licensed, officially licensed sequel to River City Ransom, done in kind of the 8-bit style of River City Ransom.

1024
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And they kind of took the 8-bit graphics and obviously added more color to them and stuff.

1025
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But it's in the same style, and they're seeking $180,000 Canadian by October 9th.

1026
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And they'll probably make it.

1027
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It looks awesome.

1028
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Right now they're at about a third of the way, and it's only been seven days.

1029
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And it looks pretty sweet.

1030
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I looked at it. I almost put some money on it.

1031
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm kind of with Loki, though, where it's like, it's got to be a really good Kickstarter at this point for me to jump on beforehand.

1032
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Because there's just too much out there now where it's like, I don't want to buy all these games, I'm not going to see for a year.

1033
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

1034
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
This is expected out September of 2014.

1035
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And you know they always get, nothing ever comes out in time.

1036
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So 2015 or end of 2014, it's like, I'd rather just keep my money now and then I'll buy it when it comes out.

1037
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
If I have time for it.

1038
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't want to back anything.

1039
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Unless it's hardware that I'm pre-ordering, like an Oculus Rift or something like that, that's a little different.

1040
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But if it's a digital game, I'll just buy it when it comes out.

1041
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I want an actual Kunio sequel, not branded under River City Ransom.

1042
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I loved going back and playing the PC Engine version of the hot-blooded downtown story.

1043
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It was fun. It was quirky.

1044
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But is that really possible at this point, or is this really, you know, we're having to settle here?

1045
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I think it's having to settle, really, but I mean, that's just sort of like, maybe not.

1046
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Well yeah, it's like, I want to wish these guys well, and good luck, and I love the idea, and I hope the game's great, but I'll see you when you come out.

1047
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Yeah.

1048
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Yeah.

1049
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Alright, now I might be tricked into kickstarting something like this if this were the way this game were to go, because I did love me some Geometry Wars.

1050
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And Geometry Wars was really, I mean, let's be real, Geometry Wars was like the best launch game on the Xbox 360.

1051
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Because it sure as hell wasn't Cameo, or some of those other 360 games.

1052
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Geometry Wars was an awesome $5 game, and then they had Geometry Wars 2, which was also one of the better Xbox Live Arcade games they ever did.

1053
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And hell, Geometry Wars was free if you happened to get Project Gotham Racing.

1054
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Right, which, you know, of course, this whole thing started as a spinoff in Project Gotham Racing, like this little inside joke that just grew into a phenomenon of sorts.

1055
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I remember, it's one of the few huge interviews we had on the show when they put out the Wii version of Geometry Wars, remember that?

1056
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah.

1057
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Which was a really great game, too, which is sad, a lot of people didn't really check it out.

1058
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
We had those guys on the show, and, you know, the Wii version was great, too.

1059
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Unfortunately, as you all know, Bizarre Creations was closed in 2011 after Blur didn't do so hot in some of the 007 games.

1060
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So why am I bringing it up now?

1061
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Well, Phil Spencer, who's right now the corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, said on Twitter, you know, take it or leave it,

1062
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
quote, I like Geometry Wars. Great game from the old Bizarre Creations.

1063
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Activision picked up IP when they bought Bizarre Creations.

1064
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And then somebody followed up with a question like, you know, would you work with Activision on a new game or buy the rights to it?

1065
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Spencer said, quote, oh, I'll respond. Let's just say as someone who worked on Project Gotham Racing, I have a lot of love for Geometry Wars.

1066
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Conversations have been had.

1067
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Oh, that was the tweet that drove everybody crazy. Somebody's talking about it, bringing back Geometry Wars.

1068
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So I'm a little surprised that if something was going to happen, it hasn't already.

1069
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But do you think maybe this is something they're sitting on until the Xbox One or the inevitable next Project Gotham Racing game?

1070
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It would be a nice launch title. I just don't think it's going to be a launch title.

1071
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well, no, we'd know about it by now if it was. Is there a Project Gotham? No, there's not a Project Gotham at launch because there's a Forza, right?

1072
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
They're going to have a conference, though, or a presentation at Tokyo Game Show.

1073
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Microsoft, that's ironic, but, you know, they're going to.

1074
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But you never know. By the time, after all, PlayStation 4 doesn't come out until February, so they very well could launch before February. It is possible.

1075
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It is possible. Well, I hope they are able to bring this franchise back. It was great, but here's the other thing, too.

1076
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:27,000
If they do bring it back, it needs to still be good. So I don't know if that's, you know, hiring back some of the people who worked on it before if they're not already happy somewhere else or what.

1077
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But don't just make another game, you know, with completely different people and then have it suck because we've seen that happen to other franchises and it's always depressing when that stuff happens.

1078
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So before we get into release dates, Darkstalkers got a story for us.

1079
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I do, and it makes me kind of happy, but kind of wary and sad at the same time.

1080
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It has to do with the next Mass Effect, because we all love some Mass Effect here. Well, at least two out of three of us like Mass Effect.

1081
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And two out of three ain't bad.

1082
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And two out of three are correct. So they are calling it, at present, Mass Effect 4, at least I guess that's their development name.

1083
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And there are a series of quotes out about that from Casey Hudson, and he's saying that they're basically reworking the universe, going to make it new, and that it's not going to be about Shepard, but that it could be about people who were in the previous Mass Effect games.

1084
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So, who knows, you could be any one of the crew, you could be the Elusive Man, which, why would anybody want to be him, because he sucks. Chainsmoker.

1085
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:51,000
But they were also saying that it was supposed to be a new fictional world, so I don't know if it's supposed to be alternate universe, another story, just something else occurring within the established canon.

1086
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I personally want to see something less human-centric, but I know why they make it human-centric, because people will more easily get into the series.

1087
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I'm actually, you know, part of me would like an MMO, but I would really rather have just another standalone game with, you know, the same awesome multiplayer that Mass Effect 3 had. Don't you think?

1088
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Sorry, I only heard the second, I'm sorry, I only heard the first half of that, my bad. I'm multitasking, leave me alone.

1089
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:33,000
No, you're single-tasking. No, I was like, there had been some rumors about it being MMO-style, and I, well, I think it was-

1090
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
That could be like Borderlands, though.

1091
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah, I think it would be fun to play around in that universe, but I would still rather have a single-player game that has all the same cinematic, to quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, it's the best movie I've ever played.

1092
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And I would like another experience like that. I would like to, you know, see more things about the other races, not have it just be human-centric, but understand that it was focused on humans, because that would be what would get people more easily immersed in the game.

1093
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Uh, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, how about Garrus as the main character from Mass Effect 4? Well, that would make the fandom happy.

1094
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I would totally play Garrus the game.

1095
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I thought BioWare was trying to get away from that universe, though. I mean, like, that whole story in Shepherd's Crew and all that, I thought they were trying to kind of do something completely different.

1096
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:34,000
But there'd be plenty, I mean, I still think that there would be plenty to go on in a post-Reaperpocalypse world, or universe, or galaxy. I should say galaxy.

1097
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Uh, SSJ100Matt says, so would this next game be the Star Trek Voyager to Mass Effect 1 through 3's Star Trek Next Generation?

1098
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't know, because Voyager was shit.

1099
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Hey, I liked Voyager, so I'm gonna say hopefully, although apparently it will divide the fandom epically if that happens. So we'll see.

1100
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Alright, let's travel around the universe and check out release dates coming to a planet near you, starting with the US. Loki?

1101
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Uh, there's Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver, that's on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and who gives a shit?

1102
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And, uh, I think maybe Wii U, I don't know. Who cares? There's also some stupid karaoke game, you know, Wii, Wii Sing 80's or something like that, that's on the Wii.

1103
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And, uh, you know, the only game you really should get this week, Grand Theft Auto 5, that's on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

1104
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So there you go, Grand Theft Auto 5, your shopping's done, buy it, it comes out tomorrow. Or, not tomorrow.

1105
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
You're not biased at all!

1106
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm not, oh, I'm not biased. Hot Wheels, World's Best Driver, a game based off a YouTube series that has no Hot Wheel cars in it, it's just about fuckin' rally driving with a really stupid premise built in.

1107
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Like, oh we have all these teams, we're telling them to do this strategic driving, which is like a really short course anyways.

1108
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And then we have a karaoke title that they imported from the UK that's just lame on a Wii system.

1109
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And then you have Grand Theft Auto, the game that's gonna get perfect 10 reviews. I don't think you're gonna see perfect 10 reviews from Hot Wheels.

1110
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
You're so easily wound up, I love it. Alright, going to Japan, since unfortunately no Grand Theft Auto 5 in Japan this week.

1111
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Do they get Grand Theft Auto 5 at some point? Eventually.

1112
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Alright, so instead, on the Playstation 3 this week, you have Fairy Fencer F to look forward to, over there.

1113
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And, uh, I don't think they are actual fairies, just so you know. It looks like one of those epic RPGs.

1114
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Actually, it looks kinda cool, and it's by Compile, although I know the Compile of today is not the same as the Compile of yesterday.

1115
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Compile Heart, excuse me.

1116
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But we can still give them a little love.

1117
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That's right, we can. That game does look kinda neat, so you got that coming out this week, regular and limited edition.

1118
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Phantom Breaker Extra, also in regular and limited edition on the Xbox, excuse me, on the Playstation 3 this week.

1119
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And that Phantom Breaker is a fighting game, with chicks in sailor suits.

1120
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Going on to the Xbox 360, because it is still chugging along over there for the loyal supporters in Japan.

1121
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
On the Xbox 360 this week, Alan Wake gets a price reduction.

1122
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Halo 3 gets a price reduction, including Halo 3 ODST, Halo Reach, Halo Wars.

1123
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And then the Phantom Breaker Extra game I mentioned earlier is also coming out this week on the Xbox 360.

1124
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:33,000
There's also a couple new Xbox console packs themselves, a 250GB one and a 4GB one that also includes Kinect.

1125
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So, I guess a soft launch, if you will, of the Xbox 360 and some new SKUs.

1126
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Hope they're cheap.

1127
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:51,000
On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, Yahari Game Demo Ore no Saishin Love Komei wa Machigateru comes out this week in regular and limited edition.

1128
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm just trying to see quickly what this game is all about.

1129
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
This one is, this is a dating sim, totally a dating sim.

1130
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yep, totally a dating sim, but you know, everything you expect.

1131
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Beach outfits, notes written on notepaper, all that stuff.

1132
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Quickly checking the Nintendo platforms to see what we have to look forward to there.

1133
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Unfortunately, nothing on the Wii U this week. They don't have any releases until the 26th of September.

1134
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
But on the 3DS this week, a little more to choose from.

1135
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Jewel Master, Nobunaga no Yabu, also Sangokushi comes out this week, all on the Nintendo 3DS.

1136
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1137
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
There's some stuff. God, if it'll ever load, thank you.

1138
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Okay, so, on the 17th we have Grand Theft Auto 5 in the UK.

1139
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
On the 19th, Angry Birds Star Wars 2, and what the hell just happened to my thing?

1140
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Okay, and on the 20th we have Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which, ew, snails. That's it.

1141
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

1142
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
They're not just snails, they're snails on NOS, okay?

1143
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:07,000
No, that is like my big phobia, are mollusks of that nature.

1144
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Yeah, it's even better when they moved at turbo speed, they can just...

1145
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
No, no, no, no, la la la la la la la.

1146
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Okay, so, this is kind of interesting. Here we thought that this channel was just done for.

1147
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
They put the bullet into it, and it was just done.

1148
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Put up from the grave like a zombie, rises G4.

1149
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
A husk of, well, pretty much nothing at this point because they fired all their staff, so...

1150
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
G4 will no longer become the Esquire Network.

1151
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Instead, that wonderful title goes to Style Channel, now is going to be the Esquire Channel.

1152
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
But what's going to happen to Bill and Juliana?

1153
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Here's the thing about Style, though. Style was like a totally different demographic, I think, than the Esquire Channel.

1154
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Wasn't that focused more like women and stuff? And now it's like, oh, men channel.

1155
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Well, here's the thing, it was in more homes. And I think at the end of the day, that's what they're trying to do,

1156
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
is they're trying to get, they're going to push the Esquire Network on a channel that's in more homes.

1157
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I don't think this is about they suddenly wanted to give G4 a reprieve.

1158
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
G4 is like a lame duck network now. I mean, what the hell do you do with G4?

1159
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
How do you solve a problem like the G4 network?

1160
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I don't even know how they can, I mean, the only thing I think is it's going to be the Cops and Cheaters rerun channel again.

1161
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's the rerun network. They're not doing any original programming at this point.

1162
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah, they got rid of all the original programming, all the hosts and everything,

1163
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:37,000
so unless they come up with some new content, which I don't see happening, does that mean we're still going to have G4 at E3?

1164
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
No, no, that's not going to happen. And BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

1165
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
G4 died in 2004, end of story. And for all practical purposes, I think we banned all talk of this network in the future on the show.

1166
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
However, I'm entertaining it tonight because, you know, it is interesting to think like,

1167
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
well, I mean, even though I think, you know, this network is damned, it's done for.

1168
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I would have been more interested if they said, tech TV's coming back.

1169
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Well, is it possible that maybe they'll try to launch the network with this space that maybe should have been?

1170
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I mean, that's going to mean an investment or somebody's going to have to come in and buy it,

1171
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and I don't really know if that's going to happen, but it is interesting that they have all this space and nothing to do with it.

1172
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You would think that they're going to try to repackage it and launch it as something, and that might entail additional contact.

1173
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Well, you bring back Leo Laporte and Patrick Norton on screensavers, I'll sign up for cable and watch that shit,

1174
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
but until then, I don't give a shit about reruns of, you know.

1175
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Just pay those twit guys in Petaluma to be on basic cable?

1176
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Hell yeah.

1177
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
If they want that, they probably don't.

1178
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
They've moved on. Everyone's moved on.

1179
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Everyone's moved on.

1180
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's nice to think, I'm just saying, not that we love doing OLR, and we're all getting to be in our mid-thirties, but we're available.

1181
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
We'd be cheap too.

1182
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Hey, exactly, I said I will sell out in a second. You don't understand.

1183
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'll take a paycheck. I don't care. I'll introduce videos of cheaters if you want me to quip about something.

1184
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
You know, I don't care what you want. Hey, this episode of Cops is classic. We've got this, you know, druggie guy.

1185
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
He tries to jump over the fence, but a dog grabs him in the ass. That's hilarious. Let's watch that clip.

1186
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And I'll introduce things too, like, okay y'all, this is that episode of Cops where they try to arrest the drag queen, and he's all, excuse my beauty.

1187
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So, don't change the channel.

1188
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
This'll be me.

1189
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Here's some shit. Watch it. I don't care.

1190
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:54,000
No, you would be like Dr. Claw where you would only allow your arm to be shot on video while you're petting Midna.

1191
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
While I'm petting, while trying to get Midna to sit freaking still.

1192
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Well, wasn't that an enthusiastic episode of Campus PD?

1193
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Up next, cheaters, followed by a rerun of MacGyver.

1194
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
No, Rob, do you know what I would be? I would be the Kennedy.

1195
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Remember the MTV days.

1196
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I liked Kennedy. She was awesome.

1197
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Remember the, I got voted the least loved VJ, and she had the tiara and everything.

1198
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Do you want to know a story that not a lot of people know?

1199
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Okay, tell me.

1200
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That has to do with Kennedy?

1201
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Tell me.

1202
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I don't know if I should admit this on the air.

1203
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Do it.

1204
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Okay, so like many years ago when I was in high school, I was probably like a senior in high school, so it was a long time ago, right?

1205
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Would have been 96, right?

1206
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
That's not a long time ago.

1207
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
There used to be this show on the radio that I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of called Love Line.

1208
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And Love Line, back in the day, had Adam Carolla, right?

1209
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And Dr. Drew, which I think Dr. Drew still does it.

1210
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah, he does it.

1211
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I think so, amongst all the other stuff he does.

1212
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Well, I called in one night, and I called in because Kennedy was the guest.

1213
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And I just wanted to talk to Kennedy, so I think I asked, I don't even remember what it is I asked all these years later.

1214
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But I was on an episode of Love Line talking to Kennedy, and I think it was something like,

1215
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
what's your advice to somebody who's trying to get into business?

1216
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Because at that time, I was thinking that I was going to go into broadcast journalism and all this stuff in college,

1217
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and that's the type of stuff I really wanted to do.

1218
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I wanted to do that type of radio stuff.

1219
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Look where I ended up.

1220
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Thanks, Kennedy, for your shitty advice.

1221
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I wonder what happened to her.

1222
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm sure she's still around and doing all that.

1223
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I think she did political stuff later on.

1224
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But anyway, she said, and it's really funny because they had to dump this from the air.

1225
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
She said, well, don't work for the guy in Bleep. That guy's a dick.

1226
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And Adam Carolla goes, we're on in that station, you idiot.

1227
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So they had to dump that from the airwaves.

1228
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So if you want to know what town she said, it was Portland.

1229
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Don't work in Portland.

1230
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So that's the advice I got.

1231
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So yes, if you didn't know, I was on Love Line when I was 18 or something like that.

1232
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So there you go.

1233
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Sorry, no juicy relationship questions for you.

1234
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.

1235
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
She hosted a game show on Game Show Network, The Friend or Foe.

1236
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But that was about ten years ago at this point.

1237
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
By the way, don't feel bad because my 20-year reunion is next year.

1238
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
No, it's fine. I'm at peace with the fact that I'm 35. It's all good.

1239
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
You know what? I'm 35 and awesome.

1240
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Now I'm 37 in a row.

1241
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
All right, playing games like this one that I'll be looking forward to.

1242
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Final Fantasy Agito is going to be out on iOS and Android.

1243
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Wasn't this the game that was supposed to be part of the Final Fantasy XIII mythos and all that?

1244
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Well, this finally is coming out.

1245
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's in the same universe as Final Fantasy Type 0, which was a PSP game in Japan.

1246
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And it's in that same universe.

1247
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It's going to be a free-to-play app for iOS and Android,

1248
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
which means you'll probably get to play the first part for free,

1249
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
and then you're going to have to buy everything.

1250
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
The play will be divided between solo play and team play.

1251
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There will be missions based around individual characters,

1252
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
and there will be bosses that you fight as team play.

1253
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
We don't know what release day this is, but it is something that will come out soon.

1254
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Speaking of Square Enix, I just want to do a quick follow-up.

1255
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Last week we talked about Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call,

1256
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and it was suggested this could be a sequel to Theatrhythm,

1257
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and I was sitting here going, no, it's probably just like a year-end edition

1258
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
that's going to package everything together.

1259
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Well, I was wrong. Go figure.

1260
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call will be coming to the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 at some point.

1261
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
It will be in Japan in spring.

1262
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,000
200-plus tracks, 60-plus characters, and a versus battle mode.

1263
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
They say songs from Final Fantasy XIV, as well as Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII-3,

1264
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,000
are some of the games featured in that, so it sounds like it's going to be even bigger and better.

1265
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
200 tracks is a lot of tracks, but when it's all music from your own company,

1266
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that shouldn't be too difficult to put together.

1267
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I wonder if it will just have all the regular tracks from Theatrhythm 1.

1268
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
That would be interesting if they went that way.

1269
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
All right, well, let's go back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.

1270
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
There was not 200-plus songs in a game.

1271
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
There was like maybe five, and you liked it.

1272
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week,

1273
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
where Dark Sakura's going to go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1274
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
hey, you kids should check out this game because it's cooler than you.

1275
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1276
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
The Classic Game of the Week is Valis, the Phantasm Soldier,

1277
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
or as it was called, Mugensenshi Vadisu in Japan.

1278
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It was the first game in the Valis series,

1279
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and it originally came out on the MSX and PC-88 home computers in 1986.

1280
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And then later on there was a Famicom version,

1281
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
and then there was a Sega Mega Drive version,

1282
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
which I'm sure is the one that most people remember,

1283
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
either the Mega Drive version or the re-release that came out on PC Engine CD or Turbo Duo CD.

1284
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So the game is basically a side-scrolling platformer.

1285
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You are a girl in a school uniform with a sword beating shit up.

1286
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And then later on she gets all magical outfits and everything.

1287
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But the big part with this game is that it was one of the first magical girl games that,

1288
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
well, kind of magical girl games that came out,

1289
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
you know, that got a US release and was really popular.

1290
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Now, the interesting thing about this is that the Famicom version was absolutely different from the game.

1291
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It had the same plot of the game, but it basically was more of a maze-style game with different paths,

1292
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
so it's supposed to be a lot harder.

1293
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,000
For the Mega Drive game, it was pretty much side-scrolling, D-pad, hack, slash, slide, jump, swing your sword,

1294
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
that type of thing, and you did have magic attacks.

1295
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
There was a promotional video that came out with the game's release,

1296
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but it's hard to find. I don't think you can find it anywhere, however, the entire thing is on YouTube.

1297
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So, now with Valis, if anyone does want the PC Engine version,

1298
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
or I should say the PC Duo or Turbo Duo version,

1299
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,000
it actually comes with a Valis 1 and 2 collection, so you get two games for the price of one.

1300
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But this is one of the classic RPGs that came out on Sega Systems, so definitely get it.

1301
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Alright, I've never played this game, I'm just watching the little footage.

1302
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Well, the overall story is basically, it's a Japanese schoolgirl whose name is Yuko.

1303
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Look at those fancy effects where the pillars sometimes scroll in front of her,

1304
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
as opposed to behind her. That was cutting edge for the time there.

1305
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Well, but she used a sword called Valis to defend the earth and the spirit world and the dream world.

1306
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I'm looking at some of these later stages now.

1307
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Yeah, and there were more sequels, I mean, we had Valis 2, Valis 3, Valis 4.

1308
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I think I played one of the later Valis games. I seem to remember Valis 3 and 4, I think I played one of those.

1309
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah, and I'm trying to remember, let me see what it was that Valis 4 came out on.

1310
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Valis was also on the NES, I'm looking at this related thing.

1311
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
That's what I'm saying, the Famicom version, but it was more of a maze game.

1312
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1313
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Valis 4 was on the Super Nintendo, or as it was known in Japan as a...

1314
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:58,000
No, it was actually called in America too, Super Valis 4, which was on the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo.

1315
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But Valis 3 did come out on PC Engine because I do have that game.

1316
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And with Valis 3 is basically you play as Yuko, but she has a couple other characters that are there named Valna and a warrior named Cham who are also in the game.

1317
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:26,000
But I might cover the later Valis games at another time, but it has to start somewhere, so going with the first Valis is pretty safe.

1318
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
The Game Buster in our chat room says, I played Valis 3 on the Genesis. I think that's one of the ones I played too.

1319
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I think I played a later one because a friend of mine had it.

1320
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But still, it's nice to know where those games came from, right?

1321
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Well, there was a...

1322
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
What was I trying to think? Because I think it had a different release.

1323
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Was this one ever released on Wii?

1324
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I don't think it had a Wii release.

1325
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I don't think it was.

1326
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Because this would have been perfect. The Valis 1 and 2 set for PC Engine would have been a perfect Wii store.

1327
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Well, you never know. There's always time on the Wii U Virtual Console, so you'll see.

1328
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
As long as it still has life in it.

1329
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Valis, the Phantasm Soldier.

1330
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Alrighty, let's do a music break, guys.

1331
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

1332
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
We have some rapid-fire news for you guys.

1333
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
The FUGO Question of the Week.

1334
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And, because we haven't done it in a little while, we're going to do a List List tonight.

1335
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
We've got List List on deck for tonight because it's been a while.

1336
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
We will have a special guest calling in to help us with that.

1337
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,000
So stay tuned, guys, so you too can participate and play along here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

1338
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Because remember, we have our new fancy little Bobby Blackwolf-programmed List List game thing.

1339

1340
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Coming up when Orange Lounge Radio resumes here right after this.

1341
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1342
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
We are live, episode 519 already in progress here at VOG Network.

1343
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
September the 15th, 2013. Boy, this year is almost over.

1344
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But it is my favorite time of year right now because that is when pumpkin all the things come out at all the various stores.

1345
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I'm very happy. I'm not just talking about pumpkin spice lattes, so don't get me wrong. Those are really good.

1346
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Although, one of the other coffee stores has a maple that's really good too, but I love pumpkin. I love pumpkin.

1347
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I did have a pumpkin muffin not too long ago.

1348
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Yum.

1349
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It was the cream cheese.

1350
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Alan and I at Target the other day got pumpkin waffles because I guess that's like a seasoned thing now that Eggo does like seasonal waffles.

1351
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But I was very happy because Noah's, not only does pumpkin bagels this year, but they have a pumpkin walnut bagel that is real good.

1352
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It's like eating dessert for breakfast. I love it.

1353
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
You know what we need to do one day when it's an I can eat wheat day?

1354
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah.

1355
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
We need to go to Coco's.

1356
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Okay.

1357
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Get their pumpkin pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream.

1358
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Oh, it's going to be that time of year. I hop soon too.

1359
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Oh my God.

1360
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Pumpkin all the things.

1361
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Pumpkin all the things. Alright.

1362
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:23,000
During that break, which I know you guys don't get to hear it on the podcast, but we play some songs for the live listeners while we take a quick break to rest our voices, refill our drinks and so forth, use the restroom.

1363
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
During that break, Loki picked one of the songs tonight that we heard tonight. What was that?

1364
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:34,000
It was a parody of Prince Ali from Aladdin called DLC. That was so stupid.

1365
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Sorry.

1366
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
You know how to pick them. That was sure dumb.

1367
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I thought it was funny.

1368
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Alright.

1369
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
But what was awesome was the Grand Theft Auto 5 you were playing during the break. You ran over there real quick and turned it on.

1370
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
You were able to show me the little roller coaster sequence on the pier. That looked pretty cool.

1371
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah.

1372
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I was trying to dive into the water too, but unfortunately I picked the spot that was too shallow and so I dived in the water and smacked my head on the ground.

1373
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I did get to see it in water.

1374
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It was, yeah.

1375
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It was something.

1376
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Alright.

1377
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Anyhow, we are going to do a few rapid fire news stories here and then the Fugu question of the week coming up and then listless before too long.

1378
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So I know you guys are excited for that and you can play along with us if you are here live.

1379
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm sorry, podcast listeners. We don't have a way you guys can participate with us yet.

1380
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That is coming. That's a 2.0 upgrade later on. So more like 3.0 at this point.

1381
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with rapid fire news?

1382
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Humble Bundle 9, which I had to buy because unfortunately I am addicted to buying Humble Bundles.

1383
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I am totally addicted to buying Humble Bundles and I bought this one too, the day it was announced.

1384
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So it came with some wonderful games including Fez, Mark of the Ninja, also Brutal Legends, Trying 2, and Faster in the Light.

1385
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Of course, that's just the initial offering. Oh, and Eats Munchies. I guess that's the sequel and that's going to be in beta.

1386
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Faster in the Light and Fez, of course, are if you beat the average, which is only $4.59 right now. It actually went down in price.

1387
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I know I have to give away a copy of Mark of the Ninja at some point because I already have that game.

1388
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I'm surprised we don't have Brutal Legend yet, but the other ones I did not.

1389
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And of course they will be adding more games probably closer towards the end of the pay period there.

1390
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So another nine days, so probably announcing some more games by the end of the week maybe.

1391
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It's worth checking out.

1392
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And to go along with Grand Theft Auto 5, they have this wonderful fake website that they made called, I see, I called it Lifestalker.

1393
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It was Life Invader. Still funny. But what's kind of cool about Life Invader is it's actually a real website you can visit.

1394
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So lifeinvader.com. You can go stalk a bunch of people on there just like following them I guess.

1395
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And what's kind of cool though is it ties in with your Rockstar Social Club account and you can stalk different businesses and it actually gives you in-game discounts and perks that way.

1396
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So it's kind of a cool little thing that they had to do. And of course it plays a part in the game.

1397
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And Rockstar is taking advantage of the cloud. I noticed that when you booted up the game there was a special little icon for when Rockstar is uploading info to the cloud.

1398
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So they can do things like this where you do something on the internet that impacts your game.

1399
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Well that's also going to be mainly for the multiplayer portion with Grand Theft Auto Online because there's a way you can quick switch between the characters.

1400
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And the fourth quick switch option is your multiplayer character. So you'll be able to jump into it right away.

1401
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Jumping back to your previous topic real quick because we have a good question here from Robert M. in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,

1402
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Hey, are Humble Bundle games win Mac Linux still? I'm sure there's no Mark of the Ninja or Fez on Mac and Linux.

1403
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Didn't I read somewhere that Fez was making its Linux debut with this Humble Bundle?

1404
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Usually we'll say when they're on which platforms they're on. Sometimes the Humble Bundles aren't on all platforms. Sometimes they are. It depends.

1405
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:28,000
In this case I believe, let's see here, for Fez it is making its Mac and Linux debut.

1406
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There you go.

1407
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Mark of the Ninja is making its Mac and Linux debut. So these new platforms are debuting with this Humble Bundle. That's awesome.

1408
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Like Trine 2 is not Linux but it is Mac. You usually just watch the video and it should clarify which games are and are not.

1409
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Sometimes it will also clarify what platforms they're on. For example the Origin bundle I don't think was Linux.

1410
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
There's been some other ones that have not been Linux.

1411
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Well good question from the chatroom so I wanted to clarify that.

1412
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And you also get soundtracks by the way too.

1413
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Alright and then on top of that there was also another announcement this week.

1414
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Of course Apple doing their announcements of the new iPhones and stuff.

1415
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,000
So the iPhone 5s is going to be the brand new iPhone and along with that you're going to get Infinity Blade 3.

1416
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Which is going to launch September 20th and is even more amazing because now they have the wonderful graphics chips and stuff like that in the new phones.

1417
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
So yeah that will be coming soon.

1418
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And was it me or was it Infinity Blade going kind of weird? Like what's this futuristic shit in there? I don't know.

1419
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I haven't played since the first one but it looks nice. Something to look forward to if you're getting one of those new phones.

1420
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Which I'm not but it's not enough of an upgrade and I'm already locked in a two year contract with my current phone.

1421
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But if I was up for renewal I probably would be going to the 5s because I didn't have a 5 yet.

1422
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Ah it's one of these stupid pages I'm on that has an autoplay something something. Sorry about that. I don't know which one that was.

1423
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It made your comment that much more dramatic.

1424
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
It did a little bit didn't it? Alright so let's hope that doesn't happen again.

1425
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So quickly I'm going to go through some news here.

1426
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Possibly a Majora's Mask remake on 3DS question mark.

1427
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Because of course we had Ocarina of Time was remade for the 3DS and it was pretty well received and did quite well.

1428
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So a lot of folks were asking for a Majora's Mask.

1429
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So there was a little bit of a tease there.

1430
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Anuma, EG Anuma that is who is the Legend of Zelda series producer was questioned by IGN about it.

1431
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Quote, please write that I laughed. Don't make it sound like that I laughed because I was troubled or inconvenienced or put out.

1432
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I don't want them to read anything into it. But if you want to say that I laughed I think that would be a good answer.

1433
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It's really up to them if we want to interpret my laughter as yeah we're making it or no we're not. I guess that's really up to them.

1434
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I didn't read jack shit into that but some people are clinging to that as oh it could be information about Anuma Jora's Mask.

1435
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Would it have been different if he said I sharted? Don't read into that.

1436
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
It's like I'm just gonna make the game but there's a little bit of poo.

1437
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
So that doesn't mean it's bad poo.

1438
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Anyway moving on.

1439
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Stories about DJ Max Technic EQ is something.

1440
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Oh I know what that is.

1441
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
It's more epic.

1442
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
It's that side. I think that side was.

1443
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Alright so I'll try to summarize it for you guys from what I remember. DJ Max Technic EQ it was announced for iOS and Android.

1444
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:55,000
That was pretty much the big thing right which is interesting because DJ Max they had the PS Vita version that I liked and I thought it did well but I guess not well enough to necessitate future games.

1445
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That's sad.

1446
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Because I don't think they're making anymore on the PS Vita.

1447
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
But like all games.

1448
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Did that come out over here? Was that one of those things you had to import?

1449
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
No it did come out here. I think it was only available on the store.

1450
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
No you could get it through Amazon in really limited quantities.

1451
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Alright and then what ought to have the epic music behind it is Star Trek Pinball.

1452
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And this is actually an arcade thing.

1453
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Star Trek will be getting a new pinball table thanks to Stern.

1454
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
There's a video out there that shows the play field.

1455
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
It's more hand drawn they say than more like the CG slash photoshop information we usually see.

1456
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It will have to do with the reboots so if you're not a big fan of those you might be disappointed.

1457
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
But it will use elements from the reboot movies. It's not strictly based off one or the other.

1458
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:52,000
That's too bad. I thought for a second there that we'd see Jean-Luc Picard teaching us about the quadruple take.

1459
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Well there was a table with Next Generation.

1460
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
There was a Next Generation table.

1461
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You can do that.

1462
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Looking at the pictures that you had on there it sort of looks a little bit like the Next Gen table.

1463
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
But I don't know. Dan has a friend who buys all the Stern tables when they come out.

1464
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
So I'm sure I will get to see it.

1465
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Excellent.

1466
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
He's got the limited edition Tron table which oh my god.

1467
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It has like this frosted glass top on it.

1468
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Nice.

1469
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh it's beautiful.

1470
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I only got to play it like the one time real quick at Disneyland. I want to play it again.

1471
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
You know what else was pretty hot?

1472
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I was playing Metallica pinball with the speaker right by me.

1473
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Oh my god that game is awesome.

1474
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Okay.

1475
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Alright Dark Soccer what do you have for us for rapid fire news?

1476
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Metallica pinball.

1477
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
No. For rapid fire news.

1478
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:41,000
This one I brought up just because I know we have a few racing game fans out there.

1479
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
So for anyone who is looking forward to F1 2013.

1480
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:54,000
The Ferrari that was driven by Nikki Lauda is supposed to be in the game.

1481
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So for fans who are into racers there you go.

1482
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
You get a classic Ferrari in game.

1483
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And then I've also been watching a lot of Top Gear.

1484
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Also in this is some pretty interesting news.

1485
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
For Ridge Racer news.

1486
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Ridge Racer.

1487
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah.

1488
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,000
There is going to be a free to play PC racing game called Ridge Racer Driftopia.

1489
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
That's part of Steam's early access program so it should already be out.

1490
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And thank god we finally have new Ridge Racer news.

1491
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Because I was like how can it be that we have two consoles launching this year and neither one of them have Ridge Racer.

1492
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
What is up with that?

1493
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It's a shame.

1494
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I know. It's a sham is what it is.

1495
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Well the Driftopia beta has already been out for PS3.

1496
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It's a public beta and they said that the official release in Europe is supposed to be not too much later this year hopefully.

1497
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Well Steam you've officially made it. You have a Ridge Racer game.

1498
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Ridge Racer.

1499
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And happy happy happy Puyo Puyo Tetris.

1500
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I'm just trying to figure out how Puyo Puyo and Tetris would breed.

1501
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
But apparently it's Tetris with.

1502
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But they're going to try. God help them.

1503
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I'm wondering if the Tetris blocks are going to have like little Puyos on them or something.

1504
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But Puyo Puyo. I love Puyo Puyo.

1505
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So hopefully it's going to be fun and not you know utterly crappy. I hope.

1506
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
You know me and my Puyo Puyo.

1507
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I know. I know you do love Puyo Puyo.

1508
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Yeah.

1509
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
When was the last big Puyo Puyo game that came out? I remember the DS one but that was the last one I really remember.

1510
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Wasn't that yeah just Puyo Pop?

1511
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Yeah.

1512
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Or Puyo Pop Fever?

1513
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Alright let's go to the Fugal question of the week.

1514
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Take Facebook. Take Google Plus. Smoosh them together and you get Fugal.

1515
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Every week we take to our social networks to ask a question.

1516
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
And this week it has to do with something we talked about earlier in the show. The Steam Family Sharing.

1517
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:08,000
This week we heard that Steam would be implementing Family Sharing which was a feature that had been teased for the Xbox One.

1518
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Many people who were critical of the Xbox One policies embraced the idea of Family Sharing on Steam.

1519
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Do you think there is an unfair double standard in play in the gaming community when it comes to Steam announcing features versus Microsoft announcing Xbox One features?

1520
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Why or why not?

1521
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm going to read just a few of the answers tonight because unfortunately the answers get very long with this.

1522
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
But you have a lot of good stuff so I really want to encourage our community.

1523
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Go read the answers people wrote.

1524
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You can see them at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or in our Google Plus community.

1525
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Just search on Google for Orange Lounge Radio and it will come right up.

1526
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Let's go to Brandon C. who says the Xbox One features outraged people because it meant the end of used game sales.

1527
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Even before Steam and other digital stores selling and buying used PC games was not a huge market just because of the issue with CD keys.

1528
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Even if I give you the right CD key I could still use it for myself to play online for example.

1529
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Meanwhile there is an entire retail chain that is basically built around the idea of buying and selling used console games.

1530
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Critical Myth says the devil as they say is in the details.

1531
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:24,000
While they are similar services in general the context in which they are being introduced is an important factor.

1532
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:34,000
For me Steam's program doesn't look like it would introduce new restrictions above and beyond the PC gaming status quo where the Xbox program as understood would have.

1533
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Seattle replies and says I think the biggest reason Steam isn't catching any crap over this is the fact that Steam doesn't use your webcam and microphone to stalk you through your gaming area yet.

1534
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And offline mode is an option even though it enjoys making me rage.

1535
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It actually exists unlike what the Xbox One had before it became the Xbox One 80.

1536
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So there really isn't a double standard as much as there is a different standard.

1537
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Console games are easier to share but cost more and PC games are harder to share but tend to go on sale more often.

1538
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Degenerajani says trick question the gaming community is full of double standards but I get your point.

1539
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Honestly it's a feature that benefits Valve's market more than Microsoft's.

1540
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Imagine you're a business and your competitor announced a special feature for a product that competes with your products and services.

1541
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
You realize that some of these features would be beneficial for your niche market.

1542
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Unfortunately for your competitor that company's target market rejected the product's limitations that supported those features because they would impede the experiences that consumers enjoy today.

1543
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Thus those features were removed from the product.

1544
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Common sense dictates for a business savvy company to take advantage of a competitor's wasted features to benefit that organization's products and services.

1545
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Another one here on Facebook from Alan Alchemy.

1546
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
There has always been an inferred or proven portability with console games.

1547
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Packing up an entire system in a backpack and taking it to a friend's place, loaning copies of games and so on.

1548
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Microsoft wanted to get rid of that with the strict licensing and killing used games with the online sharing feature being a bandaid to help soothe the burn.

1549
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
It didn't work. PC's and PC users never really had that narrative.

1550
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Yes land parties are a thing but they're associated with very specific fandoms like Starcraft.

1551
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Majority of PC users treat their rigs like immovable glaciers.

1552
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Factor in the reality of CD keys, illegal cracks often being a harbor for malware and other realities PC users have accepted for over 20 years.

1553
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Trading games or systems physically has always been cumbersome or impossible.

1554
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:38,000
So Steam doing this is actually a boon on what we're used to and it's wholly intended as a value add and not a skeezy compromise.

1555
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Taking a look over on Google Plus.

1556
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Act Def says, I've actually seen more people complain about Steam's family sharing not being all that much rather than praising it.

1557
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
For me personally I praised both of the Xbox One and Steam family sharing since I have to share with my brother.

1558
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And these kinds of services make it a whole lot simpler and I don't have to share accounts this way.

1559
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And lastly Travis H says, nope not one bit.

1560
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I think that after Microsoft flip flopped more times than a backward assed politician they deserve every bit of bias and scrutiny they get.

1561
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I don't even think that they knew what they were offering when they were offering it.

1562
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I also think that Microsoft is way too greedy to actually follow through with something as giving as what Steam is doing.

1563
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Steam never has failed to impress the hell out of anyone that is a member.

1564
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Daily sales, summer and winter sales, weekend deals.

1565
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Hell right now I can get all Tomb Raider games for 17 bucks.

1566
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Not to mention the 60 plus free games that are there for the taking by anyone who signs up for a free Steam membership.

1567
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
But as a bias, heavy PC and Playstation gamer, I'm probably just talking crazy right now.

1568
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Kind of seems like a no brainer to me though.

1569
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Those are some of the answers. Check out Facebook and Google for more answers.

1570
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
They're with the Fugu question of the week.

1571
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
What do you guys think?

1572
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Is there a bias in the way we treat Steam announcements versus the way we treat Microsoft announcements?

1573
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Depends on the precedent.

1574
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Steam has done nothing but good things for the most part.

1575
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
We expect to see good from them.

1576
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
We know that when they are offering a service...

1577
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Yeah, I mean they're a business. They want to make money.

1578
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:16,000
But we know that they really are trying to put out a service that is going to be good for their...

1579
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I'm sorry.

1580
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Yeah, for the consumer.

1581
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Loki?

1582
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I would say that it's probably more of like the service was good as it was.

1583
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
But now they're adding another feature. So that's great.

1584
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Whereas Microsoft, they don't really trust them too much because of what they've done in the past.

1585
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:43,000
As far as first off, all these really crazy ideas which I still don't think that they're completely against doing.

1586
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Like eliminating the whole retail marketplace so that they can basically control everything.

1587
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:56,000
But at the same time, it's a service that if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.

1588
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It's not like you have to share your library with other people.

1589
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I think it's just an added feature and there's no real...

1590
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
You're already doing the DRM stuff with Steam so it's not that big a deal.

1591
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
And also, you're not buying games for the most part for $60 a pop.

1592
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,000
You're buying them for very slim fractions of that.

1593
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I don't feel so bad about it.

1594
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I think for me, one big difference.

1595
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I get those tweets that say, why do we always praise Steam but we cut down at Microsoft?

1596
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
For one, there was a lot of confusion with Microsoft.

1597
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Whether whatever you may have thought about Microsoft's system, they were never really clear with the positives of their system.

1598
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
The negatives ended up being pretty clear when they announced that early on.

1599
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
But the positives were always a bit of a haze and that was one big problem.

1600
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But here's the other big thing to remember is that Steam is not a console.

1601
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I know there's rumors about the whole Steam box and everything, but Steam is not a console.

1602
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Steam is a delivery method.

1603
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Steam is a store.

1604
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Steam is a way of acquiring licenses to play on your PC.

1605
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
And your PC is ultimately the device.

1606
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And the perception, whether it's accurate or not, definitely the perception out there about the Xbox One was that that thing was going to be a fucking brick unless you did this and this and this.

1607
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And there were things that people didn't like.

1608
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
The Kinect would have to be on.

1609
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
The thing would have to talk to the internet every 24 hours.

1610
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Or else, you know, it doesn't do shit.

1611
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:33,000
And I think that was one big problem is that, you know, well, even if Steam were to go down or your internet goes down, at least you can still do something with your PC.

1612
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You can still do all the other things that are outside of Steam like Photoshop or writing, word processing, or games that...

1613
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Complaining about Steam being down on the...

1614
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Exactly, through your cell phone or whatever.

1615
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:52,000
But I think the perception is your PC is not going to be a freaking brick if these, you know, negatives, you know, were to occur or whatever.

1616
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
So, again, I don't think there's any reason why Microsoft can't...

1617
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I've been hooting and hollering about this for weeks now on the show, months, is that there's no reason Microsoft can't say,

1618
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Okay, well if Steam is more of a delivery method, then why don't we invoke multiple delivery methods on the Xbox One?

1619
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:17,000
You can either go buy a disc at the store, at Amazon, at Walmart, at GameStop, whatever.

1620
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Bring it home, put it in your console, and it's all the restrictions and things you're used to.

1621
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Your disc has to be in the console for it to work, et cetera, et cetera.

1622
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Or, we can have the Microsoft Store that sells digital licenses that work in this whole new way, and you can family share, and da-da-da-da-da.

1623
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Why not?

1624
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I'm literally saying Microsoft should set up two different stores.

1625
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
It could appease everybody.

1626
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I'm not sure I would see the negative in that.

1627
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
But anyway, that's my big thoughts on the issue.

1628
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:55,000
So thank you guys for sharing yours over at Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or our Google Plus page.

1629
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
So, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1630
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Blackwool says, Actually, when lightning took out my internet for five days, my PC did feel like a brick.

1631
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:11,000
But to be fair, your Xbox One would have been a brick too, especially under those old policies.

1632
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:21,000
So, I mean, sha100matt says, Will people change their tune if the Steam Box has the same requirements and things we didn't like about the original Xbox One?

1633
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Most likely, I think people wouldn't buy it.

1634
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
The Steam Box is going to be a PC.

1635
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Yeah, I think that's what...

1636
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
It's just going to be a PC.

1637
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Yeah, I don't think it will do that.

1638
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
So, all right.

1639
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Datatrak in chat says, As if the normal store isn't already confusing enough.

1640
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm not sure I see that.

1641
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I think maybe, I mean, I don't think it's super confusing.

1642
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Well, confusing to navigate, maybe.

1643
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I'd give you that.

1644
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
You know, it's not always easy to find what you want.

1645
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But, I mean, right now, it's pretty simple.

1646
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You buy the game, it's on your drive.

1647
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
There it is.

1648
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Finding what you want might be another problem, but...

1649
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
It's also, once again, you know, back going, you know, complaining about how it would have been.

1650
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Their marketplace would have been locked down.

1651
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
There's really only one place you can get your digital content from, and that's Microsoft.

1652
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Whereas, if I want to get digital content from Steam, I have a ton of avenues for it.

1653
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I have multiple retailers out there.

1654
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I can buy a physical copy of it.

1655
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I mean, granted, you can buy a physical copy of the disc if you went to, you know, any retailer for the Xbox One.

1656
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
But not a lot of people would be motivated to sell them for any sort of discount.

1657
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
You can buy digital stuff through Humble Bundles.

1658
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And a lot of times, they're competing for lower prices, and you see deals on games all the time.

1659
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I just don't think you would see, you know, that's what everyone thought.

1660
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Oh, if they go all digital, we'll see better prices on games.

1661
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I don't think so, because really, they're not spending that much for the packaged media.

1662
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Remember, it only costs a few bucks, maybe two or three dollars, to actually make that packaged media.

1663
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And they're even cutting back on that by not printing the manuals anymore, or doing any of that stuff.

1664
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So, you're not going to see a huge discount in games from Microsoft, because they have it locked down.

1665
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
If anything, now they can keep games at a higher price.

1666
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Just look at the Vita, for example, in the digital marketplace that was on PlayStation Network for some of the older PSP titles.

1667
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:17,000
They don't drop the digital price on them, even though they're dropping price at retail, for whatever reason.

1668
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
So, that's just how it works, when you have a single marketplace to get something.

1669
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Let's go back into some gaming news. And, Loki, I know you teased these stories a little earlier.

1670
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
All right. So, let's talk a little bit more about Ouya's Free the Games Fund.

1671
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
So, here's kind of what happened.

1672
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
They announced the Free the Games Fund back in July.

1673
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It was going to be this fund that was going to match any earnings from these crowdfunded campaigns, probably through Kickstarter, if their goal was $50,000 or more.

1674
01:56:50,000 --> 01:57:02,000
And then, on top of that, the game that had the largest earnings, I guess, for it through Kickstarter would get an additional $100,000.

1675
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And, anything else would have been matched by Ouya.

1676
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So, at the end of August, there were two games that met that goal.

1677
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
The first one being Elementary My Dear Homes, and the second one is Great Iron Thunder.

1678
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Elementary My Dear Homes, as we talked about last week, the campaign was pulled because of a bunch of fake accounts on there.

1679
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:32,000
They had them named after fictional characters, sports celebrities, all these different people that definitely weren't actually backing the game.

1680
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But, they had basically put their own money into the project so that they'd meet their goal.

1681
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:45,000
So then, that way, when they make their $50,000, Ouya matches that $50,000 and then they make a profit off of it.

1682
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:57,000
At Great Iron Thunder, same thing, they had less than 200 people back it and somehow they had about $180,000 and then they're getting that matched by Ouya.

1683
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Basically, the thing with Great Iron Thunder, yeah, is $171,000 from 183 backers.

1684
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:18,000
So, obviously there was some sort of fraud going on there because it just seems a little fishy that these few people are not even requesting any sort of, they're not like, you know, selecting a $10,000 option.

1685
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:26,000
They're selecting no prize or gift whatsoever, they're just backing it with like multiple thousands of dollars.

1686
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And it was obvious that they were doing that and in the case of Great Iron Thunder, it was a really shitty looking game that they probably already had finished.

1687
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And, in fact, it is coming out at the end of this month. Kind of weird how all of a sudden they were able to turn that game around with over a few hundred thousand dollars in like two weeks.

1688
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
So that was the plan all along. They're not going to make anything off the game, they're just going to make it off of this program.

1689
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So then Julie Ehrman responds back to this, basically saying that, you know, we're not going to change the program at all.

1690
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:09,000
You know, we think things are good the way they are, you know, we heard your complaints that you think that these are scamming us, but we're not going to do anything.

1691
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:15,000
We're not going to alter it. And because of that, there's been a lot of reaction to it.

1692
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:23,000
In fact, there's even one more Kickstarter that I believe just posted, I don't know if it's been funded yet.

1693
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I was going to check that real quick here. It's called Dungeons The Eye of Drakonas.

1694
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:40,000
And, yes, it has been funded. Their backing, was it $10,000 was the goal, and they hit a goal of $53,292.

1695
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:48,000
And this is basically what they said. It's all, dear Pledgers, we have been honest up front with you about our situation from the start.

1696
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,000
As you can see, we currently are only one quarter of the way to our goal before launching this Kickstarter.

1697
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Basically saying, let's see here, we're going to get to the part where they're actually funding it with their...

1698
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Basically, he goes into saying that his father decided to give five checks for a certain amount of dollars.

1699
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:16,000
To people in the family so that they could each back that Kickstarter with that money.

1700
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And because of that, they said, so now you may ask, how does my father have that kind of money?

1701
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Is he rich? No, no, no, no he's not. He lives frugally in a terrible house and all that stuff.

1702
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
He says, for the first time in my life, he's actually helping me with one of the projects.

1703
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
So what does this mean to you? Well, it means that all the tiers are hereby unlocked.

1704
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,000
You and previous Kickstarter Pledges will receive all three episodes and will stream to you once every few weeks.

1705
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It says, everyone wins in this situation. We're going to make an excellent video game for $65,000.

1706
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Ouya matches the funds that come in three disbursements.

1707
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,000
First, $12,500 at the end of the Kickstarter. Second, $25,000 when the game is released.

1708
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
And finally, $12,500 after the six months Ouya exclusive.

1709
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
We have to finish the game before we get the second and third payments.

1710
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,000
You all receive the fully expanded trilogy and all that stuff.

1711
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Thanks to the Ouya funds, we'll be able to afford marketing and have a booth at PAX and all that stuff.

1712
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:21,000
But he funded the game so they would get over their minimum.

1713
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to do it in the first case.

1714
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
So they fund it with their own money and they're going to pay themselves back with the matched funds.

1715
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
So how are people reacting to this, including developers?

1716
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Some people, for example, Sophie Holden, who launched a game called Rose in Time on the Ouya,

1717
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
is going to be pulling her game from the marketplace.

1718
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
So it's basically Julie's response.

1719
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It became very apparent to me that the company does not support the indie developers who need the support the most.

1720
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
And they're incapable of correcting their mistake.

1721
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'm simply no longer comfortable supporting the company.

1722
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Basically saying these smaller developers actually need the money and not $100,000 to develop a game.

1723
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
They're not getting the funding that they need to make this game.

1724
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,000
As we talked about earlier in the show, I wonder how this is going to bode for future consoles.

1725
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
All this mess going on with Ouya.

1726
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Do you think this can be saved? Do you think this can be salvaged?

1727
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It's going to have to be a hell of a game that comes out, right?

1728
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I honestly think that when we see that Gridiron Thunder game come out, which is going to be on the 30th or whatever,

1729
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
it's just going to be terrible.

1730
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
But it's basically checkboxing what they need.

1731
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
They need the game to re-release.

1732
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
They never said that it had to be a good game.

1733
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And they need it to be exclusive for six months to get the full funds.

1734
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
And so they hit those checkboxes and that's it.

1735
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
It doesn't need to sell well because they're going to make their money back from Ouya.

1736
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,000
And unfortunately that's going to nix any ideas that they have as far as doing this in the future.

1737
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Because if that's all it's going to be is a bunch of abuse from people releasing shitty apps on the store,

1738
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:04,000
then they're out even more money and what's this really have gained?

1739
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
If anything, negative press.

1740
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I think most people bought Ouya to be an emulator. Let's be real.

1741
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I think it's starting to show that a little bit now through some of the corruption going on in other places.

1742
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Yeah, and unfortunately even a lot of these other consoles are probably getting better emulators than this thing.

1743
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Alright, let's move on.

1744
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Talk about things going a little better on the PlayStation 3 with some of the free things that they offer on the PlayStation 3.

1745
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
You know a couple weeks ago I talked about the free-to-play Tekken Fighter game.

1746
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Well, news came out this week that Soul Calibur Lost Swords is a free-to-play PlayStation 3 title.

1747
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
This is according to Famitsu.

1748
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's something that's going to be coming out later this year.

1749
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I don't know if that means in the US as well, but we know that's for Japan.

1750
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
It is confirmed it will release in Europe at some point.

1751
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Namco Bandai did file a trademark for this back in July, so we knew something was coming,

1752
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
but I think a lot of people thought maybe like handheld game or spin-off game or something.

1753
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
This will be a free-to-play game.

1754
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Siegfried and Mitsurugi are the first characters that are confirmed to be playable in it,

1755
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
but here's the thing about it.

1756
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
It's a single-player game, not really a head-to-head fighter game.

1757
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Well, they say it is a free-to-play fighter, but I don't know exactly how that's all going to work out

1758
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
if they say it's single-player.

1759
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
There's only very, very low-resolution screenshots out there thanks to Famitsu Magazine's scam.

1760
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
If you wish to buy more resolution, it's going to cost you some money.

1761
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Exactly.

1762
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Well, you know, the Tekken one really wasn't bad, and that was Namco Bandai as well,

1763
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:37,000
so if they kind of used that as a model, it could be a good thing.

1764
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I'm very curious to see what happens with that.

1765
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
All right.

1766
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Well, that's the news for right now, but I think we're going to put the news on hold a little bit

1767
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
so we can do some listless.

1768
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Ah, I love hearing that music.

1769
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
It always means we're going to have a good time here on Orange Lawn's radio.

1770
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
So what we're going to do, we're going to put together the definitive list around a certain topic,

1771
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
and the way listless works, if you don't remember, is that each of us, as well as a guest,

1772
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,000
who I'll introduce here in a minute, will give our top three answers on this topic,

1773
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and then we go around, and the tricky part is we have to eliminate one of the answers off the board.

1774
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
But remember our new twist for listless 2.0?

1775
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,000
If a host has two answers eliminated, that third answer gets immunity.

1776
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You guys get to play along and ultimately vote once we've made our list of, let's see,

1777
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
there'll be four people, there'll be 12 answers, and then it gets narrowed down to eight answers.

1778
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:47,000
So once we're down to eight answers on the board, you guys get to vote live along with us at live.vognetwork.com.

1779
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:54,000
So let's introduce our special guest tonight, since three doesn't make for a very good listless,

1780
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,000
we always like to invite a fourth person from the indie podcast community to come play with us.

1781
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:04,000
So tonight we have Captain Spike with us on the line. Are you there, Captain?

1782
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Ahoy, can you hear me?

1783
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Yes, I can. How you doing, Spike?

1784
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Doing rather well, thank you. How are you?

1785
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Good. So you are one of the two hosts, of course, of gamebuoy.org.

1786
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I know you've been on the show previously to tell us all about that,

1787
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
but what have you guys been talking about lately on gamebuoy.org?

1788
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Well, this weekend we contrasted Capcom's position a year ago to its position this month

1789
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
in relation to how poorly Lost Planet 3 sold.

1790
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Ooh. Yeah, it's interesting what's going on with Capcom, isn't it?

1791
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
It's really one of those things where you look at it and go,

1792
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
what in the hell are they thinking? Or did you guys come to a different conclusion?

1793
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
No, rather certainly. I would say that three of the big gems or jewels

1794
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
coming out of the Japanese game development scene right now

1795
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:55,000
are tied to staff that they sort of brought up into the world.

1796
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
It's really funny to see them flailing and floundering

1797
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
as all of these really important voices in Japanese games

1798
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,000
are coming onto sort of their big opuses, so to speak.

1799
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Spike, actually. I perked up for just one moment because I thought you said R-Type.

1800
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Oh gosh, I didn't, but...

1801
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Maybe next time. Maybe there'll be a Game Buoy Micro on that whole series in the future.

1802
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
If people want to check out that discussion, where can they find that?

1803
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
You can find that over at gamebuoy.org.

1804
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Gamebuoy.org. I had to do that since Slidekick isn't on the show tonight, unfortunately.

1805
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Okay, so tonight's topic for Listless is about the Xbox One,

1806
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
and I'll tell you the specific topic in a minute, but Spike,

1807
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
quickly, your thoughts in a nutshell on Xbox One. Do you have one preordered?

1808
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
It's the first console in the last decade that I haven't preordered,

1809
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
but if I can find one day one, I'll probably end up buying it.

1810
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
That's kind of what I did with Wii U. I was like, I'm not going to buy it,

1811
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I'm not going to buy it, I'm not going to buy it, and then I look at my Target app,

1812
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
oh, it's in stock, fuck, and I bought it, you know, so we'll see.

1813
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Alright, so tonight's Listless is all about the Xbox One,

1814
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:13,000
and the topic tonight is thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.

1815
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Well, you know, the Xbox has taken a lot of kind of kicks in the face

1816
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,000
when it comes to their DRM policy, and then, you know, the whole 180 reversals

1817
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:27,000
they've done on other things, and now this whole thing with Steam

1818
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
got the family sharing, and everybody praised Steam.

1819
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
What did you think about all that, Spike, before we begin?

1820
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Do you think people were fair in praising what Steam was doing versus what Xbox was trying to do?

1821
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,000
You know, I had loaded up your Facebook for Orange Lounge Radio to comment on this,

1822
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
but I saw comments there that reflected exactly my thought,

1823
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
which is that the PC marketplace has operated so different for so long

1824
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,000
that it's really not the same thing. There isn't an expectation of being able to resell

1825
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
and have the portability, as Alan Alchemy had called it,

1826
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
of your games and being able to take your software other places.

1827
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:08,000
For PC, that's not really a thing, so I don't think people are, you know,

1828
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
that expectation that exists in the console market for games to stay open

1829
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I don't think exists in the PC market.

1830
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,000
All right, well, if you are playing along with us at live.vognetwork.com,

1831
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
you're going to see that pop up right on your screen.

1832
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
We're going to put up the board there for Listless tonight.

1833
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
The thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet again,

1834
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,000
because, you know, everybody just really wants to be popular at the end of the day.

1835
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
They need to get their mojo back. They need to...

1836
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
That song just popped into my head.

1837
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
What song?

1838
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
The Not A Surf song.

1839
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I'm popular.

1840
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Well, unfortunately, you get Come On Down as your theme song tonight.

1841
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
That's what you get. All right.

1842
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Captain Spike, since you are our guest, we're going to let you go first tonight.

1843
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
What is your number three answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the internet tonight?

1844
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,000
By the way, sorry, before you answer, if you want to play along in our chat room,

1845
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:06,000
live.vognetwork.com, sometimes we steal chat answers and replace our own with chat answers.

1846
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
So shout out your answers in chat as we go along with this.

1847
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
All right, Spike, what is your number three thing?

1848
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And we're talking about popular on the internet, right? Not actual popular?

1849
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Popular on the internet was what was said.

1850
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
So serious or funny, whatever you want to do.

1851
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Oh, good. Bye, Sega. Rename the Xbox One as the Dreamcast 2.

1852
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:35,000
So rename it to the Dreamcast 2. Didn't that come up as an answer in another list list at some point?

1853
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I don't remember.

1854
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I think that was name of system, maybe?

1855
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Perhaps, yeah. Thing to name the system.

1856
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
All right, well, that could do it.

1857
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Yeah, there was a lot of posts on Twitter and so forth not that long ago on 9999,

1858
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
remember the Dreamcast, XOXO, love you, 5ever, right?

1859
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I remember sitting on the ground outside waiting in line at Arden Fair Mall.

1860
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
All right, so there it is up on the board. Rename it to the Dreamcast 2.

1861
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
All right, Loki, what is your number three answer?

1862
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:12,000
My number three answer would be they need to drop the price of that system at least $100.

1863
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Say $101 just to make it $1.

1864
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Just to make it $1 less.

1865
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
$398.

1866
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
The Xbox $1 less. It is important, right? All right, drop the price at least $101.

1867
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,000
All right, my turn is next. We're going to do ladies last tonight.

1868
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:37,000
My answer is embrace what people really want and give us the pornography channel.

1869
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,000
That's right, pornography app because, you know, porno is always the answer.

1870
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Why can't we just embrace what the people really want? I don't understand.

1871
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It helped VHS win that war.

1872
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
All right, let's go on to DarkSakura, your number three answer.

1873
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
What could the Xbox One do to be popular on the Internet again?

1874
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
A pack-in with every online order. Waffle Iron.

1875
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Free Waffle Iron with every online order.

1876
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Forget a game or a controller.

1877
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Give people what they really want and that's waffles.

1878
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:20,000
They're already waffling.

1879
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:26,000
You're kind of dumb and amazing at the same time right now.

1880
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
See, I made a pun.

1881
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Yeah, I get it. A free waffle iron because they're waffling.

1882
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Oh, good lord.

1883
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
All right, Captain Spike, I don't know how you're going to one-up that, but good luck to you.

1884
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Good luck to you as you go into your number two answer for thing that Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.

1885
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Fling Phil Fish to the moon.

1886
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,000
What do you have against Phil Fish?

1887
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Can I just say everything?

1888
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I suppose that's a valid response.

1889
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:07,000
But how would that sell Xboxes if they, like, it would be something that, like, you could only watch it on the Slingshot app or something?

1890
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
It would get the Xbox One popular on the Internet.

1891
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Yeah, sure. I mean, tie it to a stream on your Xbox One only.

1892
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
People would buy it to watch that.

1893
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Like the pay-per-view event of the millennium.

1894
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
We're going to Fling Phil Fish into the moon.

1895
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:33,000
All right. Loki, dare I ask, what is your number two answer tonight for thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet?

1896
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Uh, let's see. Be backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.

1897
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Very serious answers for me tonight, Loki. Why is backwards compatibility...

1898
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Sorry.

1899
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
No, it's fine. Why is backwards compatibility so important?

1900
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:52,000
It's not, but people bitch about it, so, you know, it would make it important.

1901
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Again, it's about being popular on the Internet when all is said and done, right?

1902
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
All right, so let's put that up on the board. Loki says backwards compatibility with the 360.

1903
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:10,000
My number two answer, my number two answer is, okay, so we all know everybody's losing their shit about Killer Instinct, right?

1904
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Because Killer Instinct got its big remake, even though it's interesting.

1905
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
It's only going to have six to eight characters, but I guess that's a whole nother Oprah.

1906
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:25,000
But I said, you know what? When we were being teased for so long about that Rare is going to bring back a classic franchise,

1907
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I had my fingers and toes crossed for a different franchise to come back.

1908
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:35,000
So my number two answer is, give us the Rare remake we really want, Anticipation.

1909
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Lord.

1910
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:47,000
All right, so I'm just going to shorten that to make Rare do a new Anticipation game as my number two answer.

1911
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:52,000
We'll put that up on the board. All right, Dark Sakura, what is your number two answer?

1912
02:14:52,000 --> 02:15:00,000
A more interactive banning system, meaning like a, I'm trying to remember how to phrase this,

1913
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
like a smart list where when people get certain amounts of complaints made against them,

1914
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:10,000
and I'm talking about real time complaining for people on Xbox Live, that it puts a mark on them,

1915
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
they get a certain number of marks, they're banned or sent to a moderator review to see if they're legit.

1916
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Or you get to sit in the chair next that flings you to the moon.

1917
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Yes. But I mean, but I mean, either that or something that completely removes the anonymity.

1918
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
All right.

1919
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
You know, just some way to hold people-

1920
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
You should be publicly shamed.

1921
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
A way to hold people accountable for being shits on Xbox Live.

1922
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,000
All right. So I did shorten that to the more interactive banning system,

1923
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:44,000
but I honestly think maybe that should just be put Dark Sakura in charge of Xbox Live.

1924
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:51,000
All right, let's recap what we have on the board so far.

1925
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,000
So thing Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again, rename it to Dreamcast 2,

1926
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:03,000
fling fill fish to the moon, drop the price at least $101, backwards compatibility with 360,

1927
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:09,000
pornography app, make Rare do a new anticipation, a free waffle iron with every order,

1928
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
or a more interactive banning system.

1929
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,000
All right. Boy, this elimination is going to be some of the hardest ever tonight.

1930
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Let's see what folks have for their number one answers tonight.

1931
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Captain Spike, your number one answer for what Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.

1932
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I call this one the Nintendo method, money hat, hipster games exclusive that everyone claims to want,

1933
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:41,000
but wouldn't actually buy, like Mega Man Legends 3 or Shenmue 3.

1934
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I'm trying to think how to shorten that. Hipster exclusives.

1935
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And why would Mega Man and Shenmue more than others bring all the boys to the yard?

1936
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Because both of these games are games where everyone on the Internet claims to have loved these games

1937
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
and played them, and ooh, I remember that.

1938
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:06,000
But if that many people played these games, they would have been commercial success.

1939
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:11,000
But mind you, a lot of people pirated them on Dreamcast.

1940
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
That is true. A lot of people pirated them.

1941
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
But if they really loved it, they would have spent the money on it.

1942
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
That's right. You even have people in chat right now. Fifth Dream says,

1943
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Shenmue 3, motherfucker, I want it so much.

1944
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
All right. Good answer, Spike.

1945
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Loki, what is your number one answer tonight?

1946
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:36,000
The Xbox One gets its whole external redesign, ends up being a fully interactive, artificially controlled cute kitten,

1947
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,000
because people love cute kittens and the Internet loves cute kittens more than anything.

1948
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
So the Xbox One will do cute things. Not only will it play your games, but it will sit there looking cute.

1949
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And it is a kitten.

1950
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:56,000
So the box is now an artificial kitten. There it is.

1951
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Because who doesn't love cats?

1952
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Exactly. The Internet. They don't.

1953
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,000
That's right. Internet loves cats. And it was, how do we be popular on the Internet?

1954
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Cats.

1955
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Cats. All right. Excellent answer.

1956
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
All right. My number one answer. I actually went for something serious tonight.

1957
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
And I'm surprised nobody said it yet unless maybe Dark Soccer was sitting on it.

1958
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
But if so, I apologize. I think the thing people want most of all, Detach Connect.

1959
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Damn it.

1960
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Is that really your number one?

1961
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
You can detach it.

1962
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Huh?

1963
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
You can detach it.

1964
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
You know what I mean. Out of the bundle completely.

1965
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
All right. So Dark Soccer, I don't...

1966
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Now I have to pull it out of my ass.

1967
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
All right. Well, you do have her chat room could be shouting some answers.

1968
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Well, yeah, I was. No, because it's already going to be on PS3 and PS4.

1969
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:50,000
That's what I'm getting anyway.

1970
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Making O.L.R. the official voice of Microsoft.

1971
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Now Dark Soccer, we said popular on the Internet.

1972
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Fuck you. I'm popular.

1973
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
We will make people want this shit.

1974
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:13,000
All right. So there it is. O.L.R. will become the official voice of Microsoft.

1975
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I just had a horrible thought.

1976
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:21,000
If we ended up doing the porn app, what if it was like recording stuff with the connect?

1977
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:24,000
When you're not watching. That's why it needs to be detached.

1978
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And then that's the porn channel.

1979
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
All right.

1980
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Let's run down the list.

1981
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
John Weil channel.

1982
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Let's run down the list real quick.

1983
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
If you guys need it up so you can choose what to eliminate, go to live.vognetwork.com.

1984
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Here is the list as it stands right now.

1985
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Rename it to Dreamcast 2.

1986
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.

1987
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Hipster exclusives like Mega Man Legends and Shenmue 3.

1988
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Drop the price at least $101.

1989
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Backwards compatibility with the 360.

1990
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
The box is now an artificial kitten.

1991
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Pornography app.

1992
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Make Rare do a new anticipation.

1993
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Detach connect.

1994
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
A free waffle iron with every order.

1995
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
A more interactive banning system.

1996
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
And OLR becomes the official voice of Microsoft.

1997
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
That is a great list tonight.

1998
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
This is going to be painful tonight.

1999
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
You have to choose which of these is not worthy of the list.

2000
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
It's just too big of a list when it's 12.

2001
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
It's too much.

2002
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
So we need to narrow this down a little bit.

2003
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
So Captain Spike, I'm sorry, but you got to go first.

2004
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Because we make our guests go first.

2005
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Captain Spike, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2006
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
It is awful for you to put me in this position.

2007
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Sorry about it.

2008
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I'm going to take off making Orange Launch Radio the official voice of Microsoft.

2009
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Because I don't want you to sell out.

2010
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Stay independent.

2011
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
He did sugar coat that in a very good way.

2012
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Yeah, but we said we'd sell out in an instant if people want to take us.

2013
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
No, no, no.

2014
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I think he's just a little jealous because there was no room for gamebuoy.org in that sense.

2015
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Maybe I should just read it.

2016
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Vog and Pals.

2017
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Vog and Pals.

2018
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,000
There you go.

2019
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Clearly Game Buoy would be the right voice for Microsoft.

2020
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
You're so far up Nintendo's ass, I don't think you would know what to say.

2021
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
They care about game design. I'm here for that.

2022
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Alright.

2023
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
It is stricken from the list.

2024
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2025
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Just because it's silly and, you know, they don't really make a ton of games anymore.

2026
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Buying Sega and calling it the Dreamcast 2.

2027
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
You're going to eliminate the Dreamcast 2.

2028
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2029
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
You ass.

2030
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Alright, that's alright.

2031
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
It is stricken from the list.

2032
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Rename it to Dreamcast 2.

2033
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Not going to happen.

2034
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Alright, so that comes to my turn.

2035
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Oh my gosh, this is so hard.

2036
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Okay, the internet is going to totally hate me for this, but I am going to say the box is now an artificial kitten.

2037
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I just, it's, it's, I like cats, don't get me wrong, but something about the eyebo like fucking freaks the shit out of me.

2038
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
So I don't want that Xbox to turn into that.

2039
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Can I ever bring over my eyebo?

2040
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I want an eyebo.

2041
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
So unfortunately I'm going to eliminate the artificial kitten.

2042
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Dude, I really want an eyebo because I want to see what Midna would do.

2043
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Especially now that I think of it, a box that poops is also probably out of it.

2044
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,000
So sorry about it. It is removed from the list.

2045
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Real cats are better anyway.

2046
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Alright, so Dark Sakura, last but not least, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2047
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Anticipation.

2048
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Anticipation, because I'm sorry.

2049
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
You're a brat.

2050
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
The only anticipation I care about comes from Frank's mouth.

2051
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I see what you did there.

2052
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Okay, only because you phrased that in a great way.

2053
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
There it is.

2054
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Make Rare do a new anticipation is removed from the list.

2055
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Very interesting the way that worked out tonight because nobody got hosed with two eliminations.

2056
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Each host got one taken off.

2057
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
So fair enough, fair enough.

2058
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Well Spike, we're going to put it to a vote of the public.

2059
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
But hey, I want to thank you for being here tonight.

2060
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Oh, thank you so much for having me.

2061
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Not a problem.

2062
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Let's plug your show one more time.

2063
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Where can folks hear you on the interwebs?

2064
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
And what kind of fun topics do you have coming up next on your show?

2065
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,000
That is gamebuoy.org.

2066
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Oh sorry, it just reflects to wait for someone to repeat it.

2067
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Oh, gamebuoy.org.

2068
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And coming up we have a researched episode on bootleg games.

2069
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Cheetah Man and Donkey Kong Returns 99 and that sort of thing.

2070
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Cheetah Man is awesome and horrible.

2071
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I like how you say it's a researched as opposed to so much other stuff out there on the internet like this program.

2072
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I'm not naming names.

2073
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Have you ever played Cheetah Man or any of the sequels?

2074
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I don't think so.

2075
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Be glad. Rejoice.

2076
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I'm sure it was bad.

2077
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
The music is super good though.

2078
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Are we talking about Color Dreams games on the NES?

2079
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
That's going to be a thing we talk about, yes.

2080
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And the 10 Gen games.

2081
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Oh my god, some of those were really horrible.

2082
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who was the worst NES game in history.

2083
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
It was so horrible.

2084
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
We're going to talk about Bible Adventures.

2085
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Yes, awesome.

2086
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Well actually I will say this.

2087
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
You guys are always very well researched over there.

2088
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I don't know this about you Captain Spike, but you're like a freaking encyclopedia when it comes to games.

2089
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
You know an awful lot.

2090
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Domestic and import.

2091
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
People should check it out if they want to hear something really educated.

2092
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Thank you. Thank you so much for your kind words.

2093
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I love your show. I'm a long time fan. Thank you for having me.

2094
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
We're long time fans of you Spike. Come back and say hi in the studio sometime.

2095
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Thank you, will do.

2096
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Take care my friend.

2097
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Spike, help us out tonight. We are about to make this answerable.

2098
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I just want to remind people as they vote on this.

2099
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
You get to vote for your number one and your number two pick.

2100
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Your first click will be your number one.

2101
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Your second click will be your number two.

2102
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
So think before you vote.

2103
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It is now put to the vote of the listeners.

2104
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Help us come up with the definitive list.

2105
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
We will keep this open for a few minutes.

2106
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
While we do a couple more stories here.

2107
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I think we're going to go to the mail bag.

2108
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
We have a mail.

2109
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
One email tonight.

2110
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
And apparently we can get cheap Viagra.

2111
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2112
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
While we open up the mail bag.

2113
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
If you want to send us an email about Viagra or otherwise.

2114
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

2115
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Maybe you could send us a well researched email on bootleg games.

2116
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And we can one up what Game Boy is doing.

2117
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I have to make a mention of something by the way.

2118
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I've seen a lot of people try to do stuff on GoFundMe.

2119
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,000
And I wonder if I put up a GoFundMe if people would send me to Comiket.

2120
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
But what are they going to get out of it?

2121
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Me at Comiket.

2122
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I'll bring back toilet paper.

2123
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Alright. What's that email we got tonight?

2124
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Okay we got something from CatastrophicMaggie who I chat with all the time on Steam.

2125
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Evening all is your very favorite CatastrophicMaggie. Smile.

2126
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I've been pretty psyched for Telltale's new game A Wolf Among Us.

2127
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Which is a prequel to the Fables comics.

2128
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I like the Fables comics for the record.

2129
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
You guys haven't mentioned it yet.

2130
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Apart from Jamie who I'm continually pestering on Steam anyway.

2131
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Have you seen anything about it yet?

2132
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Mainly just the trailer.

2133
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
In other news. I honestly haven't seen anything on it by the way.

2134
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:19,000
In other news I've always wanted to go to one of the big American cons.

2135
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,000
So given VoG's ties with Dragon Con nowadays.

2136
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I'm going to aim for that one in 2015.

2137
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
So you'd better be there Rob.

2138
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
2015? Not 14.

2139
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Well it takes time to save up.

2140
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
No you're right. It does take time. I'm just saying.

2141
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
If I have as good of a time next year as I did this year and I don't see why I wouldn't.

2142
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I would absolutely go back every year as long as I can afford it.

2143
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Hear you later, Maggie.

2144
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
So I don't know how well it's going to do to play the trailer on the air.

2145
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
No I don't really want to play it on the air.

2146
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
But where can people look that up? Is that just on YouTube?

2147
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
It's on YouTube.

2148
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Well people can look that up on YouTube.

2149
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
So it's A Wolf Among Us.

2150
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Well there you go. You can just Google that and you'll find that.

2151
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:03,000
And I pretty much do kind of chat with Maggie every day come to think of it.

2152
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Yeah he chats with me on Steam once in a while too.

2153
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:08,000
And he was good enough to. He's the one that got me.

2154
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Oh god and now I forgot the name of that game.

2155
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,000
That other scary game. Paranormal. The one that I played.

2156
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
That was another scary game that I played a little bit.

2157
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Maggie's been trying to get me into Shin Megami Tensei.

2158
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Which I probably will play it eventually.

2159
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I've got a bunch of games on my plate, man.

2160
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Okay. So that's it.

2161
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:30,000
One email apart from Viagra.

2162
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Which I don't know about you but I have no problems with that part of anyone's anatomy.

2163
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Alright. We are going to move on with some news.

2164
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Again you can vote in the list list tonight. Live.vognetwork.com.

2165
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Oh before we get to the news we have to get to the angst with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2166
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Why do we do a segment called the FUs of the Week on the video game show?

2167
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Because if you were me fighting the Cerberus boss in Kingdom Hearts earlier today there was a lot of rage.

2168
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I'm going to give a big FU to anti-Semitism.

2169
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Not just because of things that happened earlier.

2170
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
But because it's...

2171
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And this is the people who are like, oh well we're Christians and we're persecuted here in America.

2172
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
No you're not. You don't have to have the cops at your Christmas services.

2173
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,000
To keep people from breaking into your cars or throwing bricks at your place of worship.

2174
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
So an FU to that.

2175
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
FU to intolerance in general.

2176
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Yeah. FU to intolerance.

2177
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
And the cops have been really good about it every year.

2178
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
They just make a presence and we don't have any trouble.

2179
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
But I just don't think it's horrible that it's necessary.

2180
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Absolutely.

2181
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,000
So FU to that.

2182
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Alright, Logie.

2183
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
FU to Logan's Roadhouse.

2184
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Their fried cheese hamburger because it was not good.

2185
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:21,000
You would think that a patty of fried cheese would be good on a burger.

2186
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
But it was not.

2187
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
That's why you need to go to squeeze in.

2188
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I've been to squeeze in and their burgers are not good.

2189
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And I was sorely disappointed because it sounded awesome like a cheese grip.

2190
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
They burn the shit out of their burgers and they don't season the patties at all.

2191
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
So they tasted like crap.

2192
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I can't remember like the last really good hamburger I had where I went like,

2193
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Mmm, that is a tasty burger.

2194
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Red Robin's burgers are pretty good if you put a ton of their seasoned salt on it.

2195
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
It makes their burgers taste really good.

2196
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I like In-N-Out.

2197
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Rob, I'm going to have to take you to California Burger.

2198
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Oh, I like Smash Burger.

2199
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I took Alan there.

2200
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Oh yeah?

2201
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
He really likes it.

2202
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Nice.

2203
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Oh, he sent me a picture and I was like, that burger is drenched in mayonnaise.

2204
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
That looks disgusting.

2205
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Well, they put, you can get it without.

2206
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Thank God.

2207
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
They do like Thousand Island dressing and other stuff too.

2208
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Yeah, that's all the devil's work.

2209
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I love mayonnaise for the record.

2210
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
My F.U. of the week goes to mayonnaise first and foremost every week.

2211
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:26,000
And my other F.U. goes to, you know, as much as I love this time of year pumpkin everything.

2212
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
It's making me die.

2213
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,000
My F.U. to all the sugar that I'm eating right now.

2214
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
It's making me gain weight when I should be trying to lose it to do sexy cosplay next

2215
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
year at Dragon Con.

2216
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
So F.U. to sugar.

2217
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Can I add another one, Rob?

2218
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
No.

2219
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Let's go to the next story.

2220
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Yes, you can add another one.

2221
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:49,000
A big F.U. to all of the people who are sending poor hussy death threats.

2222
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I know you don't like the, this is a Homestuck thing by the way.

2223
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Oh.

2224
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I know you don't like what happened in the last update.

2225
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
A lot of us were like, oh shit.

2226
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,000
But it's no reason to send somebody freaking death threats.

2227
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
It's a story.

2228
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
And I have to commend him for being very positive about the whole thing.

2229
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Well good.

2230
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:16,000
It's a very, it's a very mature sign when the author who is apparently receiving said, you know,

2231
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:21,000
teenage crap is being very gracious and focusing on the good parts of the fandom.

2232
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
So good for you.

2233
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Alright.

2234
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:28,000
A few more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your calls

2235
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2236
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
But not just yet.

2237
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
We still have a couple more stories first.

2238
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Loki.

2239
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Alright.

2240
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,000
So let's talk a little bit about Duke Nukem Forever.

2241
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Yeah.

2242
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Apparently, I don't know if you guys remember, but a few months ago there was this whole

2243
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:54,000
lawsuit with 3D Realms trying to get their royalties from Gearbox and all that stuff.

2244
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Apparently, you know, they were owed $2 million.

2245
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:01,000
But apparently they've dropped the case.

2246
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I'm not sure if they've settled it or what the case is.

2247
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:09,000
After reviewing evidence regarding our business affairs and without any money exchanging hands,

2248
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,000
we have satisfactory resolved any and all differences we perceived against Gearbox.

2249
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
And so they've apologized.

2250
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Hmm.

2251
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I don't know what that means.

2252
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,000
But.

2253
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Boy.

2254
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Yeah.

2255
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Kind of interesting how that all ended with an apology.

2256
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Yeah.

2257
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Basically, here's the press release.

2258
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
It says, who am I concerned after reviewing the evidence regarding our business affairs

2259
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,000
and without any money exchanging hands, we have satisfactory resolved any and all differences

2260
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
that we perceived against Gearbox.

2261
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
In all sincerity, we regret the misunderstanding that instigated our lawsuit and now that

2262
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
we better understand and appreciate the actual nature of our business matters,

2263
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
we have voluntarily withdrawn our claims against Gearbox with genuine apologies to Randy

2264
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
for any damage that our lawsuit may have caused the relationship.

2265
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:00,000
So seriously, or sincerely, Scott Miller.

2266
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
So in other words, they hugged it out.

2267
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Essentially.

2268
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I guess.

2269
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I don't know.

2270
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't any royalties to be made because it made no money.

2271
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I don't know what the case may be.

2272
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
But whatever.

2273
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
They're frenzies now.

2274
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
So yeah.

2275
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,000
All right.

2276
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Well, last but not least, our longtime music game fans will probably be happy to hear this.

2277
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
This was always a adorable little music game series that not everybody knows about.

2278
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
But maybe you should hear about Taiko Drum Master, which is also known as Taiko no Tatujin.

2279
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Taiko Drum Master Namco Bandai will be bringing it to the Wii U.

2280
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Famitsu has mentioned that you can play Taiko Drum Master Wii U version with a taiko drum accessory.

2281
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,000
It'll be available for the Wii, Wii remotes, or the Wii U game pad.

2282
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,000
The game pad controls will be optimized to be simple for game players.

2283
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I'm hoping you're not going to beat that game pad with a stick.

2284
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I'm sure it's like tapping or something.

2285
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
They're doing a little different.

2286
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Baton change mode is a new mode where between two to four players will work together in playing one song.

2287
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
There'll also be Nintendo crossover content like Mario Luigi Masks.

2288
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And one of the songs that will be playable in the game, Wild Pokémon Battle Medley.

2289
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,000
So we'll have a little bit of that crossover there to make it even more appealing to Nintendo fans.

2290
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
So there you go.

2291
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,000
No word on when.

2292
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:25,000
You can just look forward to it, I guess next year, I would think at this point.

2293
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
So there you go.

2294
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Do you guys ever play Taiko no Tatujin?

2295
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
It's been a long time, but I like that game.

2296
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Last time I played it was on PSP.

2297
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I don't think I've played it since they originally put the US PlayStation 2 one out.

2298
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I have the US ones.

2299
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:46,000
And because Dan actually, back when he got to take home Field Destroys, that's how I got mine.

2300
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Okay.

2301
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
It worked. I don't know.

2302
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
All right. Well, now's the part of the show where we're going to open it up to your calls.

2303
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2304
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
You can give us a call to talk about whatever you'd like to.

2305
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Perhaps something we've talked about tonight or something that we missed.

2306
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
You can also still vote on list lists.

2307
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:13,000
We'll close that up at the end of the show, the very end tonight, once everybody has had a chance to call in or what have you.

2308
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Loki, do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls?

2309
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Just one, Grant. That's auto-related.

2310
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It's been found by digging through the files of the game that it makes reference to PC and PlayStation 4 in the form of Orbis.

2311
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
So most likely those versions will be coming.

2312
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:43,000
And I would assume that an Xbox One version would be coming as well unless there's some sort of financial exclusive trickery or whatever that they're going to be pulling.

2313
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
All right. Let's go to the phones because we are getting a call.

2314
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2315
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Hello, it's Shane.

2316
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Hey, Shane. How are you doing?

2317
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I am running a dungeon, so I'm doing pretty well.

2318
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
In Final Fantasy XIV, you're multitasking?

2319
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Well, I might not pay attention to the phone call.

2320
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Well, thanks for calling when you had so much attention to give us tonight.

2321
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
How is Final Fantasy XIV going for you? You're all the way in Endgame, right?

2322
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Uh, yeah. I am actually running a dungeon that's for max level and it seems pretty terrible so far because the tank left when the three of us that joined said we've never ran this one before, so we just auto-quit the dungeon.

2323
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
What a jerk.

2324
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I know, right? She got his name so I could publicly shame him.

2325
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
You should. Do that in the future.

2326
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Quickly, I know you'll talk about some of this on Horde House this week, but what is there to do when you get to the Endgame in Final Fantasy XIV? What happens when you get to 50?

2327
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Gear up for the actual Endgame? Because that's what I'm doing right now. I'm running the hard mode Primal Battles, so I got a weapon from there already, which is pretty awesome. It took only two tries.

2328
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:57,000
And I'm running level 50 dungeons to get currency to get better gear.

2329
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
So after the grinding of leveling up comes more grinding?

2330
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Yeah, but it's not bad. I'm having fun with it.

2331
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Alright, well that's important. Alright. Well, did you call to talk about XIV tonight or what did you want to talk about tonight?

2332
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,000
No, I called to talk about the 2DS.

2333
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Oh, yes. The Nintendo 2DS was announced, what, last week? About a week ago? Two weeks ago?

2334
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Two weeks ago? Two weeks ago? Something like that.

2335
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Well, a lot of internet anger about this thing. How dare Nintendo put this thing out because it looks stupid, basically, was the verdict of the internet courtroom. What do you want to say about it?

2336
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Well, if you know my job, I kind of get Nintendo stuff early, and so I have my 2DS.

2337
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And I have to say that I just barely, barely like it less than my 3DS XL. It is a wonderful system.

2338
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Really?

2339
02:37:53,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Yeah, it's comfortable to hold. The way the design, the slate design is awesome. Like, I don't know, if the screens were a little bit bigger, I probably wouldn't play my XL at all. It's that nice to me.

2340
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
What do you think people on the internet are getting wrong about this thing?

2341
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Um, I'm not, I'm not sure they are, because it's not, it's geared really more towards, like, an entry-level, first-time, current generation of Nintendo handheld experience.

2342
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:45,000
So these people that are, like, saying, oh, this is awful, why would anybody get this, it's not geared towards them. It's geared to, like, the 5 and 6-year-olds that didn't have one before, or the person that didn't want to shell out $170 to play the latest Mario or Pokémon.

2343
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Now, you can shell out $130, and you don't get the 3D features, but you still get a really great experience.

2344
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I know a teenager who wants a 2DS.

2345
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Pretty much for that reason.

2346
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Yeah, it's great. I really hope a lot of people get their hands on it. If you are going out to GameStops or Walmarts or Targets this week, you might run into a Nintendo app and they might be able to show you one, so you can play around with it and see how you really feel about it.

2347
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:25,000
But I love it. And the little case that you can buy extra is adorable, and it's also shaped like a piece of toast, so it's pretty cool.

2348
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Would you really have dropped the $129 or whatever the price is? Would you really have dropped that amount of money on this device?

2349
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:44,000
If I didn't have any form of 3DS, yes. If I had a regular 3DS and then got to mess with this, yes. But because I have an XL, personally, no.

2350
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:51,000
But that's just because I already have an XL, and I think this is just slightly under the XL in terms of how great it is.

2351
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Pokémon's almost here, right?

2352
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Yeah, it is.

2353
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Are you excited about that?

2354
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,000
What?

2355
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Are you excited about that?

2356
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:02,000
No, I'm not excited whatsoever for Pokémon.

2357
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Aren't they supposed to announce something? Didn't Twitter tease some type of announcement tomorrow?

2358
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Tomorrow at 8 AM Pacific, so it's the first time in forever for some sort of announcement that I don't have to get up early for.

2359
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:23,000
There you go. Do you think it might be anything that's not about X and Y, like something of the future of Pokémon?

2360
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I'm not sure. I really don't know. I'm just as excited as everybody else is.

2361
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Alright, and before we wrap up tonight, why are you so damn excited about Pokémon X and Y? What about it is exciting?

2362
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:50,000
It's taking the game to new graphical and like, I don't know what the word is I'm looking for. It's the evolution of Pokémon.

2363
02:40:50,000 --> 02:41:00,000
And that's exciting because, you know, black and white, it was a nice jump, but it wasn't a real jump. It was kind of like a little step up. This is a huge jump forward.

2364
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Alright. Well, Shane, if you don't have anything else, I guess we'll let you get back to your dungeon. Thanks for calling.

2365
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Alright. Bye. He makes it sound like he didn't want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call.

2366
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:22,000
This is also the last call to vote in listless. You do need to be a registered VoG participant, but we don't charge money for that. We're not like that.

2367
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Just sign up at vognetwork.com and then you will see the board up at live.vognetwork.com.

2368
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And big thanks to Bobby Blackwell for coding this little game. And he had to fix it on the fly tonight because I guess it was actually broken.

2369
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:40,000
When it went to tabulate, it was taking the last listless we did, which was the first one on the system, and it was combining the votes together.

2370
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
So the wrong answer was winning. So, but he fixed it. So now we have the accurate results.

2371
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
The last time we did listless was thing I most want to happen at E3 2013. That gives you an idea how long ago that was.

2372
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:58,000
So, alright. So this is your last chance to vote in listless. Don't forget to vote for your number one and your number two answer with your first and second clicks there.

2373
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Again, phone lines are open. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2374
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I will try to bring up the Twitter topics here real quick. No other last minute stories, Logie?

2375
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:14,000
No, I'm just, I'm looking through grants without a file now.

2376
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Alright, well we do have another call coming in, so let's go to the phones and we'll take that.

2377
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2378
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Holy shit, I got through. It's Ranma.

2379
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Hey, Ranma. How you doing?

2380
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Hello.

2381
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Thank you so much. The thing is, I wasn't even going to call. Let everybody else, you know, call in, you know, hey.

2382
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Yeah, you know, the phone lines haven't been lighting up as much this month as previously. Like last week I seem to remember was really tough. We barely got any calls last week either. It was weird.

2383
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Do I have to have another open Skype challenge?

2384
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:58,000
No, I figure, you know, some weeks people have things to say and some weeks they don't. This was a pretty slow news week all things considered. There wasn't really anything that really ignited passion maybe in previous weeks.

2385
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
I see.

2386
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I thought maybe we'd hear more about Sony and the whole, like, just from the listeners because Sony did that big thing on Sunday night, but, you know, that was a whole week ago at this point, which in internet years was about three years ago.

2387
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,000
So, well what's on your mind, Ranma? To what do we do with this phone call tonight?

2388
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Rob, would you like to hear about the game that got me to stop playing Candy Crush Saga?

2389
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Absolutely.

2390
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Alright, you've heard of the game Namco Cross Capcom, right?

2391
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Yes.

2392
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,000
And the now spiritual actual sequel, Project Cross Zone.

2393
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Yes, the name of our panel at GamerX was inspired by that podcast Cross Zone, yeah.

2394
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Nice. I just want you to know I have been playing this game for about three weeks straight. I have almost 50 hours logged into the game.

2395
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Wow.

2396
02:43:44,000 --> 02:44:04,000
I mean, this is like, I see my, I'm sitting here watching stuff on DVR to catch up and I'm like, pause, go grab the 3DS, sit down, unpause, just turn the volume down on the game, start playing, and I'm like, pause DVR, put the volume back up, put the headphones on and just keep playing.

2397
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:12,000
What is it about this game that makes it so amazing? Is it just the cutscenes and this and the way you get sucked into it that way?

2398
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:22,000
No, it's the fact that I call it an, it's not just a tactical RPG, it's an action tactical RPG. Real-time RPG.

2399
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Whereas before, you know, with games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars, you set your characters and you sit there and you watch them attack each other.

2400
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Mhm.

2401
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:50,000
In this, you move your character to the person you want to fight and then the screen comes up, you hold down the attack button, you do one attack, then you do another series of combinations, like it could be attack and left and up and down and then right, and it'll just keep doing a series of attacks right behind each other.

2402
02:44:51,000 --> 02:45:02,000
But in Project Cross Zone, you can have a third person part of your team, and that person's with you, you hit the L button, they just come inside doing anywhere from 15 to 20 hit combos.

2403
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:18,000
And if somebody's within your space, that's your support. You hit the R button, they come in and do more damage, and if you time it just right, before you do your special, you could do a 90 hit combo that does up to 10,000 points of damage.

2404
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:27,000
You know, I'm not hearing a lot about this game. It seems to be a game that really is flying under the radar. What do you think people are missing about this game?

2405
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I think it's because you have different gaming properties in it. You have Rival Schools, you have Space Channel 5, you have .hack, Street Fighter, the Tales of series, Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Force.

2406
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:53,000
It's like, it's pretty much Sega, Namco, Bandai, and Capcom just had a freaking gaming orgy. And the storyline is just phenomenal as well.

2407
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
And you get to clean it up.

2408
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Yeah.

2409
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
That sounds hot.

2410
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:05,000
So even the storyline incorporates all this like cross IP fuckery.

2411
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I think I sent Jamie a screenshot, or I posted it on my wall for her to look at, for a little in-joke or something like that.

2412
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I believe that you did, and I can't get onto my Facebook right now.

2413
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Yeah, something about the fantasy zone. Get ready. I'm like, oh! Oh, Jamie's gonna love that.

2414
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
One of Jamie's favorite quotes.

2415
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Yes.

2416
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And I've been meaning to record this one scene by having that time, but there is a scene when you're playing with Ulala and you call her out as a support.

2417
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
She fires with her guns. The Opa comes in and starts blowing shit up.

2418
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:49,000
And the dude from Space Harries jumps out of nowhere and just does like a series of attacks out of nowhere.

2419
02:46:49,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Alan Alchemy in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, no shade, but it's a fan service game with a lot of niche franchises in a format, strat RPG, that generally isn't a heavy hitter and only appeals to certain gamers, which of course makes it completely phenomenal.

2420
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Is this one of these hipster games that might save the Xbox One if tonight's list is to be believed?

2421
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Maybe, but I was just saying to a bunch of friends of mine, if they ever did a brand new Naruto video game in this style, I would sit down and play it from start to finish, because it would fit.

2422
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
All right.

2423
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Yes.

2424
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Well, Rama, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

2425
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,000
My liberal will never forgive me from this past weekend.

2426
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
How so?

2427
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I went to Nauticon, a 21 plus anime gaming convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

2428
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Oh my.

2429
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Oh, you have no idea, good sir.

2430
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Let's just say in one night I drank typically what I would have drank over three nights.

2431
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Wow.

2432
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
That was like me at Dragon Con though, to be honest.

2433
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
But I haven't been drinking a lot lately, so I've been well behaved.

2434
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
All right.

2435
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Well, Rama, I'm glad to hear you had fun.

2436
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:13,000
We can hear all about that con and more cons on your little program that you co-host here at VOG Network, Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights, right?

2437
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:14,000
That's right.

2438
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
All right.

2439
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Pre-show starts around 9.15, 9.20, right after our brand new neighbors at Electric Sisterhood.

2440
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Sounds awesome.

2441
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
All right, take care, buddy.

2442
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
You too.

2443
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Bye-bye.

2444
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Bye-bye.

2445
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:28,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2446
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:33,000
We have about one more moment to take calls and we'll reveal the results of Listless as well.

2447
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I was just going real quick to see if we had any tweets.

2448
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:45,000
And we did get a couple tweets from TigerCaw and one of the stories he tweeted us, I remember reading about this.

2449
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Did you hear about this on the internet this week?

2450
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:52,000
JJ Abrams emotionally hurt by the latest Star Trek game.

2451
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Yeah, I saw that.

2452
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I wasn't going to post it, but I was like, that's stupid.

2453
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:00,000
What did you guys think about that, that he was so hurt about it?

2454
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I could see that.

2455
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Yeah?

2456
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
That game was pretty bad.

2457
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Yeah, I heard it was pretty bad too.

2458
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:07,000
All right, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.

2459
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
I love this icon this guy has too.

2460
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.

2461
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Who's this?

2462
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
This is Code Man.

2463
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Hey, Code Man, I love your little user picture.

2464
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:24,000
It's like who I envision is you and a little creeper drawn Minecraft style with little Mickey Mouse balloons and mouse ears.

2465
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Like it's the most random collage of worlds, but I love it.

2466
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I want to make it into a shirt, but I don't know if Disney will attack me with copyrights if I make it into a shirt.

2467
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Nah, that might happen. You got to be careful with that.

2468
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
You better have them go to Six Flags.

2469
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2470
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Kingdom Hearts HD Remix. It's absolutely fantastic.

2471
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Yeah?

2472
02:49:49,000 --> 02:50:00,000
You know, I haven't played the first one in so long, and bringing that back into my life, because I remember I was 17 when it came out and I bought it on launch day.

2473
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:08,000
And I remember playing it and imagining how could any game get any better than this game?

2474
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Because I'm a huge Disney fan, I'm a huge Squeenix fan, and so I'm all over all of these games.

2475
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:24,000
And so when they came together and made this fantastic game, I was just going crazy.

2476
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:31,000
But when they announced that they were releasing this HD Remix, I absolutely went crazy.

2477
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:35,000
And so when I popped it in and started playing it, they have changed.

2478
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Of course, I never played the final mix because it was never released in North America.

2479
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:48,000
But the music sounds different, obviously the graphics are just phenomenal.

2480
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:59,000
And there's so many different things now that maybe I missed when I played it earlier, or they weren't actually in there. I don't know.

2481
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:04,000
I think too just the fact that it's been, what, 12 years since the game was first out.

2482
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,000
I think you just kind of catch on to more, and you're probably a different gamer now than you were then.

2483
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
So you just kind of find different things that way.

2484
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:17,000
But is it just me, Codeman? Or did you lose skill over 12? Or maybe you got better, I don't know.

2485
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:21,000
But why am I so bad at this kid's game?

2486
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
This game is tough as hell.

2487
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I'm playing on Proud Mode, because I figured, okay, I'm going to play on Proud Mode.

2488
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I started Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and I still want to play Dream Drop Distance.

2489
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:45,000
But like I said in chat earlier, I don't own any Nintendo handhelds, and I'm trying to figure out which one to buy.

2490
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Although Shane's kind of leaning me towards the 2DS. I don't know, though, because the 3D makes me sick.

2491
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I don't like 3D, but I know you can turn it off and all that stuff.

2492
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:57,000
He does that to people. Look out. He's the best salesman in the video games industry.

2493
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:00,000
He's the one that got me started on Final Fantasy XIV, but I don't want to talk about that.

2494
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:06,000
But I don't know. It's so tough.

2495
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I'm anticipating the infamous fight with Sephiroth.

2496
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I've beaten him several times when I was a kid.

2497
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I beat him a million times, because he was tough.

2498
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:26,000
The platinum, I can't remember what it was called, but it was the platinum whatever that you fought him.

2499
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
He was the hardest character in the whole game.

2500
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I'm anticipating that fight, because I know now I started playing it again, and I'm like,

2501
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:40,000
God, this game is so difficult. And I don't remember it being that difficult when I was a kid.

2502
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:43,000
No kidding. I'm still getting my butt whipped by Cerberus.

2503
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:47,000
But I seem to recall, and I think I might have had to do this the first time I played 2,

2504
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:52,000
you can actually skip that fight and go on to the next world, and then go back and do it later.

2505
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
It's a lot easier, so I think that's what I'm going to end up having to do.

2506
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Ah, I probably should have done that.

2507
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Enough about my problems.

2508
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Let's see, what else did I want to ask you about?

2509
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Because there was something else.

2510
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Oh, you were kind enough to gift me a copy of this game Outlast on Steam.

2511
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
What am I in for?

2512
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:14,000
First off, thank you. I want to publicly thank you.

2513
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Although, as I understand it, maybe I should also be saying curse you.

2514
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:21,000
What inspired you to get me this game?

2515
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Well, you know, because I've watched your livestreams.

2516
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I don't really get a whole lot of time to do anything, really.

2517
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,000
So I have to watch your livestreams when you post them like a nerd.

2518
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:42,000
But I watch your livestreams that I find how hilarious when you play.

2519
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Like, Paranormal wasn't as bad because I don't think that game...

2520
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I don't know. That game's kind of cheesy to me.

2521
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,000
I played it, and some of the scares were fine.

2522
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
But then when you played Slender Man, that was hilarious.

2523
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
So I'm trying to figure out something in my head.

2524
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I was like, okay, so what can I buy Rob to play that would be the funniest, scariest,

2525
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:14,000
and all-around entertaining livestream that he plays.

2526
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:18,000
But this game Outlast came out, and one of the guys that I talked to

2527
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:22,000
that was on my podcast, he was like,

2528
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:25,000
this game is the scariest game I've ever played in my whole entire life.

2529
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
And so I was like, okay, well maybe this is the game that I should...

2530
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
And I never really heard a whole lot about it.

2531
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:33,000
I mean, I watch, you know, whatever.

2532
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,000
But I don't really play games like that, so I thought,

2533
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
okay, well maybe I should gift that to him.

2534
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So I gifted that to you, and you are in for a ride, my friend.

2535
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I hear. It's something else.

2536
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I'm not a big fan of the blood and gore, and apparently there's plenty of that in Outlast.

2537
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:50,000
But I will make good on a livestream at some point.

2538
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:53,000
I'm not sure when, but soon. We'll see. We'll see.

2539
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,000
You've got to tear me away from Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts for a little bit first.

2540
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:59,000
But I do really appreciate it, Coatman.

2541
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
You know what you're talking about.

2542
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Coatman, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, get lists done and all that stuff.

2543
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:08,000
But any last quick thoughts for us?

2544
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:13,000
If you're not playing the Kingdom Hearts HD remix, you should definitely pick it up.

2545
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:17,000
I've got to party with that guy sometime.

2546
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
That guy, he sounds like a fun character.

2547
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:22,000
He is a very fun character. If you ever go to New York City,

2548
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
you look him up and say Rob Roberts sent you.

2549
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
He'll show you a good time.

2550
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:29,000
I have a friend in New York that will be with him pretty soon,

2551
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
so yes, I will definitely look him up.

2552
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Or shit, go to any anime convention on the entirety of the East Coast,

2553
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
and you'll probably run into him.

2554
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Oh, I'm sure. He's dressed up as Luigi, right?

2555
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Sometimes. I heard he might retire that soon.

2556
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
You'll have to, or maybe that was Rama.

2557
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
I don't want to speak for him.

2558
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:51,000
You will have to just listen to Anime Jam Session to get all the latest.

2559
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Alrighty.

2560
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Alright, you take care my friend.

2561
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Alright, thanks.

2562
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:56,000
Alright, bye bye.

2563
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Thanks for the calls guys, but we are going to close up the Skype line for now.

2564
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:02,000
If you had something you wanted to say and you didn't get through,

2565
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:05,000
you should absolutely email us.

2566
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Mailbag at orangelauntrady.com

2567
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:11,000
or you can always tweet us, such as Tigerclaw did with one other story

2568
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:15,000
that I want to read here real quick about the PlayStation 4 sharing options

2569
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
and the whole game recording.

2570
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Apparently, things coming out about how you're going to have to break the DRM

2571
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,000
of the high bandwidth digital content protection

2572
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:28,000
if you want to stream outside of the built-in game streaming,

2573
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
which as you know could be shut off for certain games

2574
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:34,000
because PlayStation 4 doesn't have component cables,

2575
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:37,000
and that's how people were getting around it on the PlayStation 3.

2576
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:42,000
There's ways to strip that out.

2577
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:48,000
There's like, uh, there are, there is apparently like a box you can get that strips it out,

2578
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
like an HDCP stripper, but when you do that, you're breaking the law.

2579
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:57,000
You are violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it prohibits.

2580
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Oh yeah, they're going to send cops to your house right away.

2581
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
That's right. They will call the po-po.

2582
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
It's just like when you rip off that tag on your mattress.

2583
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Someone's been ripping that tag.

2584
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,000
No, it's only if you resell it after ripping off the tag.

2585
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
You don't get arrested for ripping off the tag.

2586
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,000
The seller does, just so you know.

2587
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Alright, by the way, I have to read this amazing drag from Alan in chat.

2588
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I love this. Alan Alchemy in our chat room.

2589
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:29,000
This is a response to Tigerclaw's article earlier about how JJ Abrams was emotionally hurt by the game.

2590
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Perfect way to end the show here with Alan Alchemy literally dragging this.

2591
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Well, Star Trek fans are emotionally hurt by his shit show fanfic of Wrath of Khan

2592
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,000
and saying he doesn't like pretentious intellectual Star Trek and never did.

2593
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Sorry about it.

2594
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
For the record?

2595
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Four for you, Alan Alchemy. You go, Alan Alchemy.

2596
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Yeah, for the record?

2597
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
I wasn't hurt.

2598
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Then again, I'm the DS9 fan.

2599
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Alright, that's going to about do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2600
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,000
But before we get final thoughts, we have one other thing we've got to take care of.

2601
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:11,000
And that is tonight's list list. Don't you want to know what won?

2602
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Yay.

2603
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
So let's get to it.

2604
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Here it is, the top three as voted on by you guys at live.vognetwork.com.

2605
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:28,000
The board is now away. You can no longer vote because here are the answers.

2606
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:32,000
The winners. No ties tonight. This is a very clear top three tonight.

2607
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:39,000
The number three answer for the thing that the Xbox One could do to be popular on the Internet again.

2608
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
The number three answer?

2609
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:44,000
A more interactive banning system.

2610
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:50,000
The number two answer for a thing that could make the Xbox One popular again.

2611
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Detach Connect.

2612
02:58:54,000 --> 02:59:01,000
And last but not least, the number one way that you will be popular all over the Internet, Microsoft.

2613
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
You got to announce this tomorrow.

2614
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
You buy the Xbox One?

2615
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,000
A free waffle iron with every order.

2616
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Because they're waffling.

2617
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Get it?

2618
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Alright, there it is. Number one answer.

2619
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,000
And besides that?

2620
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,000
Waffle iron with every order.

2621
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Waffles.

2622
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
I like waffles!

2623
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Waffles!

2624
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
A big thanks to Captain Spike. Unfortunately, none of his answers made the top three.

2625
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:32,000
But I will say his answer on Hipster Exclusives was the number four result.

2626
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:36,000
So there it is. Mega Man Legends Assembly 3. That was the number four answer.

2627
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Followed right by Fling Phil Fish to the Moon.

2628
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:43,000
So close yet so far, Captain Spike. I did love his answers.

2629
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Fly Phil to the Moon.

2630
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,000
I know, right? I got that stuck. Like I'm having a Bayonetta moment.

2631
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Flame among the stars.

2632
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
In other words...

2633
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Kiss my ass.

2634
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Alright, love it.

2635
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room saying anticipation would have won had Dark Soccer not been a meanie.

2636
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Well that's...

2637
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
When?

2638
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:09,000
That's... them's the breaks here on Listless.

2639
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
Bobby, I want you to picture something.

2640
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Uh huh.

2641
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Imagine you're standing in an open field.

2642
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Imagine a world without you crying.

2643
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
No. Imagine you're standing in an open field.

2644
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Yes.

2645
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
And you're looking up at the sun.

2646
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:31,000
And then suddenly, five letters float in front of the sun, completely blocking out its light and its S-H-A-D-E.

2647
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:42,000
And on that note, we're gonna wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here tonight.

2648
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Maybe y'all sing us out tonight.

2649
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Fly me to the moon.

2650
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Well, you know the other half of the fans are saying Evangelion.

2651
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,000
There's like 50 million versions of that song.

2652
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Or Utada Hikaru did one.

2653
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Utada Hikaru did one. I think it was on a Dance Mania album. Anyway.

2654
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I've got like the album version of that one.

2655
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Next April Fools on VOG. All we will do is play covers of that song.

2656
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Hear me out.

2657
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Alright.

2658
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Fly me to the moon.

2659
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,000
Let's wrap it up, guys. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2660
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Thank you for participating. Thank you for being here.

2661
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Whether you were here live, whether you were listening to us on the podcast, we really appreciate it.

2662
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:23,000
And all we ask, guys, tell a friend or two or five or seven about the show.

2663
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2664
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:30,000
You guys are what helps our fan base grow and grows our family.

2665
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:34,000
And yeah, just thank you guys for your support. We so appreciate it.

2666
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
We'll be back next week to do it all again.

2667
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
But for now, we're going to wrap up with final thoughts tonight.

2668
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I'll go first with my final thought tonight.

2669
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:50,000
My final thought is, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5 is probably going to do very well even though it's being released right before all these new consoles come out.

2670
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,000
I really wish Final Fantasy XII would have gotten the same break.

2671
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Because Balthier and Fran are still like some of the best characters ever to come out of that series.

2672
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Maybe they'll do an HD remake.

2673
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,000
My fingers and toes crossed. There was that rumor some time ago.

2674
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
So I plan to buy the X remake.

2675
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:08,000
If the X remake is as good as Kingdom Hearts, I'm on board.

2676
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
They still haven't announced one that's coming out yet.

2677
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Still waiting.

2678
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Hopefully by the end of the year, I hope.

2679
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Yeah, hopefully.

2680
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
We'll see.

2681
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Alright, that's my final thought.

2682
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,000
Loki, your final thought.

2683
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,000
I'm going to play Lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.

2684
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,000
And hopefully now that it's out there, maybe we can livestream some of it.

2685
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Because that would be fun.

2686
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:29,000
Last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

2687
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Of course.

2688
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
That's all the singing you're going to get out of me.

2689
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Alright. Hey, that's something. We usually don't get singing here.

2690
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Thank you guys again so much for listening to the show.

2691
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:47,000
We'll be back here to do it all again next week with episode 520 of our show.

2692
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
A fifth of the way to 600.

2693
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
For the record.

2694
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:53,000
For the record what?

2695
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
In other words.

2696
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Shut up.

2697
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:59,000
You know, the more I think about it, we're going to be episode 600 before you know it.

2698
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:03,000
This show might actually make it to episode 666.

2699
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,000
I'm just saying.

2700
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Dun dun dun.

2701
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Those are like the big episodes we have left.

2702
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
We have 600, of course.

2703
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:12,000
We have 573, obviously, is going to be a big episode for us.

2704
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
We'll explain that later if you don't know.

2705
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:18,000
And then 666 would be like, we've got to do something crazy.

2706
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:21,000
But if we make it to 777, we have to do like a whole Final Fantasy VII.

2707
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
I'm going to be like 43.

2708
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
