14093	16037	Tonight, Valve's three announcements have come and gone.
16117	18141	What have they revealed that didn't have three in its name?
18422	23472	We lament over LucasArts Games' loss to the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros.
23512	25676	roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9.
33419	33799	Oops.
34780	37142	Hi there, everybody out there on the internet.
37182	41065	Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
41205	48391	We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show.
49052	54396	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc., etc.
54956	58179	With my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58379	60079	You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy.
60720	62080	Empress Sakura of Normandy.
62220	62480	Yes.
62620	65281	So just a three-hour Dark Sakura love fest.
66061	68082	Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy.
68802	71463	Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are.
71603	73083	But here you ain't shit.
73203	73543	Hey.
73563	73643	What?
74263	75384	I'd like to make an announcement.
75584	75864	Okay.
76084	78765	Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom.
79965	80665	Assholes.
80685	81966	You got stung by one, didn't you?
82106	82566	Yes, I did.
82646	83146	In my car.
84167	84367	Benadryl
101535	107138	So you're here, and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out, I shouldn't worry.
107398	110799	No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since.
111660	111960	Alright.
113080	113801	Fucking assholes.
114341	116322	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki!
116602	116862	Hello.
117142	118083	Hi, Loki, how are you?
118703	119203	I'm fine.
119423	120984	Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?
121755	121935	No.
123236	123816	Glad to hear it.
147265	167033	Games we might be talking about tonight Although oddly, we were kind of looking at things before the show It was a slower of news weeks I know we have some big announcements, especially in the PC universe and so on And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about We'll get to those here before too long But otherwise, kind of a relatively quiet week Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto V still?
167393	168534	What is it, a billion?
168954	171175	Eleventy billion dollars that game's made?
171475	176417	It's over a billion I don't know what the exact numbers are right now It's crazy
176977	177417	A lot?
178037	178758	A lot.
204878	217085	Well, according to the global VG charts, the top global sellers, obviously both being Grand Theft Auto V, it sold a total of about 17 million copies already.
217726	218386	Wow.
218786	219747	As of the 21st, yeah.
219947	221108	That's worldwide, right?
221348	222028	Grand Theft Billions
246385	248167	That's pretty much what it is right now.
248367	249028	Grand Theft Billions.
249048	255655	Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?
255675	261841	There was one kid that stole a car or something and shot some people and they said, oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto.
261921	262522	Right, right.
262862	264083	I mean, they'll try to tie it with him.
264103	266305	No, that's because he's stupid.
266405	267686	They'll blame it on anything.
267726	274691	I mean, it's just like there was another one of those kid brings a gun to school or something like that, and they blamed it on Minecraft.
275131	277633	So, I mean, it's just seriously, it'll be anything.
277933	279554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
298080	298861	Thanks for watching!
315091	315971	Food causes murder.
316352	316912	You know what?
317532	327757	If video games really caused a particular action, then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches and wearing cat ears all the time and throwing books at people.
328237	332359	I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked.
332820	341464	If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder, well, we're in for the apocalypse because there's 17 million people out there now that are
342424	343124	Murderers.
343705	346885	So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead.
347005	351166	If any food drives people to murder, it's probably mayonnaise, and that's why I avoid it.
351186	352247	Mayonnaise is awesome.
352287	353667	You shut your whore mouth.
354027	355727	You murderous woman.
356488	358828	Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise.
359228	359628	Barf.
360309	360709	Barf.
361769	364870	Somebody call the cops, because somebody's about to get killed over mayonnaise.
364890	367290	Mayonnaise is really good for your hair.
367310	368991	Something that's good for your hair, why would you eat it?
369011	369731	Do you eat shampoo?
370999	371240	No.
371300	372061	Do you eat conditioner?
372081	372963	Beer is good for your hair.
373844	374585	I drink lots of beer.
374605	375767	Okay, well I'd take a bath in beer.
375828	376669	Would you take a bath in beer?
377392	378752	As long as I could, no.
379773	383694	No, because then that would be alcohol abuse, and I just want to put my head in and drink it.
383734	385394	I thought about it on Family Guy today, actually.
386274	386795	Did you now?
386975	387255	Yes.
388035	388495	You know what?
388555	395497	Actually, last night while I was playing Final Fantasy, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly, which is like some of the best apple cider ever.
395877	397677	And I was like, well, I'm getting dizzy.
397737	400598	And then I kept trying to go to bed, and then I kept doing more quests.
401859	403299	And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed.
403737	405298	I was having a very classy weekend.
405598	410420	Friday night, Alan and I, we wanted to go to this new restaurant in town, but it was way too crowded.
410460	412961	So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen, which you know that place.
412981	413422	We love that place.
413442	414002	Pita Kitchen!
414182	415543	And then we went by Safeway.
415563	416703	It's like right by there, right?
416743	421205	So we went by Safeway, and we got a bottle of Barefoot Wine and some Ben & Jerry's.
421425	426448	And I brought it home, and I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long with my bottle of wine and Ben & Jerry's.
426488	429089	And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight.
429309	432091	By the way, you know what's sitting in my fridge at home?
433172	436914	I have a bottle of apple wine from the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill.
437014	437475	Delicious.
438055	438996	I need people to help me drink it.
440216	441457	Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself.
441477	441978	Help you drink liquor.
441998	442518	I can do that.
443098	443338	All right.
443559	449443	Look, moving from our classy weekends to a little bit of a kickoff topic, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.
449503	453545	But, Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about this latest hacking project of yours.
453725	457388	Because you've talked about it on the show a little bit in passing.
457408	457548	Yeah.
457748	458849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
479268	480409	And what brand is this?
480449	481150	This is an on-lap.
481170	481931	It's an on-lap.
482151	487155	I forget what they call it, but I'll show you how nice it looks.
487315	489157	It's pretty sexy looking, actually.
489777	493200	That's a pretty big looking monitor there.
493220	493861	It's a 13-inch monitor.
494381	498925	Normally, if I didn't get such a great deal on it, I wouldn't probably be using that.
499405	501247	What exactly are you doing with this?
501488	510417	I'm basically building almost like a Wii U tablet, but for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
510477	513380	You're not talking about an emulator type of thing or anything like that, are you?
513420	518446	No, it's basically going to be a wireless HDMI, and it'll sync up with...
520091	548311	you know whatever I hook up HDMI or whatever I hook up the you know I'm still a little lost tell me tell me like an application how this would work with a game like as you say okay so basically I would hook up I would use this and whatever console I want to play on say like an Xbox 360 you know I'm gonna have controls like you know like you would see on the Wii U gamepad or like the 360 and stuff and
549492	551494	So that's still something you're going to attach to it as a controller.
551514	552616	Yeah, it's something I'm going to attach to it.
552636	554177	I'm going to build a whole new case for it.
554297	555178	Okay, that's what I'm missing.
555899	557901	And then, what was I going to say?
559403	562366	So there's that, and then on top of that, there's going to be...
564796	565476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
585001	587783	Although I'm still running into a slight problem with the PlayStation 3 one.
587803	596249	It's going to be a little bit more challenging because when you plug that in to charge it off or run it off USB power, it shuts off the wireless radio, I believe.
596329	604054	So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller as it does like you're building a portable 360 that works in your house somewhere.
604074	608717	Well, it's a second screen because it's basically just pulling whatever signal.
608757	610618	I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to.
611919	614061	Well, I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore because that's sold.
615121	617622	If I had another Ouya, I could hook it up to that.
618082	623563	So basically anything that has an HDMI out that's compatible with a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 controller.
623643	624823	What's the why on this?
624903	628644	I know, for one, you just like to have these projects and do it because you can't.
628744	636785	It's because my wife watches the TV a lot, and right now I'm sitting there on my computer monitor and playing games, which is fine.
637125	640486	But it'd be more comfortable if I could sit on the couch and just kind of kick back with
641304	649809	Yeah, so this is something like you could play Grand Theft Auto V in private with that thing in your lap and not have your kid be able to see you shooting hookers on the television.
649849	652150	Well, yeah, he'd be asleep, but yeah, basically.
652490	659074	Okay, but it's still like a way... Or, okay, so the wife can watch, you know, Scandal, and you can... Or Grey's Anatomy.
659154	660615	Or whatever it is she watches, yeah.
661175	662656	And you can do that.
662716	662936	Okay.
662956	663256	There you go.
663276	664197	I was going to show you real quick.
664257	665778	Just, well, let's see if...
666298	668561	This is not a great example, but here's my computer monitor.
671384	678552	Okay, so since this is radio, basically Loki is holding up this flat, like basically because it's a flat monitor.
678572	679113	Picture time.
679754	680534	Yeah, you can do a picture.
680554	681435	I'll put it on my Tumblr.
681515	682336	I know, not all of it.
682356	684018	It doesn't weigh like hardly anything.
684078	685420	It's just like maybe a pound.
685600	686521	Firefox Open Touchscreen
703038	704259	Thanks for watching!
718470	733009	and I've actually tried it out with an Xbox 360 I have another cable that's not hooked up to this that it converts it to it splits out the audio from the HDMI because you know I don't have any speakers on this thing so I have to build that
733950	738692	Let's see, Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom says, wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?
739813	749317	I have another TV, but I just, the problem is, you know, setting up systems and moving them around and stuff, it's just a lot easier for, I don't know, I just want to build this.
749377	754760	You have to understand, Brad, this is the very manly man side of Loki, that now it's a thing.
755180	759642	And once it's become a thing, he will stop at nothing to achieve said thing.
760462	765264	Unless there might be like that one little thing that just derails the whole thing and they'll be like, ah, forget it.
765744	769586	Like, what happened to the building an arcade machine for $100 or whatever that was?
770306	771466	I just lost interest in that.
771666	771846	See?
771947	775048	Well, because I didn't need another arcade machine.
775068	778209	I had two I wasn't using, so why build a third?
778769	785932	And also, it didn't help that the PC that I got for that was defective, so you can't really...
786312	787413	So you get what you pay for.
787673	788394	Yeah, pretty much.
788854	790816	It just wouldn't power up, you know, go fake.
791856	799982	So yeah, I just, I ended up, well, I didn't even really part of the PC, I just threw it away because it was just not working.
801464	803865	Yeah, it just, I lost interest in that.
804646	811171	But now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto V, you know, so I'm definitely interested in having a screen I can play that on.
811440	812160	Alright, fair enough.
812201	815142	Especially with the online component of Grand Theft Auto V starting soon.
815422	820886	I'm sure it's going to be absolutely disastrous as far as being able to connect to it.
821586	823747	Quick plug for the VOG Network crew.
823808	824808	How many people are in that now?
824848	825288	Like 20 at least?
826589	827310	There's quite a few.
828531	845391	so yeah the VOG Network crew you can go to you can go to our forums and check out we have a thread on it otherwise you can go to socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network and check it out and we're seeing right now how many people we have in there
846572	848333	20 members, yeah.
848633	849894	And I even promoted Bobby.
850374	851515	Oh, there you go.
851935	853816	Bobby is now promoted to Commissioner.
854616	855617	Commissioner Bobby.
856477	856917	Nice.
857037	857497	I'll appreciate that.
857537	864761	The only thing I'm hoping, but I don't know how it's going to work, is I'm going to be playing on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
864941	866782	All my coworkers have the PS3 version.
866802	867742	They want me to play on that.
868683	871644	I just hope that my progress moves with both.
871764	872785	Like it's in the cloud?
872805	872885	Yeah.
873465	875186	Well, they say it's in the cloud and stuff.
875246	881891	And they say that when the PlayStation 4 version comes along that your multiplayer information goes along with that.
881951	885033	But I just don't know how exactly that works.
885173	889516	Because they have special editions and stuff you could have gotten for one or the other system.
889576	891678	They add different perks for your characters.
891738	895701	But I don't think I can save my character on PlayStation 3 and then transfer it over.
895741	898042	It may just do my stats and that's about it.
898643	900244	But I don't know.
900704	901545	We'll check it out, I guess.
903099	906071	Alright, well, good luck with this new project of yours.
906111	907296	How long do you think it's going to take you to finish?
908827	923018	Well, I'm just testing everything as I go along, so I'm getting the wireless HDMI stuff on Wednesday, and then the hardest part is going to be making the case for it, because, yeah, how do you do that?
923198	935488	And then, also, I have to get a battery to run everything, which I figured out I need a 12-volt battery, then I'm going to use a step-down to drop it to 5 volts so that I can get more amps out of it, because...
935808	941571	It's basically going to be powering about four or five USB powered things.
942051	947314	The two controllers because there's going to be the internals for DualShock 3 and Xbox 360 controllers.
947334	948794	So I have to wire to both of those.
949375	953937	And then also the monitor and then the wireless HDMI.
954517	958039	So that's four things and I think there's something else I'm forgetting.
959399	960099	We believe in you.
960340	960920	We believe in you.
960960	962200	You'll get it.
962880	964801	At the very least, this monitor's pretty cool.
965401	966621	It is a nice little thing.
966661	967642	It looks like a tablet.
967822	970822	Looks expensive.
971242	970822	$35.
971723	973703	That's how much of a steal I got that for.
973763	975604	Normally they go for about $250.
975704	976224	Where at?
977564	978805	eBay.
978845	983726	Speaking of eBay, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week, how much did your Ouya go for on eBay?
984286	983726	$80.
984306	984746	That's good.
984886	985446	That's really good.
986047	987207	Considering you paid, what, $90 for it?
988507	989467	Yeah, 99.
989967	991588	And 80 bucks, that's not bad.
991768	1001070	And also, funny enough, actually Saints Row 4, I sold my Xbox 360 copy of that because I have it on PC and I don't really play the 360 version.
1001490	1001970	That went for $14.
1002030	1004271	So I was a little disappointed on that.
1004311	1005151	But I was like, yeah, whatever.
1005171	1006211	I would have bought that for more.
1006611	1007191	Yeah, exactly.
1008032	1010092	There's so much counterfeit shit on eBay of new games.
1010112	1010992	You've got to be really careful.
1011032	1014433	Remember a couple years ago when Alan got me that Child of Eden that came from China?
1014453	1014673	Yeah.
1014893	1023286	and it wasn't even like... Like, we opened it and the box was like Assassin's Creed and it was very clearly a burned disc and it was a piece of garbage and he, like, he...
1024093	1025714	DarkSakura, what have you been playing?
1053880	1054241	Salad?
1054942	1055784	Salad the game.
1056845	1058348	Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom?
1058729	1058909	No.
1059690	1061093	I'm actually legit eating a salad.
1063237	1064158	I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV.
1065973	1067294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1086772	1087893	Yeah, it's fate parties.
1088293	1094299	If you actually shout out and say, looking for fate party, you'll get invited, and then you guys all, any contributions are pooled.
1094619	1095880	So you get more golds that way.
1095900	1097602	It's a trick people use in leveling.
1097995	1098836	I just ignore everybody.
1099776	1101397	They don't exist in my mental universe.
1101417	1106020	You can do enough side quests and other things to level.
1106880	1109241	I hit it, obviously, while I'm drinking.
1114484	1115405	Animal Crossing, of course.
1116385	1118066	I haven't really been playing much of anything else.
1119147	1121949	For some reason, I'm stupidly addicted to IOS Bejeweled.
1122949	1123509	I don't know why.
1124150	1124630	It's just fun.
1124870	1126111	It's a nice little time waster.
1126531	1129272	And I've actually gotten pretty good at the Diamond Mine.
1129372	1130332	It's a good potty game.
1130833	1132193	It actually is a really good potty game.
1133774	1135734	My iPhone has changed the way I use the bathroom, Rob.
1136935	1138355	There's a shirt that says that, and I want it.
1140036	1150800	And Dan beat GTA V, so I've now been randomly going in there and hearing him doing some of the other side missions, so it's been pretty funny.
1151080	1152760	But you're not really interested in playing yourself?
1152941	1153101	No.
1154461	1155822	I don't... You know what?
1156463	1158465	I don't care how good a game is.
1160586	1162108	I have no tolerance for misogyny.
1163129	1166071	You have to have also, like, just some interest in it, you know?
1166391	1167552	I have zero interest in it.
1167873	1179783	Now, if it was, you know... I want to do, like, a lady Grand Theft Auto where it's just this hardcore, you know, woman tearing down the patriarchy.
1180680	1205819	Play Saints Row, because you can kind of do it Saints Row 2 Saints Row 2, not the other ones No, but I really have no interest in I hate to say I have no interest in the culture Because clearly I have an interest in various aspects of culture But it's not something that appeals to me So, I don't really care about it Fair enough, all right
1206824	1211226	I'll go in and watch Dan play for a little bit, and I'm like, I'll just roll my eyes and go, really?
1211906	1215887	Because, oh my god, I have to tell you what happened the other day.
1216908	1224490	I was pumping gas, and this guy comes up and says, you know, one of the, can we do your windshield thing fluid, you know, so that they're trying to sell you something?
1224830	1226351	And I said, that's okay, I'm not interested.
1227111	1229412	He's like, oh, well, I hope you have a better rest of your day.
1229752	1232093	I got so mad, I said, would you have asked me that if I was a man?
1232913	1234374	And he's like, uh...
1235274	1236696	No, I'm like, I thought not.
1238777	1241100	But, you know, it was like, God, I hate people.
1241700	1242821	But yeah, I don't know.
1242861	1244263	I've been a little bit hypersensitive.
1244283	1245924	What in the hell does that have to do with games?
1246505	1257295	Because I'm just saying that I've been so hypersensitive lately and just really pissed off at everything, especially after talking with my mother, that I think I would vomit all over GTA 5 at this point in a feminist rage.
1259397	1260298	You're missing the point.
1260620	1265862	I mean, honestly, if you're gonna vomit all over GTA 5, it's a story that has guys in it.
1266542	1267503	I mean, so what?
1267523	1269063	There's not a fucking female lead.
1269323	1270444	Boo-hoo.
1270964	1271624	Get over it.
1272065	1272565	Seriously.
1273285	1274325	Everybody needs to get over it.
1274526	1278127	I can see where... Well, here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto.
1278147	1280488	I don't care that it has it, I just don't have to play it.
1281454	1284776	It pushes the envelope as art does, right?
1284916	1286076	Video games are art, right?
1286157	1288918	And Grand Theft Auto definitely pushes the envelope in a lot of ways.
1288978	1297102	But for me, Grand Theft Auto and everything that's in it, again, I don't put a game like Grand Theft Auto on any different platform than I put movies.
1297562	1299823	And Grand Theft Auto to me is just one of those like,
1299983	1303686	Brozy action movies that are out there and exist.
1303886	1305627	And there's definitely an audience for it.
1305967	1307488	A lot of those movies really do well.
1307769	1310130	But there's some people that just aren't really interested in it.
1310190	1314293	Just like, I bet Loki wouldn't be caught dead watching The Notebook.
1314613	1315234	I've already seen it.
1316535	1318156	I haven't seen it and I don't care to see it.
1319295	1322779	Well, I mean, it's a genre that I am not into.
1322879	1328626	I mean, if it had more things that I think would appeal to me as a player, then I might give it a chance.
1328706	1332831	Like, I tried Saints Row 3, or the third, or whatever the fuck it was.
1332871	1333712	It wasn't very fun.
1333792	1338697	So what exactly about Mass Effect 3 made for a good game versus Grand Theft Auto V?
1340017	1367471	well first of all it actually told a very solid story there was very little misogyny in it but you haven't played Grand Theft Auto 5 so you have no fucking clue what the story is like I've actually sat and watched Dan play through it as we discussed before the show there's a great story in fact three stories throughout the entire campaign of it I just don't understand how people can get off saying that there's not a good story in that I'm not saying the story isn't good I'm just saying it doesn't appeal to me
1368416	1370258	Yeah, but you're blaming it.
1370378	1373100	You're saying that it doesn't have a good story and Mass Effect 3 has a great story.
1373161	1375102	I didn't say it didn't have a good story.
1375222	1376664	I said it doesn't appeal to me.
1377985	1383010	There is a difference between something being good on its own and not being something that I'm into.
1384631	1388855	You know, for example, Miss Saigon, the play.
1389296	1389976	Great story.
1390477	1391358	I don't really care for the play.
1392828	1414484	um Chicago great movie great story I hate everybody in it I don't I've seen it once I don't care to see it again uh Breaking Bad just won an Emmy and I think we're going up against the finale tonight and I'm sure it's a great show and I hate that show I'll get around to it someday and I'm sure it's a good show but I just I'd rather do other stuff right now but
1414824	1428691	I mean, anything... That's kind of where I see it, is that it's like, alright, so Breaking Bad's winning all these awards, and I'm sure it's a great show, I'm not gonna sit here and knock the show, but it's just like, ain't nobody got time for that right now, for me.
1428831	1430052	Here's another example, okay?
1430272	1432273	I have a bajillion friends that are into Buffy.
1433173	1439096	And I love Joss, because he can tell a really good story, he really gets people into it, but I am not the biggest Buffy fan.
1440177	1443659	I have a few episodes that I like to watch, I really don't care for the series as a whole.
1443899	1444219	The end.
1445545	1446286	It's the same thing.
1446586	1450910	Something can be good on its own merits, but if it's not your thing, you don't have to watch it.
1452772	1453653	Or like mayonnaise.
1453953	1455615	Again, I really hate mayonnaise.
1456636	1457797	Actually, it is like mayonnaise.
1458277	1464383	Mayonnaise has very good culinary applications, but if you're not into it, you're not into it.
1465724	1466585	I like boobs.
1466906	1468107	Some girls don't like boobs.
1469868	1470349	Not their thing.
1470993	1472393	Self-hating women, I don't understand it.
1473514	1474834	I guess we'll leave it at that.
1475594	1478895	If that's it for your gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1479535	1493078	My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto V, and I played a ton of it, and even had the time to shoot some video for a funny little montage thing that's set to the music from the movie Rad.
1494738	1497320	I haven't seen your video yet.
1497380	1499922	It's just weird.
1500623	1505226	For me, the movie Rad, because I was looking... I remember what I was doing.
1505286	1511251	I was browsing YouTube, and you know how I'll make recommendations for you and stuff.
1511271	1517536	I think I watched Play of the Navigator on there one time, and so I recommended Rad and stuff.
1518016	1521939	So, that movie is really fucking cheesy, if you've ever seen it.
1521979	1523200	It is super cheesy, Bob.
1523220	1531026	They have a scene at a dance where they're riding BMX bikes to send me an angel.
1531266	1533948	It's just like, what the hell is going on?
1534068	1535529	So I was like, okay, that's really funny.
1536109	1539792	And so I had Trevor in the game, running for the police, and
1541573	1542274	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1560729	1563211	Are you going to try and go viral like Bobby's article did this week?
1563272	1564913	Oh no, it's not going to go viral.
1564973	1567375	It's just a funny video, so that's all.
1568436	1569337	But yeah, so I played through that.
1569357	1578246	I'm actually at the very end of the game, so I'm trying to finish the single player campaign before online starts because I do want to do online.
1578606	1585713	I think I am going to have a few days though because I know online launches on Tuesday, but come on.
1586033	1587235	They even admitted to it.
1587275	1598748	They're like, listen, we know how online multiplayer launches have been, and trust us, we're going to try to make sure that that's not going to be the same way, but it's probably going to... It'll break.
1599048	1599829	It's going to be broken.
1599849	1600670	It's going to be, you know...
1602392	1602952	www.DarkSakura.com
1625579	1635965	What was the strategy behind delaying it and not having it when the game launches?
1636025	1641347	Did they purposely want people to spend some time with single player mode first?
1641387	1644069	Some people feel rushed to get into the multiplayer portion.
1644529	1649610	They wanted you to enjoy the single-player portion of the game first, and they wanted to make sure that everything worked properly.
1650291	1662794	So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff in the world, so I can understand how you need to make sure everything's tested and catch any flaws you may have with your servers and that kind of stuff.
1663074	1665435	Especially since they've had trouble with the social club stuff.
1665655	1670820	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster said Social Club was pretty rough in the first week.
1670900	1672421	Game had issues connecting to it.
1673302	1676485	Seg is in our chatroom and says, I'm glad they separated out the release.
1677345	1685833	Yeah, so I could play the single player and get a little bit of a handle of the map and also kind of like how you do heists and just all that stuff.
1686138	1692624	I'm going to totally 180 the topic on you here, but this conversation is making me think about this, and it's not in our show role tonight, and it is pretty big news.
1693105	1698670	The new Batman game that's coming out this fall in a month or two.
1699251	1700092	I don't know if you heard about this.
1700132	1702274	The Wii U version will not have multiplayer.
1702434	1703235	Oh, shocking.
1703355	1704236	They've said that before.
1704276	1710102	The Nintendo online component just isn't – they don't think there's enough people there, and it's –
1710522	1711223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1726576	1729858	God, I wish they would do that on the PlayStation 3 and the 360 as well.
1729878	1743525	Or I wish this is an offering we could have for games where not $10 off the price for multiplayer, which is kind of funny to me because isn't this like the inverse but in a more consumer-friendly way of the online pass?
1743986	1746447	Because the online pass was $10, right?
1746667	1753791	Because I'm thinking like if what I'm reading is correct, if games were $10 cheaper to begin with, we wouldn't have a problem with online passes.
1753811	1753891	Yeah.
1754131	1759133	I think it's marketing spin to be honest because it was always going to be $10 cheaper.
1759153	1762254	It wasn't a decision that they made when they put it out.
1762434	1770656	I think what it is is that the Wii U stuff doesn't sell as well and so they have to lower the price to make it more attractive to people buying games.
1770936	1772557	That's really the true story of it.
1772917	1776278	And the fact that it just doesn't have multiplayer I don't think it would have mattered.
1776318	1780119	They would have still put it out at $60 anyways if they thought they could get away with it.
1780159	1782220	But that's really what it comes down to is there's not a lot of
1783260	1812047	you know third party games selling on that system so yeah let's mark you know mark it down 10 bucks to try to see if we can move a few more copies it's not but see now they've gotten a lot of PR spin out of it you know so it's very positive and you know that helps them out as well but it's not it's not specifically because multiplayer is missing trust me because shit they omit stuff from all different you know games cross platforms and there's never a price break because of that it's always because the system's just not doing as well
1813249	1832977	E3VL in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says pretty sweet deal seeing it also has gamepad support I gotta be honest I'm interested in the new Batman game I don't know how I feel about multiplayer part of me says get it on Playstation 3 but even Arkham City Armored Edition was kind of lame as far as the gamepad support it was pretty much what you had with the PS3 I
1834137	1859759	I don't have let that affect my opinion of the new Batman game because well A I haven't played the new one yet B I know the other case you had Arkham City was kind of shoehorned into the Wii U to try to like and that was one of the Wii U's biggest problems is that most of its launch was made up of games that were already out on PlayStation 3 and 360 but with new little frills in it that didn't really I mean it was kind of at that point no one care
1860319	1861460	You know, unfortunately.
1861880	1862100	Yeah.
1862441	1864422	So, I don't know.
1864502	1867664	Like, I gotta admit, there's a part of me that's kind of like, oh, maybe I'll just get the Wii U version.
1868345	1872248	Even though there's another part of me that's like, well, Rob, you never know when you might want to do multiplayer.
1872288	1873228	You might really like it.
1873248	1874929	But what multiplayer do they really have?
1875029	1879733	Because if it's anything like the other games have been, it's just been challenge maps where it's two-player co-op.
1880253	1882735	You know, it's not even really that interesting.
1882755	1882835	Yeah.
1883295	1883576	I don't know.
1885117	1886558	Another recent release, Tomb Raider.
1887599	1890002	It was a great, fantastic single-player game.
1890022	1890522	I loved it.
1890902	1892003	I didn't really touch the multiplayer.
1892704	1894045	I wouldn't have missed it if it wasn't there.
1894065	1899110	I wouldn't pick your system based on multiplayer because I don't think that the multiplayer in that game is going to be very deep.
1899170	1902533	It's kind of challenge maps and that's it.
1903294	1907618	It's kind of tacked on because these studios think that they need to have multiplayer in every game.
1909359	1914905	I think that's why a lot of people think, oh, hey, if the game was $10 cheaper, yeah, I wouldn't really miss the multiplayer in it.
1915225	1917388	And for a lot of games, yeah, that's pretty true.
1917408	1918629	All right.
1918709	1924715	Sorry, I didn't mean to yank away your gaming week, but that just kind of jumped in my mind and I knew it wasn't on the show roll coming up.
1925225	1931391	Also, if I may interject, on the Orange Lounge Radio Tumblr, the picture of Loki and the monitor is up.
1931552	1931992	Oh, you got that?
1932372	1934995	Was it just Orange Lounge Radio on one word dot Tumblr dot com?
1935115	1935275	Yep.
1935395	1935836	There you go.
1936036	1937698	So if you want the visual, there you go.
1938479	1938819	Thank you.
1939640	1940541	You guys work fast.
1940981	1941842	Go team OLR.
1942443	1943644	All right, Loki.
1943684	1944385	Thanks to Runchon.
1944965	1945286	Thank you.
1945486	1946587	Loki, back to your gaming week.
1947243	1949045	So that was it, yeah, it's just Grand Theft Auto.
1949365	1950807	I don't even think I got around to it.
1951087	1955110	I may have played one thing at Call of Duty this week, but it's been basically just Grand Theft Auto.
1955591	1965000	Oh, and very briefly, because we're going to get into that later, I had to launch up Saints Row 4 on PC in big picture mode, you know.
1965100	1965260	Yeah.
1968382	1970324	I did Rogue Legacy, same reason.
1970824	1973106	Going into my gaming week, so what did I play this week?
1973146	1983855	Well, I played Rogue Legacy, but most of my time, of course, was spent with Final Fantasy XIV, which really shouldn't surprise anybody who's been listening to this show, but I will say this, I hit level 50 this morning.
1984455	1984936	and DarkSakura.
2004568	2030161	uh 14 still not perfect the gold spam is very irritating and there's some other quality of life things but you know again for a quote I'm using my quotey fingers new MMO because we're just we're forgiving 1.0 and just pretending it never happened but for a new MMO uh it's you know doing quite well so I look forward to the future patches and what else is going to be in the future um so when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy 14 and getting level 50 there um
2032282	2034583	I was in my pinball thing again.
2034623	2037103	I think I got into this last week, but even more so.
2037183	2038364	More pinball games this week.
2039504	2043445	Not just the Zen Pinball on Vita and PlayStation 3.
2043665	2044445	I was playing more of that.
2044725	2050407	But then I also downloaded Pinball Arcade, which is the... I can't remember who makes that.
2050467	2053307	Crave published it on Wii, but then they went under.
2054768	2056228	Farsight Studios, I think is the name of it?
2056288	2056808	Yes, that's it.
2056908	2058109	It's Farsight Studios does it.
2059249	2059729	And they...
2060349	2069332	have deals in place with like Stern and Midway or whoever owns that right now to have all those classic tables in the game.
2069432	2072193	So what's really cool, there's tons of DLC.
2072613	2075574	So I actually downloaded Pinbot so I could have that as a table.
2076154	2083337	And because Alan told me this is his favorite table of all time, I also downloaded Elvira Scared Stiff, which is available in Pinball Arcade.
2083957	2087438	And they have the Star Trek, the next generation pinball machine, which surprised me.
2088538	2094941	They had a couple licensed ones where I was like, wow, Twilight Zone is one of the default machines you get when you buy the game.
2095221	2096582	I was very surprised with that.
2096862	2101684	Which, by the way, I think that, what is the new table that Stern's coming out with?
2101724	2103145	They have Steve Ritchie working on one.
2104718	2106459	Tron is the newest thing I know that they did.
2134045	2138990	Well, the rumor is that the Addams Family pinball machine is coming in a future expansion pack.
2139030	2140252	That would make me very happy.
2140532	2141693	I love that pinball machine.
2141713	2142634	I'm sure a lot of people did.
2142935	2146879	It's one of the best performing pinball machines of all time was the Addams Family one.
2147039	2150183	You know, an odd one that I would love to see would be Black Rose.
2151784	2152485	It might be in there.
2152625	2153586	The Lady Pirate game.
2153766	2155989	I'll have to fire it up and see what they have and what they don't have.
2156796	2159958	Is this so weird playing the virtual tables?
2160038	2173525	Yeah, it is weird, but, you know, I can't afford the real machines, and it's not always practical to go out, so it's a nice compromise, because, like, I can actually play on the Vita in my bed, you know, which is kind of neat.
2174265	2179728	Well, we used to have Pin Mame hooked up that, I mean, it had, like, a tilt function and everything.
2179768	2180569	It was really cool.
2182270	2182690	But, uh...
2185236	2186457	What was I was going to say about it?
2186918	2194226	But I mean, even those big virtual ultracade type ones just were, it's different.
2194407	2199593	I can get into playing it maybe a little casually, but I can't get into playing it kind of hardcore.
2200579	2202080	I'm going to the chat room.
2202860	2207503	In chat, SSJ100Matt says, if Haunted House Pinball Table is in there, then this is sold to me.
2208244	2208704	Guess what?
2208944	2209604	It is in there.
2209664	2210605	But here's the weird thing.
2210665	2212406	It's not on PlayStation Network.
2212446	2215108	It's only on the iOS, Android, and Mac versions.
2215248	2217289	For some reason, it's missing from PlayStation Network.
2217729	2220291	That could be because it's the newest pack.
2221931	2225912	17 and 18 are the newest packs, and so maybe it's just not there yet.
2226492	2229033	So don't lose hope, but I'm looking at that.
2229353	2231954	They do not have the Black Rose, which you were mentioning before.
2232054	2234114	You mentioned another table, too, you were curious about.
2234594	2234855	I did?
2235115	2235495	I thought.
2235795	2238375	Maybe not.
2238656	2239376	Jackbot, maybe?
2239816	2241256	No, but Bride of Pimbot's there.
2241396	2244397	And I know they referenced Jackbot in the bio for Pimbot.
2245196	2248798	Jackbot is basically Pinbot's table with the bride's rules.
2249639	2252460	Attack from Mars is there, which was a pretty neat machine.
2253661	2254981	Creature from the Black Lagoon.
2255001	2257783	I'm not going to read the whole list.
2257803	2259504	I'm just reading ones that jump out at me.
2259904	2262325	Medieval Madness, No Good Gophers.
2262365	2263406	I know I've played that before.
2265487	2271450	Terminator 2 Judgment Day is another one of those packs that's not on PlayStation, but it's on the iOS.
2271917	2273780	and of course Twilight Zone is there because that's the best.
2273800	2275462	Yeah, that's one of the default ones you get I think.
2275782	2276323	Oh no, it's not.
2276503	2277184	No, I take that back.
2277364	2277665	It's not.
2277985	2278626	Theater of Magic.
2278786	2279707	Theater of Magic is so good.
2279727	2279868	Yeah.
2280515	2282256	So, yeah, there you go.
2282336	2290160	Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to take over with pinball talk, but that's literally kind of what I've been playing in the in-between times is the pinball games.
2290500	2299825	And also checked out a free-to-play one on PlayStation, which was more like a demo, but it actually has trophies and a full table in it.
2300186	2304988	I think it's called Pinballistic is the name of it, and it's more of a head-to-head pinball game.
2305348	2308950	Not like Revenge of the Gator, which, by the way, is one of my all-time favorite Game Boy games.
2308970	2309931	Remember Revenge of the Gator?
2310171	2310311	Oh, yeah.
2310331	2311552	That big old link cable.
2311572	2312932	It was so much fun, right?
2313312	2317534	But I think, didn't that, wasn't that by the same people who eventually made Pokemon Pinball?
2317574	2319435	I'm almost positive it was, HAL Laboratories.
2319856	2323777	But anyway, it's more like side by side.
2323937	2328540	You play with somebody side by side, but it's the NPC.
2328600	2329240	It's the computer.
2329280	2331581	You can't play on PlayStation Network, which surprised me.
2331621	2337344	I would have thought for sure it was something you would play online, but it doesn't appear to be that way unless I somehow missed it.
2337444	2337764	I don't know.
2338765	2339125	There it is.
2339185	2341007	That's pretty much why I've been playing my gaming week.
2341547	2342548	White Mage and Pinball.
2342788	2344710	That's it.
2344970	2348113	Game Guru said Orange Pinball Radio and I'm like, maybe we need a pinball podcast.
2348173	2348874	Some days.
2349074	2349634	Some days.
2350795	2354719	Ragenator in chat also says Steam selection of pinball is sadly kind of limited.
2355479	2359060	Yeah, I don't think they have a lot, but there's some old school PC classics.
2359620	2364782	One of my favorite PC pinball games was, oh God, now I can't remember the name of it.
2364802	2365482	I'm so embarrassed.
2365542	2367183	It was the one that was on the Amiga, Pinball Dreams?
2367763	2368643	That's it, Pinball Dreams.
2369283	2371584	And they had sequels to that, which were amazing.
2371664	2374305	So I remember playing Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.
2375345	2376766	I mean, those are two great ones.
2376826	2380587	I still need a copy of Jackie Crush.
2381727	2385709	I don't think Pinball Dreams was the one I really, really loved.
2386429	2387650	What was the one that had the game show?
2387670	2388610	Pinball Fantasies.
2388690	2389290	I bet that's it.
2391171	2393632	Yes, Pinball Fantasy was my absolute favorite.
2394113	2396574	Pinball Fantasies, excuse me, was my absolute favorite one.
2396954	2400195	That was originally on the Amiga in late 1992.
2401316	2403037	But it was on the PC later on.
2403077	2403537	I know it was.
2403597	2405118	Did they really make that on the Jaguar?
2405618	2406158	I didn't know that.
2406298	2407679	They put a lot of stuff on Jaguar.
2407999	2408419	Go figure.
2409299	2409700	Never knew that.
2409840	2410260	All right, anyway.
2410970	2411851	Pinball, pinball, pinball.
2413211	2416994	Some quick FYIs, and then we'll get into gaming news tonight.
2417954	2424559	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and then we're also on Facebook, of course, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2424599	2433244	I don't know of any shows off that we have coming up, probably not until the holiday season, so we do hope you will join us live, if you can, on the Sunday night at some point.
2434045	2435506	All right, we ready to get into some gaming news?
2437298	2441879	We got a big 1, 2, 3 that I think everybody's talking about right at the top here.
2441999	2443400	So, Loki, start us off.
2443720	2448801	So, they had three big announcements for Steam this week.
2448881	2452082	The first being the announcement of SteamOS.
2452222	2461705	It's a version of Linux, or I should say it's based off of Linux, that will support Windows and Mac gamers as well.
2462486	2469955	Also, I guess, allow you to stream music, TV, and movies and stuff to your TV as well.
2469995	2480108	So, basically, what this is meant for is you put SteamOS on a PC and you can either... Because, you know, not every game is supporting Linux on Steam, so...
2480709	2481089	and DarkSakura.
2502341	2510389	Yeah, so it's going to kind of tie in with big picture mode, and they're going to have a beta in this September.
2511910	2513672	I'm sorry, not this September.
2513692	2517576	They're going to have a beta soon, I think, for the SteamOS stuff.
2519043	2524525	Asking a question here, I'm sure a lot of gamers are asking, why do I need SteamOS?
2525006	2526326	How is it going to make a game better?
2526526	2527647	That's exactly my question.
2527827	2528347	I don't know.
2528547	2533269	And that's what I would like to know in order for me to want to do that.
2533809	2545193	Why would I spend money to build this small PC to hook up to my TV when I can just build a better PC and just hook it up to my TV in the first place and not have to worry about streaming stuff through my network?
2545373	2546754	I don't know at that point.
2547094	2550257	All right, well, I was asking you because I thought maybe you would have an answer.
2550337	2559586	I'll tell you what I think I'm getting, the impression I'm getting from everything I'm reading is that by having a dedicated operating system, it cuts out a lot of the fat.
2559726	2567893	Because an operating system like Windows 7, it's a good operating system, but there's a lot of fatty stuff in it that might not necessarily be needed to play games.
2568254	2572638	There might be a lot of things under the hood, parts that we don't necessarily need when we're playing a game.
2573038	2579624	So SteamOS as an operating system can kind of strip that out and dedicate all the power of the system to the game.
2580345	2584789	And I don't think you're going to see these improvements that are like, oh my god, it just blows me away.
2584829	2594478	But minor performance improvements that would make a game run a little better than necessarily it would in Windows environment or even Mac OS.
2595399	2596720	So that's the impression I'm getting.
2597421	2605088	Well, I can imagine if that's the case, if it's running natively on that box, but as far as streaming goes, probably not so much.
2605689	2615518	And that's the thing, I'm sure that later on, when they do come out with this, that maybe more developers will support it, maybe they'll give them some sort of incentive to support SteamOS, but...
2616699	2622567	Right now, they haven't really detailed what exactly you're getting with SteamOS.
2623809	2629656	Actdeft in our chatroom says, because SteamOS is going to be free, might be a reason.
2629756	2634042	But, I mean, Linux as it is, is free, and it doesn't seem to have this... Because I think Linux...
2635143	2658529	Linux, because of the environment it grew up in, it was a very kind of like, I don't want to say hacker, but let's say computer enthusiast type of OS that most general people out there that use a personal computer don't understand Linux because you do have to have kind of a basic grasp a lot of times of how to use the inside of a computer which not everybody has a working knowledge of.
2658629	2661189	There's other distros of Linux that are a lot more user friendly.
2661409	2663810	But I don't think it really puts itself out there for...
2665390	2667411	and soccer moms.
2669531	2673172	If I could teach a five-year-old how to use Linux Mint, anyone can learn it.
2673332	2675353	Okay, well then I'm going to turn it around.
2675393	2677213	Why aren't people using it then if it's so easy?
2677754	2682675	Because basically we've got this Windows versus PC mentality.
2682715	2684295	It's all marketing.
2684375	2688277	People are looking into what more things are made for.
2688497	2689437	It's almost like the...
2691721	2692701	What am I trying to think of?
2692961	2714506	You know, when you have your consumer market, when a lot of marketing money is going into saying, hey, you need a PC for blah, blah, blah, and they're getting all of these developers in their pocket, or hey, you need a Mac for this, especially when they were really marketing to artists and, you know, movie editors, that type of thing, you know.
2715899	2721103	Instead, you've got, for example, a lot of 3D programs actually run more efficiently in Linux.
2721964	2728329	For example, every build of Maya I've ever used, I've had the easiest time using it in Linux and I've gotten better results.
2728489	2731992	Well, even Gabe Newell came out and said the best version of Left 4 Dead was in Linux.
2732212	2737516	So, you know, that's why this kind of conclusion we're getting to here isn't a huge surprise.
2737576	2740819	I think we all kind of figured the Steam box would be a Linux box.
2741219	2744862	We just didn't realize it would be a custom Linux box.
2746117	2750118	Well, and Ranma, I disagree about Windows being easier to use than Linux.
2750539	2753599	I mean, I do agree that you get more unified support for Windows.
2754100	2758501	But with Linux, you have a lot more freedom and a more efficient OS.
2759121	2768104	For example, when I was running Mint on my little stupid netbook, it took up two gigabytes of space less than Windows for netbook did.
2769164	2770905	Freed up a lot of memory.
2771645	2795110	and on top of that whenever I wanted to make any tweaks to it all I had to do was upload a kernel was update the kernel that was it I didn't have to go into and with with Linux even with Mint as user-friendly as it is you can go in and do quite a bit to it go in through the root and everything but the easiest way to do that is find someone who's already done the work for you and upgrade the kernel it's fully customizable
2796803	2806907	Well, I think also now that with SteamOS, they're getting a lot more support from the graphics card developers and stuff, like NVIDIA is working with them on drivers and support for it.
2807027	2809608	And I'm assuming ATI is going to probably do the same.
2809748	2818091	So that's really the most important part for right now is because, say, I want a game on Linux.
2818131	2821833	There's not a lot of drivers out there available for that stuff.
2821913	2825594	And so now they're working with them to be able to have better support for it.
2825754	2828296	And that is the one downside of Linux.
2828396	2837544	However, especially the reason why I liked Mint is because it used a lot of drivers that worked for Ubuntu and Debian.
2838165	2841668	So I really had a very wide range of what I could pick from.
2842648	2855454	and one of the other things I like too is a lot of programs that existed for Linux that have to go through a verified check before you could download them and it had like this download server that you could get almost anything that had been approved.
2855994	2861456	You make me want to take my crappy old laptop I'm not really using anymore and just put Linux on it just to kind of play with it.
2861796	2864718	The other thing about Linux, you can run it off a flash drive.
2866138	2869680	So I can bring you a Linux Mint Distro if you wanted to try it and run it off a flash drive.
2869740	2869860	Hmm.
2870683	2871544	Linux is very user-accessible.
2888263	2891504	and very user friendly depending on your distro.
2892344	2899666	But Windows is what people have pretty much been sort of, you know, led by the leash to learn how to use.
2900846	2909068	And I use Windows for most of my stuff because honestly, like for example, for the Adobe Suite, it's optimized a lot better than it used to be.
2910028	2913949	You know, most of my games are on Windows.
2914449	2914629	But
2915370	2917074	In a heartbeat, I would have a dual boot.
2917736	2920403	When I'm ready to reformat my system, I'm dual booting it.
2920563	2920904	Okay.
2921923	2922803	All right, well, let's move on.
2923564	2937629	We kind of already have touched on this, so let me just formally bring up the topic of the Steam Box, which is now being called the Steam Machine, or Steam Machines, plural, as the case may be, because there's not just one.
2937669	2944152	There's going to be multiple forms of these coming out in 2014, according to the Valve announcement, which was the second one they made this week.
2944992	2950094	Also, they announced 300 prototype boxes will be available to Steam users for...
2950174	2950995	DarkSakura.com
2968752	2993799	all right all in all seriousness though uh you can actually go through this series of um like little i don't want to say hoops online but basically little mini achievements online if you want to sign up for this and even get a little bit of steam xp for doing it but one of them is like basically signing an agreement that you know the legal mumbo jumbo that it's still the property of valve and they can ask for it back and if it burns down your house it's not their fault you know type of thing
2994799	3012507	and then you have to have a public profile you have to because if they want people to share the information right it's got to be public and you have to actually play a game in big picture mode and with a controller and so I'm assuming that's also to make sure that somebody can kind of compare contrast I'm thinking it's kind of the
3012887	3013688	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3033669	3047471	obviously these things will be running Steam OS which will be on the Steam machine they are working with a variety of computer parts makers I have a feeling one of them is Alienware because didn't Alienware put some tweets out there about this?
3049052	3062034	I don't remember I thought I remember seeing something like that I know they're still having was it that one company that was doing the pistons doing one and maybe Alienware they do a lot of gaming stuff so I wouldn't doubt it but
3064318	3088239	I mean come on at the end of the day though I mean if it's that easy just to just build a box I mean it's not essentially since it's available free I don't see what they can really put together I mean aside from form factor and making something you know proprietary that way but it doesn't have to I don't think you need to have a box that's like the size of you know an Ouya or something like that because because it's going next to your TV I mean
3088539	3090100	Fuck, look at the size of the Xbox One.
3090140	3091640	That's a pretty decent-sized case.
3091800	3098002	And really, when you try to get it down that small, that means a lot more specialized parts, and it's going to send the price up a lot more.
3098082	3102703	So just, I don't know, make just a smaller case, and that's about it.
3103164	3108045	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says they don't want beta testers.
3108065	3109926	They want people promoting the Steam machine.
3110746	3113827	It's what Blizzard's doing with Hearthstone right now, and it's working very well for them.
3114887	3119930	PackDev says, it sucks that they're asking for the machine back, but I understand as a prototype they must have it back.
3120851	3123172	It's not that they're going to make you give it back.
3123272	3126874	In fact, I kind of highly doubt they will, but they have the right to ask for it back.
3127254	3130416	And I have a feeling, PackDev, that's to prevent people from selling it on eBay.
3130676	3133677	Because if they see one of those machines pop up on eBay, they're going to ask for it back.
3134098	3140921	I kind of think that's what... They have to just put that in there legally, so you can't go and try and sell it.
3140981	3141822	That's probably what it's for.
3143483	3144024	So there you go.
3144924	3150248	Tenkis in our chatroom says, Daft Punk better be getting some royalties for the use of Steam Machine.
3150889	3152270	No, I don't think it works that way.
3152290	3156954	I think because Steam Machine is not a music performance piece.
3156974	3158415	It doesn't happen that way.
3160597	3164200	And DC Nate says, I'm pretty sure those machines will be scattered to the winds.
3164320	3167022	Didn't they say they encouraged hacking them open anyway?
3167042	3167122	Okay.
3168739	3170040	Yeah, I think hacking's a part of it.
3170080	3172242	Wasn't that supposed to be the deal with the Ouya, too, though?
3173043	3176787	Well, the Ouya, yeah, they promised that, oh, you'd be able to root it from the beginning.
3176807	3178728	We'll give you the instructions to root it.
3178768	3179729	That never happened.
3179889	3181090	People figured it out anyways.
3181211	3193241	But it's all the more reason, you know, now that all this stuff's coming out, it's kind of making it more and more insignificant, I guess.
3193342	3193542	Yeah.
3194253	3195795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3212851	3214492	It's still... You're building a gaming PC.
3214532	3218916	It's not all of a sudden because SteamOS is on it that it's going to drop the price of parts.
3219076	3219556	It's not.
3219636	3226361	It's going to be very expensive to... You're not going to get a really great gaming PC for $400.
3227442	3232066	I mean, you're going to have to spend a lot of money to be able to build a nice PC.
3232966	3239151	But there'll probably be a bargain one for the streaming solution and very few games...
3239710	3242773	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3259691	3260051	DarkSakura
3283456	3287980	Well, there have been a few questions in chat about this, and it's about the Steam Controller.
3288580	3291022	First of all, it has no D-pad.
3291702	3294204	It is all using a touchpad.
3296746	3308135	The trackpads themselves are using haptic feedback, so it's basically something that's going to make it easier for people that are more used to playing FPS games on a PC.
3308655	3311197	It's supposed to make it a lot more friendly to use.
3311337	3312358	It also has...
3314820	3322064	Different shoulder buttons, some face buttons, and three buttons that are below the touchpad.
3323324	3331248	And what they're trying to do is make it basically run just using your thumbs as sort of the instinctive direction.
3333349	3338192	It looks pretty neat, and it actually looks like it would be ergonomically comfortable.
3339112	3339853	So hopefully...
3340549	3353281	It looks like they're taking a big cue from, I would even say, some of Sony's design for their PlayStation controllers.
3353721	3361288	The big thing about it is that with having a touchpad, it's trying to ascertain that it will always be supported for whatever game to be played on it.
3363021	3364741	I'm not sure I understand why I need one
3383167	3390174	I mean, okay, so yeah, they're trying to do something that goes with the box, but the Xbox 360 controller can play everything on Steam now.
3390334	3401365	Well, here's the other good thing about this, because it's using that double trackpad, is they also have it configurable to where it can be switched for left-handed or right-handedness.
3402246	3404368	So it offers a lot more comfort.
3404568	3404989	That's cool.
3405869	3406669	to people who play.
3406889	3410250	I think they're just trying to bridge the gap between PC and gamepad.
3410891	3413391	It's almost like having mouse controls, I guess, with it.
3413911	3433177	Once again, I can't tell by just looking at that if I would like it because, yeah, the haptic feedback would have to be pretty significant as far as making it feel different from trying to play a game on a tablet versus on this thing.
3433197	3433577	I mean, because
3434177	3447746	Honestly, at the end of the day, it's basically you're sliding your finger along a pad and you've kind of trained yourself if you're playing video games that you're using an analog stick or directional pad or something, at least console-wise.
3448446	3450168	And so it's going to be very different.
3450188	3452169	I think there's going to be a little bit of a learning curve with there.
3452389	3460794	And I did read a review or just some brief comments about it that the developer for Super Meat Boy actually got to try it out.
3461315	3462475	Somebody just posted that in our...
3464297	3465057	He liked it.
3465077	3468240	There's a few gripes about it and stuff.
3468360	3471702	Maybe some latency things that they need to iron out.
3472203	3475045	I think it's going to be a whole new learning curve, but it could be good.
3475645	3477707	I just don't know based on looking at that.
3478378	3479218	Saganar Chatroom.
3479278	3480579	Actually, let me start with GameGuru.
3480899	3484600	Says, Valve needs kiosks without controllers so we can play with it.
3484700	3485660	And how much is it going to be?
3485680	3487801	Because do I really need to buy another controller?
3487921	3489821	Is it going to be another $60 controller?
3490101	3491582	And are people really going to support it?
3491602	3495383	Because I understand that it's backwards compatible with all these other games that...
3496723	3510531	You can map it to keyboard and stuff, but dude, wouldn't it be a lot easier if they just put out some Steam app or something that, hey, now I can fucking map my gamepad, like my Xbox 360 controller to these older games and stuff.
3510611	3512372	Why can't they just do that?
3512573	3514794	I mean, instead of putting out this brand new controller.
3515054	3517596	I'm on Steam's page right now looking for price information.
3517636	3518596	I don't see anything.
3518636	3519477	They won't have it yet.
3519497	3519997	You won't find it.
3520897	3547092	Sagan Chat says the controller is attempting to bridge the gap of games needing mouse and keyboard without remaking the game I get that to a point because I think about what this controller would allow me to do I could play Civilization V on my TV essentially with this controller which is going to be a very surreal thing a very mouse and keyboard type of game I'm going to be able to use this controller on that's kind of funky I'm curious to try that see what that's like that could be very cool
3547612	3574663	but then I can't help but my brain goes to when we talk about bringing the mouse and keyboard games over to a controller I keep thinking most people don't want that because my head goes to first person shooters like Battlefield or even something like Mass Effect 3 where the people that are on mouse and keyboard are very loyal to mouse and keyboard and don't want the controller but the vice versa is also true you've got some people that swear by the controller and don't want to do the mouse and keyboard that's an age old thing
3575163	3576704	as old as the consoles themselves.
3577264	3583088	Becky wants to do all the fun customization stuff I've been doing in Mass Effect, but she doesn't want to use her keyboard.
3583609	3590053	She wants to keep using her Xbox controller, which doesn't quite work for the third game because they were kind of jerk faces about it.
3590113	3591033	It does on an Xbox.
3592034	3592694	You know what I mean?
3592914	3593595	I do, I do.
3594695	3600217	Which is completely stupid because basically the Xbox version is the PC version just with lower textures.
3601237	3605878	But it's also what people are used to and what they're more comfortable with.
3605958	3607799	She has wrist problems, I have hand problems.
3608439	3609839	For me, my keyboard's better.
3609879	3611360	For her, her controller's better.
3613266	3619973	I think I can see why they'd want to have something in between both styles.
3620514	3622195	But I don't know that it's going to catch on.
3622255	3625519	At least it would take a lot of persuasion for it to catch on.
3625659	3630884	I'm just worried about the price because that thing has another display in the actual controller that's a touchpad.
3631405	3632226	You know, so...
3633834	3634594	and DarkSakura.
3663690	3666931	What if I want to play with friends, you know, in my living room or something like that?
3667051	3668452	Or are they even designing it for that?
3668852	3669172	I don't know.
3669212	3670893	It's just really strange.
3670953	3674515	Let me ask this question and then we're going to move on for time's sake.
3674955	3681778	But I've seen this a lot on Twitter and I just kind of wanted to entertain this out there, you know, because this is where every gamer has a voice.
3681818	3685079	So sometimes I like to kind of see what's the pulse on things out there going on.
3685579	3698726	and a lot of the stuff I see on Twitter says, you know, if Microsoft or Sony had made an announcement this week along these lines, if Sony had rolled out that controller, they'd be getting crucified right now and raked over the coals over it.
3699287	3703089	And I have to admit, I don't think I agree with that because I think
3703669	3706871	There is a lot of skepticism behind the Steam Controller, especially.
3707192	3711615	There's less skepticism behind SteamOS because it's free.
3712356	3715298	It's hard to argue about something that's free and a choice.
3715418	3719361	I'll tell you what it is right here, and this is exactly what the issue is.
3720001	3721222	All of this is optional.
3721382	3725806	You can still use Steam the way it is right now, and nothing's going to change.
3726246	3727647	Or you can do all this other stuff.
3727687	3732851	It'd be like if the PlayStation 4 was going to use the Steam Controller exclusively...
3733571	3759469	Even optionally, I don't think anyone would really buy into it optionally But let's just say that it was And actually, we don't know how it connects It could be Bluetooth and maybe they could support it I mean, who knows But if this was going to be the only controller Then people would be like, well, hold on now I'm used to this controller that I've been playing with for the last three generations And now you're going to totally switch it up on me That's where people flip their shit and stuff And get pissed off at Microsoft and Sony about this kind of thing
3760269	3763031	but Steam, this is all new ground for them.
3763271	3764111	It's all optional.
3765492	3772176	Steam's not all of a sudden going to just stop working on current PCs unless you buy a Steam box or a Steam machine or whatever you want to call it.
3772596	3780780	So that's I think why people aren't really necessarily dogging them so much but at the same time I'm not really praising them so much because I don't know anything about any of this.
3781321	3785343	So far they haven't demonstrated to me why this is significant to me.
3786083	3787863	That's the thing I don't get about these tweets.
3787883	3792444	I mean, sure, there's always going to be fanboys, but there's fanboys in Microsoft and Sony's camps as well, clearly.
3792744	3796305	So, of course, there's fanboys in Steam's camp that are going to praise anything and everything they do.
3796865	3807647	And I love Steam, and I love a lot of it, and I'm interested in the Steam OS, and the price is the big thing for me on the Steam machines, but I've got to say, when it comes to the controller, I'm highly skeptical.
3807767	3809427	I mean, I guess I have to get my hands on one.
3809467	3814248	Hopefully they have them at gaming expos, or they have it out there where I can try this, but...
3814648	3819933	I am kind of skeptical about the controller and so forth, and that's okay to be a little bit skeptical, right?
3819953	3821775	I'm skeptical about a lot of things.
3822836	3829422	I'm still skeptical about an included Kinect with Xbox One, but we won't tread down that road.
3829782	3833566	I get why Microsoft's forcing it, I get it, but I still don't.
3833906	3837870	One of the things I forgot to mention during my game week, I canceled my pre-order for my PlayStation 4.
3838530	3839170	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3864958	3873001	Honestly, they didn't look that different and it didn't look that much more amazing on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One versus the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
3873701	3879783	I'm going to go on a limb and say there hasn't been a good launch game since Super Mario World.
3881906	3885709	Hell no, that Wii U Mario game is fucking great.
3886750	3888171	I can't even keep them all straight anymore.
3888511	3894576	The Mario game on this console, Super Mario Wii, it was better than the one on the Wii.
3894616	3898339	I can't put my finger on it, but I enjoyed it more than the one on the Wii.
3898359	3901702	I don't know if it's just the HD, the touchpad, being able to interact with multiplayer.
3901782	3902583	There's nothing wrong with it.
3902603	3905045	It's a decent Mario game, but it's not enough to sell me a system.
3905365	3906526	Yeah, that's how I feel too.
3906586	3916773	However, you know, I was all over my Super Nintendo because, you know, I got Zelda and I had Mario World and that was all I needed.
3916813	3918334	You know what would have sold that system?
3918754	3926759	If they never came out with Super Mario Galaxy and launched Super Mario Galaxy with the Wii U, that would have been pretty significant and looked a lot different than what they had out there.
3927240	3931262	I think that would have been a little bit better than just like another new Super Mario Brothers game, but whatever.
3931503	3933144	I mean, fine, we've already traded that.
3933164	3934264	Yeah, let's not go down that road.
3934324	3934885	I feel like we've,
3935886	3943353	but yeah seriously though the CMOS thing and then of course you know everyone's everyone's still hoping for a Half-Life 3 announcement but you know that's never gonna come
3943971	3948352	It was a little bit disappointing that there was no game announcement.
3948392	3956014	And I'm going to admit, I was one of those people disappointed that they didn't announce any games because the old rule, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3956034	3956274	Hold on.
3956534	3961316	I get that there's a ton of games already in Steam's library, and that's what they're pushing with these Steam machines.
3961356	3968838	But still, something to sweeten the pot and that would really just be optimized for SteamOS or something would have been awesome.
3969418	3984052	and it doesn't even have to be Half-Life 3 people if that's long and gone whatever Left 4 Dead 3 or heaven forbid a new IP from Valve or something they gobbled up a while ago and I forgot about would have been great
3984853	4002470	and I think there's still time because right now we've gotten the whole they're going to go through the beta testing thing kind of start building the buzz for it and stuff and once you get towards the launch of this new system whatever because I would assume they're treating it like a Steam console so they're going to have console games for it that's I think when we're going to see you know the bombs being dropped about like you know
4003370	4005210	Source 2, and that kind of stuff.
4006151	4013752	Assuming with Source 2 you're going to see new games, maybe not necessarily Half-Life 3, but Left 4 Dead 3, and whatever else is going to follow.
4013912	4015152	At the very least, Left 4 Dead 3.
4015812	4017733	I think Half-Life 3, though, is still being worked on.
4017773	4026134	It was probably being done on Source 2, and because they don't have anything to talk about Source 2 right now, there's nothing to talk about about Half-Life 3.
4027074	4028934	Alright, let's move on with some more stories.
4029214	4029455	Loki.
4030375	4031395	Alright, so...
4033823	4034403	Thanks for watching!
4052274	4056739	It is kind of weighed more towards the PlayStation 4 versus the Xbox One.
4056819	4068011	For example, they're saying that 15% of the people who are surveyed were going to buy an Xbox One compared to 26% who are going to buy a PlayStation 4.
4068832	4079759	and then of course the younger people were saying that only 27% were under the age of 40 were going to get an Xbox One compared to 41% under the age of 40 that were planning to buy a PlayStation 4.
4086423	4114736	it kind of makes sense to me if you think about it because I don't know I think a lot of people over 40 would still be that hardcore in the gaming I mean that's kind of before you know before a lot of you know that generation I guess you know the people that grew up in the 80s but um yeah so 15 and 26 I mean that doesn't seem that significant to me I don't really know what you know previous generations were like but um
4117202	4117502	I don't know.
4117802	4128691	I think for me and a lot of people I've talked to, it's just when you look at what they have coming out, like you just launched a huge game with Grand Theft Auto V on current generation consoles.
4129491	4141921	And all these big games that are coming out for the fourth quarter, the staple stuff aside from the next-gen exclusive first-party titles, you've got Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and Watch Dogs.
4142461	4157724	and like Need for Speed and all that stuff those are coming out in current gen as well as next gen so there's not a lot of um they haven't really given you a lot of reasons like okay here's the PlayStation 3 version here's the PlayStation 4 version here's why the PlayStation 4 version is better
4158024	4158664	Thanks for watching!
4179091	4179391	I don't know.
4179431	4181233	I think that's why people aren't that excited right now.
4181613	4197887	Although, once 2014 hits and we see a lot more next-gen exclusive games or games that look a lot better in next-gen than they do on current-gen, as we start to get that gap a little bit more, then yeah, it might be a little bit more advantageous to buy a next-gen system.
4198507	4203551	Yeah, but are people going to crucify the shit out of these consoles like they did the Wii U if the games aren't there right away?
4204292	4231201	but I think there are games there right now it's just there's third party games but the thing is I think it's going to be along the lines of like the Xbox 360 launch where you had a lot of titles that didn't look that much better than the Xbox titles there wasn't that huge difference because they're developing for both systems so you were kind of scaled back a little bit on you know the Xbox 360 and they sort of look like you know a little up res or slightly better versions of the original Xbox games I
4232101	4232521	Sorry, Jamie.
4232622	4234202	I just have this very funny feeling.
4235003	4236403	Call this whatever you want.
4236463	4237824	I just call it a funny feeling.
4237944	4239725	I haven't been doing this show for a long time.
4239745	4245968	I have this funny feeling that Xbox One is going to perform a lot like Wii U. I think it'll do fine during the holiday.
4246088	4249249	It's going to sell enough consoles to justify its existence and so forth.
4249590	4260735	But then when the games don't show up in 2014 like they never do during a console's first year, I think the sales of the Xbox One are going to drop off dramatically simply because of price.
4261355	4285111	and so forth and I think uh I think for some reason it's going to be okay and people will be like that's okay Xbox One will still but yet with but the third party developers aren't going to be jumping ship going we're only going to make PlayStation 4 games here's the thing though it's like I have to see how that looks because right now as far as the slate goes everything that's been I haven't really seen any aside from like you know uh Final Fantasy 14 and
4286051	4293701	I haven't really seen any PlayStation 4 exclusive titles that weren't first party that were coming out or even vice versa.
4293741	4297126	There hasn't been any Xbox One exclusive titles that were third party.
4297206	4300350	It's all been multi-platform kind of going forward.
4300991	4303694	Now, if one console completely tanks...
4304415	4305155	Yeah, that could change.
4324463	4325184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4338455	4342918	Random ass tangent because I'm going to totally switch to a different news story here in a minute here.
4343018	4348021	But I've got to ask this question while we're talking about sales and console wars and all that.
4350382	4354525	I was listening to another podcast I enjoy, Video Game Realness.
4354545	4357847	I don't know if you guys have all heard that show, but it's a really fun show.
4357887	4358627	It's like a newer show.
4359248	4363550	And they brought up a point on their last episode that even I kind of didn't realize.
4364331	4366472	But in Japan right now,
4367233	4378872	PlayStation 4, not coming out till 2014 Xbox One So what does that mean for the holidays in Japan this year?
4379393	4380335	Wii U is unopposed
4382054	4384095	Zat, have any bearing on anything?
4384415	4384895	No.
4385295	4385715	Why not?
4386735	4388155	Because it's all about the games.
4388275	4394297	I don't think that unless they come out and just really impress, I don't know, is Monster Hunter 4 coming out on Wii U?
4394357	4400778	Because I just don't think that they're going to wait because they know that it's coming.
4401399	4406680	No, but there is a Mario game that anybody who's touched it seems to really enjoy it.
4408040	4408440	I don't know.
4408600	4409100	I will see.
4409280	4410361	I mean, hopefully.
4410681	4419782	It's just like I hope there's a little bit of an uptick with, you know, the Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, but I don't think that people are treating it like a brand new Zelda game.
4419822	4424903	It's just kind of like they almost look at it as like an HD remake type thing, which it is.
4424963	4426104	I mean, I don't know.
4426284	4426704	Yeah, Jamie.
4426744	4431625	Well, IkumaJP in chat was saying that there's Vita ads everywhere.
4431645	4432225	Mm-hmm.
4432825	4442927	and the other thing that I was considering too is that I think that maybe Sony and Microsoft are relying on brand loyalty for marketing over here as opposed to having the games out.
4444268	4447268	I think Microsoft's already starting a push with marketing though.
4447489	4451029	They're getting those billboards up and they're getting their ads on TV and so forth.
4451069	4455530	I'm not sure so much about Sony but I know Microsoft's starting that push over here a little bit.
4457191	4460091	ShadowNextGen in chat says the Wii U has a nice holiday lineup.
4460131	4462072	Super Mario 3D World will move units.
4462752	4467557	It's really too bad they don't have Mario Kart 8 on deck this year because I really think that's the game.
4467577	4468297	That would help.
4468538	4470219	Even more so than Mario 3D World.
4470239	4472241	I think that's the game that they need right now.
4472301	4473582	I think that and Smash Bros.
4473622	4475144	would be pretty strong.
4476205	4476645	We'll see.
4476965	4485934	I realize good games take time and I'm living in a fan-wank world when I say if this holiday had been...
4486714	4490557	3D World, Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2, and Smash Bros.
4490877	4494839	I mean, we would not be hearing the death of Nintendo articles right now.
4494859	4495800	I think you can exclude Bayonetta 2.
4495860	4497501	I mean, that's not a system seller.
4497561	4498782	It's still niche.
4499302	4501404	It's niche, but it's niche in the right way.
4501604	4503505	Bayonetta 2 will perform like Wonderful 101.
4504306	4505466	It will not do well.
4505566	4510249	It will do okay, because all the niche people that are into Bayonetta will buy it.
4511590	4514192	By the way, I heard that Bayonetta is actually in that game, too.
4514772	4515052	Wonderful 101.
4516213	4526763	Um, but they will buy it, but it's just not going to be that significant because you have to have, you know, the just the regular players, you know, wanting to pick that game up.
4526843	4530647	Like, you know, regular players will pick up a Mario game, but they won't pick up Bayonetta 2.
4532528	4538230	I don't think that would... But yeah, those three big Nintendo titles would definitely help.
4538730	4546452	At least the wank I just said is not nearly as bad as... God, one of those investor websites where I sometimes wonder, like, has this person ever even played a fucking video game?
4546852	4552833	Where it says that in order for Nintendo to save itself, because, you know, there's no such thing as a 3DS right now.
4555274	4562901	in order for Nintendo to save itself they need to sell the Wii U without the gamepad is Nintendo going to be abandoning the gamepad?
4563241	4564022	what an idiot
4565965	4574933	There's a person who needs to get his corporate sponsorship out of his ass and actually play the system and live in the real world.
4575994	4576954	I will say this.
4577315	4587863	As much as I agree with that to an extent, there is a part of me though that goes, but Wii Fit U, that's not really built around the gamepad.
4588584	4593108	The Wii Sports HD, not really built around the gamepad.
4595751	4597872	Are they starting to do away with this?
4597972	4601833	Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?
4602473	4610596	I don't think so, because Mario Kart 8, etc., etc., but could this idiot be onto something?
4611476	4616637	Wii U without the gamepad, you think?
4617238	4618438	Then why not just get a Wii?
4622828	4624389	Why not get a 3DS?
4625069	4630213	I'm happier with my 3DS.
4630973	4634896	For the love of God, just do what you know is going to happen eventually.
4634956	4640960	Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U. Or even regular DS games like Clubhouse games.
4641140	4641920	It's going to happen.
4644102	4647984	We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish if they were to do that...
4649085	4653368	Why can't I play a DS game across the internet now?
4654169	4656910	That should be something I should be able to do, feasibly.
4657391	4658892	Why can't I fucking do that?
4659212	4660813	Like, the technology is there.
4661153	4667117	If you're gonna sell DS games on the Wii U, let me play Clubhouse games with friends on the other coast.
4667137	4667578	It is possible.
4667618	4668798	Instead of having to be in the same room.
4668979	4672921	Because, I mean, just going back to the one 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing...
4674322	4698949	I go to the International Island and chat with people in Japan and do the stupid Club Tortimer games with them and usually I don't have too much of a problem communicating because either there's a chance that between the Japanese I know and the English they know we can get a point across but I mean if they're letting you play with people across the ocean in a game like Animal Crossing why can't you play other games?
4700635	4704217	And actually, now that I think about it, that may have actually been the game I called out, Clubhouse Games.
4704237	4710301	You may have actually been able to play that across the internet on the DS, because the DS did have some internet-enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters you could do online, right?
4710841	4717085	But, you know, there were a lot of games you could only do in the same room, and it would be really cool if you could open that up.
4717145	4719687	And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a camera in it.
4719767	4723009	Why can't we be able to see friends while we're playing?
4725310	4726971	Or see Dick while we're playing.
4727272	4727712	Or boobies.
4728482	4730522	Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here.
4732403	4737864	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase BRUSH.
4738204	4740404	This is a huge kind of topic change here.
4740444	4749106	This is going back to a story from a long time ago, but we talked about this extensively on OLR when it first happened because it had a local connection.
4749766	4755348	And this goes all the way back to the year, I think it was 2007 when this all happened.
4755468	4756388	Or would it have been 2006?
4758508	4760049	I think it was, no, it was about 07 or 07.
4760089	4761489	When did the Wii come out, Nintendo Wii?
4761789	4762169	Was it 2006?
4762549	4766450	I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold.
4766730	4767851	Well, here's the thing.
4768631	4779434	Here locally in California, there was a radio station in Sacramento, specifically where our show is based, which is The End, and they had a contest called Hold Your Wii for a Wii.
4779634	4780574	You guys remember this now?
4780714	4780994	Yeah.
4781054	4783695	Yeah, because, and it really doesn't have, I mean...
4784555	4785156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4808176	4815741	These radio hosts and the radio station didn't realize that, yes, a person can die from drinking too much water and then not allowing themselves to go to the bathroom.
4815861	4818362	And people warned them during and before the contest.
4818623	4823286	And it was really just a hugely ignorant thing, unfortunately.
4823346	4828750	They were ignorant of the fact that a fraternity guy in Chico had passed away from the same thing not that long before.
4829430	4833353	Somebody called into the radio station even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this.
4833393	4834453	And they kind of laughed it off.
4834493	4836355	And that was the really damning thing.
4837015	4844362	and this whole thing because they laughed that person off and that clip really came back to haunt all those people that got fired.
4845463	4848365	So the Morning Rave was the name of this show at the time.
4848705	4849466	They got fired.
4851568	4858514	$16.5 million in damages awarded against the station in a lawsuit, but there were no further ramifications in place.
4858534	4860936	Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?
4861016	4861637	Because...
4862838	4875386	Media Watchdog Group, the Sacramento Media Group, and Media Action Center bringing legal action to the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, to block the renewal of the license for KDND.
4876186	4880989	So because of this incident that happened over a week six or seven years ago,
4882310	4887073	It's going to court where 107.9 The End may not get its license.
4887794	4893597	And just to kind of give you the local connection living here, I can tell you that radio station's huge in this area.
4893657	4896259	I think it's one of the top stations in the area.
4896299	4897940	It's the top 40 music station.
4898140	4901002	Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?
4901282	4903443	Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs.
4903563	4908626	I personally don't listen to it because it's like the Justin Bieber One Direction.
4908666	4910687	It's more of like a teeny kid station.
4911508	4912508	So no great loss.
4913129	4914410	But that shit's really popular.
4914450	4921614	There's still people that work at those stations and that's still... I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy.
4922194	4922574	Right.
4923135	4943887	And so it's very interesting that all this time later, but I mean, they kind of bring up a good point that I guess there was even a documentary, Sue Wilson in 2009, who was the founder of the Media Action Center and who was a vocal critic of KD&D, did a documentary called Broadcast Blues and says, quote, in that contest, a woman died, but the Federal Communications Commission has not acted in any way.
4944368	4947930	And you kind of look at that and go, well, she has a point.
4948490	4948931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4964309	4967391	If it were me, I would make it more difficult.
4968352	4983143	I mean, for example, to do maybe a complete investigation into their current practices to see that they have indeed learned from their mistake and are staying within proper health and safety compliance, that type of thing, before approving it.
4983163	4986045	Maybe give them extra requirements since they had
4986926	4995094	This history of events, because I mean, keep in mind for this, if you have a bankruptcy, it takes seven years to come off of your report, right?
4995595	5004103	We're looking kind of around the same time frame, you know, if your financial, you know, what's the word I'm trying to think of?
5005104	5005224	Right.
5005244	5005284	So...
5027632	5028352	So there you have it.
5028613	5038337	All these years later, the silly name of the Nintendo Wii still kind of causing these legal fallouts all these years later.
5038437	5039398	Very interesting.
5039698	5047202	If only they had stuck with the revolution, they'd be spinning in office chairs instead.
5049743	5050003	Funny.
5051744	5055006	I hate you and I really appreciate you all at the same time.
5056491	5057373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5072974	5074195	Right now, it would be too late.
5074275	5076277	It would just be almost spiteful.
5076417	5079279	And it's like you see all these years later.
5079339	5081921	Do you know what I still hear about in regards to the FCC?
5082442	5085784	Is when Janet Jackson, everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl.
5085804	5087626	You still hear about that today.
5088006	5094831	Because just recently there was an appeal of an appeal where the CBS stations themselves would not be fined.
5095612	5096392	Oh my god, people.
5096933	5097533	Oh my god.
5097773	5098374	It was a titty.
5098934	5099655	It was a titty.
5101744	5110355	When you've got people stringing up Most people already seen her titties With hands on them too Right?
5110876	5119046	It was her album cover Oh no, it was Rolling Stone Oh yeah, okay, it was Rolling Stone Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty Yes!
5121297	5122117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5138729	5141371	I agree, we need more nudity in shows.
5142552	5143994	Seriously.
5144294	5145795	It is such a double standard, you know?
5145835	5148177	It's like, oh my god, oh, there's a nipple.
5148457	5152981	And they even have it where they're pretty much topless, but they've got paces on or something.
5153021	5157445	But for some reason, that nipple, man, you've crossed the line when it's the nipple.
5157679	5159940	Why is the chat room going off about titty sprinkles?
5160120	5163122	I don't... Stop giggling.
5164183	5170846	SSG100Matt says, FCC is still going after MIA for last year's Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger.
5171146	5173088	Was that even last year or was that two years ago?
5173348	5174188	I don't know.
5174268	5175869	It was fucking sports ball.
5176209	5178931	Well, I mean, yes, but it was Madonna, Jamie.
5178971	5179331	Madonna.
5181412	5182493	But Beyonce was this year.
5182513	5184115	Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?
5184135	5186157	What's Madonna going to do to one-up Miley?
5186197	5191502	Because she made out with Britney Spears or whatever or there was a kiss or some garbage.
5191722	5193364	Now she needs to one-up.
5193784	5195946	Madonna will have to literally pull something out of her.
5195966	5199830	She will need to have sex with somebody on stage in the middle of her song.
5200190	5201672	Something is going to have to happen.
5202256	5202917	You know what?
5203357	5208180	And I have to say that Adam... What's his face that was on American Idol?
5208260	5208581	Lambert.
5208701	5209541	Yeah.
5209601	5211322	I thought... My mom's a big fan.
5211503	5212263	My mom is a big fan.
5212323	5212723	Rob!
5213404	5214665	I love Adam Lambert.
5215465	5216546	Or as... Rob.
5217147	5219028	As my friend Susan calls... He should have won, Rob.
5219268	5222751	He was... Why do they let 12-year-old girls vote on Idol, Rob?
5222971	5227994	They should ban little girls from voting on Idol because Adam Lambert was robbed because the other guy was cuter.
5228094	5228295	Rob.
5228615	5228795	What?
5228835	5230576	But the 30-year-old's won with David Cook.
5230876	5231337	Just saying.
5231357	5231457	What?
5232177	5237161	Anyway, and you know Susan, she calls him Madam Lambert.
5238562	5250232	But he went out on some of his performances being basically as, I'd probably say overtly sexual as some women feel that they need to do.
5250592	5252093	And he illustrated a very good point.
5252373	5255475	Why should women be expected to do this, but men be lambasted for it?
5256356	5263281	And at the same time, if a woman goes out and is classy, she still has a particular standard that men aren't particularly held to.
5264161	5270586	And, you know, I think that the big fault just has to do with basically the...
5272947	5280729	The expectations that society itself is forced to have by what's presented to us in the media.
5282150	5289132	I think that people losing their shit over a boob is how they are conditioned to react.
5290272	5290572	You know?
5291652	5294273	I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii to this, but here you go.
5294293	5297134	Alright.
5298345	5301406	Well, you know, actually the same will go for violent video games.
5303447	5304827	Sorry, I gotta wrap up.
5304847	5305668	The hot coffee thing.
5305728	5310529	We gotta move on because we're an hour and a half into the show and not even halfway through our show roll for part A. You know what?
5310669	5312710	I will flip off everybody for fucking free.
5312750	5314851	If you want to, you know, pay me 1.
5315651	5317892	Well, I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars.
5317992	5319952	I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off.
5321733	5322333	I'll do it too.
5322353	5325314	Are they talking about bedazzling boobs now?
5327095	5329276	I hate to say this, but Jamie, just ignore chat.
5329676	5330656	Go to the next story.
5330716	5334157	Actually, I do have to point out to Reginator that they have such a thing as bedazzling.
5334658	5335078	Think it over.
5337178	5338219	It's exactly what you think it is.
5338299	5338699	No thanks.
5341309	5347014	So, um, a lot of us love our LucasArts, and a lot of people love Maniac Mansion.
5347695	5352779	And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much, like, the, one of the best LucasArts games.
5353420	5360306	Well, another reason to be pissed off at Disney, with getting rid of LucasArts, they also got rid of a game that was 80% complete.
5360686	5364009	Hadn't yet been greenlit, but it was sort of a dream project for a lot of people.
5364930	5368253	And it was a Day of the Tentacle HD remake.
5368932	5375177	We've had a lot of HD remakes come in, especially DuckTales and the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion.
5376017	5378199	This one, I think, would have made a lot of people piss themselves.
5381730	5385011	With the fall of LucasArts, this was one of the games to suffer.
5385991	5389932	And on top of that, too, is they had a Star Wars smuggler game.
5390532	5392412	They had a Death Star iOS game.
5392632	5398213	A lot of stuff that was in process, including a Star Wars First Assault.
5399054	5401674	So, sad face.
5402714	5405475	But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be missing.
5405515	5410336	Now, if I found out there was a Loom game, I would have gone out on a rampage.
5410636	5410716	Yeah.
5412083	5416966	I really wish they could have transitioned this or sold it to somebody to finish or something.
5417006	5418628	This is really heartbreaking.
5418648	5419568	And it's 80% done.
5419628	5420289	I know.
5421449	5423371	So just really, really sad.
5423391	5425352	Just bring in Gearbox to finish the other 20%.
5425952	5426833	What could possibly go wrong?
5426853	5428694	There was a big expose on Kotaku about it.
5429495	5430976	And so that's where they got the information from.
5431076	5433137	Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show.
5433417	5434578	Shame on you.
5435098	5437360	Sorry, but the article actually was legit.
5438237	5438678	Fair enough.
5438898	5440460	Instead of being the other shit.
5441160	5443904	But I mean, that being said, you know.
5446149	5450432	It makes me think about when we have stuff like this.
5451853	5452934	God, I hate this stupid program.
5454314	5459678	When we have developers working on games and then just to have it stop.
5459778	5460559	Oh, you're defunded.
5460959	5462400	Oh, we're closing down your division.
5462960	5467363	Imagine the people that are working on this one and they are totally into what they're making.
5468144	5469725	Their heart goes into it.
5470405	5471266	Robotech Crystal Dreams
5484844	5512277	well one of the developers put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the levels and released it a lot of Atari 5200 prototypes Dan and I have gone out and bought because people have fished out the prototypes made them playable and put them on a repurposed cartridge and sold them I have a ton of there's NES games you know that basically all these prototypes like oh here's an example um
5514159	5534899	Space Fantasy Zone Complete game Didn't release because of the Sega license But I've got a copy People will find a way to get out what they love So I would actually be completely happy if someone decided to be sneaky with code and get that out

5610012	5610252	All right.
5610272	5612374	Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.
5612394	5613034	I got to be honest.
5613074	5614455	It's kind of a thin week in Japan.
5614515	5615056	Not a lot.
5615316	5616217	Nothing on PlayStation 3.
5616897	5620140	And the only thing you're going to see on Xbox 360 is some price reductions.
5620540	5626945	So Fable 2 and 3, Gears of War, the entire trilogy, and Halo 4, all getting price reductions in Japan this week.
5627645	5629887	You know, for all you 360 owners out in Japan.
5629907	5629987	Yeah.
5630607	5633089	Um, on the Vita, really nothing this week.
5633449	5636771	Uh, everything's ramping up towards October 10th is more of a busy week.
5637151	5639213	I did see something on the 3DS though.
5639273	5645137	There is, uh, S-P-E-C, Spec Can is the game that's coming out on the 3DS this week.
5645537	5646978	And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is.
5647018	5652061	It's labeled as an adventure game and it kind of looks like, I like the graphics because it's like an old school PC game in parts.
5652481	5655403	Kind of mixed with like a newer thing that's mixed with photography.
5655443	5657805	I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something, but, uh...
5658425	5659767	Maybe like a CSI kind of game.
5659787	5662731	But that is one of the lone releases this week is on the 3DS.
5663432	5663973	That game.
5665455	5666717	And check out the PSP.
5666797	5668039	Just make sure we're not missing anything there.
5668179	5668820	Yeah, nothing.
5669641	5671744	There's very few releases in Japan this week.
5671885	5672986	But stay tuned next week.
5673006	5673427	There'll be more.
5674255	5677858	Well, for our friends in the UK, there are a few releases.
5679339	5681080	For the 30th, there's Gridiron Thunder.
5682561	5685444	And on October 1st, there's Flashback for PC.
5686224	5692209	And then on the 2nd is Ares Extinction Agenda EX.
5693010	5698654	And on the 4th, we have F1 2013, NBA 2K14, and The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker for Wii U.
5701658	5705223	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5705304	5708248	By the way, chatters are telling me that my mic is cutting in and out.
5708308	5717602	Sorry, I can't see that live when I'm doing talking, so I'm going to try and hold this thing together, which is really unfortunate because this is a newer mic and was donated, so I don't know.
5717904	5718305	Thanks for watching!
5736087	5743217	Sorry, that's the downside of live radio is that I can't, you know, say, oh, hold on, guys, we're going to stop while I go fix this.
5743617	5745099	All right, let's move on, Loki.
5745981	5750086	Valve has started the beta for the Steam Family Sharing Program.
5750367	5752089	So the first thousand people that...
5752970	5767859	I guess we're invited we're sent invites this week through email or hopefully through the actual messaging through Steam because if it's through email I didn't fucking get that because I get so much spam it's ridiculous
5768619	5769379	Thanks for watching!
5786653	5801787	So once I get mine going, because I am playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto, I will probably have to add people to my Steam sharing thing so that maybe Bobby can play the legit copy of Saints Row 4 and get those achievements.
5803028	5804809	Yeah, I'm waiting for mine to come in too.
5804829	5805890	I want to play Saints Row 4.
5806451	5811055	I'm waiting for mine to get enabled too so I can do some of that sharing and test that out and be fun.
5812297	5813600	All right, well, moving on.
5813680	5815686	One more story for you guys for the Classic Game of the Week.
5815746	5819616	And this is about one of the few animes I used to watch years and years ago.
5820106	5821026	Oh, your favorite, Rob.
5821066	5822067	Pokemon!
5822127	5822787	That's right.
5822847	5823528	Yay.
5823628	5832932	You know, as much as I razzed the series and give Shane a hard time for being such a fan of the series, you know, on Horde House and so forth, I actually like legit used to love the old school Pokemon anime.
5834693	5836073	This is way back when I was in college.
5836093	5837254	I mean, this thing is like years old, right?
5837274	5840816	Do you remember when I brought my VCD of the Japanese version of the movie over?
5840836	5841276	Yes, I do.
5841496	5841736	I do.
5841756	5842236	That was great.
5842276	5844937	I remember going to see the first movie in the theater.
5844997	5845618	I went with you.
5846939	5848039	You saw a later one with me.
5848099	5848780	Did I?
5849000	5851582	No, I went and saw the very first movie with my friend Amanda.
5852702	5853803	It's too bad Sig's not listening.
5853843	5854564	He knows her very well.
5854904	5859307	But Amanda and I went to this movie, the first movie.
5859327	5862229	We were the only people in the largest auditorium in the theater.
5862709	5863590	So what did we do?
5864030	5866672	We were screaming our heads off, mimicking all the Pokemon.
5867012	5868573	We had the best time ever.
5868593	5870154	It was so fun.
5870194	5875598	But anyway, the important thing to talk about news-wise is that Pokemon Origins,
5876318	5877559	is coming to the West.
5878300	5887067	This is an anime that is a whopping four episodes long, but it will launch on November 15th in the Pokemon TV mobile application.
5887367	5891831	This tells the stories of the very first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Blue.
5891951	5892812	I thought that looked like Red.
5892992	5894213	From the original 96 Game Boy.
5894253	5894933	Yeah, 96 Game Boy.
5895554	5895694	Okay.
5898476	5908004	The protagonist named Red will travel through the Kanto region and get into trouble with Team Rocket, battle his rival, and challenge the Pokemon League.
5908424	5912808	Also, Pokemon the movie Genesect and The Legend Awakened will air later this month.
5912868	5915249	My god, how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point?
5916010	5917971	They only ever did, what, like four of them in theaters?
5917991	5919352	I only cared about the first one.
5919432	5920233	I know, right?
5920693	5931040	Well, the second movie was also great because if for nothing else, for the line where Jesse and James from Team Rocket, Jesse goes, the opposite sex is nothing but trouble.
5931120	5936464	And then James goes, that's why I stay out of that kind of trouble and laughed my head off when that happened.
5936957	5938138	It's on YouTube somewhere.
5938178	5938658	Go check it out.
5939399	5939799	There you go.
5939859	5940800	Pokemon Origins.
5940980	5943742	I'm kind of thinking I might have to try it.
5944143	5944543	We'll see.
5945183	5945844	See how much it costs.
5946144	5947545	For the record, I like Digimon better.
5949146	5949467	Okay.
5950548	5950888	All right.
5951048	5954731	I would say let's travel back to a time when Pokemon wasn't around, but...
5955531	5957492	There were plenty of Pokemans around for this.
5958012	5970035	Thanks to the rule change invoked by DarkSakura last week, ten years ago there were still plenty of Pokemans and plenty of classic, classic video games that are as old as this show.
5970435	5971355	Old as balls.
5973596	5975257	Are you saying this show is old as balls?
5975458	5975998	Probably.
5976138	5977339	All right.
5977379	5977899	Well, here it is.
5978160	5979941	The classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
5980782	5987567	Now that you can rip open the PlayStation 2 era, even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter, you already did when you picked the Mosquito game.
5987807	5988388	Yes, I did.
5988448	5989088	I've done other.
5989428	5989929	But whatever.
5989989	5990309	Whatever.
5990489	5992411	I've done newer games than this, too, now that I think about it.
5992471	5992731	Yeah.
5992911	5993472	But here it is.
5993532	5994593	The classic game of the week.
5994633	5995633	DarkSakura, what did you pick?
5995874	5998856	I'm going with Kingdom Hearts for Rob.
5999363	5999944	Well, thank you.
6000084	6000484	I appreciate that.
6000504	6002045	And everybody else who bought the HD version.
6002125	6003707	Even though I go, wait a minute.
6003927	6011834	Like, when this game came out, I remember playing this when it was new, and I think we were doing OLR at the time.
6012214	6014356	This game came out 11 years ago.
6014676	6015176	Oh, God.
6017338	6018359	I was still in my 20s.
6020301	6021522	Because fuck a bunch of that.
6022923	6023964	I love this music, by the way.
6026250	6027231	The Traverse Town music.
6027831	6029111	Freaking love it.
6029792	6032253	So anyway, it was Kingdom Hearts.
6033293	6040717	And as we know, it's an action role-playing game put out by Square at the time, now Squeenix, and came out on PS2 in 2002.
6042418	6045879	And it was a collaboration between Squeenix and Walt Disney.
6046439	6051322	Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around and lots of Disney characters around.
6051402	6054183	It's like the two universes had a very cute baby.
6055660	6057041	Very cute, kind of fucked up baby.
6059262	6072348	And so this one, for Square to have done so many regular RPGs, you know, their standard JRPG format, this was a little bit of a departure to be a lot more action-oriented.
6072849	6072989	And
6073849	6078891	In my case, it was a lot more, oh my god, Donald, knock the fuck off, I don't need healing.
6079691	6082212	Just saying, that was the common thing you would hear in my house.
6083592	6096037	The really great thing about it, too, is that a lot of the character designs were done... I'm sorry, the director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura, who had done a lot of the character design in Square Games.
6097658	6100119	I had a fantastic voice cast.
6100239	6106864	I mean, even though at the time I think it was right at the height of the Hayley Joel love.
6107525	6112529	And what actually has impressed me is that he's still voicing Sora and can still make himself sound that young.
6113149	6115391	He's, you know, aged a bit.
6115891	6117092	Still kind of a cute dude.
6117553	6124137	But I like the fact that he is that talented as a voice actor that he can still sound so young.
6125738	6127339	It had lots of fun cutscenes.
6127379	6131742	I mean, you had your Final Fantasy VIII characters hanging around.
6131782	6135484	You had the Sephiroth thing was pretty fun.
6135824	6141867	You had your Squall hanging out, or I'm sorry, Leonhart.
6143308	6145249	And you would get little nods.
6145609	6153073	I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs, but you'd get little nods to other Square games and to different Disney franchises.
6153886	6155207	and it was pretty fun.
6155788	6160352	And I'm not even going to go much into Kingdom Hearts 2 because that, of course, is newer.
6161093	6163095	It had the Tron level, which was amazing.
6165322	6168765	This game was just awesome, except for the gummy ship, which was my least favorite part.
6168865	6170326	I hated navigating the gummy ship.
6171166	6173989	And I kept saying, why is it a gummy ship when there's no gummy bears?
6175350	6176110	I mean, hello?
6177591	6184777	So, as far as your characters, you've got the main character Sora, you have his buddy Riku, and Kairi.
6186838	6191642	And for the record, Actdeft, I knew how to set up Donald and he was still a shit.
6193087	6198192	So, basically, you team up with Donald and Goofy to find King Mickey.
6199454	6205140	And your main character is the main antagonist is Ansem and the Heartless.
6206381	6208904	So, this game has spawned so much wank.
6209104	6209885	So much wank!
6210665	6217390	But other characters that show up in there, I mean, you've got 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest.
6217671	6221934	You have major Disney villains in the game.
6222014	6227098	You can summon different characters too, like you have the genie, you have Tinkerbell, you have Simba from The Lion King.
6227847	6230049	Riku from Final Fantasy X was supposed to show up, but was replaced by Yuffie.
6247445	6250907	You have the Cloud and Sephiroth showdown in the Olympus Coliseum.
6251788	6253209	So much really good stuff.
6253309	6259312	And the story itself is so rich that they seem to really plan on there being more than one.
6259613	6260973	They were really looking ahead.
6262855	6263035	But...
6266269	6268670	I can't say enough good about this game.
6268810	6270211	It was really amazing.
6270271	6283919	And basically, the way that this came about was that there was a discussion between Shinji Hashimoto and Sakaguchi about Mario 64, where they wanted to do a three-dimensional movement.
6285539	6289922	But they said the only way to rival a Mario game would be to have Disney behind it.
6290502	6297863	and Nomura overheard the conversation and actually led the way to start building the game.
6297883	6305825	And then there was a meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator where they were in the same building in Japan.
6306525	6308045	And magic was made.
6308685	6309665	So they brought it together.
6310545	6314946	It's got fantastic music, a fantastic voice cast.
6315386	6319507	And I have to say, both the English voice cast and...
6319947	6348219	the Japanese voice cast were top notch after hearing them in both and then getting Utada Hikaru to do the main song both in Japanese and English although honestly I think the Japanese version is better I think there was a lot more production value behind it and like there's some of the voice cast that they couldn't get for the American one like they couldn't get Robin Williams they had I can never pronounce this guy's name properly Dan Castellaneta
6348699	6350921	Dan... He's Homer Simpson, yeah.
6351001	6351202	Yeah.
6351702	6352543	I can never pronounce those.
6352563	6353604	Italian, I think Castaneda or something like that.
6353624	6355706	But I mean, they get Billy Zane and David Borneas.
6355926	6362852	So I was like, well, they got the guy who plays a really down-on-himself guy to play another really down-on-himself guy.
6362872	6366956	I think, though, isn't he also the voice, though, in the second and third movies?
6367376	6379613	He was in the TV show because after Robin Williams had the falling out with Disney over Aladdin he stepped in and did the voice Robin Williams came back and did the third movie though when they all kissed and made up
6383325	6389327	At any rate, they got really, really top-level voice talent.
6389807	6398749	Sometimes when you get an RPG in Japan, they'll have top-notch voice actors behind it there, but we won't get as big names there.
6398769	6403810	This is probably one of the first to have really significant talent put into a game.
6404810	6410756	I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it, you'd expect them to put in that kind of production value.
6411457	6414320	And I don't think anybody was disappointed by this game.
6414400	6416122	If anybody was, then they're wrong.
6417859	6426325	I can see, though, when you put it next to Kingdom Hearts 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 fixed a lot of problems with the first one with the camera and so forth.
6426925	6434851	And this was stated as the runner-up for the PS2 Best Game of 2002 Reader's Choice Award.
6435791	6436972	Let's see what the first one was.
6439694	6444237	GamePro said that the battle system was like the N64 Zelda games, which, honestly, I thought was really good.
6444897	6453761	and then there actually were plenty of compliments for the AI with Donald and Goofy and it really was very customizable.
6453921	6457402	I would just always get irritated because sometimes Donald would do shit the wrong time.
6457422	6460343	It doesn't get any better in the HD version, just letting you know.
6460843	6462124	Donald's still his stupid head.
6462364	6463565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6493084	6499505	I really like when you have something big come out and then have it be a success.
6500165	6504026	And then have such a really beautiful story around the whole thing.
6504406	6505646	And there's still a lot we don't know.
6505847	6512768	You remember how everyone went, oh shit, when everyone saw Riku blindfolded in the organization outfit.
6512788	6513728	Everyone was like, ah.
6514208	6519189	And then the little ending for 2 where everyone was in the whole Keyblade Graveyard scene.
6519329	6525271	I saw an amazing Google Doc that was like 50 pages long that was trying to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
6525772	6527392	And I was like, and it's for kids?
6527672	6530614	But it spawned that much fan involvement.
6530654	6537456	And when you've got, when you can build a dedicated fan base like that, you know you've really got something important and special.
6538837	6545565	Kingdom Hearts is really, I think, one of the first games that's bought several different levels of fandom together.
6546405	6550450	And I think that's a pretty monumental event, too, because usually fandoms are like, bitch, please.
6552272	6552612	All right.
6552993	6553814	Well, there it is, guys.
6553834	6555235	Your classic game of the week.
6555415	6556196	Kingdom Hearts.
6557217	6569948	on the PlayStation 2, but of course, as we all know, now on the PlayStation 3 with the whole HD version, which in our chat room, ShadowNextGen points out, Rob, I heard they fixed the camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD remix on PlayStation 3.
6571029	6573551	It's better, but I still get frustrated with it, to be honest.
6574011	6578934	But I gotta admit, Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy XIV.
6579274	6584236	Now that I finally hit endgame and maybe that'll calm down a little bit, I'm hoping to go back and play more Kingdom Hearts.
6584576	6591740	And another good thing is that I have to say that it gave Utada Hikaru some really, really good exposure here in the U.S.
6592000	6593601	Yeah, she ended up having her albums on.
6593621	6595202	She's had several albums now in the U.S.
6595422	6595562	Two.
6596062	6598603	Well, I think that she had two and then an EP, didn't she?
6598623	6599783	I don't think so.
6599803	6604905	I think it was just the one that Timbaland produced and then the Come Back to Me.
6605105	6606865	Her best of from Japan is on the U.S.
6606905	6607125	Store.
6607585	6608486	Ah, that might be what it is.
6609126	6611627	But at any rate, I freaking love her voice.
6613287	6613927	All right, there you go.
6614387	6615148	The Classic Game of the Week.
6615568	6618188	We're running long tonight, so we're going to go right into our break.
6618289	6619269	Don't go anywhere, guys, though.
6619289	6622990	We'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6630003	6641510	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, September the 29th of 2013, the 521st episode of our show already in progress.
6641750	6650095	And unfortunately, those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to hear the music that we play during the break while we, you know, get up and stretch and refill our drinks and so forth during the break.
6650515	6654658	But we had a fun little background medley from Kid Icarus that played in the break there.
6654678	6659541	And it just reminded me how much I love the music in Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood.
6660311	6661432	Even though that game's fucking hard.
6661532	6664594	It is fucking hard, but I still like to go back and play it once in a while.
6664654	6669758	I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one sitting, but I can at least get through the first world.
6670018	6672000	Terror, Danger, Horror, XXXX.
6672020	6673381	You picked Uprising, right?
6673921	6674342	I did.
6674362	6675142	It's up my house.
6675262	6678244	You know, and that game hurt my hand so much to play.
6678284	6680386	I never really made a lot of progress in that.
6680466	6685890	I enjoyed it, but I kind of wish they'd do it on Wii U. That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U. Didn't.
6685930	6688512	Can they say they originally had a console version?
6688532	6690973	Yeah, they had a Wii version.
6692114	6692434	Alright.
6693015	6700079	Well, anyway, let's get into some rapid-fire gaming news and talk about some things that will be happening, unlike Kid Icarus on Wii U.
6701380	6706481	So there was an ARG that was tied with Surgeon Simulator that's now finally been cracked.
6707341	6715483	It was a secret code that you would put in the Zero Gravity Surgery mission and you'd get sucked outside of your ship.
6715903	6723365	And now you have a brand new set of surgeries you can do on an alien in Zero Gravity with alien tools.
6723725	6727186	And they have you do all sorts of weird stuff like...
6728267	6743424	Gobble Shaft Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a Gobble Shaft it's pretty funny so check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator there's actually videos out there that show you what the access code is and you can do all that so yeah
6743664	6760553	and then of course there's the second season of Mortal Kombat Legacy 10 episodes I guess they were all released at one time it's being hosted by Machinima if you may remember it was that live action series that came out around the time that the last Mortal Kombat game came out
6761614	6780753	and so yeah if you want to check it out it's on YouTube Machinima and 10 episodes for your digestion and last but not least Rockstar put out some information about Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this Tuesday on the 1st well bumpy launching on the 1st may or may not launch on the 1st
6781400	6782822	Launching in an MMO sense.
6782962	6786146	We'll be stable by mid-October.
6786366	6790571	Okay, so basically they were talking about some of the stuff and answered some of the rumors that were going around.
6791232	6799822	Confirming that there will be, not really microtransactions, but there will be some sort of online transactions to purchase in-game money.
6800382	6828537	so they have that however they preface that with you will be able to play the game and it's been balanced for people playing the game regularly and you won't actually have to buy money if you don't want to but if you want to just get ahead buy your fast cars and better weapons and crib or whatever by all means go ahead and do that some of the stuff that they announced that they're going to be doing with that they're going to be including some different
6829798	6835039	Activity, Jobs, Sports, Tennis, Content Creators for Deathmatches and Races Beach Bum Pack Customization Items Weapons
6858443	6865987	Capture the Flag is going to be coming back, and they're also going to have a content creator for that, and they'll be introducing Heist.
6868148	6869608	So that's going to be pretty sweet.
6870128	6873870	And 700 Missions, I think, is what they teased before, are going to be available online.
6874370	6878432	Compare that to 69 that are in the single-player game.
6878472	6879653	That's pretty significant.
6879673	6879973	Hmm.
6882154	6895880	and people have actually dug through the files and a couple things that they've been of course they have of course they have drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well as betting on horses at the track so it's Derby Owners Club
6896340	6896741	Hooray!
6896861	6898783	Do you get to whip the horses, though, like you do in Derby Hunters Club?
6898803	6899624	I don't know about that.
6899724	6901045	That's a game I haven't played in forever.
6901085	6901746	I miss that game.
6901886	6906551	But seriously, mention again, you know, we do have the VOG Network crew that you can join.
6906571	6908032	You can go check out the forums.
6908413	6909153	You have the link to that.
6909213	6915860	Otherwise, I believe it's socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.
6916821	6917162	VOG Network
6933798	6934759	Shadow Warrior and Saints Row 4
6951582	6958244	If you own Saints Row 4 on Steam and you own Shadow Warrior on Steam, you'll unlock the Penetrator weapon in Shadow Warrior.
6958644	6963786	That's right, the purple dildo bat will be yours to slaughter the enemies.
6964206	6965146	I love that it has balls.
6965286	6969188	In the ancient Japan setting, that is Shadow Warrior.
6970248	6972989	You play a character named Wang, so I mean, it's fitting.
6973109	6978351	I know, it's just silly, but you know, anything involving Saints Row usually is.
6978471	6979351	I'm just completely...
6980876	6982036	Amused that it has balls.
6984677	6986918	Do you want me to bring up the balls again so you can giggle some more?
6987178	6988878	Tee hee.
6989358	6996020	I'll have you know though, it only had balls over here in this region and in Europe.
6996340	7002602	It did not have balls in Japan where I believe it was censored and it didn't have the wiggle physics in Japan either.
7002622	7003222	That's right.
7004142	7006083	So silly what they have to change from region to region.
7006483	7009665	All right, look, safe for, I believe, almost everyone.
7009725	7013968	Try a game like Rocksmith 2014, which, of course, is the newest Rocksmith game.
7014369	7020273	Kind of more of kind of like a cult-level music game because it's not pushing plastic buttons to instruments.
7020613	7024676	Well, I guess it is in a way, but you're actually learning to play the actual guitars.
7024716	7026117	That's kind of what sets... He uses a real guitar.
7026137	7026977	Yeah, he uses a real guitar.
7026997	7028939	So it's kind of what sets Rocksmith apart.
7028979	7030620	So it definitely has its following because of that.
7031000	7033402	If you weren't already aware, there is a new version coming this year.
7033482	7034042	It's Rocksmith 2014.
7035363	7038165	and some mini-games will be involved in this.
7038446	7045951	There's a Guitarcade, which was also in the first Rocksmith game, but you play games that are retro-inspired.
7046311	7054878	For example, there's a game like Duck's Redo, which is basically Galaga, but it can't actually be Galaga because Ubisoft didn't make Galaga, so there's all those issues there.
7055598	7062524	Some of the other Guitarcade games that are available for playing, Scale Racers and Gone Whalen.
7063044	7063985	and Scale Racers.
7064085	7067808	You will master scales while avoiding traffic in a police car chase.
7068508	7075074	And Gone Wailing will make you play louder or quieter to elevate characters and collect coins.
7075534	7082800	And lastly, there's Return to Castle Core Dead, which is a first-person shooter where you strum chords to kill enemies.
7084244	7086346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7108602	7110083	Just Dance 2014 Just Dance 2014 Just Dance 2014
7130436	7134321	Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj, Gentlemen by Psy.
7134341	7136223	That's a good song.
7136403	7138585	Let's see, even Ricky Martin's back with Maria.
7139046	7140688	Where Have You Been by Rihanna.
7141769	7146214	Oh God, that horrible, horrible blurred line song by Robin Thicke is in this.
7146234	7148217	That song needs to be removed from everything, ever.
7148277	7149959	He needs to be removed from everything, ever.
7149999	7150980	It's just a bad song.
7151780	7156102	But in better news, Flashdance What a Feelin' by the Girly Team.
7156182	7157903	Sadly, it's a cover, but it's something.
7158303	7159244	YMCA is there.
7160144	7167207	And attention Beliebers, the Will.i.am song That Power, which features Justin Bieber, is in there too.
7168128	7171349	Gamebuoy.org will be happy to know Kesha is in the game with Come On.
7171509	7172410	I do love Kesha.
7173490	7173990	I do like her too.
7174010	7177712	Kesha is so fun in such a guilty pleasure way.
7178272	7187801	For those of you that like more basic singers, Katy Perry's in the game with I Kissed a Girl And if you like your musicals, Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game What the fuck?
7188061	7190043	That's random How random is that?
7190283	7194767	Is that like a holdover from Just Dance Disney?
7195127	7200112	I have no idea And one of the songs of the summer, Get Lucky by Daft Punk
7201252	7202953	Oh yeah, everybody likes that song.
7203613	7207093	I like this song, David Guetta with Sia She-Wolf, Falling to Pieces.
7207394	7208034	But you know what?
7208774	7211795	All of these songs, all of them, shit.
7213195	7214055	They are trumped.
7214635	7218116	They are just nothing with the inclusion of this song.
7219176	7221857	Gimme, gimme, gimme, A Man After Midnight by ABBA.
7222157	7222877	That's all you need.
7222997	7223537	Fuck the rest of it.
7223557	7224137	You and your ABBA.
7224157	7225078	Fuck the rest of it.
7225978	7226498	End quote.
7227887	7231772	I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it.
7232053	7233094	Nope.
7233735	7238160	Unfortunately, DarkSakura, ABBA trumps that song.
7238421	7238961	I have to.
7239442	7239803	Sorry.
7241545	7244709	If you think about it, DarkSakura... I don't think ABBA could even...
7246831	7251953	Now Rob, did you ever pick up Abba You Could Dance for the Wii?
7252113	7252634	I did.
7253394	7257996	You should have seen Rob do freaking ballerina spins.
7259336	7264959	I wish I had been recording it because Rob's like, I've got the Abba game, you need to come over.
7265039	7265659	I'm like, okay.
7265979	7294538	and I'm sitting back in this chair that no one can see me point to except for us in this room thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing like that was a couple years ago and you know game streaming and Rob's like look what I got and I did the winner takes it all for Jamie well and then I don't want to talk oh and remember you bringing SingStar Abba over to my house when Tiara was over I still have SingStar Abba right there right next to SingStar Queen that is like the best shelf in my entire house
7295191	7296733	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7313354	7314115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7333214	7333974	I don't have a Wii Remote Plus.
7357103	7359705	I never... And the game does require it.
7359765	7364228	I'm going to get shit for this, but I never played Skyward Sword, so I didn't have one.
7364248	7368090	Neither have I. And the game does require it, so yeah, that's why.
7368271	7368711	Exactly.
7369291	7380559	So you can get that for $70, the bundle that has all of that, or you can buy the game separately for $40 if you have, you know... Wow, they significantly reduced the price of the controller.
7380659	7381419	Oh, wait, no, they didn't.
7381459	7383941	It's actually a full price controller, so fuck them.
7384321	7386123	You know, just buy a used one, seriously.
7386503	7387024	Oh, you.
7387204	7387544	All right.
7387965	7389366	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7389406	7389987	Not ABBA.
7392309	7395692	Well, for the Super Smash Bros.
7396112	7397654	roster, we have a new addition.
7397754	7401938	We have Wind Waker Link and all of his adorable cuteness.
7402819	7408584	And I believe he's going to be on both versions, also with his adult incarnation as well.
7409725	7410967	So fun.
7412009	7412911	Mighty No.
7412931	7416496	9 is also coming out for the Vita and the 3DS.
7416837	7420062	It basically reached the goals for those, so you know what?
7420603	7421985	If I get it, I'll get it on 3DS.
7422486	7423929	I don't think it's reached those goals yet.
7426103	7430045	Well, no, when it reached 3.5 million, but it's pretty close, I think.
7430145	7430565	I don't know.
7430585	7431926	They've only got two days left.
7431986	7433486	They might not hit it.
7433866	7435027	I still haven't put in money yet, though.
7435047	7436968	I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there.
7437948	7442490	And in other news, Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack.
7443230	7451835	Uh, it's coming, um, there's a listing for, uh, the, uh, let's see, Rockman X Soundbox on, uh, Rakuten.
7452095	7458758	So, it looks like it's gonna be out for, wow, it's expensive, 12,600 yen, so basically 127 bucks.
7459679	7460279	A lot of money.
7460699	7461820	Someone get that for me and rip it.
7463541	7463781	No.
7464681	7464981	Yes!
7466222	7469144	Actually, I have a game on my list, Rob, that I need to have.
7469164	7471685	Oh.
7472475	7473096	Shut up, phone.
7473196	7475478	Rob is playing with his phone during the show, everybody.
7476438	7480722	There's like a lot of people out there that still don't realize I do a show on Sunday nights.
7481282	7482644	You've been doing it for 11 years.
7482764	7484325	My mom knows I do a show on Sunday.
7486775	7488716	Anyway, moving on.
7488756	7490377	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
7490457	7493759	Every week we go to our Facebook community and our Google Plus community.
7494119	7497141	And if you slam those words together, you get Fugle.
7497401	7499502	And it's the Fugle Question of the Week.
7500063	7501643	Except I don't have my music.
7501664	7502324	Where's my music?
7503565	7504725	DarkSakura, you took my music.
7508168	7508808	That's not good.
7509308	7509989	How did I lose that?
7510569	7511049	I did not.
7511209	7511489	Rob.
7511749	7511969	Rob.
7512069	7514150	I'm so prepared.
7514170	7518571	See, getting these messages on the phone and everything just threw me off.
7519751	7520452	I didn't do shit.
7521892	7522612	You don't know shit.
7523553	7523933	You know what?
7523973	7527274	We need to sit down and watch Showgirls with a bunch of crap food.
7527494	7527814	We do.
7528714	7529214	Good times.
7530495	7531335	Anyhow, here we go.
7531355	7531835	Did you find it yet?
7531855	7532695	Yes, I found my bumper.
7532735	7533055	Here we go.
7533075	7533956	It's right here.
7540882	7542364	Here it is, the Foogle Question of the Week.
7542444	7547831	We went with the obvious this week, with a lot of folks talking about the Steam Machine and all the related stuff.
7548291	7550614	What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?
7550735	7553198	SteamOS, Steam Machine, and the Steam Controller.
7553638	7557063	Let's start with Andy R., who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid.
7557443	7560004	but I do want to try it and I'm pretty happy with my current PC.
7560424	7562345	I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me.
7562705	7567887	I'll wait until we have more concrete details, machine specs, prices and so on until I pass further judgment.
7568268	7571049	Signed up for the beta thingy though so I have at least a passing interest.
7571889	7581373	Tigerclaw says I think SteamOS is perfect for those that like to build a home theater and PC in a small form factor with a good graphics card and play their Steam games on the HDTV.
7581433	7582894	That presents a lot of opportunities.
7583334	7585315	And there are those that want to play those Steam games but
7585495	7587797	Don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig.
7588097	7590579	The Steam machine will be perfect for first-time PC gamers.
7590599	7593121	It'll be interesting to see what they can do with the Steam controller.
7593161	7603048	The fact that it has no thumbsticks but uses touchpad technology, I'm curious to how responsive the controls are given the tech is the kind you'd find in laptops, which is often not very responsive to touch.
7606411	7610134	Katsuhiko J says, that controller is something different for a change.
7610174	7611835	I need to try it before I pass judgment.
7612156	7612536	Who knows?
7612576	7613677	It could be the next best thing.
7614077	7616439	Valve made a bold move this past week.
7616819	7618941	I'm interested in their OS.
7619001	7624986	Chris C says, I think spec-wise, the hardware in the Steam console would have to be on par with
7625266	7628647	RedTheHaze left us with this too-long-didn't-read version, but you can read his full answer on Facebook.
7628707	7630208	It says, Hmm, I like that perspective.
7654157	7657459	Uh, Xiao says, uh, the Steam OS has my interest.
7657839	7659000	I'm not much of a controller.
7659500	7660401	I'm not much of a controller.
7660441	7663123	I think I'm a controller person, but I'd like to give it a shot.
7663443	7665684	The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices.
7666044	7668506	The Steam machines may have multiple price models.
7668866	7671848	The OS is free, but surely they have an ideal on the controllers.
7672168	7675690	I can't shut up and give you my money, Gabe, if you don't tell me how much you desire.
7675710	7678392	It's like the third person I've seen say, we need a price.
7679232	7703010	UnfoldedRaptor said I heard nothing about Daft Punk being involved with the Steam Machine nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS so no sell for me yet Ragenator says it's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game given that I don't know too much on the stuff I did see a picture of the controller my initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd but hey if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box and give it a try I may end up liking it
7704370	7707811	Andrew G says... That's actually 23rd Magus.
7707971	7708431	Remember him?
7708971	7709792	Where's he been lately?
7711412	7711792	Working.
7712652	7715373	Well, he needs to work his way on over here to a Sunday night show.
7715413	7718454	But anyway, The Gabe Cube... I like that name for it.
7718474	7721815	The Gabe Cube looks promising for those who would rather not self-build.
7722115	7724796	But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles.
7725176	7725936	Time will tell.
7726856	7728137	Some of the answer here from PekerJr92 says...
7729837	7730797	Thank you for watching!
7751303	7770745	Codeman says honestly it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do and yes it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC but I'm not sold yet I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party and Eddie K says if Half-Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console I'm not buying one
7772623	7775706	and let's see, going to Google Plus.
7776566	7778648	We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week.
7778688	7779588	We usually don't have this many.
7780049	7783632	Let me start with Travis H. who says, Speechless with excitement.
7784755	7794301	Flaco Jones says, I think SteamOS is cool, but as for the Steam machine itself, there was nothing to convince me I should buy that instead of just running SteamOS on my PC as a partition or however it would work.
7794642	7796423	The controller looks like it would not work for me.
7796683	7799325	Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play.
7800365	7806730	Actdeft says, anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page and the family sharing option, well, need to use logic more.
7807210	7808551	All right, hold on, Actdeft.
7808731	7812954	That is so easy to say in retrospect, but why didn't you call the 123 last week then, huh?
7814935	7818618	I could see at least the Steam Box and maybe the Steam OS.
7818718	7827906	Yeah, I kind of thought that the Steam Box announcement would have been kind of combined with... Actually, like they said before, it pretty much could have been all one announcement.
7827946	7830888	You didn't really need to separate... Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said, yeah.
7831049	7832069	It could have just been all one.
7832109	7832490	But anyway...
7833231	7836234	My opinion about the whole thing is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this.
7836494	7840539	They're making the Steam machine pretty much an entertainment console, like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.
7841180	7847308	And since they're developing their own OS for it, and yeah, I know it's Linux-based, but still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff and cost-effective too.
7847728	7851733	Not to mention being able to stream all your library in case your game doesn't support Linux.
7853315	7863603	Uh, going over to Evil, E3VL, says, from what I see, the SteamOS is basically countering Windows, as in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system like Apple's App Store.
7864064	7867227	SteamOS is essentially an open system like Google Android.
7867687	7868588	Very interesting comparison.
7869328	7874970	Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now, no one needs PC laptops in the future aside for gaming.
7875411	7878912	SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs in the future.
7879492	7881913	The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability.
7881973	7887375	Current PC gamers may adopt it, but Steam is lending out the OS for third-party vendors to create Steam Machines.
7887415	7894038	It might be a problem, and quite possibly a huge gamble depending on how their hardware is marketed and priced relative to consoles.
7894959	7906230	The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS to third-party developers, you get those companies like Alienware and stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there.
7906270	7906650	You get the
7910454	7912876	Junk programs with a brand new PC they buy.
7912916	7916360	I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials and stuff like that.
7916400	7920765	You used to have all that, but with Dell, you get that a lot.
7920805	7924729	Even with my Asus computers, there's a lot of Asus programs in there.
7925450	7931156	I'm just worried to get all that bogged down in the SteamOS, and it's going to just be like a Windows PC again.
7931976	7938682	And lastly, Redertainment says, The Steam OS seems to be tailored for people who have or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming.
7939062	7941384	Problem is, most people don't use their PC like that.
7941464	7946007	Most people have PCs they use for work, music, movies, games, and general dicking around on the internet.
7946348	7947028	Also, porn.
7947428	7950371	If people want a device that is only for video games, they buy a console.
7950771	7951612	I didn't really look at this.
7951832	7952552	No, not really.
7952573	7956416	Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs.
7956676	7957757	But hold on.
7957877	7959718	This guy leaves a lot of tongue-in-cheek answers, though.
7959738	7959918	Hold on.
7960178	7960499	Porn.
7961059	7964742	Think of the advanced haptic feedback that they have with that.
7966043	7967524	Advanced haptic feedback.
7968865	7971727	And lastly, Redertainment says the rest of his answer here.
7971827	7978832	I didn't really look at the Steam machine or the Steam controller as I do not plan to make any major purchases until I accomplish Project Buy a House.
7979613	7992132	and in fact it has a little touch screen on there you could probably stream porn to that while you play like Team Fortress 2 or something you can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2 first thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday porn
7994449	7995630	All right, moving on.
7996050	8000393	Let's get back into some longer news here, and we'll get to the Skype line here hopefully before too long.
8000413	8004496	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8004937	8005938	But first, Loki.
8006698	8011562	All right, so there was an announcement this week that first leaked out, and then they kind of made their own announcement.
8012502	8028469	Something coming to Xbox One is Xbox Fitness and it's going to be an app that uses Kinect and what's kind of cool about it though is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there including Insanity and I want to say P90X is one of the other ones that's in there.
8029569	8030650	All sorts of different trainers.
8031230	8044457	It is kind of interesting, though, because I guess the app will be free for Gold members through December 2014, although it says there's some additional content that you can purchase for it.
8044517	8053582	I guess in 2015, Unlimited Access will also require a separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee, as well as Xbox Gold.
8055043	8056324	Health Junkie
8076348	8085114	Yes, it's probably a little better than was it that Xbox, the Nike one that they had last year that was kind of lame.
8085454	8089517	This looks a little bit along the lines of kind of what they were trying to do with that.
8089897	8094180	Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate and all those features that they were touting before.
8094720	8097202	But it might be cool.
8097382	8103446	Some of the trainers to be noted, Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton, and Sean T. So...
8105063	8105784	Kind of cool, I guess.
8106764	8111388	Not really my thing because, you know, I eat hamburgers.
8113730	8113970	Yes.
8114590	8115451	No, no, no, not today.
8115491	8116171	You had chicken nuggets.
8116652	8117092	That's true.
8118953	8120975	Here's the thing, though, about Xbox Fitness.
8121195	8124177	Don't we already have a million fucking fitness games on the Xbox?
8125098	8130983	I mean, I know this is for the new one, but doesn't the Kinect need to get out of this rut of dance and fitness games?
8131143	8132444	Like, show me something new.
8133264	8134145	Technically, yeah.
8134225	8135826	I mean, there's about one or two every year.
8135846	8136667	I mean, there's Zumba.
8136707	8137968	There's a new Zumba game this year.
8138008	8146855	But there's only really about one, maybe two fitness games a year for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
8147675	8149477	Actually, I think it's been about one a year.
8150497	8151979	So it's not a ton.
8152419	8153480	But yeah, I mean...
8154960	8158061	Those are really the only games that kind of effectively use the Kinect.
8158201	8160442	Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect has been kind of crap.
8160462	8162323	So I don't know.
8162903	8170405	But yeah, they're saying different workouts, I guess from 10 minutes to an hour.
8171425	8173966	They're going to have little routines that you can do and stuff.
8174106	8178407	I'm assuming this is tracked across all the different ones you have.
8178988	8181328	Metamorphosis, they've got that in there as well.
8181548	8183369	Ripped in 30 from Jillian Michaels.
8184049	8187594	So, I don't know if you've got a fitness program that you're really into.
8187614	8197427	But see, once again, though, like Insanity, unless you're like one of those people that just borrowed that set or something, like if you already have it, you've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks for it.
8198588	8200811	You're probably not going to need this.
8201672	8201953	I don't know.
8202333	8205495	S2C100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com has a good point.
8205595	8207015	The fitness things sell really well.
8207156	8208836	They won't stray too far from your cash cow.
8209317	8217461	And if you think about it though, I mean, if you are getting an Xbox One anyways, this is pretty much free since you're probably paying for gold to play it, you know, online multiplayer, so...
8218482	8218962	Why not?
8219022	8219843	Check it out.
8220703	8223346	It might be cool.
8223406	8225307	Moving on to other features on the Xbox One.
8225367	8231653	The Game DVR will work on Xbox Live at launch, but YouTube and Facebook sharing won't be enabled until 2014.
8233214	8234955	So here's what Game DVR does.
8235335	8239916	Game DVR will save the previous five minutes of gameplay if you use a voice command.
8240136	8241116	Xbox record.
8241577	8247338	And then you can edit the piece in the upload studio and then share it, which would be the YouTube Facebook thing later.
8247699	8251380	These clips are saved in 720p at 30 frames a second.
8252000	8255481	Game DVR will only work if you have Xbox Live Gold.
8255921	8257001	So there you have it.
8257021	8257782	That's how it's going to work.
8257942	8258642	That sounds dumb.
8259062	8269092	I mean, like, because it's saying that you have to do Xbox record and then it records something, whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where... Well, no, because it says previous five minutes of gameplay if you say Xbox record.
8269132	8274117	So my thought is if something funny happens and you say that, you can go back and edit it in the studio.
8274517	8275378	That's my thought.
8275438	8279903	So, like, if something really funny happens, you have a chance to react and say Xbox record, and that way it'll save it.
8280523	8280744	So...
8281226	8281486	DarkSakura
8308948	8310350	Sorry, I'm critiquing that image.
8311372	8317120	Okay, first of all, they have it like it's levitating, but it's at the wrong angle for the level of shadow that they have.
8317140	8318061	What are you talking about?
8318101	8320985	The Xbox One picture that was on the article you were just reading.
8321165	8323168	Whoever does their press materials needs to like...
8324178	8325379	Go back and relearn Photoshop or something.
8325399	8325959	And you know what?
8326099	8329081	Levitating consoles are so like PlayStation 3.
8329601	8332742	I mean, it was the evil baby that made the console levitate.
8333103	8336264	Or the levitating console that made the evil baby.
8336284	8336524	I don't know.
8336544	8342828	So EA Sports has put out a statement saying that they are no longer making college games.
8344228	8348971	Basically, their general manager, Cam Weber, and... I'm sorry, of American...
8351380	8365777	Who basically the one in charge of all the American football games Basically is saying that the college sports games are going away That's meaning the NCAA games They're also, which they themselves put out an announcement That they're letting their license expire in 2014
8368019	8390988	and EA is not pursuing it so they are not going to be doing any more college football as in American football and not the real football that you actually play with your feet and they are not doing any other college games that basically they're letting it go bye and the rest of us are like whoopty shit
8391738	8408364	You know, I'm surprised though, because that does kind of suck, because it was a pretty big revenue stream for them, even though there was a lot of... You have to remember, for me, I'm always like, okay, but college football is a way bigger deal in other places than it is here.
8408524	8414086	Exactly, and in July, it really is pretty much the biggest game, only big game coming out.
8414126	8417708	Now it's going to be this big debt area, which hopefully will be filled by something else, but you know...
8418288	8419168	I'm from Alabama.
8419969	8425151	And the biggest thing in the universe there is the rivalry between the University of Alabama and Auburn University.
8426091	8430213	And I know people who will probably be, well, I want my game this year!
8431393	8438876	You know, and, um... There's all there is to do in Alabama is college football and eat crawdads.
8440817	8441277	Just saying.
8443298	8445499	So maybe they couldn't, I don't know... Go to church.
8447020	8456337	It's kind of disappointing, but at first I thought they were just going to put out a college football game and be like EA Sports College Football, drop the NCAA thing and just do whatever.
8456537	8459883	You would think that they would do something like that where they just make a game anyway, but...
8460549	8460829	Yeah.
8460849	8461009	Yeah.
8481581	8482622	I'll settle for $40 million.
8483142	8494451	That's probably why they're not doing a college game because they got into trouble and there was a whole lawsuit against them for using the likenesses of these different players without actually giving them any sort of compensation for it.
8495753	8504279	So now, of course, $40 million, how exactly it's going to be split up, who knows, but probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game.
8504299	8504520	Yeah.
8505799	8510323	I mean, it sucks for the fans, you know, even though I say like, well, that isn't really a big deal around these parts.
8510363	8514786	I understand there are some and I don't even really play these football games to begin with if it's not like tech mobile.
8515267	8518569	But I understand where people would be upset about this.
8518749	8522372	And it sucks for, you know, that group that looks forward to these games every year.
8523593	8525274	I wasn't happy when DDR died.
8526475	8548680	well all they would have to do is just give up some of their profits I would think couldn't they have just licensed the actual player likenesses and you know pay the extra money or you know that would be too uh honest and so they can't do that how much would they have to have paid for all of those individual players versus what they paid out in uh fees for the settlement
8548860	8552384	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says they could do something like what 2K did to get football back.
8562202	8563242	I'm sure they'll have something.
8563342	8568404	After all, remember, they tried to do NFL Blitz so they could have another type of football game.
8568644	8575346	Hell, they even experimented a little with rugby a while back, but arena football even.
8575486	8576067	So I don't know.
8576087	8577227	They could do some more stuff.
8577247	8579388	How about a puppy bowl game?
8580368	8580648	Huh?
8581168	8585050	There was already Jerry Rice and Nidus dog football.
8585070	8585710	Oh, that's right.
8585850	8586250	On the Wii.
8586610	8587350	I forgot about that.
8587390	8588591	Well, because it was on the Wii.
8590009	8594553	It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin with all the other late Wii games.
8594733	8595554	I can see Puppy Bowl.
8596494	8600878	Nintendo, get on that.
8601138	8603980	Now that they have this team freed up, they can make a Wii U game.
8608638	8609680	Yeah, alright.
8610360	8610801	Moving on.
8611602	8615747	Here's a game that I'm actually legit really excited to play this game.
8616448	8618150	South Park, The Stick of Truth.
8618250	8619131	Oh, it looks awesome.
8620575	8620895	December 10th
8638908	8640229	DarkSakura, do you have any interest in this?
8660883	8661384	When Evil Rises
8696727	8698187	There is only one of them.
8698207	8698668	New kid?
8698728	8699108	New kid.
8699328	8701328	The new kid has a power we have yet to understand.
8702449	8703929	Who can save us?
8705650	8715272	Step forward now and fulfill your d-d-d- And fulfill your d-d-d-d- The audio on this is low, sorry guys.
8715532	8717813	You have some incredible ability to make friends quickly, new kid.
8718093	8720454	I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my greatest warriors.
8725416	8726698	Oh yay, Mr. Slave's in it.
8727178	8733446	Mr. Slave has a finishing move where he jumps on one of the enemies and it sucks them into his ass.
8735648	8738191	It's a trap!
8738211	8741635	You're playing for the wrong side, dude.
8741675	8743097	Defenders of freedom!
8743538	8745600	Tonight, we're united!
8754344	8758889	Yeah, it's a pain, but this is the kind of stuff you put up with living in a remote little mountain town.
8759109	8760531	At least we don't have to deal with traffic.
8764171	8765912	Here's why I'm looking forward to the Stick of Truth.
8765992	8768893	Because there really should have been another South Park movie.
8769594	8773656	I don't think I have ever laughed harder in the theater in my life.
8773676	8775797	Wasn't there the Imaginary Funland or whatever?
8775897	8778299	That was like a three episode arc of the show.
8778339	8778899	Oh, whatever.
8779059	8780920	And it wasn't nearly as good as the movie.
8781220	8785002	So I kind of feel like this is the next closest thing we're getting to a new movie.
8785022	8786023	And that was all in-game.
8786303	8786543	Yeah.
8786784	8791931	You know, and it looks just like the actual, um, the actual show, so.
8792311	8793012	That'd be pretty sweet.
8793213	8793413	Yeah.
8794334	8794515	So.
8795115	8800443	Alright, well, uh, we would be usually moving on to the mailbag at this point, except, uh,
8800819	8802180	We got Jack and shit.
8802360	8802640	That's right.
8802660	8803561	And Jack left town.
8804601	8811605	So let us use this music as a little opportunity to remind y'all that it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
8811925	8812886	As long as you use it.
8813046	8813326	Yes.
8813746	8817108	But if we can't hear you, then you don't get one.
8817408	8821931	I promise I will at least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on.
8822271	8822591	Okay?
8823211	8823412	One.
8823652	8824492	Mailbag.
8824812	8825333	All one word.
8825353	8828814	That's M-A-I-L-B-A-G
8830542	8832463	at OrangeDonesRadio.com.
8833444	8833864	All one word.
8834745	8835165	Word.
8835685	8838747	Well, the dot separates the Orange Dones Radio and the com.
8841589	8841969	Shut up.
8842590	8842890	All right.
8843350	8844391	Bitch, you didn't even.
8846072	8846592	Love you mean it.
8847432	8847773	Hearts.
8848593	8848993	All right.
8849454	8850714	So that's it then.
8850915	8852435	No emails this week for us to read.
8852495	8858059	So, well, I guess this next segment will just have to be doubled to make up for the time.
8873482	8874603	FUs of the week time.
8875383	8876203	Okay, I have a couple.
8877023	8887668	FU to the asshole wasp, which all wasps are assholes, but this one was extra asshole by inviting himself into my car and poking his butt in my finger.
8888728	8894450	That was really rude, and I'm really allergic, and thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to Bimmy Girl.
8895011	8897031	So, fuck you, wasp.
8897171	8898332	Fuck all wasps.
8898752	8901694	The only good thing they do is eat plant-destroying caterpillars.
8901814	8902194	That's it.
8902635	8904356	And there's other bugs that will do that too, and birds.
8905036	8906937	So fuck them.
8908719	8917364	They're also an F you to having certain illusions of mind shattered because I like to think better of my relatives.
8918665	8922988	And then every so often they'll just say something that's completely dickish and rude and...
8924397	8925117	and I'll see you next time.
8952092	8961199	and also F you to the bitch that wouldn't let me over even though I signaled for like ages and then every time I'd speed up, she'd speed up.
8961840	8966604	The three people weaving in and out of traffic and the cop that didn't pull any of them over.
8966684	8967384	Fuck all of them.
8968065	8968605	Fuck them all.
8969226	8974350	And even though it's not a fuck you, because I'm PMS-y today, so I'm just completely taking over this whole segment.
8975331	8979834	I would like to say I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck eggs was not at...
8981553	8982114	What are you doing?
8983375	8984096	Just keep going.
8984296	8991663	Okay, well there's a guy who sells duck eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted to buy duck eggs and he wasn't there and I was disappointed.
8992304	8993445	But Rachel bought a rabbit.
8994266	8994827	A dead rabbit.
8995067	8995848	A wascally wabbit?
8996068	8997049	A frozen dead rabbit.
8997349	8997910	Poor rabbit.
8998130	8999191	Mmm, rabbit's delicious.
8999631	9001754	So it was rabbit season and not duck season?
9004617	9004837	Yes.
9007116	9008057	It was rabbit season.
9008117	9008537	Okay, sorry.
9008577	9009597	This is what I was trying to cue up.
9009637	9012299	Since you're having an extra angsty week, DarkSakura.
9013760	9020864	It's the PMS march.
9023285	9026847	Well, I am legit PMSing, so F you to cramps.
9027348	9027848	TMI.
9028388	9028688	You know what?
9028768	9029369	I don't care.
9030089	9036273	Okay, guys in the universe, women get cramps, we get bitchy,
9037847	9038908	My brain has a cramp now.
9038928	9039569	My job has been done.
9055618	9056219	All right, Loki.
9057780	9065485	F you to YouTube's content ID service, which is so fantastic that they... Hey, did you know that you're using licensed music in your stuff?
9066066	9070709	Accept this copyright claim or deny it or contest it.
9071130	9072191	I will choose option three.
9072371	9073972	Do nothing is what I will do.
9074369	9082575	But it's great though because on one of the videos I did get that on, or that flag on, was one of the ones I used an audio swap thanks to YouTube.
9082595	9086078	You know, YouTube allows you to audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve.
9087419	9094404	Yeah, I know it's licensed music because you told me to use that music instead of the licensed music that I had in that before.
9094824	9099006	Our pal Travis from Under Station Live unfortunately deals with this a lot.
9099547	9107491	If he even uses a little bit of a song in his hour and a half long Under Station Live that goes up on YouTube, they flag it.
9107631	9109272	That's why he had to change the intro of the show.
9109692	9111113	And I'm like, come on.
9112233	9112954	It's ridiculous.
9113294	9113834	It's ridiculous.
9114074	9114995	And they scan that.
9115035	9115815	So what do they do?
9115855	9120537	They scan all these videos and they just send it to these music people so that they can just complain about it.
9120557	9129341	What they should do is just have a service that if these lawyers or whoever find these videos and infringe upon it, then yes, they can do a copyright thing.
9129582	9136645	The thing is, I don't believe the copyright content ID thing is actually a copyright claim by them.
9137525	9140388	But it does sometimes block it from mobile apps and stuff.
9140408	9143690	Like I tried watching my video on a mobile app and you can't see it.
9144231	9151636	There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that because YouTube pulled one of his videos where he was using a copyrighted thing but it was under fair use.
9151956	9153598	And he's like, I'm a copyright lawyer.
9153738	9154979	This was fair for me to do.
9155259	9156520	So he's suing YouTube.
9156540	9156920	Well, good.
9157020	9157401	Hopefully...
9158021	9158161	Get it!
9158181	9158482	That's it.
9158502	9159223	That's all I've got.
9175416	9176716	So, I don't know.
9177977	9185458	Also, a premature F you for trying to figure out how to make this case for my controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard.
9185878	9192540	And I'm thinking I may need to do vacuum forming plastic, which is going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig to cook it.
9192700	9196800	Basically, I have to build an oven and then some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff.
9198281	9199061	Alright, that's all I got.
9201464	9209869	My FU of the week just goes to the fact that there's a show in two weeks and even though it'll be great, I'm just like, stress!
9211030	9213551	But, you know, that'll pass like things usually do.
9215072	9220876	Alright, let's go back to a few more news stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line.
9221676	9223999	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9236793	9239094	Um, but they're saying that, hey, you know what?
9239194	9247599	We can actually use this to stream these games to other consoles or other devices like PCs, TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones, tablets.
9248019	9255003	So, um, you know, their ultimate goal is to be able to stream those stuff, you know, those things to other devices.
9255743	9261927	It'd be kind of funny if you could play a PlayStation 4 game with an Xbox One, you know, if they had some sort of website or something you can go to the stream this stuff.
9264246	9291965	that would just be ridiculous although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through the Xbox One's HDMI in and create some sort of black hole of death with that I don't know it'll be neat but once again we'll have to see how the SkyKai service works once it does launch next year for at least North America we can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy indeed indeed
9292392	9295236	All right, one more story for you guys and we'll open up the Skype line.
9295276	9299082	And this is about, actually, I think Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show, but that's all right.
9299943	9301686	I'll recap it for y'all anyway.
9302327	9305251	This is, of course, out of Orlando, Florida.
9305772	9306974	Only in Florida, people.
9307394	9308156	Only in Florida.
9308736	9315059	A nine-year-old boy made a court appearance on school weapon charges and was sentenced to home confinement.
9315919	9320341	Officials said that the boy brought multiple weapons to the school at Hunter's Creek Wednesday.
9321041	9324843	And of course, this is going to tie into video games eventually, folks.
9324903	9325563	Bear with me here.
9326003	9330565	Officers searched the bag and found a handgun, six bullets, a steak knife, and a sledgehammer.
9331406	9339197	The guns all came from the father's home and the boy is ordered to home confinement and said the parents need to keep any and all weapons away from him.
9339999	9345346	The boy's father said he was playing a character he learned from a video game.
9347089	9347729	of course he was
9372378	9373840	Not Grand Theft Auto, people!
9374560	9375301	Minecraft.
9375501	9378404	Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game, right?
9378504	9385030	And there really is no story to Minecraft aside from there's a guy named Steve and there's zombies.
9385271	9388894	I mean, so... Yeah, I don't know.
9389395	9389475	Um...
9392293	9392713	It's dumb.
9393054	9394454	And there's no guns even in that.
9395434	9402517	And I like how the boy's father is pretending to be in the game.
9402757	9409079	Not, oh, why do I have all these guns available so my nine-year-old can pick up a gun and bring it to school.
9409659	9412580	Yeah, PacDeft in the chatroom says, Irresponsible parents.
9412660	9412840	What?
9412881	9413581	We're not to blame.
9413621	9415822	It's the video game that teaches them all the bad stuff.
9416522	9417002	Yeah.
9418291	9442937	no it's and even so even if you know they've allowed their child exposure to the game they've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons I want to know why CPS isn't involved okay let's see SSJ100 Matt says please please someone hijack a horse and blame it on Barbie's horse adventure I'll do it or imagine horses
9444915	9445335	Amazing.
9445515	9447216	I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club.
9447576	9447836	Okay.
9448476	9450797	And I'll name it Politary and beat her.
9451417	9452657	No, I wouldn't do that to a real horse.
9452677	9453397	It's so stupid, though.
9453437	9461859	It's like, why we even allow these excuses to, you know, that's about as valid an excuse as, like, the voices in my head told me to do it.
9461920	9462520	I mean, come on.
9462580	9464580	If someone said that, you're going to be like, okay, that's ridiculous.
9464940	9467501	But if, like, you know, oh, the video game told them to do it.
9467801	9469141	Oh, well, that makes sense.
9470342	9471842	Seriously, what is wrong with people?
9472102	9472982	He was a witch!
9474043	9474763	Okay, must be.
9477084	9477425	Alright.
9478565	9480646	That is it for our stories tonight.
9480686	9482707	Let's go to the Skype line and open it up.
9482727	9487350	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.
9487830	9492272	And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight or maybe there's something we missed that you would like to bring up.
9493126	9495407	Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain.
9496668	9505913	That is, I think, the most recent Milli Vanilli reference I have seen in the last... I know the first reference to them I've seen in maybe the last five years.
9506353	9508834	Ever since that guy passed away, probably.
9509575	9510335	So, there you go.
9510675	9511756	And not even from this country.
9512496	9513797	We do have a couple tweets.
9514517	9519280	Not a whole lot of them, but we do have a few from... I thought we had had some earlier in the week.
9519340	9521041	I can't remember.
9522001	9526203	Sorry if I missed yours because it was too early in the week, but we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight.
9526924	9531086	One of them is that China will be ending a decade-long ban on game consoles.
9531206	9536793	I had no idea that they had this ban in place because I thought there were knockoff consoles and stuff that they sold in Japan.
9536813	9540177	Wasn't the V something they sold in China?
9540197	9544022	Yeah, but it was some sort of weird TV console thing.
9544082	9547226	I don't know what the restrictions were exactly.
9547475	9552300	Well, that and Hong Kong was not under Chinese authority for the longest time.
9552620	9554442	And why was the ban in place in China?
9554963	9555663	Communism!
9556004	9560208	Well, there was concern for the effects that games might have on young people.
9560789	9563351	But the group was persuaded because...
9564292	9567953	Gaming on computers and internet cafes is taken off across China or whatever.
9568953	9574475	There will soon be consoles sold as part of new rules in a free trade zone in Shanghai.
9574935	9577756	Don't know when the consoles will go on sale, but there you go.
9579696	9587399	I don't know if that means Xbox and PlayStation 3 necessarily, but probably some local gaming devices there.
9588759	9590479	They're talking about something based on the Xbox.
9593621	9595083	but not called the best pad.
9596024	9604653	That again from a tweet that Tiger Claw sent us and one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9605674	9611700	One other article here from Tiger Claw says Nintendo teaming up with Tesco for a Wii U fight back.
9614482	9631453	ah so let's see Nintendo said in an interview with MCV that too many people are unaware that the Wii U is a new console and they're going to do a giant campaign to educate people including Wii owners about this console they've booked in-store space at Tesco which is in the UK sending out a
9632493	9640656	5 page leaflet to 300,000 Tesco customers that have bought a Wii but haven't bought another console and give vouchers away that will allow money off of games.
9640996	9647758	There will also be TV ads for Mario, Donkey Kong and Zelda which will run continuously from half term until Christmas.
9648644	9649625	I think they know.
9649765	9650706	I just think they don't care.
9651766	9655729	Yeah, I don't think they really see that must-have game, but then there's Mario.
9655949	9658511	I'm still irritated at Tesco's for selling fresh and easy.
9659251	9660592	Yeah, isn't that crazy?
9660732	9663434	I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed.
9664255	9664655	So mad.
9664955	9666035	Aren't they all closed now though?
9666475	9669216	I think certain ones.
9669376	9670436	The one here is gone.
9670596	9671997	That's it for Twitter topics.
9672097	9674377	Again, I'll put one more call out there for calls.
9674397	9679319	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9680039	9681459	Loki, do we have any last minute stories?
9681879	9689101	There's just a quick mod that someone's working on right now for Team Fortress 2 that you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer.
9690322	9691162	That sounds kind of fun.
9691282	9694143	Yeah, it's called Star Fortress and it's in pre-alpha.
9694763	9699504	And if you want to check it out, it's... Let's see here.
9699524	9709067	I think Gray Man Gaming is the Steam community group that they have with man, of course, two Ns, like Team Fortress game.
9711431	9711932	That's it.
9712853	9713874	That's it, huh?
9713894	9714815	Slow news week.
9717618	9718820	No calls coming in either.
9719501	9720021	I don't know.
9721002	9721883	What do we do, guys?
9722945	9724186	Let's have a poker party.
9724246	9726028	I guess we win the show.
9727330	9727670	Yay!
9728051	9728972	You know what, Pinkberry?
9730697	9732158	I gotta go get Alan after work.
9733778	9736319	Someone call!
9736899	9739100	One more holler out there.

9751685	9752785	So don't forget to send us emails.
9752825	9755106	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or Twitter.
9755226	9755966	Tweets help as well.
9755986	9757267	Looks like someone's going to be trying shortly.
9762691	9768096	I can't think of anything else video game related except blah.
9768357	9768777	Hey, look.
9769698	9770138	Oh, there it is.
9770198	9770719	It's lighting up.
9770759	9772841	Let's go to the phones.
9772941	9773902	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9773922	9774262	Who's this?
9775723	9776364	It is Ranma.
9776384	9777805	The one that has come to save the day.
9778026	9778826	Apparently.
9778886	9779627	What's up with that?
9779687	9780588	Well, what's on your mind, Ranma?
9781804	9784046	Oh, you don't want to know.
9784907	9788631	But there is a question I've been meaning to call about.
9788751	9790132	Let me get your opinions on this.
9790212	9797419	Now, we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes and reboots and stuff like that, but this is something they haven't done.
9798900	9806568	Why is it they haven't taken Wario and Waluigi and put them in a game and call it Super Wario Bros. ?
9808843	9812525	I'm also surprised that hasn't happened, but wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?
9812865	9816347	Well, they had that Wario Land Shake It, which was a hand-drawn game.
9816387	9819588	It looked fantastic, and it was pretty fun, but no one bought it.
9819869	9820549	That was on the Wii.
9820569	9822990	Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends, almost.
9825451	9826592	Who wants to play the bad guy?
9827232	9828333	Exactly, you know?
9829435	9831336	I like the sound of that.
9858246	9859207	Nintendo, call me.
9859427	9859907	We'll talk.
9861529	9862990	Your people can call me and pay me.
9866032	9869134	What other dream Nintendo games do you have, Ranma?
9869735	9871556	That was the only one because I don't know.
9871716	9876560	It just popped in my head like, you know, they have like Wario series of games.
9876640	9883345	I guess at the time I was thinking about one of my favorite Game Boy games, which was Super Mario Land 3.
9883665	9886748	And I'm like, you know, why haven't he done that?
9889249	9889589	You know what?
9889669	9894810	I think you just need your own Mario is Missing game, except in the sequel, Luigi's like, I know.
9897771	9898611	Exactly.
9899351	9909753	And also, I really think they should put the Wii U out without the gamepad, because honestly, maybe three out of the four games that are out on the Wii U doesn't even use the gamepad.
9911253	9912693	Some of them use it really well, though.
9912753	9916774	Zombie U is a great example of a game that's really enhanced with that gamepad, so...
9919525	9930678	I like the gamepad, but I just... Honest to God, for me, the gamepad and all that thing, that's less of a concern than I still feel there's a lot of clunky shit on Nintendo's online.
9931138	9936224	And although I like Miiverse, I don't think it's particularly convenient.
9936585	9940049	It's kind of slow, and the internet on Nintendo's system can still be clunky.
9940709	9946192	I just still feel like where Nintendo is going online isn't really where they need to be.
9947113	9955378	I still remain really irritated that Virtual Console isn't what we ought to see on a modern gaming console.
9955398	9955858	You know what I mean?
9957799	9958660	Exactly.
9959260	9959820	But those are just...
9961261	9961802	What do I know?
9961882	9977775	I still have a Wii U, and there are the games I do have on it I enjoy, and I know I will like the new Mario game, and I know I'll love the new Mario Kart, and whatever they continue to do in 2014 that will justify owning the system, but it is a little frustrating to see all the third parties abandoning ship.
9977895	9980678	I think a lot of them are being dicks.
9982780	10010809	you're right, because even though the Wii U isn't as powerful you can get somebody else to take a top tier title and shove it into that little hardware and somehow make it work they make shitty little computers for kids that will play games and I see ports of games from big companies that end up on these things LeapFrog is just a little device that's powered by Flash that's a Shockwave Flash console yep
10015362	10019247	Alrighty, well, Ranma, if that's it, I'm going to let you go and see if anybody else wants to call.
10020088	10020408	Awesome.
10020548	10021349	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
10021990	10022390	You too.
10022691	10023251	Alright, bye-bye now.
10023792	10024893	Alright.
10024953	10027756	We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else wants to call in.
10027777	10032322	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10035677	10037319	Probably.
10037339	10037559	Probably.
10037579	10038280	Probably.
10054860	10060184	I would think the wa part in Wario and Waluigi definitely would have to do with things being bad.
10060304	10064847	There's a lot of little puns that don't always necessarily transfer over.
10065047	10068229	But anyway, let's go to the phones because we got another call coming in.
10068269	10069190	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10069210	10069570	Who's this?
10070390	10073953	This is Obi-Wan Jabroni calling from the United Kingdom.
10074213	10075454	Oh my gosh.
10075494	10076114	Hello.
10076514	10077675	You are up late, sir.
10077835	10078696	I love your icon.
10079551	10080151	Thank you very much.
10081352	10085613	Also, I want to say numero uno on the leaderboard.
10086094	10087054	Look at you, yeah.
10087434	10091976	It's you and Tigerclaw fighting to the death on the VOG Network leaderboards.
10092036	10092956	Well, you know what, Sky?
10093116	10097838	I heard Tigerclaw likes being on top, and that's okay.
10098178	10102160	I think that was a little bit of shade throwing here live at Orange Lounge Radio.
10102580	10102720	Awesome.
10102800	10103001	Awesome.
10103021	10104162	Yeah, my Max has told me it's five hours.
10104182	10104402	Awesome.
10120057	10124800	Well, you know, there's been a lot of free-to-play games out there lately.
10124900	10128202	There's been more free-to-play games than I've fucked, you know?
10130423	10133585	So, yeah, I think this is a great thing, because I'm 35 years old.
10134386	10135006	Old gamer.
10135807	10137588	Not that old.
10137908	10138669	You're not that old.
10138949	10139329	I'm older.
10141190	10142052	You're a young lady.
10142753	10143514	Oh, I love you.
10144776	10145357	I love you too.
10149703	10154030	So as we get older, I think, you know, as older gamers, I think we become more cheap.
10154591	10155212	You know what I mean?
10156176	10159460	and the 2DS that they announced.
10159500	10167068	That's cool to me because it's going to be cheap and it kind of looks kind of shitty.
10168309	10174956	The price, I think, is going to appeal to a lot of older people for cheap people like myself.
10174996	10176538	I've got a 3DS at the minute.
10177513	10196914	um the original one so i mean that's you know but i mean i've got a lot of friends actually who would be into that the 2ds just because you know they don't want to spend the money on my regular 3ds so um but i went off on a tangent yeah but yeah the free to play is what i was gonna mention
10198510	10206136	Sorry, this is my first time calling you guys, and as they say, your first time is... That's alright, we'll go easy on you on your first time.
10206176	10207397	The first time's a little rough.
10207537	10214223	It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train, and we're just all sitting here listening to your accent, so by all means, talk away.
10214463	10218826	And for the record, I have several friends who've expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason.
10219607	10221509	Especially one of them that has problems with 3D.
10222489	10223130	So, just saying.
10223770	10224551	Yeah, exactly.
10224751	10231934	And if anyone's out there fapping to my accent and whatever, feel free to let me know on Twitter or the comments on VOG.
10235536	10236836	So free to play games.
10237176	10238397	Do you play any of them?
10239366	10245309	Oh yeah, I've been pimping the shit out of Tekken Revolution.
10245749	10249131	That's right, that was your comment that got me to play that game.
10249651	10262397	Yeah, I've been pimping the crap out of it, and yeah, I love it, and I don't know if you've played the latest one, of course, like, is it Dead or Alive 5, Ultimate, Call of Fighters or some shit?
10262537	10267399	I saw that, but I haven't played it, but I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one they're talking about.
10267999	10270361	Yeah, yeah, because I'm a huge fighting game fan.
10270401	10272183	But the Dead or Alive one's kind of cool.
10272263	10274304	It's free gigs, I will say that.
10275525	10278268	But it doesn't have the token system.
10278608	10281170	So you can play as much as you want.
10281350	10286755	It's one of those games where if you want the story part of it, you've got to pay for it.
10287275	10289457	So it's kind of like one of those games where you unlock.
10290118	10292379	Well, pay to unlock is what I meant, so...
10293624	10294925	Yeah, but it's cool.
10295065	10298466	I mean, you can play online, too, so that's kind of fun.
10300127	10302628	You don't have to pay to unlock booby mechanics, though, do you?
10303049	10304069	Because it is dead or alive.
10304829	10306690	I'm not sure.
10306770	10311492	You know, Tekken Revolution's kind of been, you know, taken over.
10313173	10317876	I think pay to unlock is better when you have the expectation that it's going to be pay to unlock.
10318136	10318396	Yeah.
10319096	10323037	instead of just, oh, well, we have this DLC.
10323097	10324238	No, you just gave us a code.
10324798	10325998	Yeah, at least it's not double-dipping.
10326218	10331300	Yeah, when you know that you've got to unlock it, pay a little bit more, then I think it lessens the blow.
10332440	10340143	Yeah, and I think the story portion of it, of that day of life, is kind of expensive, so you might as well just go out and buy the full game.
10340163	10340243	Yeah.
10340820	10358952	Also, I wanted to mention that Ridge Racer game, Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever, that's kind of, it's okay, but like, I think I said in one of the comments before, I said, when you crash on the game, it's like, it's not game over, but you can keep carrying on playing.
10360322	10375864	um it's it's okay but you know with that game every time i put it up now it says server error um and i know you guys love this word it's a beta or a beta wherever you live we say we say beer obviously i've heard beta
10376727	10378028	Yeah.
10378189	10379730	So yeah, Ridge Racer's okay.
10379750	10383214	It's not traditional Ridge Racer in my opinion, so I kind of hate it.
10383254	10384215	It does have trophies.
10384655	10389720	I keep forgetting there really are a ton of free-to-play options on PlayStation right now.
10390301	10393584	You mentioned one last week, Rob, called Pinball Free-to-Play.
10393604	10395065	That was called Pinball Stick.
10395105	10397067	I was shouting at my... That's it.
10398788	10400109	I mentioned it again earlier tonight.
10400169	10401549	Pinballistic or something like that.
10401569	10401849	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10401869	10402670	I mentioned it again tonight.
10402750	10406471	It's free.
10408612	10410392	Hey, yeah, free is good.
10410432	10415034	I mean, you've got to pay for handjobs or whatever these days.
10415074	10415594	But, I mean, free.
10416952	10417552	Free is good.
10418052	10418673	Love it.
10418933	10425875	I wish Tekken and stuff on the Dead or Alive game was on Xbox, but probably not going to happen.
10427135	10427995	But PS3 is okay.
10428115	10428895	I like the controller.
10429196	10433417	I'm the minority who likes the PS3 controller anyway.
10433437	10434637	No, I love the PS3 controller.
10434877	10437518	But need I remind everyone that Yaris was also free?
10439959	10444121	Brad from PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe is the best free to play on PC.
10444221	10445781	He's our DC fanboy.
10445821	10451344	He is, but as far as MMOs go, it's way better than that Free Realms bullshit.
10451384	10453145	Marvel Heroes is pretty good for Steam.
10453165	10455065	Marvel Heroes ain't bad, but it's not on PlayStation 3.
10455226	10457467	But it's Marvel, and there's Jessica Jones in it, and I'm happy.
10458867	10472740	I did try DC Universe, took forever to download, and my PC was on wireless, so it took just like 3 days, it was a terrible experience, it took up so much space too
10474886	10479248	I mean, you know, the PS3 is a great system, but there's annoyances with it.
10479448	10480369	It's really ridiculous.
10480409	10484031	I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy some of my files over to that.
10484051	10489833	I mean, I can copy save games, but I'm not getting any space by copying save games to my drive, so I'm just really irritated.
10489873	10496216	I can't, like, you know, send over some of these really large games to play off the drive, but whatever.
10496936	10499158	Anyway, Obi-Wan, Jabroni, it's so good to hear from you.
10499418	10504802	And again, that icon you have that DarkSakura loves, I just want to make sure our listeners hear this.
10504862	10509825	It says, keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis with a PlayStation 1 console.
10510426	10513127	Well, thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice.
10513227	10513488	Yes.
10514048	10521256	No problem, it's a PlayStation 1 console, it plugged into the port too, so if anyone gets that reference.
10521516	10523739	Also, can I say one quick thing before I go?
10524820	10527763	Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection, bye bye bye.
10528384	10532148	Because I'm a huge MGS fan, everyone knows that, follow me on Twitter.
10536332	10555385	basically playstation exclusive but holy shit value for money it's awesome and just one more one more thing if that's okay before i go queen elizabeth you can suck my mother fucking nuts because that's why everything's so fucking expensive that's why i'm paying 429 for an xbox one
10557446	10560769	We need to all just move to our own island and call it Fuck Everyone Else.
10563371	10565112	We are the island nation of awesome.
10565633	10566393	Fuck the rest of you.
10566593	10567094	That's our theme.
10567234	10572558	This is probably the only internet video gaming show where people will call in to tell off the Queen of England.
10572698	10573099	I love it.
10573499	10573819	Alright.
10574860	10575761	Have a good one, my friend.
10576461	10576841	You too.
10576962	10577582	Alright, bye.
10578263	10578503	Bye.
10580029	10580830	That was a great call.
10580890	10581370	Thank you so much.
10581410	10582871	I love hearing from the overseas people.
10582931	10583211	It's great.
10583531	10583911	All right, guys.
10584172	10586273	You are up way early or late, depending.
10586313	10586993	Yeah, one of the two.
10587053	10591136	I have a feeling he's up early because he missed me talking about the pinball game in the beginning of the show.
10591156	10592176	He's eight hours ahead of us.
10592297	10592497	Yes.
10593479	10595320	So anyway, I'm going to close up Skype.
10595360	10596401	I'm sorry to those didn't get through.
10596421	10599864	I know Actdeft was trying to ring in, but I think he was just trying to be nice because we weren't getting any calls.
10600164	10603827	But I am going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.
10604127	10612753	But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and so forth, I just want to say once again, thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
10613053	10614814	Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10615055	10616636	You know, we've been doing this a very long time.
10616796	10617877	We don't ask for your money.
10618357	10620078	Once in a while, a charity thing, we might ask for your money.
10620418	10621739	But I'll take it for free.
10622660	10625301	but we do ask you to help spread the word.
10625361	10626781	Tell a friend or five about the show.
10627101	10629702	Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio and I do see some of you guys doing that.
10629722	10630862	I do see your kind tweets.
10631242	10637604	I hear some of our other indie podcast folks saying nice words and I just want to let you know we so appreciate you guys.
10638084	10646447	Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support which really keeps the fire for us to do this show for 11 plus years going.
10647367	10647847	You know what?
10648227	10650928	I'm going to make my dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight.
10652309	10653469	I'm uninstalling WoW.
10654190	10654870	Oh my gosh.

10666716	10668636	It's already replaced WoW in my heart.
10668916	10673037	And besides that, I watched the fuckery that was the end of the Orgrimmar thing.
10673778	10674398	And fuck that.
10674438	10675058	I'm glad I quit.
10676418	10676698	All right.
