7000	14000	Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	Tonight, Valve's 3 announcements have come and gone. What did they reveal that didn't have 3 in its name?
18000	27000	Wii Lamento were LucasArts games lost at the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros. Roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9
27000	28000	Oops
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	34000	Oops
34000	41000	Hi there everybody, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
41000	49000	We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show
49000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc, etc, with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
58000	60000	You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy
60000	62000	Empress Sakura of Normandy
62000	63000	Yes
63000	65000	So just a 3 hour DarkSakura lovefest
65000	68000	Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy
68000	73000	Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are, but here you ain't shit
73000	75000	Hey, I'd like to make an announcement
75000	76000	Okay
76000	79000	Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom
79000	81000	Assholes
81000	82000	You got stung by one, didn't you?
82000	84000	Yes I did, in my car
84000	86000	Well, why did you invite the wasp in your car?
86000	90000	I didn't invite it in my car, the little asshole, he just barged on in, I'm gonna hang out in your car
90000	92000	Asshole
92000	96000	And I'm super allergic, not like EpiPen allergic, but pretty allergic
96000	101000	And so, thankfully I was at my friend's house and I was like, Benadryl
101000	107000	So you're here and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out
107000	111000	No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since
111000	113000	Alright
113000	114000	Fucking assholes
114000	116000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki
116000	117000	Hello
117000	118000	Hi, Loki, how are you?
118000	119000	I'm fine
119000	121000	Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?
121000	123000	No
123000	124000	Glad to hear it
125000	128000	We are live, of course, Wednesday, or excuse me, not Wednesday, Sunday
128000	131000	It is Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
131000	135000	We do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show
135000	139000	At the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
139000	142000	And of course, if you are listening live, you can join our chat room
142000	144000	Live.vognetwork.com
144000	146000	And you can participate along with our show
146000	149000	And whatever games we might be talking about tonight
149000	152000	Although, oddly, we were kind of looking things before the show
152000	155000	It was a slower of news weeks. I know we have some big announcements
155000	158000	Especially in the PC universe and so on
158000	160000	And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about
160000	162000	We'll get to those here before too long
162000	164000	But otherwise, it's kind of a relatively quiet week
164000	167000	Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 5 still?
167000	169000	What is it? A billion?
169000	172000	Eleventy billion dollars that game's made? Loki?
172000	174000	It's over a billion, so
174000	176000	I don't know what the exact numbers are right now
176000	177000	It's crazy
177000	178000	A lot
178000	181000	I got to tell you, I almost caved and bought it
181000	183000	That's not good enough
183000	185000	It was all the chatter about the online stuff
185000	187000	And joining the VOD crew
187000	189000	Why are you going to miss out? It's starting in a couple days
189000	191000	I know, I kind of want to do it
191000	193000	But then I'm like, Rob, it's $60
193000	196000	You're going to be pissed when it comes out for PlayStation 4
196000	198000	So
198000	201000	I resisted
201000	204000	And I continued playing the games that I already have that I need to finish
205000	208000	Well, according to the VG charts
208000	212000	The top global seller is obviously being Grand Theft Auto 5
212000	217000	It sold a total of about 17 million copies already
217000	218000	Wow
218000	220000	And that's as of the 21st
220000	221000	And that's worldwide, right?
221000	222000	Worldwide
222000	225000	Has there been a release besides America? Is it out in Europe or Japan yet?
225000	226000	Yeah, it's out everywhere
226000	228000	Here's the thing, though
228000	229000	That's the 21st
229000	231000	That's over a week ago
231000	234000	It's only been selling a ton since then
234000	235000	Gosh, alright
235000	238000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
238000	240000	Let's see
240000	242000	Where was it?
242000	245000	Oh, Dungeon Buster in chat says Grand Theft Billions
245000	248000	That's pretty much what it is right now
248000	249000	Grand Theft Billions
249000	252000	Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about
252000	255000	Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?
255000	258000	There was one kid that stole a car or something
258000	260000	And shot some people and they said
260000	262000	Oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto
262000	263000	Right, right
263000	264000	I mean, they'll try to tie it with him
264000	265000	No, that's because he's stupid
265000	267000	They'll blame it on anything
267000	269000	I mean, it's just like there was another one
269000	270000	Another one of those
270000	273000	Kid brings a gun to school or something like that
273000	275000	And they blamed it on Minecraft
275000	277000	So, seriously, it'll be anything
277000	281000	Wasn't there that horrible tragedy happened in DC
281000	283000	There was a gunman that did a shooting
283000	286000	And I want to say it was either this week or last week
286000	287000	And didn't they peg that on?
287000	289000	He played video games, sure enough
289000	291000	Oh, well that explains everything
291000	293000	He played Call of Duty, so therefore, you know
293000	294000	That's right
294000	297000	It's just dumb because they're willing to like, you know
297000	300000	Think that's okay to say that
300000	302000	Yet, at the same time, they could say
302000	305000	You could just easily draw the conclusion
305000	306000	Well, he ate food
306000	308000	Food made him kill people
308000	310000	I mean, because all of these murders
310000	311000	I tell you what
311000	313000	All of the murders that have ever happened
313000	314000	Tied the food
314000	315000	Because people eat
315000	316000	Food causes murder
316000	317000	You know what
317000	319000	If video games really, you know
319000	321000	Caused a particular action
321000	324000	Then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches
324000	326000	And wearing cat ears all the time
326000	328000	And throwing books at people
328000	329000	If video games caused
329000	332000	I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked
332000	336000	If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder
336000	338000	Well, we're in for the apocalypse
338000	341000	Because there's 17 million people out there now
341000	343000	That are murderers
343000	347000	So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead
347000	349000	If any food drives people to murder
349000	350000	It's probably mayonnaise
350000	351000	And that's why I avoid it
351000	352000	Mayonnaise is awesome
352000	353000	You shut your whore mouth
353000	356000	You murderous woman
356000	359000	Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise
359000	360000	Barf
360000	361000	Barf
361000	363000	Somebody call the cops
363000	365000	Because somebody's got to get killed over mayonnaise
365000	366000	Mayonnaise is really good for your hair
366000	367000	Yeah
367000	368000	Why would you
368000	369000	Something that's good for your hair
369000	370000	Why would you eat it
370000	371000	Do you eat shampoo?
371000	372000	No
372000	373000	Beer is good for your hair
373000	374000	I drink lots of beer
374000	375000	Okay, well I take a bath in beer
375000	377000	Would you take a bath in beer?
377000	379000	As long as I could, no
379000	382000	No, because then that would be alcohol abuse
382000	383000	And I just want to put my head in and drink it
383000	385000	I saw that on Family Guy today actually
385000	386000	Did you now?
386000	387000	Yes
387000	390000	You know what, actually last night while I was playing Final Fantasy
390000	393000	I was, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly
393000	395000	Which is like some of the best apple cider ever
395000	397000	And I was like, well I'm getting dizzy
397000	399000	And then I kept trying to go to bed
399000	401000	And then I kept doing more quests
401000	403000	And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed
403000	405000	I was having a very classy weekend
405000	407000	Friday night, Alan and I
407000	409000	We wanted to go to this new restaurant in town
409000	410000	But it was way too crowded
410000	412000	So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen
412000	413000	Which, you know, you know that place
413000	414000	We love that place
414000	415000	Pita Kitchen
415000	416000	And then we went by Safeway
416000	417000	It's like right by there, right?
417000	418000	So we went by Safeway
418000	420000	And we got a bottle of barefoot wine
420000	421000	And some Ben and Jerry's
421000	422000	And I brought it home
422000	425000	And I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long
425000	426000	With my bottle of wine and Ben and Jerry's
426000	429000	And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight
429000	430000	By the way
430000	432000	You know what's sitting in my fridge at home?
432000	434000	I have a bottle of apple wine
434000	436000	From the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill
436000	437000	Delicious
437000	439000	I need people to help me drink it
439000	441000	Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself
441000	442000	Help you drink liquor, I can do that
442000	443000	Alright, look
443000	445000	Moving from our classy weekends
445000	447000	To a little bit of a kickoff topic
447000	449000	And then we'll get into our gaming weeks
449000	451000	But Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity
451000	453000	To talk about this latest hacking project of yours
453000	455000	Because you've talked about it on the show
455000	457000	A little bit in passing
457000	458000	But it's one thing to kind of talk about it
459000	460000	But it's another to see it
460000	462000	So here in studio tonight you brought it
462000	464000	And I apologize to listeners because they can't see it
464000	466000	It's not anything yet
466000	468000	But it's just the monitor that I'm using
468000	470000	Yeah, you have like a flat screen monitor
470000	471000	But not like
471000	473000	Like it is literally just the screen part
473000	474000	There's no base
474000	475000	There's nothing
475000	477000	Well, there's no like
479000	480000	What brand is this?
480000	481000	This is an on lap
481000	482000	It's an on lap
484000	485000	I forget what they call it
485000	487000	But here I'll show you how nice it looks
487000	489000	It's pretty sexy looking actually
491000	493000	That's a pretty big big looking monitor
493000	494000	It's a 13 inch monitor
494000	497000	Normally if I didn't get such a great deal on it
497000	499000	I wouldn't probably be using that
499000	501000	So what exactly are you doing with this?
501000	503000	I'm basically building almost like a
503000	505000	Wii U tablet
505000	507000	But for
507000	509000	Like PlayStation 3 and
509000	510000	Xbox 360
510000	512000	You're not talking about like an emulator type of thing
512000	513000	Or anything like that are you?
513000	515000	No, it's basically gonna be a wireless HDMI
516000	518000	And it will sync up with
520000	521000	You know
521000	522000	Whatever
522000	523000	I hook up HDMI
523000	525000	Or whatever I hook up the transmitter
525000	526000	I'm still a little lost
526000	528000	Tell me like an application
528000	529000	How this would work with a game
529000	530000	Like as you say
530000	531000	Like okay
531000	533000	So basically I would hook up
533000	534000	I would use this
534000	536000	And whatever console I wanna play on
536000	538000	Say like an Xbox 360
538000	539000	You know
539000	541000	I'm gonna have controls
541000	542000	Like you know
542000	544000	Like you would see on the Wii U
544000	545000	Gamepad
545000	547000	Or like the 360 and stuff
547000	548000	And
549000	551000	So that's still something you're gonna attach to
551000	552000	Yeah it's something I'm gonna attach to
552000	554000	I'm gonna build a whole new case for it
554000	555000	Okay that's interesting
555000	556000	And then
557000	558000	What was I gonna say
559000	560000	So there's that
560000	561000	And then on top of that
561000	562000	There's gonna be
564000	565000	This like switch
565000	567000	I can switch between PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
567000	569000	And so it's gonna have a wireless transmitter
569000	571000	That's HDMI
571000	573000	That you plug into whatever console you wanna do
573000	575000	And then it wirelessly transmits to the receiver
575000	577000	Which is gonna be built into the unit
577000	579000	So you have wireless video and audio
580000	582000	Up to like 30 feet away
582000	584000	And then the controllers are obviously wireless
584000	586000	Although I'm still running into a slight problem
586000	588000	With the PlayStation 3 one
588000	589000	It's gonna be a little bit more challenging
589000	591000	Because when you plug that in
591000	592000	To charge it off
592000	594000	Or run it off USB power
594000	596000	It shuts off the wireless radio I believe
596000	599000	So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller
599000	601000	As it does like you're building like a portable
601000	603000	360 that works in your house somewhere
603000	605000	Well it's a second screen
605000	607000	Because it's basically just pulling
607000	608000	Whatever signal
608000	610000	I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to
610000	611000	I can hook it up to
611000	613000	Well I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore
613000	614000	Because that's sold
614000	616000	But if I had another OUYA
616000	617000	I could hook it up to that
617000	619000	So basically anything that has an HDMI out
619000	621000	That's compatible with a PlayStation 3
621000	623000	Or Xbox 360 controller
623000	624000	What's the why on this
624000	625000	Like I know for one
625000	627000	You just like to have these projects
627000	628000	And do it because you can
628000	630000	It's because my wife watches the TV a lot
630000	632000	And right now I'm sitting there
632000	634000	On my computer monitor
634000	636000	And playing games
636000	637000	Which is fine
637000	638000	But it would be more comfortable
638000	639000	If I could sit on the couch
639000	640000	And just kind of kick back
640000	642000	Yes so this is something like
642000	644000	You could play Grand Theft Auto 5
644000	646000	In private with that thing in your lap
646000	648000	And not have your kid be able to see you
648000	650000	Shooting hookers on the television
650000	651000	Yeah he'd be asleep
651000	652000	But yeah basically
652000	654000	Okay but it's still like a way
654000	656000	Or okay so the wife can watch
656000	657000	You know Scandal
657000	658000	And you can
659000	660000	Whatever it is she watches
660000	661000	Yeah
661000	662000	And you can do that
662000	663000	Okay
663000	664000	There you go
664000	665000	I was gonna show you real quick
665000	666000	Let's see
666000	667000	This is not a great example
667000	668000	But here's my computer monitor
668000	669000	Okay
669000	670000	I mean so the
670000	671000	You know it'll do
671000	673000	Okay so since this is radio
673000	675000	Basically Loki is holding up this
675000	676000	This flat
676000	678000	Like basically because it's a flat
678000	679000	Picture time
679000	680000	Yeah you can do a picture
680000	681000	I'll put it on my tumblers
681000	682000	I know not all
682000	683000	Yeah it doesn't weigh
683000	684000	Like hardly anything
684000	685000	It's just like maybe a pound
685000	686000	Yeah not all our listeners
686000	687000	Are gonna
687000	688000	Are gonna go look it up
688000	689000	So let me describe it
689000	690000	It's
690000	691000	It kind of like because it's just
691000	693000	That very flat part of a computer monitor
693000	694000	It's almost like a tablet
694000	695000	And function
695000	696000	And you're literally looking at
696000	698000	A Windows 7 screen
698000	699000	With Firefox open
699000	700000	On this like little tablet
700000	702000	So is that a touch screen too?
702000	703000	No
703000	704000	No
704000	705000	So it's literally just the monitor
705000	706000	Yeah
706000	707000	Because it's just
707000	709000	It's a USB powered monitor
709000	710000	That's important
710000	711000	Because the whole thing is gonna
711000	712000	Run off a battery
712000	713000	Because it's gonna be wireless
713000	714000	Otherwise I'd have to plug it in
714000	715000	So yeah
715000	716000	It's USB powered
716000	718000	Which is pretty awesome
718000	719000	And I've actually tried it out
719000	720000	With an Xbox 360
720000	722000	I have another cable that's not
722000	723000	Hooked up to this that
723000	724000	It converts it to
724000	726000	It splits out the audio
726000	727000	From the HDMI
727000	728000	Because
728000	729000	You know
729000	731000	I don't have any speakers on this thing
731000	733000	So I have to build that
733000	734000	Let's see
734000	736000	Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom
736000	737000	Says
737000	739000	Wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?
739000	740000	I have another TV
740000	741000	But I just
741000	742000	The problem is
742000	743000	You know setting up systems
743000	744000	And moving them around and stuff
744000	745000	It's just a lot easier for
745000	746000	I don't know
746000	747000	I just want to build this
747000	748000	Yeah
748000	751000	You have to understand Brad
751000	753000	This is the very manly man side of Loki
753000	754000	That now it's a thing
754000	756000	And once it's become a thing
756000	758000	He will stop at nothing to achieve
758000	759000	Said thing
759000	760000	Unless
760000	762000	There might be like that one little thing
762000	764000	That just derails the whole thing
764000	765000	And they'll be like
765000	766000	Ah forget it
766000	767000	Like what happened to the building
767000	768000	An arcade machine for $100
768000	769000	Or whatever that was
769000	770000	Um
770000	771000	I just lost interest
771000	772000	See
772000	773000	See
773000	774000	It
774000	775000	I didn't need another arcade machine
775000	777000	I had two I wasn't using
777000	779000	So why build a third
779000	781000	And also it didn't help that the PC
781000	782000	That I got for that
782000	784000	Was defective
784000	785000	So
785000	786000	You can't really
786000	788000	So you get what you pay for
788000	789000	Pretty much
789000	790000	It just wouldn't power up
790000	791000	You know go fake
791000	792000	Um
792000	793000	So yeah
793000	794000	I just
794000	795000	I ended up
795000	797000	Well I didn't even really part of the PC
797000	798000	I just threw it away
798000	799000	Because it was just not working
799000	800000	So
800000	801000	Um
801000	802000	Yeah
802000	803000	I just
803000	804000	I lost interest in that
804000	805000	Um
805000	806000	But
806000	807000	Now that I'm gonna be playing Grand Theft Auto 5
807000	808000	You know
808000	809000	So I'm
809000	810000	Definitely interested in having a screen
810000	811000	I can play that on
811000	812000	Alright
812000	813000	Fair enough
813000	814000	Especially with the online component
814000	815000	Of Grand Theft Auto 5
815000	816000	Starting soon
816000	817000	Ah it's next week
817000	818000	And I'm sure it's gonna be absolutely
818000	819000	You know
819000	820000	Disastrous as far as
820000	821000	You know
821000	822000	Being able to connect to it
822000	823000	Uh
823000	824000	Quick plug for the VOG Network crew
824000	825000	How many people are in that now
825000	826000	Like 20 at least
826000	827000	Um
827000	828000	There's quite a few
828000	829000	Yeah
829000	830000	Um
830000	831000	So yeah
831000	832000	So

847000	848000	20 members
848000	849000	Yeah
849000	850000	There you go
850000	851000	So
851000	852000	And I even promoted Bobby
852000	853000	So
853000	854000	Well there you go
854000	855000	Bobby is now promoted to
855000	856000	Commissioner
856000	857000	Commissioner Bobby
857000	858000	Commissioner Bobby
858000	859000	Nice
859000	860000	I appreciate that
860000	861000	If I know how it's gonna work
861000	862000	I wonder like
862000	863000	I'm gonna be playing both
863000	864000	Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
864000	865000	Like all my co-workers
865000	866000	Have the PS3 version
866000	867000	And they want me to play on that
867000	870000	I just hope that my progress
870000	871000	moves with both
871000	872000	Like it's in the cloud
872000	874000	Well they say it's in the cloud
874000	875000	And stuff
875000	876000	And they say that like you can
876000	878000	When the Playstation 4 version
878000	879000	Comes along that your
879000	880000	You know
880000	881000	Multiplayer information
881000	882000	Goes along with that
882000	883000	But
883000	884000	I just don't know how exactly
884000	885000	That works
885000	886000	Like you know
886000	887000	Cause they have special editions
887000	888000	Of stuff you could've gotten
888000	889000	For one or
889000	890000	The other system
890000	891000	They add different perks
891000	892000	For your characters
892000	893000	But I don't think I can like
893000	894000	Save my character on
894000	895000	Playstation 3
895000	896000	And then transfer it over
896000	897000	It may just do my stats
897000	898000	And that's about it
898000	899000	But
899000	900000	I don't know
900000	903000	We'll check it out I guess
903000	904000	Alright well
904000	905000	Good luck with this
905000	906000	New project of yours
906000	907000	How long do you think it's
907000	909000	Gonna take you to finish?
909000	910000	Well I'm just testing everything
910000	911000	As I go along
911000	912000	So I'm getting the
912000	913000	Wireless HDMI stuff
913000	914000	On Wednesday
914000	916000	And then
916000	917000	The hardest part
917000	918000	Is gonna be
918000	919000	Making the case for it
919000	920000	Cause
922000	923000	Yeah how do you do that
923000	924000	And then also
924000	925000	I have to get a battery
925000	926000	To run everything
926000	927000	Which I figured out
927000	928000	I need a 12 volt battery
928000	930000	Then I'm gonna use a
930000	931000	Step down to
931000	933000	Drop it to 5
933000	934000	Volts so that I can get
934000	935000	More amps out of it
935000	936000	Cause
936000	937000	It's basically gonna be powering
937000	938000	About
938000	941000	4 or 5 USB powered
941000	942000	Things you know
942000	943000	The two controllers
943000	944000	Cause there's gonna be
944000	945000	The internals for
945000	946000	You know
946000	947000	DualShock 3
947000	948000	And then also
948000	949000	You know
949000	950000	The monitor
950000	951000	And then
951000	952000	The wireless HDMI
952000	953000	So
953000	954000	It's four things
954000	955000	And
955000	956000	I think there's something else
956000	957000	I'm forgetting
957000	958000	Speakers
958000	959000	We believe in you
959000	960000	We believe in you
960000	961000	You'll get it
961000	962000	Well I'll see
962000	963000	At the very least
963000	964000	This monitor's pretty cool
964000	965000	So
965000	966000	It is a nice little thing
966000	967000	It looks like a tablet
967000	968000	Looks expensive
968000	969000	Alright
969000	970000	$35
970000	971000	Wow
971000	972000	That's how much of a steal
972000	973000	I got that for
973000	974000	Normally they go for about
974000	975000	$250
975000	976000	Where at?
976000	977000	eBay
977000	978000	Nice
978000	979000	I bid snipe
979000	980000	How much
980000	981000	Speaking of eBay
981000	982000	Before we get into
982000	983000	How was your gaming week
983000	984000	How much did your
984000	985000	Ouya go for on eBay?
985000	986000	$80
986000	987000	Well that's good
987000	988000	That's really good
988000	989000	That's not bad
989000	990000	Considering you paid what
990000	991000	$90 for it?
991000	992000	Yeah
992000	993000	$99
993000	994000	And $80
994000	995000	That's not bad
995000	996000	And also
996000	997000	Funny enough
997000	998000	Actually Saints Row 4
998000	999000	I sold my
999000	1000000	Xbox 360 copy of that
1000000	1001000	Cause I have it on PC
1001000	1002000	And I don't really play
1002000	1003000	The 360 version
1003000	1004000	That went for $14
1004000	1005000	So I was
1005000	1006000	I would have bought that
1006000	1007000	For more
1007000	1008000	Yeah exactly
1008000	1009000	There's so much
1009000	1010000	Counterfeit shit on eBay
1010000	1011000	Of new games
1011000	1012000	You gotta be really careful
1012000	1013000	Remember a couple years ago
1013000	1014000	When Alan got me that
1014000	1015000	Child of Eden
1015000	1016000	That came from China
1016000	1017000	And it wasn't even
1017000	1018000	Like we opened it
1018000	1019000	And the box was
1019000	1020000	Like Assassin's Creed
1020000	1021000	And it was very clearly
1021000	1022000	A burned disc
1022000	1023000	And it was
1023000	1024000	A piece of garbage
1024000	1025000	And he had to go
1025000	1026000	The whole thing
1026000	1027000	Where you file the complaint
1027000	1028000	With eBay
1028000	1029000	And wait
1029000	1030000	Oh god
1030000	1031000	What a mess
1031000	1032000	Well you just gotta
1032000	1033000	Go watch
1033000	1034000	I've got
1034000	1035000	The
1035000	1036000	It's some big box set
1036000	1037000	For
1037000	1038000	The Guild
1038000	1039000	On DVD
1039000	1040000	So
1040000	1041000	But it hasn't
1041000	1042000	Streeted yet
1042000	1043000	So I can't put it up there
1043000	1044000	Lowkey's eBay shop
1044000	1045000	Alright
1045000	1046000	I love the Guild
1046000	1047000	Alright
1047000	1048000	Let's talk about
1048000	1049000	Our gaming weeks
1049000	1050000	The types of video games
1050000	1051000	That we have been playing
1051000	1052000	This week
1052000	1053000	So Dark Soccer
1053000	1054000	Wanna start us off
1054000	1055000	What have you been playing?
1055000	1056000	Salad
1056000	1057000	Salad the game
1057000	1058000	Princess Tomato in the
1058000	1059000	Salad kingdom
1059000	1060000	No
1060000	1061000	I'm actually legit
1061000	1062000	Eating a salad
1062000	1063000	I've been playing
1063000	1064000	I've been playing
1064000	1065000	Final Fantasy 14
1065000	1066000	And
1066000	1067000	Um
1067000	1068000	I got really irritated
1068000	1069000	Because I couldn't do
1069000	1070000	The next
1070000	1071000	A story quest
1071000	1072000	Until I
1072000	1073000	And I thought that I was
1073000	1074000	Ahead levels
1074000	1075000	And then
1075000	1076000	No you have to be 27
1076000	1077000	So I'm running around
1077000	1078000	Doing just shit
1078000	1079000	And I'm in this one place
1079000	1080000	As a
1080000	1081000	I'm a quarry mill
1081000	1082000	For anyone who's playing
1082000	1083000	And everybody there
1083000	1084000	Like you can just follow
1084000	1085000	Hoards of people
1085000	1086000	From blue dot
1086000	1087000	To blue dot
1087000	1088000	It's hilarious
1088000	1089000	Yeah it's uh
1089000	1090000	Fate parties
1090000	1091000	If you actually shout out
1091000	1092000	And say
1092000	1093000	You guys all like
1093000	1094000	Any contributions
1094000	1095000	Are pooled
1095000	1096000	So you get more
1096000	1097000	Golds that way
1097000	1098000	It's a trick people use
1098000	1099000	In leveling
1099000	1100000	I just ignore everybody
1100000	1101000	Yeah
1101000	1102000	That works too
1102000	1103000	They don't exist
1103000	1104000	In my mental universe
1104000	1105000	You can do enough
1105000	1106000	Side quests
1106000	1107000	And other things
1107000	1108000	To you know
1108000	1109000	Level
1109000	1110000	Um
1110000	1111000	So I mean I hit it
1111000	1112000	Obviously
1112000	1113000	While I'm drinking
1113000	1114000	So I was like
1114000	1115000	Okay
1115000	1116000	And um
1116000	1117000	I uh
1117000	1118000	What else did I play
1118000	1119000	Animal Crossing
1119000	1120000	Of course
1120000	1121000	I haven't really been
1121000	1122000	Um
1122000	1123000	So I asked
1123000	1124000	Bejeweled
1124000	1125000	I don't know why
1125000	1126000	It's just fun
1126000	1127000	It's a nice little
1127000	1128000	Time waster
1128000	1129000	And I've actually
1129000	1130000	Gotten pretty good
1130000	1131000	At the diamond mine
1131000	1132000	It's a good potty game
1132000	1133000	It actually is
1133000	1134000	A really good potty game
1134000	1135000	My iPhone has changed
1135000	1136000	The way I use the bathroom
1136000	1137000	Rob
1137000	1138000	There's a shirt
1138000	1139000	That says that
1139000	1140000	And I want it
1140000	1141000	Um
1141000	1142000	And uh
1142000	1143000	Dan had
1143000	1144000	Beat GTA 5
1144000	1145000	Mm-hmm
1145000	1146000	So
1146000	1147000	I've now been
1147000	1148000	You know
1148000	1149000	Randomly going in there
1149000	1150000	And hearing you know
1150000	1151000	It's been pretty funny
1151000	1152000	But you're not really
1152000	1153000	Interested in playing yourself
1153000	1154000	No
1154000	1155000	I don't
1155000	1156000	You know what
1156000	1157000	I don't care how good
1157000	1159000	A game is
1159000	1161000	I have no tolerance
1161000	1163000	For misogyny
1163000	1164000	You have to have also like
1164000	1165000	Just some interest in it
1165000	1166000	You know
1166000	1167000	I have zero interest in it
1167000	1169000	Now if it was you know
1169000	1171000	I want to do like
1171000	1173000	A lady Grand Theft Auto
1173000	1175000	Where it's just this
1175000	1176000	Hardcore
1176000	1177000	You know
1177000	1178000	Woman
1178000	1180000	Tearing down the patriarchy
1180000	1181000	Play Saints Row
1181000	1182000	Because you can kind of do it
1182000	1183000	Saints Row 2
1183000	1184000	Saints Row 2
1184000	1185000	Not the other ones
1185000	1186000	No
1186000	1187000	But you
1187000	1188000	But it's
1188000	1190000	I really have no interest in
1190000	1192000	I hate to say
1192000	1193000	I have no interest in the culture
1193000	1195000	Because clearly I have an interest
1195000	1197000	In various aspects of culture
1197000	1199000	But it's not something
1199000	1200000	That appeals to me
1200000	1201000	So
1201000	1204000	I don't really care about it
1204000	1205000	Fair enough
1205000	1206000	Alright
1206000	1207000	I'll go in and watch Dan play
1207000	1208000	For a little bit
1208000	1209000	And I'm like
1209000	1210000	I'll just roll my eyes
1210000	1211000	And go
1211000	1212000	Really?
1212000	1213000	Because
1213000	1214000	Oh my god
1214000	1215000	I have to tell you
1215000	1216000	What happened the other day
1216000	1217000	I was pumping gas
1217000	1218000	And this guy comes up
1218000	1219000	And says
1219000	1220000	You know
1220000	1221000	One of the
1221000	1222000	Can we do your windshield thing
1222000	1223000	Fluid you know
1223000	1224000	So that they're trying
1224000	1225000	To sell you something
1225000	1226000	And I said
1226000	1227000	That's okay
1227000	1228000	I'm not interested
1228000	1229000	He's like
1229000	1230000	Oh well I hope you have
1230000	1231000	A better rest of your day
1231000	1232000	I got so mad
1232000	1233000	I said
1233000	1234000	Would you have asked me that
1234000	1235000	If I was a man?
1235000	1236000	And he's like
1236000	1237000	I thought not
1237000	1238000	But you know
1238000	1240000	It was like
1240000	1241000	God I hate people
1241000	1242000	But yeah
1242000	1243000	I don't know
1243000	1244000	I've been a little bit
1244000	1245000	Hypersensitive
1245000	1246000	What in the hell
1246000	1247000	Does that have to do with games?
1247000	1248000	Because
1248000	1249000	I'm just saying
1249000	1250000	That I've been so hypersensitive
1250000	1251000	Lately
1251000	1252000	And just really pissed off
1252000	1253000	At everything
1253000	1254000	Especially after talking
1254000	1255000	With my mother
1255000	1256000	That I think
1256000	1257000	I would vomit all over
1257000	1258000	GTA V
1258000	1259000	At this point
1259000	1260000	In a feminist rage
1260000	1261000	You're missing the point
1261000	1262000	I mean honestly
1262000	1263000	If you're gonna vomit
1263000	1264000	All over GTA V
1264000	1265000	It's a story
1265000	1266000	It has guys in it
1266000	1267000	I mean
1267000	1268000	So what
1268000	1269000	There's not a fucking female lead
1269000	1270000	Boo
1270000	1271000	Hoo
1271000	1272000	Get over it
1272000	1273000	Seriously
1273000	1274000	Everybody needs to get over it
1274000	1276000	I can see where
1276000	1278000	Well here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto
1278000	1279000	I don't care that it has it
1279000	1281000	I just don't have to play it
1281000	1283000	It pushes the envelope
1283000	1284000	As art does
1284000	1285000	Right
1285000	1286000	Video games are art right
1286000	1287000	And Grand Theft Auto
1287000	1288000	Definitely pushes the envelope
1288000	1289000	In a lot of ways
1289000	1290000	But for me
1290000	1291000	Grand Theft Auto
1291000	1292000	And everything that's in it
1292000	1293000	Again
1293000	1294000	I don't put
1294000	1295000	A game like Grand Theft Auto
1295000	1296000	On any different platform
1296000	1297000	Than I put movies
1297000	1298000	And Grand Theft Auto to me
1298000	1299000	Is just one of those like
1299000	1301000	Brosy action movies
1301000	1302000	Exactly
1302000	1303000	That are out there and exist
1303000	1304000	You know
1304000	1305000	And there's definitely
1305000	1306000	An audience for it
1306000	1307000	A lot of those movies
1307000	1308000	Really do well
1308000	1309000	But there's some people
1309000	1310000	That just aren't really
1310000	1311000	Interested in it
1311000	1312000	Just like
1312000	1313000	I bet Loki
1313000	1314000	Wouldn't be caught dead
1314000	1315000	Watching The Notebook
1315000	1316000	You know
1316000	1317000	I've already seen it
1317000	1318000	I haven't seen it
1318000	1319000	And I don't care to see it
1319000	1320000	Well I mean
1320000	1321000	It's just
1321000	1322000	It's a genre that
1322000	1323000	I am not into
1323000	1324000	I mean
1324000	1325000	If it had more things
1325000	1326000	That I think
1326000	1327000	Would appeal to me
1327000	1328000	As a player
1328000	1329000	You know
1329000	1330000	Then I might give it a chance
1330000	1331000	Like I tried Saints Row
1331000	1332000	Saints Row 3
1332000	1333000	Or the third
1333000	1334000	Or whatever the fuck it was
1334000	1335000	It wasn't very fun
1335000	1336000	So what exactly
1336000	1337000	About Mass Effect 3
1337000	1338000	Made for a good game
1338000	1340000	Versus Grand Theft Auto 5
1340000	1341000	Well first of all
1341000	1342000	It actually told
1342000	1343000	A very solid story
1343000	1344000	There was very little
1344000	1345000	Misogyny in it
1345000	1346000	Which
1346000	1347000	But you haven't played
1347000	1348000	Grand Theft Auto 5
1348000	1349000	So you have no fucking clue
1349000	1350000	What the story is like
1350000	1351000	Um
1351000	1352000	I've actually sat
1353000	1354000	There's a great story
1354000	1355000	In fact
1355000	1356000	Three stories
1356000	1357000	Throughout the entire
1357000	1358000	Campaign of it
1358000	1359000	There's
1359000	1360000	I just don't understand
1360000	1361000	How people can get off
1361000	1362000	Saying that there's
1362000	1363000	Not a good story in that
1363000	1364000	I mean
1364000	1365000	The whole game is compelling
1365000	1366000	I'm not saying the story
1366000	1367000	Isn't good
1367000	1368000	I'm just saying
1368000	1369000	It doesn't appeal to me
1369000	1370000	Yeah but you're
1370000	1371000	Blaming it saying
1371000	1372000	You're saying that
1372000	1373000	It doesn't have a good story
1373000	1374000	And Mass Effect 3
1374000	1375000	Has a great story
1375000	1376000	I didn't say
1376000	1377000	It didn't have a good story
1377000	1378000	I said
1378000	1379000	It doesn't appeal to me
1379000	1380000	There is a difference
1380000	1381000	Between something
1381000	1382000	And not being
1382000	1383000	Something that I'm into
1383000	1385000	You know
1385000	1387000	For example
1387000	1388000	Okay
1388000	1389000	Misogyn
1389000	1390000	The play
1390000	1391000	Great story
1391000	1392000	I don't really care
1392000	1393000	For the play
1393000	1394000	Um
1394000	1395000	Chicago
1395000	1396000	Great movie
1396000	1397000	Great story
1397000	1398000	I hate everybody in it
1398000	1399000	I don't
1399000	1400000	I've seen it once
1400000	1401000	I don't care
1401000	1402000	To see it again
1402000	1403000	Breaking Bad
1403000	1404000	Just won an Emmy
1404000	1405000	And I think
1405000	1406000	We're going up
1406000	1407000	Against the finale tonight
1407000	1408000	And I'm sure
1408000	1409000	It's a great show
1409000	1410000	And I hate that show
1410000	1411000	Okay
1411000	1412000	And I'm sure it's a good show
1412000	1413000	But I just
1413000	1414000	I'd rather
1414000	1415000	Do other stuff right now
1415000	1416000	But I mean
1416000	1417000	Anything
1417000	1418000	That's kind of where I see it
1418000	1419000	Is that it's like
1419000	1420000	Alright
1420000	1421000	So Breaking Bad's
1421000	1422000	Winning all these awards
1422000	1423000	And I'm sure it's a great show
1423000	1424000	I'm not gonna
1424000	1425000	Sit here
1425000	1426000	Yeah
1426000	1427000	I'm not gonna sit here
1427000	1428000	Not the show
1428000	1429000	But it's just like
1429000	1430000	Ain't nobody got time
1430000	1431000	For that right now
1431000	1432000	For me
1432000	1433000	Here's another
1433000	1434000	Here's another example
1434000	1435000	Okay
1435000	1436000	I have a bajillion friends
1436000	1437000	That are into Buffy
1437000	1438000	And I love Joss
1438000	1439000	Because he can tell
1440000	1441000	I have a few episodes
1441000	1442000	That I like to watch
1442000	1443000	I really don't care
1443000	1444000	For the series as a whole
1444000	1445000	The end
1445000	1446000	You know
1446000	1447000	It's the same thing
1447000	1448000	Something can be good
1448000	1449000	On its own merits
1449000	1450000	But if it's not your thing
1450000	1451000	You don't have to watch it
1453000	1454000	Or like mayonnaise
1454000	1455000	Again
1455000	1456000	I really hate mayonnaise
1456000	1457000	What?
1457000	1458000	Actually it is like mayonnaise
1458000	1459000	Mayonnaise has
1459000	1461000	Very good culinary applications
1461000	1462000	But if you're not into it
1462000	1464000	You're not into it
1464000	1465000	You know
1465000	1466000	Alright
1466000	1467000	I like boobs
1467000	1468000	Some girls don't like boobs
1469000	1470000	Another thing
1470000	1471000	Self hating women
1473000	1475000	I guess we'll leave it at that
1475000	1477000	If that's it for your gaming week
1477000	1479000	Loki how was your gaming week?
1479000	1481000	My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto 5
1481000	1482000	And I played a ton of it
1482000	1485000	And even had the time to
1485000	1488000	Shoot some video for a funny little
1488000	1490000	Montage thing
1490000	1491000	That's set to
1491000	1493000	The music from the movie Rad
1494000	1495000	Because it's
1495000	1497000	I haven't seen your video yet
1497000	1498000	It's just weird
1500000	1501000	For me
1501000	1502000	The movie Rad
1502000	1504000	Because I was looking
1504000	1505000	I don't remember what I was doing
1505000	1507000	I was browsing
1507000	1508000	YouTube
1508000	1509000	And you know how I make recommendations
1509000	1510000	For you and stuff
1510000	1512000	And I think I watched
1513000	1514000	What was it
1514000	1515000	I played the navigator on there one time
1515000	1517000	And so I recommended Rad and stuff
1517000	1518000	So
1519000	1521000	That movie is really fucking cheesy
1521000	1522000	If you've ever seen it
1522000	1523000	It is super cheeseball
1523000	1524000	They have like
1524000	1526000	A scene at a dance
1526000	1528000	Where they're riding BMX bikes
1528000	1529000	To like
1530000	1531000	Send me an angel
1531000	1532000	It's just like
1532000	1534000	What the hell is going on
1534000	1536000	So I was like ok that's really funny
1536000	1538000	And so I had Trevor in the game
1538000	1540000	Doing all those bikes
1540000	1541000	Running from the police
1541000	1543000	Hitting people with his bike
1543000	1545000	Firing a shotgun and stuff
1545000	1547000	And I thought the juxtaposition of that
1547000	1549000	With the music from the movie
1549000	1551000	Was fantastic and hilarious
1551000	1553000	So I decided to
1553000	1555000	Make a short YouTube video
1555000	1556000	Called Breaking Rad
1556000	1557000	Cause you know
1557000	1558000	He's a meth dealer
1558000	1559000	So
1559000	1560000	Fixed
1560000	1561000	And uh
1561000	1562000	Are you gonna try and go viral
1562000	1563000	Like Bobby's article did this week
1563000	1564000	Oh no
1564000	1565000	It's not gonna go viral
1565000	1566000	It's just
1566000	1567000	It's just a funny video
1567000	1568000	So that's all
1568000	1569000	But yeah
1569000	1570000	So I played through that
1570000	1571000	And I'm actually
1571000	1572000	At the very end of the game
1572000	1573000	So
1573000	1574000	I'm trying to finish
1574000	1575000	The single player campaign
1575000	1576000	Before
1576000	1577000	Online starts
1577000	1578000	Cause I do wanna do online
1578000	1580000	I think I am gonna have a few days
1580000	1581000	Though because I know
1581000	1583000	You know online launches
1583000	1584000	On Tuesday
1584000	1585000	But
1585000	1586000	Come on
1586000	1587000	They even admitted to it
1587000	1588000	They're like
1588000	1589000	So listen
1589000	1590000	We know how online
1590000	1591000	You know
1591000	1592000	Multiplayer launches have been
1592000	1593000	And
1593000	1594000	Trust us
1594000	1595000	You know
1595000	1596000	We're gonna try to make sure
1596000	1597000	That that's not gonna be the same way
1597000	1598000	But
1598000	1599000	It's probably gonna
1599000	1600000	It'll break
1600000	1601000	It's gonna
1601000	1602000	You know
1602000	1603000	It's gonna be broken
1603000	1604000	It's gonna be
1604000	1605000	You know
1605000	1606000	Bumpy
1606000	1607000	But
1607000	1608000	You know
1608000	1609000	Just give us some time
1609000	1610000	You know
1610000	1611000	Cause that's
1611000	1612000	Seriously with the
1612000	1613000	Rockstar Social Club stuff
1613000	1614000	This week
1614000	1615000	So they
1615000	1616000	It's been tough
1616000	1617000	And they've been trying to
1617000	1618000	You know
1618000	1619000	Deal with 17 million people
1619000	1620000	Wanting to try this stuff out
1620000	1621000	So
1621000	1622000	You know
1622000	1623000	17 million people
1623000	1624000	You know
1624000	1625000	Or even like
1625000	1626000	Half that
1626000	1627000	Hitting up a server
1627000	1628000	Trying to play online
1628000	1629000	What was the strategy
1629000	1630000	I apologize if you've covered this
1630000	1631000	On the show before
1631000	1632000	But you know
1632000	1633000	Now that it's coming up this week
1633000	1634000	I'm thinking about it now
1634000	1635000	What was the strategy
1635000	1636000	Behind delaying it
1636000	1637000	And not having it
1637000	1638000	When the game launches
1638000	1639000	Did they just
1639000	1640000	They purposely wanted people
1640000	1641000	To spend some time
1641000	1642000	With single player mode
1642000	1643000	They wanted people
1643000	1644000	To rush to get into
1644000	1645000	The multiplayer portion
1645000	1646000	And they wanted you to enjoy
1646000	1647000	The single player portion
1647000	1648000	Of the game first
1648000	1649000	And they wanted to make sure
1649000	1650000	That everything worked properly
1650000	1651000	So
1651000	1652000	Um
1652000	1653000	I mean
1653000	1654000	There's a lot of stuff
1654000	1655000	In the world
1655000	1656000	So I can understand how
1656000	1657000	You need to make sure
1657000	1658000	Everything's
1658000	1659000	You know
1659000	1660000	Tested
1660000	1661000	And you know
1661000	1662000	Catch any flaws
1662000	1663000	You may have
1663000	1664000	With your servers
1664000	1665000	And that kind of stuff
1665000	1666000	Especially since they've had
1666000	1667000	Trouble with the Social Club stuff
1667000	1668000	Going to our chatroom
1668000	1669000	At live.vognetwork.com
1669000	1670000	Dungeon Buster said
1670000	1671000	Social Club was pretty rough
1671000	1672000	The game had issues
1672000	1673000	Connecting to it
1673000	1674000	Uh
1674000	1675000	SEG is in our chatroom
1675000	1676000	And says I'm glad they
1676000	1677000	Separated out the release
1677000	1678000	Yeah
1678000	1679000	So I could play the single player
1679000	1680000	And get a little bit of
1680000	1681000	A handle of like
1681000	1682000	You know
1682000	1683000	The map
1683000	1684000	And also kind of like
1684000	1685000	How you do heists
1685000	1686000	And just all that stuff
1686000	1687000	I'm gonna totally 180
1687000	1688000	The topic on you here
1688000	1689000	But this conversation's
1689000	1690000	Making me think about this
1690000	1691000	And it's not in our show
1691000	1692000	Roll tonight
1692000	1693000	And it is pretty big news
1693000	1694000	The uh
1694000	1695000	New Batman game
1695000	1696000	That's coming out
1696000	1697000	Uh
1697000	1698000	This uh
1698000	1699000	Fall in
1699000	1700000	A month or two
1700000	1701000	And this
1701000	1702000	The Wii U version
1702000	1703000	Will not have multiplayer
1703000	1704000	Oh shocking
1704000	1705000	They've said that before
1705000	1706000	The Nintendo
1706000	1707000	You know
1707000	1708000	Online component
1708000	1709000	Just isn't
1709000	1710000	They don't think
1710000	1711000	There's enough people there
1711000	1712000	And it's honestly
1712000	1713000	Probably not an untrue thing
1713000	1714000	But
1714000	1715000	Because of it
1715000	1716000	This is the news that came out
1716000	1717000	This week
1717000	1718000	The Wii U version's
1718000	1719000	Going to be ten dollars cheaper
1719000	1720000	Uh
1720000	1721000	Whereas the other versions
1721000	1722000	Will be sixty dollars
1722000	1723000	Because the
1723000	1724000	Wii U's missing the multiplayer
1724000	1725000	They're gonna knock ten dollars
1725000	1726000	Off the price
1726000	1727000	Some people are saying
1727000	1728000	God
1728000	1729000	I wish they would do that
1729000	1730000	For 360 as well
1730000	1731000	Or I wish
1731000	1732000	This is an offering
1732000	1733000	We could have for games
1733000	1734000	Where
1734000	1735000	Knock ten dollars
1735000	1736000	Off the price
1736000	1737000	For multiplayer
1737000	1738000	Which is kind of funny
1738000	1739000	To me
1739000	1740000	Cause isn't this like
1740000	1741000	The inverse
1741000	1742000	But in a more consumer
1742000	1743000	Friendly way
1743000	1744000	Of the online pass
1744000	1745000	Cause
1745000	1746000	The online pass
1746000	1747000	Was ten dollars right
1747000	1748000	Cause I'm thinking like
1748000	1749000	If
1749000	1750000	What I'm reading is correct
1750000	1751000	If games were ten dollars
1751000	1752000	Cheaper to begin with
1752000	1753000	We wouldn't have a problem
1753000	1754000	With online passes
1754000	1755000	Here's what it really
1755000	1756000	That's the way I read it
1756000	1757000	I think they're just
1757000	1758000	It's marketing spin
1758000	1759000	Is gonna be ten dollars
1759000	1760000	Cheaper
1760000	1761000	Wasn't a decision
1761000	1762000	That they made
1762000	1763000	When they
1763000	1764000	Put it out
1764000	1765000	I think what it is
1765000	1766000	Is that
1766000	1767000	The Wii U's stuff
1767000	1768000	Doesn't sell as well
1768000	1769000	And so they have to
1769000	1770000	Lower the price
1770000	1771000	To make it more attractive
1771000	1772000	To people
1772000	1773000	Buying games
1773000	1774000	That's really the true
1774000	1775000	Story of it
1775000	1776000	And the fact that it
1776000	1777000	Just doesn't have multiplayer
1777000	1778000	I don't think it
1778000	1779000	Would have mattered
1779000	1780000	They would have
1780000	1781000	Still put it out
1781000	1782000	At sixty bucks
1782000	1783000	Anyways
1783000	1784000	If they thought
1784000	1785000	They could get away with it
1785000	1786000	But that's really
1786000	1787000	What it comes down to
1787000	1788000	You know
1788000	1789000	Market down ten bucks
1789000	1790000	To try to see
1790000	1791000	If we can move
1791000	1792000	A few more copies
1792000	1793000	It's not
1793000	1794000	But see
1794000	1795000	Now they've gotten
1795000	1796000	A lot of PR spin
1796000	1797000	Out of it
1797000	1798000	You know
1798000	1799000	So it's very positive
1799000	1800000	And you know
1800000	1801000	That helps them out
1801000	1802000	As well
1802000	1803000	But it's not
1803000	1804000	It's not specifically
1804000	1805000	Because multiplayer is missing
1805000	1806000	Trust me
1806000	1807000	Because
1807000	1808000	Shit
1808000	1809000	They omit stuff
1809000	1810000	From all different
1810000	1811000	You know games
1811000	1812000	Across platforms
1812000	1813000	And there's never
1813000	1814000	A price break
1814000	1815000	Because of that
1815000	1816000	It's always because
1816000	1817000	It's a pretty sweet
1817000	1818000	Deal
1818000	1819000	Seeing
1819000	1820000	It also has
1820000	1821000	Gamepad support
1821000	1822000	I gotta be honest
1822000	1823000	I'm interested
1823000	1824000	In the new Batman game
1824000	1825000	I don't know how
1825000	1826000	I feel about multiplayer
1826000	1827000	Part of me says
1827000	1828000	Eh get it on
1828000	1829000	PlayStation 3
1829000	1830000	But even
1830000	1831000	Arkham City
1831000	1832000	Armored Edition
1832000	1833000	Was kind of lame
1833000	1834000	As far as the
1834000	1835000	Gamepad support
1835000	1836000	It was pretty much
1836000	1837000	What you had
1837000	1838000	With the PS3
1838000	1839000	I don't
1839000	1840000	Let that
1840000	1841000	Effect my opinion
1841000	1842000	Of the new Batman game
1842000	1843000	Because
1843000	1844000	Well A
1844000	1845000	I haven't played
1845000	1846000	Disc there

4591000	4592000	And
4592000	4593000	And
4593000	4594000	And
4595000	4598000	Are they starting to do away with the
4598000	4602000	Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?
4602000	4604000	I don't think so, because
4604000	4605000	We're gonna have a w-
4605000	4607000	Mario Kart 8, etc. etc.
4607000	4608000	But
4608000	4611000	Could this idiot be on to something?
4611000	4613000	Weeee
4613000	4615000	Without the gamepad
4615000	4617000	You think
4617000	4619000	Then why not just get a Wii
4619000	4621000	Cause it's not HD
4621000	4623000	Well why not get a
4623000	4625000	Why not get a 3DS then
4625000	4627000	I'm happier with my 3DS
4627000	4629000	Alright, anyhow, I'm just
4629000	4631000	Anyway, alright
4631000	4633000	For the love of God, just do what you're gonna
4633000	4635000	You know that's gonna happen eventually
4635000	4637000	Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U
4637000	4639000	It's gonna happen
4639000	4641000	Or even regular DS games, like Clubhouse games
4641000	4643000	Anything, it's gonna happen
4643000	4645000	But, I just wish
4645000	4647000	We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish
4647000	4649000	If they were to do that
4649000	4651000	Why can't I play a
4651000	4653000	DS game across the internet now
4653000	4655000	That should be something
4655000	4657000	I should be able to do, feasibly
4657000	4659000	Why can't I fucking do that
4659000	4661000	Like, the technology is there
4661000	4663000	If you're gonna sell DS games on
4663000	4665000	The Wii U, let me play Clubhouse
4665000	4667000	games with friends on the other coast
4667000	4669000	Instead of having to be in the same room
4669000	4671000	Because, I mean, I'm just going back to the
4671000	4673000	One 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing
4673000	4675000	I
4675000	4677000	Go to the International Island and chat
4677000	4679000	With people in Japan
4679000	4681000	And do the stupid
4681000	4683000	Club Tortimer games with them
4683000	4685000	And, you know, and usually
4685000	4687000	I don't have too much of a problem communicating
4687000	4689000	Because either there's a chance that
4689000	4691000	Between the Japanese I know and the English they know
4691000	4693000	We can get a point across
4693000	4695000	But, I mean, if they're letting you play with people
4695000	4697000	You know, across the ocean in a game
4697000	4699000	Like Animal Crossing, why can't you play other games
4699000	4701000	And actually
4701000	4703000	Now that I think about it, that may have actually been
4703000	4705000	The game I called out, Clubhouse games, you may have actually
4705000	4707000	Been able to play that across the internet on the DS
4707000	4709000	Did have some internet enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters
4709000	4711000	You could do online, right?
4711000	4713000	But, you know, there were
4713000	4715000	A lot of games you could only do in the same room
4715000	4717000	And it would be really cool if you could open that up
4717000	4719000	And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a
4719000	4721000	Camera in it, why can't we
4721000	4723000	Be able to see friends while we're playing?
4725000	4727000	Or see dick while we're playing
4727000	4729000	Or boobies
4729000	4731000	Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here
4738000	4740000	This is a huge kind of topic change here
4740000	4742000	This is going back to a story
4742000	4744000	From a long time ago
4744000	4746000	But we talked about this extensively
4746000	4748000	On OLR when it first happened
4748000	4750000	Because it had a local connection
4750000	4752000	And this goes all the way back to the year
4752000	4754000	I think it was 2007
4754000	4756000	When this all happened
4756000	4758000	No, or would it have been 2006?
4758000	4760000	I think it, no, it was 2007
4760000	4762000	When did the Wii come out? Nintendo Wii
4762000	4764000	Was it 2006?
4764000	4766000	I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold
4767000	4769000	Well, here's the thing
4769000	4771000	Here locally, in California
4771000	4773000	There was a radio station
4773000	4775000	In Sacramento, specifically, where our show is based
4775000	4777000	Which is The End
4777000	4779000	And they had a contest called
4779000	4781000	Hold Your Wii for a Wii
4781000	4783000	You guys remember this now?
4783000	4785000	The unfortunate situation is
4785000	4787000	That the prize being given away
4787000	4789000	Was the video game
4789000	4791000	And the fact that it had the silly name
4791000	4793000	Kind of lent itself to this contest
4793000	4795000	And unfortunately
4795000	4797000	Jennifer Strange
4797000	4799000	Who is a resident of Rancho Cordova
4799000	4801000	Passed away after she held her Wii
4801000	4803000	She didn't even win the competition
4803000	4805000	Unfortunately
4805000	4807000	But she went home and she died
4807000	4809000	Because these radio hosts
4809000	4811000	And the radio station didn't realize
4811000	4813000	That yes, a person can die from drinking
4813000	4815000	Too much water and then not allowing themselves
4815000	4817000	To go to the bathroom
4817000	4819000	And people warned them during and before the contest
4819000	4821000	And it was really
4821000	4823000	Just a hugely ignorant thing
4823000	4825000	Unfortunately, they were ignorant of the fact
4825000	4827000	That a fraternity guy in Chico
4827000	4829000	Had passed away from the same thing
4829000	4831000	Not that long before
4831000	4833000	Somebody called into the radio station
4833000	4835000	Even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this
4835000	4837000	And they kind of laughed it off
4837000	4839000	And that was the really damning thing
4839000	4841000	In this whole thing
4841000	4843000	Because they laughed that person off
4843000	4845000	And that clip really came back to haunt
4845000	4847000	All those people that got fired
4847000	4849000	So The Morning Rave
4849000	4851000	Was the name of this show at the time
4851000	4853000	$2.5 million in damages
4853000	4855000	Awarded against the station
4855000	4857000	In a lawsuit
4857000	4859000	But there were no further ramifications in place
4859000	4861000	Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?
4861000	4863000	Because
4863000	4865000	Media watchdog group, the Sacramento Media Group
4865000	4867000	And Media Action Center
4867000	4869000	Bringing legal action to the Federal
4869000	4871000	Communications Commission, the FCC
4871000	4873000	To block the renewal
4873000	4875000	Of the license for K-DND
4875000	4877000	So because of this
4877000	4879000	Incident that happened over a Wii
4879000	4881000	Six or seven years ago
4881000	4883000	It's going to court
4883000	4885000	Where 1079 The End
4885000	4887000	May not get its license
4887000	4889000	And just to
4889000	4891000	Kind of give you the local connection, living here
4891000	4893000	I can tell you that radio station's huge
4893000	4895000	In this area, I think it's one of the top
4895000	4897000	Stations in the area, it's the top 40
4897000	4899000	Music station
4899000	4901000	Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?
4901000	4903000	Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs
4903000	4905000	I personally don't listen to it
4905000	4907000	Because it's like the Justin Bieber
4907000	4909000	One Direction
4909000	4911000	It's more like a teeny kid's station
4911000	4913000	So no great loss
4913000	4915000	But that shit's really popular
4915000	4917000	There's still people that work at those stations
4917000	4919000	Well, right
4919000	4921000	I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy
4921000	4923000	Right
4923000	4925000	And so it's very interesting that all this time later
4925000	4927000	But they kind of bring up a good point
4927000	4929000	I guess there was even a documentary
4929000	4931000	Sue Wilson in 2009
4931000	4933000	Who was the founder of the Media Action Center
4933000	4935000	And who was a vocal critic of K-DND
4935000	4937000	In a documentary called Broadcast Blues
4937000	4939000	And says quote
4939000	4941000	In that contest, a woman died
4941000	4943000	But the Federal Communications Commission
4943000	4945000	Has not acted in any way
4945000	4947000	And you kind of look at that and go
4947000	4949000	Well, she has a point
4949000	4951000	But then there's another part of me that goes
4951000	4953000	It's been six years
4953000	4955000	And all those ignorant people
4955000	4957000	That were involved with this
4957000	4959000	Have nothing to do with the station anymore
4959000	4961000	I mean
4961000	4963000	Yes, it was horrific at the time
4963000	4965000	If it were me
4965000	4967000	I would make it more difficult
4967000	4969000	I mean, for example
4969000	4971000	To do maybe a complete
4971000	4973000	Investigation into their current practices
4973000	4975000	To see that they have indeed
4975000	4977000	Learned from their mistake
4977000	4979000	And are staying within proper
4979000	4981000	Health and safety compliance
4981000	4983000	Before approving it
4983000	4985000	Maybe give them extra requirements
4985000	4987000	Since they had this
4987000	4989000	History of events
4989000	4991000	Keep in mind for this
4991000	4993000	It takes seven years to come off of your
4993000	4995000	Your report, right?
4995000	4997000	We're looking kind of around the same
4997000	4999000	Time frame, you know
4999000	5001000	If your financial
5001000	5003000	You know
5003000	5005000	What's the word I'm trying to think of
5005000	5007000	If your financial ability
5007000	5009000	Is judged in terms of seven years
5009000	5011000	Then that should be
5011000	5013000	Clearly enough time to give a company
5013000	5015000	Seven years to clean up its act
5015000	5017000	Especially with hordes of lawyers
5017000	5019000	And officials
5019000	5021000	I think it's plenty of time
5021000	5023000	I just think that they need to prove that yes
5023000	5025000	We have learned the errors
5025000	5027000	Of our ways
5027000	5029000	So there you have it
5029000	5031000	All these years later
5031000	5033000	The silly name of the Nintendo Wii
5033000	5035000	Still
5035000	5037000	Still kind of causing these legal
5037000	5039000	Fallouts all these years later
5039000	5041000	Very interesting
5041000	5043000	Well maybe it stuck with the revolution
5043000	5045000	They'd be spinning in office chairs
5045000	5047000	And I do
5047000	5049000	Funny
5049000	5051000	Well I do have to say
5051000	5053000	I hate you and I really appreciate you all
5053000	5055000	At the same time
5055000	5057000	I do have to say that had the FCC
5057000	5059000	Stepped in when the event happened
5059000	5061000	That would have been appropriate
5061000	5063000	But it has been a little late
5063000	5065000	And yeah I do
5065000	5067000	I would more say that I'd want the FCC
5067000	5069000	Held accountable for their lack of action
5069000	5071000	But
5071000	5073000	Right now it would be too late
5073000	5075000	It would just be almost spiteful
5075000	5077000	And it's like you see all these years
5077000	5079000	All these years later do you know what I still
5079000	5081000	Hear about in regards to the FCC
5081000	5083000	Is when Janet Jackson
5083000	5085000	Everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl
5085000	5087000	You still hear about that today
5087000	5089000	Because like just recently
5089000	5091000	There was like an appeal of an appeal
5091000	5093000	Where the CBS stations themselves
5093000	5095000	Would not be fine because
5095000	5097000	Oh my god people
5097000	5099000	Oh my god it was a titty
5099000	5101000	It was a titty
5101000	5103000	When you've got people stringing
5103000	5105000	Most people
5105000	5107000	Already seen her titties
5107000	5109000	With hands on them too
5109000	5111000	Right?
5111000	5113000	It was her album cover
5113000	5115000	Oh no it was Rolling Stone
5115000	5117000	Oh yeah okay it was Rolling Stone
5117000	5119000	Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty
5119000	5121000	Yes
5121000	5123000	Well I mean speaking of her
5123000	5125000	She made a point not too long ago
5125000	5127000	That I had to roll my eyes at my mom and her husband
5127000	5129000	For being stupid over
5129000	5131000	But I mean she was saying
5131000	5133000	You've got shows where you see all of this gratuitous
5133000	5135000	Violence but someone says fuck
5135000	5137000	Or someone shows a boob
5137000	5139000	And people lose their shit
5139000	5141000	I agree we need more nudity in shows
5141000	5143000	Seriously
5143000	5145000	Like it is such a double standard
5145000	5147000	You know it's like oh my god
5147000	5149000	Oh there's a nipple
5149000	5151000	And like they even have it where they're pretty much
5151000	5153000	Topless but they've got pasties
5153000	5155000	But for some reason that nipple man
5155000	5157000	You've crossed the line
5157000	5159000	Why is the chat room going off about titty
5159000	5161000	Sprinkles
5161000	5163000	Stop giggling
5163000	5165000	SG100 Matt says
5165000	5167000	FCC is still going after
5167000	5169000	MIA for last year's
5169000	5171000	Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger
5171000	5173000	Was that even last year or was that two years ago?
5173000	5175000	I don't know
5175000	5177000	Fucking sports ball
5177000	5179000	Yes but it was Madonna
5179000	5181000	Madonna
5181000	5183000	But Beyonce was this year
5183000	5185000	Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?
5185000	5187000	What's Madonna going to do to one up Miley
5187000	5189000	She made out with Britney Spears or whatever
5189000	5191000	Or there was a kiss or some garbage
5191000	5193000	Now she needs to one up
5193000	5195000	Madonna will have to literally
5195000	5196000	Pull something out of her
5196000	5198000	She will need to have sex with somebody on stage
5198000	5200000	In the middle of her song
5200000	5202000	Something is going to have to happen
5202000	5204000	You know what?
5204000	5206000	I have to say that Adam
5206000	5208000	What's-his-face that was on American Idol
5208000	5210000	Lambert
5210000	5212000	My mom's a big fan
5212000	5214000	Rob I love Adam
5214000	5216000	Lambert
5217000	5219000	As my friend Susan calls
5219000	5221000	He should have won Rob
5221000	5223000	Why do they let 12 year old girls vote on Idol Rob
5223000	5225000	They should ban little girls from voting on Idol
5225000	5227000	Because Adam Lambert was Rob
5227000	5229000	Because the other guy was cuter
5229000	5231000	But the 30 year olds won with David Cook
5231000	5233000	Just saying
5233000	5235000	And you know Susan
5235000	5237000	She calls him Madame Lambert
5237000	5239000	But he went out
5239000	5241000	On some of his performances
5241000	5243000	Being basically
5243000	5245000	As
5245000	5247000	I'd probably say overtly sexual
5247000	5249000	As some women feel
5249000	5251000	That they need to do
5251000	5253000	And he illustrated a very good point
5253000	5255000	Why should women be expected to do this
5255000	5257000	But men be lambasted for it
5257000	5259000	And at the same time if a woman goes out
5259000	5261000	And is classy
5261000	5263000	She still has a particular standard
5263000	5265000	That men aren't particularly held to
5265000	5267000	And you know
5267000	5269000	I think that the big fault
5269000	5271000	Just has to do with
5271000	5273000	Basically the
5273000	5275000	The expectations that society
5275000	5277000	Itself is forced
5277000	5279000	To have
5279000	5281000	By what's presented to us in the media
5281000	5283000	I think that
5283000	5285000	People losing their shit
5285000	5287000	Over a boob is how they are
5287000	5289000	Conditioned to react
5289000	5291000	You know
5291000	5293000	I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii
5293000	5295000	To this but here you go
5295000	5297000	Alright
5297000	5299000	Well you know
5299000	5301000	Actually the same will go for violent video games
5301000	5303000	Alright
5303000	5305000	Let's, sorry I gotta wrap up
5305000	5307000	The hot coffee thing
5307000	5309000	We gotta move on cause we're an hour and a half into the show
5309000	5311000	And not even halfway through our show roll for party
5311000	5313000	You know what I will flip off everybody for fucking free
5313000	5315000	If you wanna you know
5315000	5317000	Pay me at one point
5317000	5319000	Well I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars
5319000	5321000	I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off
5321000	5323000	I'll do it too
5323000	5325000	I can talk to you about bedazzling boobs now
5325000	5327000	Just
5327000	5329000	I hate to say this but Jamie
5329000	5331000	Let's go to the next story
5331000	5333000	Actually I do have to point out to Raginator
5333000	5335000	That they have such a thing as bedazzling
5335000	5337000	Think it over
5337000	5339000	Is exactly what you think it is
5339000	5341000	No thanks
5341000	5343000	So um
5343000	5345000	A lot of us love our LucasArts
5345000	5347000	And a lot of people love Maniac Mansion
5347000	5349000	And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much
5349000	5351000	Like the
5351000	5353000	One of the best LucasArts games
5353000	5355000	Well another reason to be
5355000	5357000	Pissed off at Disney
5357000	5359000	They got rid of LucasArts
5359000	5361000	They also got rid of the game that was 80% complete
5361000	5363000	Hadn't yet been greenlit but it was sort of a dream project
5363000	5365000	For a lot of people
5365000	5367000	And it was a Day of the Tentacle
5367000	5369000	HD remake
5369000	5371000	And we've had a lot of HD remakes come in
5371000	5373000	And you know especially DuckTales
5373000	5375000	And the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion
5375000	5377000	This one I think would have made a lot of people
5377000	5379000	Piss themselves
5379000	5381000	But um
5381000	5383000	With the fall of LucasArts
5383000	5385000	This was one of the games to suffer
5385000	5387000	You know and on top of that too
5387000	5389000	Was they had a Star Wars
5389000	5391000	Smuggler game
5391000	5393000	They had a Death Star Ios game
5393000	5395000	A lot of stuff that was in
5395000	5397000	In process including
5397000	5399000	A Star Wars First Assault
5399000	5401000	So
5401000	5403000	Sad face
5403000	5405000	But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be most
5405000	5407000	Now if I found out there was a Loom game
5407000	5409000	I would have gone out
5409000	5411000	On a rampage
5411000	5413000	I really wish they could have
5413000	5415000	Just like transitioned this or sold it
5415000	5417000	To somebody to finish or something
5417000	5419000	This is really heartbreaking
5419000	5421000	And it's 80% done
5421000	5423000	So just really really sad
5423000	5425000	There was a big
5425000	5427000	Just bringing Gearbox to finish the other 20%
5427000	5429000	What could possibly go wrong
5429000	5431000	There was a big expose on Kotaku about it
5431000	5433000	And so that's where they got the information from
5433000	5435000	Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show
5435000	5437000	Shame on you
5437000	5439000	Sorry but the article actually was legit
5439000	5441000	Fair enough
5441000	5443000	But I mean that being said
5443000	5445000	You know
5445000	5447000	It makes me think
5447000	5449000	About
5449000	5451000	When we have stuff like this
5451000	5453000	Oh god I hate this stupid program
5453000	5455000	When we have
5455000	5457000	You know developers working
5457000	5459000	On games and then just to have
5459000	5461000	It stop oh you're defunded
5461000	5463000	Oh we're closing down your division
5463000	5465000	Imagine the people that are working on this one
5465000	5467000	And they are totally into what they're making
5467000	5469000	Their heart goes into it
5469000	5471000	Imagine just that level of disappointment
5471000	5473000	I'm surprised it didn't leak to the internet
5473000	5475000	Even if it was only 80% done
5475000	5477000	I'm kind of surprised
5477000	5479000	Well keep in mind remember
5479000	5481000	What was it
5481000	5483000	Robotech Crystal Dreams
5483000	5485000	Well
5485000	5487000	One of the developers
5487000	5489000	Put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the
5489000	5491000	Levels
5491000	5493000	And released it
5493000	5495000	A lot of Atari 5200 prototypes
5495000	5497000	Dan and I have gone out and bought
5497000	5499000	They all have fished out the prototypes
5499000	5501000	Made them playable and put them on
5501000	5503000	A repurposed cartridge and sold them
5503000	5505000	I have a ton of
5505000	5507000	There's a
5507000	5509000	NES games, SNES games
5509000	5511000	Basically all these prototypes out
5511000	5513000	Oh here's an example
5513000	5515000	Space Fantasy Zone
5515000	5517000	Complete game
5517000	5519000	Didn't release because of the Sega license
5519000	5521000	But
5521000	5523000	I've got a copy
5523000	5525000	People will find a way to get out what they love
5525000	5527000	So I would actually
5527000	5529000	Be completely
5529000	5531000	Completely happy if someone
5531000	5533000	Decided to be sneaky
5533000	5535000	With code and get that out

5643000	5645000	That's coming out on the 3DS this week
5645000	5647000	And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is
5647000	5649000	It's labeled as an adventure game and it kinda looks like
5649000	5651000	I like the graphics cause it's like an old school
5651000	5653000	PC game in parts kinda mixed
5653000	5655000	With like a newer thing that's mixed with photography
5655000	5657000	I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something
5657000	5659000	But uh maybe like a
5659000	5661000	CSI kinda game but that is uh one of the

5713000	5715000	This thing together which is really unfortunate
5715000	5717000	Because this is a newer mic and was donated
5717000	5719000	So I don't know Well it's looking a little bit more stable
5719000	5721000	According to the recording

5723000	5725000	Unhook and re-hook and I'm just gonna try to hold it

5763000	5765000	It's through email I didn't fucking
5765000	5767000	Get that because I get so much spam

5815000	5817000	Game of the week and this is about uh one of the
5817000	5819000	Few animes I used to watch years and
5819000	5821000	Years ago oh your favorite Rob

5823000	5825000	Yay you know as much as I razz the
5825000	5827000	Series and give Shane a hard time for being such a
5827000	5829000	Fan of the series um you know on Horde House
5829000	5831000	And so forth I actually like legit used
5831000	5833000	To love the old school Pokemon anime
5833000	5835000	Uh uh this is way
5835000	5837000	Back when I was in college I mean this thing is like years
5837000	5839000	Old right? Do you remember when I brought my VCD
5839000	5841000	Of the Japanese version of the movie over?
5841000	5843000	I do I do that was great I remember going
5843000	5845000	To see the first movie in the theater
5845000	5847000	I went with you
5847000	5849000	You saw a later one with me because I
5849000	5851000	Now I went and saw the very first movie with my friend
5851000	5853000	Amanda little old Amanda
5853000	5855000	It's too bad Seg's not listening he knows her very well
5855000	5857000	But Amanda and I went to
5857000	5859000	This this movie the first
5859000	5861000	Movie we were the only people in the largest
5861000	5863000	Auditorium in the theater so what
5863000	5865000	Did we do we were screaming our heads
5865000	5867000	Off mimicking all the Pokemon we
5867000	5869000	Had the we had the best time ever
5869000	5871000	It was so fun but anyway
5871000	5873000	Um the important thing to talk about news
5873000	5875000	Wise is that Pokemon
5875000	5877000	Origins is coming to
5877000	5879000	The west uh this was an anime
5879000	5881000	That is a whopping four episodes long
5881000	5883000	But it will launch on
5883000	5885000	November 15th in the Pokemon
5885000	5887000	TV mobile application
5887000	5889000	This tells the stories of the very
5889000	5891000	First Pokemon games Pokemon red
5891000	5893000	And blue I thought that looked like red
5893000	5895000	From the original uh 96 game boy
5895000	5897000	Or excuse yeah 96 game boy
5897000	5899000	Um the protagonist
5899000	5901000	Named red will travel
5901000	5903000	Through the Kanto region and uh
5903000	5905000	Get into trouble with team rocket
5905000	5907000	Battle his rival and challenge
5907000	5909000	The Pokemon league also Pokemon
5909000	5911000	The movie Genesect and the legend
5911000	5913000	Awakened will air later this month my
5913000	5915000	God how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point
5915000	5917000	They only ever did what like
5917000	5919000	Four of them in theaters I only cared about the
5919000	5921000	First one I know right like well
5921000	5923000	The second movie was also
5923000	5925000	Great because if for nothing else
5925000	5927000	For the line where Jesse and
5927000	5929000	James from team rocket Jesse goes
5929000	5931000	The opposite sex is nothing but trouble
5931000	5933000	And then James goes that's why I stay out of
5933000	5935000	That kind of trouble and
5935000	5937000	Laughed my head off and that happened
5937000	5939000	It's on YouTube somewhere go check it out
5939000	5941000	There you go Pokemon origins
5941000	5943000	I'm kinda I'm kinda thinking
5943000	5945000	I might have to try it we'll see
5945000	5947000	See how much it costs for the record I like
5947000	5949000	Digimon better
5949000	5951000	Okay alright
5951000	5953000	I would say let's travel back to a time when
5953000	5955000	Pokemon wasn't around but
5955000	5957000	There were plenty of Pokemans around for this
5957000	5959000	Yeah thanks to the uh
5959000	5961000	Rule change invoked by dark soccer
5961000	5963000	Last week ten years ago
5963000	5965000	There was still plenty of Pokemans
5965000	5967000	And plenty of classic
5967000	5969000	Classic video games that are as
5969000	5971000	Old as this show Old as balls
5971000	5973000	Are you saying this show is old as balls?
5973000	5975000	Probably
5975000	5977000	Well here it is the classic game of the week
5977000	5979000	Dark Sakura
5979000	5981000	Now that you can rip open the
5981000	5983000	The PlayStation 2 era
5983000	5985000	Even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter you already did
5985000	5987000	When you picked the mosquito game
5987000	5989000	Yes I did I've done other
5989000	5991000	But whatever whatever
5991000	5993000	I've done newer games than this too now that I think about it
5993000	5995000	But here it is the classic game of the week
5995000	5997000	Dark Sakura what did you pick?
5997000	5999000	I'm going with Kingdom Hearts
5999000	6001000	Well thank you I appreciate that
6001000	6003000	And everybody else who bought the HD version
6003000	6005000	Even though I go wait a minute like when this game
6005000	6007000	Came out
6007000	6009000	I remember playing this when it was new
6009000	6011000	And I think we were doing OLR
6011000	6013000	Yes
6013000	6015000	This game came out eleven years ago
6015000	6017000	Oh god
6017000	6019000	I was still in my twenties
6019000	6021000	Because
6021000	6023000	Fuck a bunch of that
6023000	6025000	I love this music by the way
6025000	6027000	It's the Trevor's Tale music
6027000	6029000	I freaking love it
6029000	6031000	So anyway it was
6031000	6033000	Kingdom Hearts
6033000	6035000	And as we know it's an action role playing
6035000	6037000	Game put out by Square at the time
6037000	6039000	Now Squeenix
6039000	6041000	It came out on PS2 in 2002
6041000	6043000	And it was
6043000	6045000	A collaboration between Squeenix
6045000	6047000	And Walt Disney
6047000	6049000	Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around
6049000	6051000	And lots of Disney characters around
6051000	6053000	It's like the two universes had
6053000	6055000	A very cute baby
6055000	6057000	A very cute kind of fucked up baby
6057000	6059000	Um
6059000	6061000	And so this one for Square
6061000	6063000	To have done so many
6063000	6065000	Regular RPGs you know their standard
6065000	6067000	JRPG format
6067000	6069000	This was a little bit of a departure
6069000	6071000	To be a lot more
6071000	6073000	Action oriented
6073000	6075000	And in my case it was a lot more
6075000	6077000	Oh my god Donald
6077000	6079000	Knock the fuck off I don't need healing
6079000	6081000	Just saying that was the common
6081000	6083000	Thing you would hear at my house
6083000	6085000	The really great thing about it too
6085000	6087000	Is that a lot of
6087000	6089000	The character designs were done
6089000	6091000	I'm sorry the
6091000	6093000	Director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura
6093000	6095000	Who had done a lot of the character
6095000	6097000	Design in Square games
6097000	6099000	Had a fantastic
6099000	6101000	Voice cast I mean
6101000	6103000	Even though at the time I think it was
6103000	6105000	Like right at the height of the Haley
6105000	6107000	Joel love
6107000	6109000	And what actually has impressed
6109000	6111000	Me is that he's still voicing Sora
6111000	6113000	He can still make himself sound that young
6113000	6115000	He's you know
6115000	6117000	Aged a bit still kind of a cute
6117000	6119000	Cute dude but
6119000	6121000	I like the fact that he is that
6121000	6123000	Talented as a voice actor that he can
6123000	6125000	Still sound so young
6125000	6127000	Um it had lots of
6127000	6129000	Fun cut scenes I mean you had
6129000	6131000	Your Final Fantasy 8
6131000	6133000	Characters hanging around you had
6133000	6135000	The Sephiroth
6135000	6137000	Thing was pretty fun you had
6137000	6139000	Your
6139000	6141000	Squall hanging out or I'm sorry
6141000	6143000	Lillian Hart
6143000	6145000	And you would get little nods
6145000	6147000	I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs
6147000	6149000	But you get little nods um
6149000	6151000	To other Square games and to
6151000	6153000	Different Disney franchises
6153000	6155000	And it was pretty fun
6155000	6157000	You know and I'm not even going to go much into
6157000	6159000	Kingdom Hearts 2 because you know that of course
6159000	6161000	Like is newer
6161000	6163000	It had the Tron level which was amazing
6163000	6165000	But
6165000	6167000	This game was just awesome except for the
6167000	6169000	Gummy ship which was like my least favorite part
6169000	6171000	I hated navigating the gummy ship
6171000	6173000	And I kept saying why is it a gummy ship
6173000	6175000	When there's no gummy bears
6175000	6177000	I mean hello
6177000	6179000	So as far as
6179000	6181000	You know your characters you've got
6181000	6183000	The main character Sora you have his buddy
6183000	6185000	Riku and uh Kairi
6185000	6187000	And
6187000	6189000	And for the record
6189000	6191000	At depth I knew how to set up Donald and he was
6191000	6193000	Still a ship
6193000	6195000	So basically you
6195000	6197000	Team up with Donald and Goofy
6197000	6199000	To find King Mickey
6199000	6201000	And uh your main character
6201000	6203000	Is the main uh
6203000	6205000	Antagonist as Ansem and the Heartless
6205000	6207000	So
6207000	6209000	This game has spawned so much wank
6209000	6211000	So much wank
6211000	6213000	But other characters that show up in there I mean
6213000	6215000	You've got um
6215000	6217000	You know 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest
6217000	6219000	You have um
6219000	6221000	You know major Disney villains in the game
6221000	6223000	You've got you can summon different
6223000	6225000	Characters too like you have the genie
6225000	6227000	You have Tinkerbell you have Simba from the Lion King
6227000	6229000	Other characters that you ran into
6229000	6231000	From square games you have Tidus and Waka
6231000	6233000	And Selphie and you have
6233000	6235000	Like I said Squall you have Aerith
6235000	6237000	What the fuck was she doing in the game?
6237000	6239000	Cid and Yuffie um
6239000	6241000	Not dying much to your dismay
6241000	6243000	I know. Riku from Final Fantasy
6243000	6245000	Uh 10 was supposed to show up
6245000	6247000	But was replaced by Yuffie
6247000	6249000	Um you have the Cloud and Sephiroth
6249000	6251000	Uh showdown in the Olympus Coliseum
6251000	6253000	So much really good stuff
6253000	6255000	And the story itself is so rich
6255000	6257000	That they seem to really
6257000	6259000	Plan on there being more than one
6259000	6261000	You know they were really looking ahead
6261000	6263000	But um
6265000	6267000	I just I can't say enough good about this game
6267000	6269000	It was really amazing
6269000	6271000	And basically
6271000	6273000	The way that this came about
6273000	6275000	Was that there was a discussion
6275000	6277000	Between Shinji Hashimoto
6277000	6279000	And um Sakaguchi
6279000	6281000	About Mario 64
6281000	6283000	Where they wanted to do like a three
6283000	6285000	Dimensional movement
6285000	6287000	Um but they said they could only
6287000	6289000	The only way to rival a Mario game would be
6289000	6291000	To have Disney behind it
6291000	6293000	And Nomura overheard the conversation
6293000	6295000	And actually
6295000	6297000	Uh led the way to start
6297000	6299000	Building the game and then there was
6299000	6301000	A meeting between Hashimoto and a
6301000	6303000	Disney executive
6303000	6305000	In an elevator
6305000	6307000	Where they were in the same building in Japan
6307000	6309000	And magic was made
6309000	6311000	So they brought it together
6311000	6313000	It's got fantastic
6313000	6315000	Music, fantastic voice cast
6315000	6317000	Both and I have to say
6317000	6319000	Both the um the English voice cast
6319000	6321000	And the Japanese voice cast
6321000	6323000	Were top notch after
6323000	6325000	Hearing them in both
6325000	6327000	And then getting Utada Hikaru to do
6327000	6329000	Um the uh main song
6329000	6331000	Both in uh Japanese and English
6331000	6333000	Although honestly I think the Japanese version is
6333000	6335000	Better I think there was a lot more production value
6335000	6337000	Um
6337000	6339000	And like there's some of the voice cast that they
6339000	6341000	Couldn't get for the American one like um
6341000	6343000	They couldn't get Robin Williams
6343000	6345000	They had um
6345000	6347000	I can never pronounce this guys name properly
6347000	6349000	Dan Castellaneta
6349000	6351000	Uh he's Homer Simpson yeah
6351000	6353000	Yeah I can never pronounce this
6353000	6355000	Castaneda or something like that
6355000	6357000	Billy Zane and David Bourne
6357000	6359000	Well they got the guy who plays
6359000	6361000	A really down on himself
6361000	6363000	Guy to play another really down on himself guy
6363000	6365000	I think though that isn't he also the voice
6365000	6367000	Though in like the second and third movies
6367000	6369000	He was in the TV show
6369000	6371000	Because after Robin Williams had the falling out
6371000	6373000	With uh Disney over
6373000	6375000	Aladdin uh he stepped
6375000	6377000	In and did the voice uh Robin Williams
6377000	6379000	Came back and did the third movie though
6379000	6381000	When they all kissed and made up
6383000	6385000	At any rate you know
6385000	6387000	They got really
6387000	6389000	Really top level voice talent
6389000	6391000	I mean sometimes when you get an RPG
6391000	6393000	In Japan
6393000	6395000	They'll have top notch voice actors
6395000	6397000	Behind it there but we won't
6397000	6399000	Get as big names there this is
6399000	6401000	Probably one of the first to have really
6401000	6403000	Significant talent
6403000	6405000	Put into a game you know
6405000	6407000	I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it
6407000	6409000	You'd expect them to put in that kind of
6409000	6411000	Uh production value
6411000	6413000	And I don't think anybody
6413000	6415000	Was disappointed by this game if anybody
6415000	6417000	Was then they're wrong
6417000	6419000	I can see though when you put it next
6419000	6421000	To Kingdom Hearts 2
6421000	6423000	Kingdom Hearts 2 was you know fixed a lot of
6423000	6425000	Problems with the first one with the camera
6425000	6427000	And so forth
6427000	6429000	And this was um stated
6429000	6431000	As um the runner up
6431000	6433000	For the PS2 um
6433000	6435000	Best game of 2002 reader's choice award
6435000	6437000	Let's see what the first one was
6437000	6439000	Um
6439000	6441000	Gamepro said that the battle system
6441000	6443000	Was like the N64 Zelda games which
6443000	6445000	Honestly I thought was really good
6445000	6447000	And then there were actually
6447000	6449000	Plenty of comments um compliments
6449000	6451000	For the AI with Donald and
6451000	6453000	Goofy and it really was very
6453000	6455000	Customizable I would just always get irritated
6455000	6457000	Because sometimes Donald would do shit
6457000	6459000	The wrong time it doesn't get any better in the HD
6459000	6461000	Version just letting you know
6461000	6463000	Donald's still his stupid head but there's um
6463000	6465000	The final mix that came out that had
6465000	6467000	Um a little bit
6467000	6469000	More stuff thrown in and there was also another
6469000	6471000	Side another story the deep dive
6471000	6473000	That had uh
6473000	6475000	Bonus stuff that you would get um
6475000	6477000	There's a manga around it
6477000	6479000	There you know like you said there was the uh
6479000	6481000	The uh HD version
6481000	6483000	And there's all kinds
6483000	6485000	Of side games that have spawned
6485000	6487000	From this that are all a rich
6487000	6489000	Part of this world that's been created
6489000	6491000	Around the game so
6491000	6493000	I really like
6493000	6495000	When you have something
6495000	6497000	Big come out and then
6497000	6499000	Have it be a success
6499000	6501000	And then have such a really
6501000	6503000	Beautiful story around the whole thing
6503000	6505000	And there's still a lot we don't know
6505000	6507000	Like you remember how everyone went oh shit
6507000	6509000	When everyone saw you know
6509000	6511000	Riku blindfolded in the
6511000	6513000	Organization outfit and everyone was like ahh
6513000	6515000	And then the little ending for
6515000	6517000	Two where everyone was in the whole
6517000	6519000	Keyblade graveyard
6519000	6521000	I saw an amazing Google doc
6521000	6523000	That was like 50 pages long that was trying to
6523000	6525000	Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts
6525000	6527000	And I was like and it's for kids
6527000	6529000	But it spawned that much
6529000	6531000	Fan involvement and when you've got
6531000	6533000	When you can build
6533000	6535000	A dedicated fan base like that
6535000	6537000	You know you've really got something important
6537000	6539000	And special so
6539000	6541000	Kingdom Hearts is really I think one of the
6541000	6543000	First games that
6543000	6545000	Spot several different levels of fandom
6545000	6547000	Together and I think
6547000	6549000	That's a pretty monumental event too because
6549000	6551000	Usually fandoms are like bitch please
6551000	6553000	Alright
6553000	6555000	Well there it is guys your classic game of the week
6555000	6557000	Kingdom Hearts
6557000	6559000	On the Playstation 2 but of course as we all
6559000	6561000	Know now on the Playstation 3
6561000	6563000	With the whole HD version which
6563000	6565000	In our chat room ShadowNextGen points
6565000	6567000	Out Rob I heard they fixed the
6567000	6569000	Camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD
6569000	6571000	Remix on Playstation 3
6571000	6573000	It's better but I still get frustrated with it
6573000	6575000	To be honest but I gotta
6575000	6577000	Admit Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner
6577000	6579000	Since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy 14
6579000	6581000	Now that I finally hit end game and maybe that'll
6581000	6583000	Calm down a little bit I'm hoping to go
6583000	6585000	Back and play more Kingdom Hearts
6585000	6587000	And another good thing is that I have to
6587000	6589000	Say that it gave Utada Hikaru
6589000	6591000	Some really really good exposure
6591000	6593000	Here in the US
6593000	6595000	She's had several albums now in the US
6595000	6597000	Two
6597000	6599000	Well I think she had two and then an EP
6599000	6601000	I don't think so I think it was just the
6601000	6603000	One that Timbaland produced and then
6603000	6605000	The comeback to me
6605000	6607000	Her best of from Japan is on the US store
6607000	6609000	Ah that might be what it is
6609000	6611000	But at any rate I freaking love her voice
6613000	6615000	Alright there you go the classic game of the week
6615000	6617000	We're running long tonight so we're gonna
6617000	6619000	Go right into our break don't go anywhere guys
6619000	6621000	Though we'll be back with plenty more of
6621000	6623000	Orange Lounge Radio right after this
6629000	6631000	Welcome back everybody to
6631000	6633000	Orange Lounge Radio
6633000	6635000	Live on this Sunday night
6635000	6637000	September the 29th of 2013
6637000	6639000	The 521st
6639000	6641000	Episode of our show already in
6641000	6643000	Progress and unfortunately
6643000	6645000	Those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to
6645000	6647000	Hear the music that we play during the break while we
6647000	6649000	Get up and stretch and refill our drinks
6649000	6651000	And so forth during the break but we had
6651000	6653000	A fun little background medley from
6653000	6655000	Kid Icarus that played in the break there and it just
6655000	6657000	Reminded me how much I love the music
6657000	6659000	In Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood
6659000	6661000	Even though that game is fucking hard
6661000	6663000	It is fucking hard but I still
6663000	6665000	Like to go back and play it once now
6665000	6667000	I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one
6667000	6669000	Sitting but I can at least get through the
6669000	6671000	First world terror danger horror
6671000	6673000	You picked up Uprising right?
6673000	6675000	I did
6675000	6677000	You know and that game like hurt my hand
6677000	6679000	So much to play I never really made
6679000	6681000	A lot of progress in that I enjoyed it
6681000	6683000	But I kind of wish they would do it on Wii U
6683000	6685000	That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U
6685000	6687000	Didn't they say they originally had
6687000	6689000	A console version
6689000	6691000	Yeah they had a Wii U version
6691000	6693000	Alright
6693000	6695000	Well anyway let's get into some rapid
6695000	6697000	Fire gaming news and talk about some
6697000	6699000	Things that will be happening unlike
6699000	6701000	Kid Icarus on Wii U
6701000	6703000	So there was an ARG
6703000	6705000	That was tied with Surgeon Simulator
6705000	6707000	That has now finally been cracked
6707000	6709000	It was a secret code that you would put
6709000	6711000	In the zero gravity surgery
6711000	6713000	Mission
6713000	6715000	And you would get sucked outside of your
6715000	6717000	Ship and now you have
6717000	6719000	A brand new set
6719000	6721000	Of surgeries you could do on an alien
6721000	6723000	In zero gravity with alien
6723000	6725000	Tools and they have you do all
6725000	6727000	Sorts of like weird
6727000	6729000	Sorts of like gobble shaft
6729000	6731000	Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a gobble
6731000	6733000	Shaft
6733000	6735000	It's pretty funny
6735000	6737000	So check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator
6737000	6739000	There's actually videos out there that show you what the access code
6739000	6741000	Is and you can do all that
6743000	6745000	So yeah and then of course
6745000	6747000	There's the second season
6747000	6749000	Of Mortal Kombat Legacy
6749000	6751000	Ten episodes
6751000	6753000	I guess they were all released at one time
6753000	6755000	It's being hosted by Machinima
6755000	6757000	If you may remember it was that live action
6757000	6759000	Series that came out around the time that
6759000	6761000	The last Mortal Kombat game came out
6761000	6763000	And so yeah if you want to check it out
6763000	6765000	It's on YouTube, Machinima
6765000	6767000	And ten episodes for
6767000	6769000	Your digestion
6769000	6771000	And last but not least
6771000	6773000	Rockstar put out some information about
6773000	6775000	Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this
6775000	6777000	Tuesday on the first
6777000	6779000	Well bumpy launching on the first
6779000	6781000	May or may not launch on the first
6781000	6783000	Launching in an MMO sense
6783000	6785000	Will be stable by mid-October
6785000	6787000	Yeah um okay so
6787000	6789000	Basically they were talking about some of the stuff
6789000	6791000	And answered some of the rumors that were going around
6791000	6793000	Confirming that there will be
6795000	6797000	Not really microtransactions but there will be
6797000	6799000	Some sort of online transactions to purchase
6799000	6801000	In-game money so they have that
6801000	6803000	However they prefaced
6803000	6805000	That with you will be able to play
6805000	6807000	The game and it's been balanced for
6807000	6809000	People playing you know the game
6809000	6811000	Regularly and you won't actually have to buy money
6811000	6813000	If you don't want to but if you want to just
6813000	6815000	Get ahead you know buy your fast
6815000	6817000	Cars and better weapons and
6817000	6819000	Crib or whatever
6819000	6821000	By all means go ahead and do that
6821000	6823000	Some of the stuff that they announced that
6823000	6825000	They're going to be doing with that
6825000	6827000	They're going to be
6827000	6829000	Including some different
6829000	6831000	I guess activities
6831000	6833000	Jobs they have
6833000	6835000	Sports you can do you know tennis
6835000	6837000	And all that kind of stuff that's normally in the game
6837000	6839000	Also
6839000	6841000	They're going to be putting out some free
6841000	6843000	Content at launch
6843000	6845000	The content creators for deathmatches and races
6845000	6847000	Also a beach bum pack
6847000	6849000	Which is going to have 300 items
6849000	6851000	Like you know
6851000	6853000	Customization items for your
6853000	6855000	Characters as well as
6855000	6857000	I guess
6857000	6859000	Weapons
6859000	6861000	Capture the flag is going to be coming back
6861000	6863000	And they're also going to have a content creator
6863000	6865000	For that and they'll be
6865000	6867000	Introducing heists
6867000	6869000	So that's going to be pretty sweet
6869000	6871000	And 700 missions
6871000	6873000	I think is what they teased before
6873000	6875000	Are going to be available online
6875000	6877000	Compare that to 69
6877000	6879000	That are in the single player game
6879000	6881000	That's pretty significant
6881000	6883000	And
6883000	6885000	People have actually dug through the files
6885000	6887000	And a couple things that have been confirmed
6887000	6889000	Of course they have
6889000	6891000	Drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well
6891000	6893000	As betting on horses at the track
6893000	6895000	So
6896000	6898000	Hurray do you get to whip the horses though
6898000	6899000	Like you do in derby owners club
6899000	6900000	I don't know about that
6900000	6901000	That's a game I haven't played in forever
6901000	6902000	I miss that game
6902000	6904000	Seriously I mentioned again
6904000	6906000	We do have the vog network crew
6906000	6907000	That you can join
6907000	6908000	You can go check out the forums
6908000	6909000	We have the link to that
6909000	6910000	Otherwise I believe it's
6910000	6912000	socialclub.rockstargames.com
6912000	6914000	Slash
6914000	6916000	Crews slash vog network
6916000	6918000	Alright sounds like if you search for
6918000	6919000	Vog network you'll find
6919000	6920000	You'll probably find yeah
6920000	6921000	Vog network or the
6921000	6922000	I don't know if you can search by the
6922000	6924000	The four letter initials we have
6924000	6926000	Vog N
6926000	6928000	Sounds good
6928000	6930000	Traveling around to some other news
6930000	6932000	In kind of the WTF department
6932000	6934000	There's a really weird promotion
6934000	6936000	Between the developers flying wild hog
6936000	6938000	And volition
6938000	6940000	Because of I guess the publishers devolver
6940000	6941000	Digital and deep silver
6941000	6942000	But there's a cross promotion between
6942000	6944000	Shadow warrior and saints row 4
6944000	6946000	What is said promotion
6946000	6947000	Why I'm so glad you asked
6947000	6949000	Because in shadow warrior
6949000	6951000	You will be able to unlock
6951000	6953000	If you own saints row 4
6953000	6955000	And you own shadow warrior on steam
6955000	6957000	You'll unlock the penetrator weapon
6957000	6959000	In shadow warrior
6959000	6961000	That's right the purple dildo bat will be yours
6961000	6963000	To slaughter the enemies
6963000	6965000	I love that it has balls
6965000	6967000	In the ancient japan setting
6967000	6969000	That is shadow warrior
6969000	6971000	You play a character named wang
6971000	6973000	So I mean it's fitting
6973000	6975000	I know it's just silly
6975000	6977000	But you know anything involving
6977000	6979000	Saints row usually is
6979000	6981000	I'm just completely
6981000	6983000	Unused that it has balls
6985000	6987000	Do you want me to bring up the balls again
6987000	6989000	So you can giggle some more
6989000	6991000	I'll have you know though
6991000	6993000	It only had balls
6993000	6995000	Over here in this region
6995000	6997000	And in europe
6997000	6999000	It did not have balls in japan
6999000	7001000	Where I believe it was censored
7001000	7003000	And it didn't have the wiggle physics
7003000	7005000	In japan either
7005000	7007000	So silly what they have to change
7007000	7009000	From region to region
7009000	7011000	Almost everyone try a game like
7011000	7013000	Rocksmith 2014 which of course
7013000	7015000	Is the newest rocksmith game
7015000	7017000	More of a cult level music game
7017000	7019000	Because it's not pushing
7019000	7021000	Plastic buttons to instruments
7021000	7023000	Well I guess it is in a way
7023000	7025000	But you're actually learning to play
7025000	7027000	The actual guitars
7027000	7029000	It's kind of what sets rocksmith apart
7029000	7031000	So it definitely has it's following
7031000	7033000	If you weren't already aware
7033000	7035000	There is a new version coming this year
7035000	7037000	It's rocksmith 2014
7038000	7040000	There is a guitarcade
7040000	7042000	Which was also in the first rocksmith game
7042000	7044000	But you play games
7044000	7046000	That are retro inspired
7046000	7048000	For example there is a game like ducks redo
7048000	7050000	Which is basically galaga
7050000	7052000	But it can't actually be galaga
7052000	7054000	Because Ubisoft didn't make galaga
7054000	7056000	So you know there is all those issues there
7056000	7058000	Some of the other guitarcade items
7058000	7060000	Excuse me games that are available for playing
7060000	7062000	Scale racers
7062000	7064000	And gone wailing
7064000	7066000	In scale racers you will master scales
7066000	7068000	Avoiding traffic in a police car chase
7068000	7070000	And gone wailing will
7070000	7072000	Make you play louder or quieter
7072000	7074000	To elevate characters
7074000	7076000	And collect coins
7076000	7078000	And lastly there is return to castle
7078000	7080000	Core dead
7080000	7082000	Which is a first person shooter
7082000	7084000	Where you strum chords to kill enemies
7084000	7086000	Cute I like that
7086000	7088000	That's very similar to this
7088000	7090000	Not very popular game that came out
7090000	7092000	For the guitar hero controller
7092000	7094000	It was rock of the dead
7094000	7096000	I saw that the last E3 I went to
7096000	7098000	Anyway
7098000	7100000	I like that they use cute little arcade
7100000	7102000	Games as kind of like a way to
7102000	7104000	Make the game a little more
7104000	7106000	Gamey I guess as opposed to
7106000	7108000	A tutorial or what have you
7108000	7110000	That's pretty cool
7110000	7112000	It almost does make me want to learn to play guitar
7112000	7114000	Just a little bit
7114000	7116000	I know I have room in my house
7116000	7118000	For this and I will probably pick this up
7118000	7120000	At some point
7120000	7122000	It's Ubisoft's Just Dance 2014
7122000	7124000	The song list is out for the game
7124000	7126000	For Just Dance 2014
7126000	7128000	You have a lot of newer favorites
7128000	7130000	Like Applause by Lady Gaga
7130000	7132000	Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj
7132000	7134000	Gentlemen by Psy
7134000	7136000	That's a good song
7136000	7138000	Let's see even Ricky Martin's back
7138000	7140000	With Maria, Where Have You Been?
7140000	7142000	By Rihanna
7142000	7144000	Oh god that horrible
7144000	7146000	Blurred line song by Robin Thicke
7146000	7148000	That song needs to be removed from everything ever
7148000	7150000	He needs to be removed from everything ever
7150000	7152000	It's just a bad song
7152000	7154000	In better news, Flash Dance
7154000	7156000	What a Feelin' by The Girly Team
7156000	7158000	Sadly it's a cover
7158000	7160000	YMCA is there
7160000	7162000	Attention Beliebers
7162000	7164000	The Will.I.Am song
7164000	7166000	That Power, which features Justin Bieber
7166000	7168000	Is in there too
7168000	7170000	Gamebooey.org will be happy to know
7170000	7172000	Kesha is in the game with Come On
7172000	7174000	I do love Kesha
7174000	7176000	Kesha is so fun
7176000	7178000	In such a guilty pleasure way
7178000	7180000	For those of you that like more basic singers
7180000	7182000	Katy Perry is in the game with
7182000	7184000	I Kissed a Girl
7184000	7186000	And if you like your musicals
7186000	7188000	Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game
7188000	7190000	What the fuck? That's random
7190000	7192000	How random is that?
7192000	7194000	Like a holdover from Just Dance Disney
7194000	7196000	I have no idea
7196000	7198000	And one of the songs
7198000	7200000	of the summer, Get Lucky
7200000	7202000	by Daft Punk
7202000	7204000	Everybody likes that song
7204000	7206000	I like this song, David Guetta with
7206000	7208000	Wolf falling to pieces
7208000	7210000	But you know what? All of these songs
7210000	7212000	All of them, shit
7212000	7214000	They are trumped
7214000	7216000	They are just nothing
7216000	7218000	With the inclusion of this song
7218000	7220000	Gimme, gimme, gimme
7220000	7222000	A Man After Midnight by ABBA
7222000	7224000	It's all you need, fuck the rest of it
7224000	7226000	Fuck the rest of it
7226000	7228000	End quote
7228000	7230000	I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it
7230000	7232000	Nope
7232000	7234000	I can't
7234000	7236000	Unfortunately, Dark Sakura, ABBA
7236000	7238000	Trumps that song
7238000	7240000	I have to, sorry
7240000	7242000	Think about it
7242000	7244000	If you think about it, Dark Sakura
7244000	7246000	I don't think ABBA could even
7246000	7248000	Now Rob, Rob
7248000	7250000	What?
7250000	7252000	Did you ever pick up ABBA, You Could Dance for the Wii?
7252000	7254000	I did
7254000	7256000	You should have seen Rob
7256000	7258000	do freaking ballerina spins
7258000	7260000	I wish I had
7260000	7262000	I wish I had been recording it
7262000	7264000	Because Rob's like, I've got the ABBA game
7264000	7266000	You need to come over
7266000	7268000	And I'm sitting back in this chair
7268000	7270000	That no one can see me point to
7270000	7272000	Except for us in this room
7272000	7274000	Thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing
7274000	7276000	Like that was a couple years ago
7276000	7278000	And Rob's like, look what I got
7278000	7280000	And I did the winner takes it all
7280000	7282000	For Jamie
7282000	7284000	I don't want to talk
7284000	7286000	Oh and remember you bringing
7286000	7288000	Singstar ABBA over to my house when
7288000	7290000	Tiara was over?
7290000	7292000	There right next to Singstar Queen
7292000	7294000	That is like the best shelf in my entire house
7296000	7298000	Rob you're so cute
7298000	7300000	I'm just saying
7300000	7302000	But remember it was
7302000	7304000	You, me and Tiara playing
7304000	7306000	Singstar ABBA
7306000	7308000	And you made me sing
7308000	7310000	I miss her
7310000	7312000	She's in Arlington now
7312000	7314000	Well I still miss her
7314000	7316000	Yeah it's really hard to hit that far away
7316000	7318000	Alright also
7318000	7320000	Just going to throw this out there
7320000	7322000	Another quick little thing for Just Dance 2014
7322000	7324000	Which apparently also includes One Direction
7324000	7326000	But anyway
7326000	7328000	That's not what I wanted to say
7328000	7330000	What I want to say is that the 2014 bundle for the Wii U
7330000	7332000	Will come packaged with a Wii Remote Plus
7332000	7334000	Which is interesting
7334000	7336000	Because you know
7336000	7338000	It's the Wii U
7338000	7340000	Yet it's a Wii peripheral
7340000	7342000	But if you think about the way Just Dance works
7342000	7344000	It's not like you're going to be sitting there with a game pad
7344000	7346000	Dancing to Gimme Gimme Gimme
7346000	7348000	Also because if you buy a Wii U
7348000	7350000	System you technically
7350000	7352000	Could get away with not having a Wii Remote
7352000	7354000	Because you might be playing games with a game pad
7354000	7356000	I don't have a Wii Remote Plus
7356000	7358000	I never
7358000	7360000	And the game does require it
7360000	7362000	I'm going to get shit for this but I never played Skyward Sword
7362000	7364000	So I didn't have one
7364000	7366000	Neither have I
7366000	7368000	And the game does require it so yeah that's why
7368000	7370000	Exactly
7370000	7372000	So you can get that for 70 bucks
7372000	7374000	The bundle that has all of that
7374000	7376000	You can get the game separately for $40
7376000	7378000	If you have
7378000	7380000	Wow they significantly reduced the price
7380000	7382000	Oh wait no they didn't
7382000	7384000	It's actually a full price controller so fuck them
7384000	7386000	Just buy a used one seriously
7386000	7388000	Oh you, alright
7388000	7390000	Dark Soccer what do you have for us?
7390000	7392000	Not Abba
7392000	7394000	Well
7394000	7396000	For the Super Smash Brothers
7396000	7398000	Roster we have a new addition
7398000	7400000	We have Wind Waker Link
7400000	7402000	And all of his adorable cuteness
7402000	7404000	And I believe he's
7404000	7406000	Going to be on both versions
7406000	7408000	Also with his adult incarnation
7408000	7410000	As well
7410000	7412000	So fun
7412000	7414000	Mighty No. 9 is also coming out
7414000	7416000	For the Vita and the 3DS
7416000	7418000	It basically reached the goals
7418000	7420000	For those so you know what
7420000	7422000	If I get it I'll get it on 3DS
7422000	7424000	I don't think it's reached those goals yet
7424000	7426000	Well no
7426000	7428000	When it reached 3.5 million
7428000	7430000	But it's pretty close I think
7430000	7432000	I don't know they've only got two days left
7432000	7434000	They might not hit it
7434000	7436000	I still haven't put in money yet though
7436000	7438000	I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there
7438000	7440000	And in other news
7440000	7442000	Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack
7442000	7444000	It's coming
7444000	7446000	There's a listing for
7446000	7448000	The
7448000	7450000	Let's see, Rockman X
7450000	7452000	Soundbox on Rakuten
7452000	7454000	So it looks like it's gonna
7454000	7456000	Be out for wow it's expensive
7456000	7458000	12,600 yen so basically
7458000	7460000	27 bucks
7460000	7462000	A lot of money. Someone get that for me and rip it
7462000	7464000	No
7464000	7466000	Yes
7466000	7468000	Actually I have a game on my list Rob
7468000	7470000	That I need to have
7470000	7472000	Shut up phone
7472000	7474000	Rob is playing with his phone
7474000	7476000	During the show everybody
7476000	7478000	There's like a lot of people out there
7478000	7480000	That still don't realize I do a show
7480000	7482000	On Sunday nights
7482000	7484000	My mom knows I do a show on
7484000	7486000	Sunday
7486000	7488000	Anyway
7488000	7490000	Moving on let's go to the FUGL question of the week
7490000	7492000	Every week we go to our Facebook
7492000	7494000	Community and our Google Plus community
7494000	7496000	And if you slam those words together you get
7496000	7498000	FUGL and it's the
7498000	7500000	FUGL question of the week
7500000	7502000	Except I don't have my music
7502000	7504000	Where's my music?
7504000	7506000	Dark Soccer you took my music
7506000	7508000	No
7508000	7510000	That's not good
7510000	7512000	I didn't take your, I did not, Rob
7512000	7514000	Rob Rob Rob
7514000	7516000	I'm so prepared. See getting these messages

7520000	7522000	I didn't do shit
7522000	7524000	You don't know shit
7524000	7526000	You know what we need to sit down and watch showgirls
7526000	7528000	With a bunch of crap food
7528000	7530000	We do. Good times
7530000	7532000	Anyhow, here we go
7532000	7534000	Did you find it yet? Yes I found my bumper. Here we go
7534000	7540000	Here it is
7540000	7542000	The FUGL question of the week
7542000	7544000	We went with the obvious this week
7544000	7546000	With a lot of folks talking about the steam machine
7546000	7548000	And all the related stuff
7548000	7550000	What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?
7550000	7552000	Steam OS, Steam Machine and the Steam Controller
7552000	7554000	Let's start with Andy R
7554000	7556000	Who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid
7556000	7558000	But I do want to try it
7558000	7560000	And I'm pretty happy with my current PC
7560000	7562000	I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me
7562000	7564000	I'll wait until we have more concrete details
7564000	7566000	Machine specs, prices and so on
7566000	7568000	Until I pass further judgement
7568000	7570000	Signed up for the beta thingy though
7570000	7572000	At least a passing interest
7572000	7574000	Tigerclaw says I think Steam OS is perfect
7574000	7576000	For those that like to build a home theater
7576000	7578000	And PC in a small form factor
7578000	7580000	With a good graphics card
7580000	7582000	And play their Steam games on the HDTV
7582000	7584000	That presents a lot of opportunities
7584000	7586000	And there are those that want to play those Steam games
7586000	7588000	But don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig
7588000	7590000	The Steam Machine will be perfect for first time PC gamers
7590000	7592000	It'll be interesting to see what they can do
7592000	7594000	With the Steam Controller
7594000	7596000	The fact that it has no thumbsticks
7596000	7598000	But uses touchpad technology
7598000	7600000	That the controls are given the tech is the kind
7600000	7602000	You'd find in laptops
7602000	7604000	Which is often not very responsive
7604000	7606000	Excuse me, responsive to touch
7606000	7608000	Katsuhiko J says
7608000	7610000	The controller is something different for a change
7610000	7612000	I need to try it before I pass judgement
7612000	7614000	Who knows, it could be the next best thing
7614000	7616000	Valve made a bold move this past week
7616000	7618000	I'm interested in their OS
7618000	7620000	Chris C says
7620000	7622000	I think spec wise
7622000	7624000	The hardware of the Steam Console would have to be on par
7624000	7626000	If not more powerful
7626000	7628000	Than current consoles to pique my interest
7628000	7630000	I like consoles because
7630000	7632000	Games are tailored to the specific console
7632000	7634000	And no major tweaks have to be made
7634000	7636000	To get a seamless experience
7636000	7638000	If the specs beat out the Playstation 4's
7638000	7640000	I might be sold
7640000	7642000	Red The Haze left us with this too long didn't read version
7642000	7644000	But you can read his full answer on Facebook
7644000	7646000	It says
7646000	7648000	It will unify hardware manufacturers and software devs
7648000	7650000	To make similar specs
7650000	7652000	Which will mean better products for the consumers
7652000	7654000	Hmm, I like that perspective
7654000	7656000	Ciel says
7656000	7658000	The Steam OS has my interest
7658000	7660000	I'm not much of a controller
7660000	7662000	I'm not much of a controller, I think I'm a controller person
7662000	7664000	But I'd like to give it a shot
7664000	7666000	The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices
7666000	7668000	The Steam Machines may have multiple price models
7668000	7670000	The OS is free
7670000	7672000	But surely they have an ideal on the controllers
7672000	7674000	I can't shut up and give you my money Gabe
7674000	7676000	If you don't tell me how much you desire
7676000	7678000	It's like the third person I've seen say
7678000	7680000	We need a price
7680000	7682000	Unfolded Raptor said
7682000	7684000	I'm not being involved with the Steam Machine
7684000	7686000	Nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS
7686000	7688000	So no sell for me
7688000	7690000	Yet
7690000	7692000	Ragenator says
7692000	7694000	It's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game
7694000	7696000	Given that I don't know too much on the stuff
7696000	7698000	I did see a picture of the controller
7698000	7700000	My initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd
7700000	7702000	But hey, if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box
7702000	7704000	And give it a try
7704000	7706000	I may end up liking it
7706000	7708000	Andrew G says
7708000	7710000	That's actually 23rd Magus
7710000	7712000	Working
7712000	7714000	Well, he needs to work his way on over here
7714000	7716000	To a Sunday night show
7716000	7718000	The Gabe Cube
7718000	7720000	The Gabe Cube looks promising
7720000	7722000	For those who would rather not self build
7722000	7724000	But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles
7724000	7726000	Time will tell
7726000	7728000	Some of the answers here from PeegerJunior92 says
7728000	7732000	I think it's a logical step forward for Valve
7732000	7734000	And they seem to have a number of the important points
7734000	7736000	That users were hoping for
7736000	7738000	The controller is definitely a new concept
7738000	7740000	And something that people will have to get their hands on
7740000	7742000	To really understand how it will work
7742000	7744000	My biggest qualm is that there was no reason
7744000	7746000	For this to be a drawn out three stage announcement
7746000	7748000	It would have been a great all in one announcement
7748000	7750000	And people would have been happy
7750000	7752000	CodeMan says
7752000	7756000	Honestly, it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do
7756000	7758000	And yes, it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC
7758000	7760000	But I'm not sold yet
7760000	7764000	I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party
7764000	7766000	And Eddie K says
7766000	7770000	If Half Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console
7770000	7772000	I'm not buying one
7772000	7774000	And let's see
7774000	7776000	Going to Google Plus
7776000	7778000	We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week
7778000	7780000	We usually don't have this many
7780000	7782000	Let me start with Travis H who says
7782000	7784000	Speechless with excitement
7784000	7786000	Flaco Jones says
7786000	7788000	I think SteamOS is cool but as for the Steam Machine itself
7788000	7790000	There was nothing to convince me I should buy that
7790000	7792000	Instead of just running SteamOS on my PC
7792000	7794000	As a partition or however it would work
7794000	7796000	The controller looks like it would not work for me
7796000	7798000	Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play
7798000	7800000	ActDef says
7800000	7802000	Anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page
7802000	7804000	And the family sharing option
7804000	7806000	Well, need to use logic more
7806000	7808000	Alright, hold on ActDef
7808000	7810000	That is so easy to say in retrospect
7810000	7814000	But why didn't you call the 1, 2, 3 last week then, huh?
7814000	7816000	I could see at least the SteamBox
7816000	7818000	And maybe the SteamOS
7818000	7820000	Yeah, I kind of thought that the SteamBox announcement
7820000	7822000	Would have been kind of combined with
7822000	7824000	Actually, like they said before
7824000	7826000	It pretty much could have been all one announcement
7826000	7828000	You didn't really need to separate
7828000	7830000	Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said
7830000	7832000	It could have just been all one
7832000	7834000	But anyway, my opinion about the whole thing
7834000	7836000	Is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this
7836000	7838000	They're making the Steam Machine pretty much an entertainment console
7838000	7840000	Like the Xbox One and the Playstation 4
7840000	7842000	And since they're developing their own OS for it
7842000	7844000	And yeah, I know it's Linux based
7844000	7846000	But still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff
7846000	7848000	And cost effective too
7848000	7850000	Not to mention being able to stream all your library
7850000	7852000	In case your game doesn't support Linux
7852000	7856000	Going over to Evel, E3VL says
7856000	7858000	From what I see, the SteamOS
7858000	7860000	Is basically countering Windows
7860000	7862000	As in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system
7862000	7864000	Like Apple's App Store
7864000	7866000	SteamOS is essentially an open system
7866000	7868000	Like Google Android
7868000	7870000	Very interesting comparison
7870000	7872000	Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now
7872000	7874000	No one needs PC laptops in the future
7874000	7876000	Aside for gaming
7876000	7878000	SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs
7878000	7880000	In the future
7880000	7882000	The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability
7882000	7884000	Current PC gamers may adopt it
7884000	7886000	But Steam is lending out the OS for third party vendors
7886000	7888000	To create Steam Machines
7888000	7890000	It might be a problem and quite possibly a huge gamble
7890000	7892000	Depending on how their hardware is marketed
7892000	7894000	And priced relative to consoles
7894000	7896000	It's a really interesting comparison
7896000	7898000	The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS
7898000	7900000	To third party developers
7900000	7902000	Like you get those companies like Alienware
7902000	7906000	And stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there
7906000	7912000	You get the junk programs with a brand new PC that you buy
7912000	7914000	I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials
7914000	7916000	And stuff like that
7916000	7918000	I used to have all that
7918000	7920000	But with Dell
7920000	7922000	You get that a lot
7922000	7924000	Even with my ACES
7924000	7926000	There's a lot of ACES programs in there
7926000	7928000	I'm just worried I'm going to get all of that bogged down
7928000	7930000	In the SteamOS
7930000	7932000	And it's just going to be like a Windows PC again
7932000	7934000	And lastly, Retertainment says
7934000	7936000	The SteamOS seems to be tailored for people who have
7936000	7938000	Or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming
7938000	7940000	Problem is most people don't use their PC like that
7940000	7942000	Most people have PCs
7942000	7944000	They use for work, music, movies, games
7944000	7946000	And general dicking around on the internet
7946000	7948000	Also porn
7948000	7950000	If people want a device that is only for video games
7950000	7952000	They buy a console
7952000	7954000	I didn't really look at this
7954000	7956000	No not really
7956000	7958000	Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs
7958000	7960000	Hold on
7960000	7962000	Porn
7962000	7964000	Advanced Haptic Feedback
7964000	7966000	That they have with that
7966000	7968000	Advanced Haptic Feedback
7968000	7970000	And lastly, Retertainment says
7970000	7972000	The rest of his answer here
7972000	7974000	I didn't really look at the Steam Machine or the Steam Controller
7974000	7976000	As I do not plan to make any major purchases
7976000	7978000	Until I accomplish Project Buy-A-House
7978000	7980000	And in fact
7980000	7982000	It has a little touch screen on there
7982000	7984000	You could probably stream porn to that
7984000	7986000	While you play Team Fortress 2 or something
7986000	7988000	You can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2
7988000	7990000	First thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday
7990000	7992000	Porn
7992000	7994000	Alright
7994000	7996000	Moving on
7996000	7998000	Let's get back into some longer news here
7998000	8000000	And we'll get to the Skype line here
8000000	8002000	Hopefully before too long
8002000	8004000	1877 Game OLR
8004000	8006000	Or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
8006000	8008000	But first, Loki
8008000	8010000	Alright, so there was an announcement this week
8010000	8012000	That first leaked out
8012000	8014000	And then they kind of made their own announcement
8014000	8016000	Something coming to Xbox One
8016000	8018000	Is Xbox Fitness
8018000	8020000	Which is an app that uses Kinect
8020000	8022000	And what's kind of cool about it though
8022000	8024000	Is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there
8024000	8026000	Including Insanity
8026000	8028000	And I want to say P90X
8028000	8030000	Is one of the other ones that's in there
8030000	8032000	But all sorts of different trainers
8032000	8034000	It is kind of interesting though
8034000	8036000	Because I guess
8036000	8038000	The app will be free for Gold members
8038000	8040000	Through December 2014
8040000	8042000	Although it says there's some additional content
8042000	8044000	That you can purchase for it
8044000	8046000	And I guess in 2015
8046000	8048000	Unlimited access will also require
8048000	8052000	A separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee
8052000	8054000	As well as Xbox Gold
8054000	8056000	But
8056000	8058000	For those people that are really into fitness and stuff
8058000	8060000	And you know
8060000	8062000	I want to say it because I had co-workers that
8062000	8064000	Did the Insanity stuff
8064000	8066000	That DVD says fucking expensive
8066000	8068000	So if they've got that built in there
8068000	8070000	That's pretty cool
8070000	8072000	Especially if you're kind of a fitness
8072000	8074000	You know, enthusiast I guess
8074000	8076000	Health junkie
8076000	8078000	Yes, and it's probably a little better
8078000	8080000	Than was it that
8080000	8082000	Xbox
8082000	8084000	The Nike one that they had last year
8084000	8086000	That was kind of lame
8086000	8088000	This looks a little bit along the lines of
8088000	8090000	Kind of what they were trying to do with that
8090000	8092000	Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate
8092000	8094000	And all those features that they were touting before
8094000	8096000	But
8096000	8098000	Might be cool
8098000	8100000	Some of the trainers to be noted
8100000	8102000	Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton
8102000	8104000	Sean T
8104000	8106000	Kind of cool I guess
8106000	8108000	Not really my thing because
8108000	8110000	You know
8110000	8112000	I eat hamburgers
8112000	8114000	Yes
8114000	8116000	No no no not today, you had chicken nuggets
8116000	8118000	That's true
8118000	8120000	Here's the thing though about
8120000	8122000	Xbox Fitness, don't we already have
8122000	8124000	A million fucking fitness games on the Xbox
8124000	8126000	I mean I know this is for the new one
8126000	8128000	But doesn't the Kinect
8128000	8130000	Need to get out of this rut of dance
8130000	8132000	And fitness games, like show me something
8132000	8134000	New
8134000	8136000	Technically yeah, I mean there's about one or two every year
8136000	8138000	I mean there's Zumba, there's a new Zumba game this year
8138000	8140000	But there's only really about
8140000	8142000	One maybe
8142000	8144000	Two fitness games a year for
8144000	8146000	The Xbox 360
8146000	8148000	And Kinect
8148000	8150000	Actually I think it's been about one a year
8150000	8152000	So it's not a ton
8152000	8154000	But yeah I mean
8154000	8156000	Those are really the only games
8156000	8158000	That kind of effectively use the Kinect
8158000	8160000	Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect
8160000	8162000	Has been kind of crap
8162000	8164000	So I don't know
8164000	8166000	But yeah they're saying
8166000	8168000	Different workouts I guess
8168000	8170000	I guess from ten minutes to
8170000	8172000	One hour
8172000	8174000	They're going to have little routines that you can do
8174000	8176000	And stuff, I'm assuming this is tracked across
8176000	8178000	All the different
8178000	8180000	Ones you have, metamorphosis
8180000	8182000	They've got that in there as well
8182000	8184000	Ripton 30 from Jillian Michaels
8184000	8186000	So I don't know if you've got a
8186000	8188000	Fitness program that you're really into
8188000	8190000	But see once again though like Insanity
8190000	8192000	Unless you're one of those people that just borrowed
8192000	8194000	That set or something
8194000	8196000	Like if you already have it
8196000	8198000	You've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks
8198000	8200000	For it
8200000	8202000	You're probably not going to need this
8202000	8204000	I don't know
8204000	8206000	S2100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
8206000	8208000	Has a good point
8208000	8210000	The fitness things sell really well
8210000	8212000	They won't stray too far from a cash cow
8212000	8214000	And if you think about it though
8214000	8216000	You're probably paying for gold to play
8216000	8218000	Online multiplayer so
8218000	8220000	Why not? Check it out
8220000	8222000	Might be cool
8222000	8224000	Alright well moving on to other
8224000	8226000	Features on the Xbox One
8226000	8228000	The game DVR will work on Xbox Live
8228000	8230000	At launch but YouTube and Facebook
8230000	8232000	Sharing won't be enabled until 2014
8232000	8234000	So here's what game DVR
8234000	8236000	Does
8236000	8238000	Game DVR will save the previous five minutes
8238000	8240000	Of gameplay if you use a voice command
8240000	8242000	Xbox record
8242000	8244000	You can edit the piece in the upload studio
8244000	8246000	And then share it which would be
8246000	8248000	The YouTube Facebook thing later
8248000	8250000	These clips are saved in 720p
8250000	8252000	At 30 frames a second
8252000	8254000	Game DVR will only work if you
8254000	8256000	Have Xbox Live gold
8256000	8258000	So there you have it that's how it's going to work
8258000	8260000	That sounds dumb
8260000	8262000	Because it's saying that you have to do
8262000	8264000	Xbox record and then it records something
8264000	8266000	Whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where
8266000	8268000	Well no because it says previous five minutes of gameplay
8268000	8270000	If you say Xbox record so my thought is
8270000	8272000	If something funny happens and you say
8272000	8274000	That you can go back and edit it in the studio
8274000	8276000	That's my thought so like if something
8276000	8278000	Really funny happens you have a chance to react and say
8278000	8280000	Xbox record and that way it'll save it
8280000	8282000	So you know if you are
8282000	8284000	Playing an online game and hilarity ensues
8284000	8286000	Or whatever or I'm playing
8286000	8288000	Slenderman and I have a really scary
8288000	8290000	Ah moment although that's not on Xbox
8290000	8292000	Five minutes is not fair I don't know whatever
8292000	8294000	For a first person shooter it's enough
8294000	8296000	But like if I'm recording an online match or something
8296000	8298000	It might be ten minutes long I mean
8298000	8300000	And then this isn't the solution
8300000	8302000	That's why I have my
8302000	8304000	External one I guess
8304000	8306000	Yeah there still will be a value in that
8306000	8308000	So there you go Dark Sakura
8308000	8310000	Sorry I'm critiquing that
8310000	8312000	Image
8312000	8314000	Okay first of all they have it like it's levitating
8314000	8316000	But it's at the wrong angle for the
8316000	8318000	Level of shadow that they have
8318000	8320000	The Xbox one picture that was on the article
8320000	8322000	You were just reading
8322000	8324000	Whoever does their press materials needs to like
8324000	8326000	Go back and relearn Photoshop or something
8326000	8328000	Levitating consoles are so
8328000	8330000	Like Playstation 3 I mean
8330000	8332000	It was the evil baby that made the console
8332000	8334000	Levitate or the levitating
8334000	8336000	Console that made the evil baby I don't know
8336000	8338000	So EA Sports
8338000	8340000	Has put out a statement saying
8340000	8342000	That they are no longer making college
8342000	8344000	Games
8344000	8346000	Basically the general manager Cam Weber
8346000	8348000	Um and
8348000	8350000	I'm sorry of American uh
8350000	8352000	Who
8352000	8354000	Basically the one in charge of all the American football games
8354000	8356000	Basically is saying that
8356000	8358000	The college sports games are going away
8358000	8360000	That's meaning the NCAA games
8360000	8362000	Um they're also
8362000	8364000	Which they themselves put out an announcement
8364000	8366000	That they're letting their license expire
8366000	8368000	In 2014
8368000	8370000	And EA is not pursuing it
8370000	8372000	So they are not going to be doing
8372000	8374000	Any more college football
8374000	8376000	As in American football and not the real football
8376000	8378000	That you actually play with your feet
8378000	8380000	Um and they
8380000	8382000	Are not doing any other
8382000	8384000	College games that basically
8384000	8386000	They're letting it go
8386000	8388000	Bye
8388000	8390000	And the rest of us are like
8390000	8392000	Whoopty shit
8392000	8394000	You know I'm surprised though because that does kind of suck
8394000	8396000	Because it was a pretty big
8396000	8398000	Revenue stream for them even though
8398000	8400000	There was a lot of
8400000	8402000	You know you have to remember
8402000	8404000	Like for me I'm always like
8404000	8406000	Okay but college football is
8406000	8408000	Like a way bigger deal in other places than it is here
8408000	8410000	Exactly and in July
8410000	8412000	It really is pretty much the biggest game
8412000	8414000	Only big game coming out
8414000	8416000	Now it's going to be this big dead area
8416000	8418000	Which hopefully will be filled with something else
8418000	8420000	I'm from Alabama
8420000	8422000	And the biggest thing in the universe there
8422000	8424000	Is the rivalry between the University of Alabama
8424000	8426000	And Auburn University
8426000	8428000	And I know people who will probably be
8428000	8430000	Well I want my game this year
8430000	8432000	You know
8432000	8434000	And um
8434000	8436000	There's all there is to do
8436000	8438000	In Alabama is college football
8438000	8440000	And eat crawdads
8440000	8442000	Just saying
8442000	8444000	So maybe they could
8444000	8446000	I don't know
8446000	8448000	Go to church
8448000	8450000	It's kind of disappointing but at first I remember
8450000	8452000	I thought they were just going to put out a college football game
8452000	8454000	And be like EA Sports college football drop the NCAA
8454000	8456000	Thing and just do whatever
8456000	8458000	You would think that they would do something like that
8458000	8460000	Where they just make a game anyway but
8460000	8462000	I think they have to go through the NCAA
8462000	8464000	Yeah
8464000	8466000	Well I don't know they
8466000	8468000	For example they didn't ever
8468000	8470000	You know
8470000	8472000	License the
8472000	8474000	You know look and
8474000	8476000	You know names of the players and now they're in this big lawsuit
8476000	8478000	Which for example
8478000	8480000	They just settle for 40 million dollars
8480000	8482000	So
8482000	8484000	I'll settle for 40 million
8484000	8486000	That's probably why you know they're not doing a college game
8486000	8488000	Because you know they got into trouble
8488000	8490000	And there was a whole lawsuit against them for
8490000	8492000	Using the likenesses of these different players
8492000	8494000	Without actually giving them any sort of compensation
8494000	8496000	For it
8496000	8498000	So now of course you know
8498000	8500000	40 million dollars how exactly it's going to be
8500000	8502000	Split up who knows but
8502000	8504000	Probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game
8504000	8506000	Uh yeah
8506000	8508000	I mean it sucks for the fans you know even though I
8508000	8510000	Say like well that isn't really a big deal around these
8510000	8512000	Parts I understand there are some and I don't even
8512000	8514000	Really play these football games to begin with if it's not
8514000	8516000	Like tech mobile but I understand
8516000	8518000	Where people would be upset
8518000	8520000	About this and it sucks for you know
8520000	8522000	That group that looks forward to these games
8522000	8524000	Every year I wasn't happy
8524000	8526000	When DDR died
8526000	8528000	Well all they would have to do is just
8528000	8530000	Give up some of their profits I would think
8530000	8532000	Couldn't they have just licensed the actual player
8532000	8534000	Licenses and
8534000	8536000	You know paid the extra money
8536000	8538000	Or you know that would be too
8538000	8540000	Uh honest and so they can't do that
8540000	8542000	How much would they have to have paid
8542000	8544000	For all of those individual players
8544000	8546000	Versus what they paid out in
8546000	8548000	Uh fees for
8548000	8550000	The settlement they do it for Madden
8550000	8552000	So I don't understand why they can't do it for NCAA
8552000	8554000	Or even NBA Live
8554000	8556000	They do it for all their other sports games
8556000	8558000	SSG100Matt in our chat room says they could do
8558000	8560000	Something like what 2K did to get football back
8562000	8564000	I'm sure they'll have something after all remember
8564000	8566000	They did they tried to do NFL Blitz
8566000	8568000	So they could have another type of football
8568000	8570000	Game hell they even
8570000	8572000	They even experimented a little with rugby
8572000	8574000	A while back but
8574000	8576000	Arena football even so I don't know
8576000	8578000	They could do some more
8578000	8580000	A Puppy Bowl game
8580000	8582000	Huh? There was already
8582000	8584000	Jerry Rice and Nitus
8584000	8586000	Dog football so that's right
8586000	8588000	On the Wii I forgot about that well
8588000	8590000	Because it was on the Wii
8590000	8592000	It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin
8592000	8594000	With all the other late Wii games
8594000	8596000	Puppy Bowl party I can see Puppy Bowl
8596000	8598000	Nintendo get on that
8598000	8600000	Mhmm
8600000	8602000	These are uh yeah now that they have this team
8602000	8604000	Freed up they could make a Wii U game
8604000	8606000	Huh?
8606000	8608000	Haha
8608000	8610000	Yeah alright
8610000	8612000	Uh moving on uh here's a game
8612000	8614000	That uh I'm actually legit
8614000	8616000	Like really excited to play this game

8652000	8654000	So there you go the uh South Park
8654000	8656000	Stick of Truth game
8656000	8658000	Dark Soccer do you have any interest in this?
8658000	8660000	Huh?
8660000	8662000	It's gonna be awesome
8662000	8664000	Definitely gonna pick it up
8664000	8666000	I haven't thought South Park was remotely hilarious
8666000	8668000	Since ages ago
8668000	8670000	They I don't know they have their moments
8670000	8672000	Here sometimes yeah I have to admit though I haven't
8672000	8674000	Watched this trailer so can we take a moment
8674000	8676000	To look at this trailer? I guess
8680000	8682000	Is the audio gonna come through here at all?
8682000	8684000	Apparently
8688000	8690000	When evil rises
8692000	8694000	Don't let the brave prince's keys
8696000	8698000	There is only one
8698000	8700000	The new kid the new kid has a power
8700000	8702000	We have yet to understand
8702000	8704000	Who can save us
8704000	8706000	Step forward now
8706000	8708000	And fulfill your
8708000	8710000	And fulfill your
8712000	8714000	The audio on this is low sorry
8714000	8716000	You have some incredible ability
8716000	8718000	To make friends quickly new kid
8718000	8720000	I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my
8720000	8722000	Oh
8725120	8727120	Oh yay Mr. Slaves in there
8727120	8729120	Mr. Slave has a finishing move
8729120	8731120	Where he jumps on one of the enemies
8731120	8733120	And it sucks them into his ass
8750000	8752000	Yeah it's a pain but
8752000	8754000	This is the kind of stuff you put up with
8754000	8756000	Living in a remote little mountain town
8756000	8758000	At least we don't have to deal with traffic
8758000	8760000	I don't know
8760000	8762000	Here's why okay here's why I'm looking forward
8762000	8764000	To the Stick of Truth because like
8764000	8766000	There really should have been another South Park movie
8766000	8768000	I don't think I have ever laughed harder
8768000	8770000	In the theater in my life
8770000	8772000	Imaginary fun land or whatever
8772000	8774000	That was like a three episode arc
8774000	8776000	Of the show
8776000	8778000	And it wasn't as nearly as fun
8778000	8780000	And it wasn't as nearly as good as the movie
8780000	8782000	So I kind of feel like this is like
8782000	8784000	The next closest thing we're getting
8784000	8786000	To like a new movie
8786000	8788000	And that was all in game
8788000	8790000	And it looks just like the actual
8790000	8792000	The actual show so
8792000	8794000	It'll be pretty sweet
8794000	8796000	Alright well
8796000	8798000	We would be usually moving on
8798000	8800000	To the mailbag at this point
8800000	8802000	Except we got Jack and Shit
8802000	8804000	And Jack left town
8804000	8806000	So let us use
8806000	8808000	This music as a little opportunity
8808000	8810000	To remind y'all that it is the show
8810000	8812000	Where every gamer has a voice
8812000	8814000	As long as you use it
8814000	8816000	Yes but if we can't hear you
8816000	8818000	Then you don't get one
8818000	8820000	I promise I will
8820000	8822000	At least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on
8822000	8824000	Okay? One
8824000	8826000	Mailbag all one word
8826000	8828000	That's M-A-I-L
8828000	8830000	B-A-G
8830000	8832000	At
8832000	8834000	OrangeSongsRadio.com
8834000	8836000	Word
8836000	8838000	Well the dot separates the Orange Songs Radio
8838000	8840000	And the com
8840000	8842000	Shut up
8842000	8844000	Alright
8844000	8846000	Bitch you didn't even
8846000	8848000	Love you mean it
8848000	8850000	Hearts
8850000	8852000	Alright so that's it then
8852000	8854000	No emails this week for us to read
8854000	8856000	Oh well
8856000	8858000	This next segment will just have to be doubled
8858000	8860000	To make up for the time
8864000	8866000	This is bad
8866000	8868000	Here is justice
8868000	8870000	Here is punishment
8870000	8872000	Here
8872000	8874000	This is fucked up
8874000	8876000	FUs of the week time
8876000	8878000	Okay I have a couple
8878000	8880000	FU to the asshole wasp
8880000	8882000	Which all wasps are assholes
8882000	8884000	But this one was extra
8884000	8886000	Asshole by inviting himself into my car
8886000	8888000	And poking his butt in my finger
8888000	8890000	That was really rude
8890000	8892000	And I'm really allergic
8892000	8894000	Thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to them
8894000	8896000	So
8896000	8898000	Fuck you wasp
8898000	8900000	Fuck all wasps
8900000	8902000	The only good thing they do is eat plant destroying caterpillars
8902000	8904000	That's it
8904000	8906000	And there's other bugs that will do that too and birds
8906000	8908000	So fuck them
8908000	8910000	They're
8910000	8912000	Also
8912000	8914000	An FU to having certain illusions of
8914000	8916000	Mind shattered because I like to think
8916000	8918000	Better of my relatives
8918000	8920000	And then every so often they'll just
8920000	8922000	Say something that's completely dickish
8922000	8924000	And rude and
8924000	8926000	Racist and homophobic
8926000	8928000	And I'm like how did I
8928000	8930000	Turn out to be
8930000	8932000	Miss liberal socialist
8932000	8934000	Free thinker in California
8934000	8936000	Coming from that environment
8936000	8938000	Really how does that happen?
8938000	8940000	Or is it just that I was so overwhelmed with
8940000	8942000	The bullshit that I was like I need
8942000	8944000	To go and flew out of
8944000	8946000	Alabama with fire
8946000	8948000	Out of my ass or something I don't know
8948000	8950000	I just am completely baffled
8950000	8952000	How did this happen?
8952000	8954000	And also FU to
8954000	8956000	The bitch that wouldn't let me over
8956000	8958000	Even though I signaled for like
8958000	8960000	Ages and then every time
8960000	8962000	I'd speed up she'd speed up
8962000	8964000	The three people weaving in and out of
8964000	8966000	Traffic and the cop that didn't pull any
8966000	8968000	Of them over fuck all of them
8968000	8970000	Fuck them all and even though it's not
8970000	8972000	A fuck you because I'm PMS
8972000	8974000	Today so I'm just completely taking over this whole
8974000	8976000	Segment I would like to say
8976000	8978000	I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck
8978000	8980000	Eggs was not at
8980000	8982000	What are you doing?
8982000	8984000	Just keep going
8984000	8986000	Okay well there's a guy who sells duck
8986000	8988000	Eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted
8988000	8990000	To buy duck eggs and
8990000	8992000	He wasn't there and I was disappointed
8992000	8994000	But Rachel bought a rabbit
8994000	8996000	A dead rabbit A wascley wabbit
8996000	8998000	A frozen dead rabbit Poor rabbit
8998000	9000000	Mmm rabbit's delicious So it was
9000000	9002000	Rabbit season and not duck season
9002000	9004000	Yes
9004000	9006000	Yes
9006000	9008000	It was rabbit season
9008000	9010000	Okay sorry this is what I was trying to cue up
9010000	9012000	Since you're having an extra angsty week Dark
9012000	9014000	Sakura
9014000	9016000	Yoo hoo
9018000	9020000	It's the PMS
9020000	9022000	March
9022000	9024000	Well I am legit
9024000	9026000	PMS-ing so F you
9026000	9028000	Two cramps TMI
9028000	9030000	You know what I don't care
9030000	9032000	Okay guys in the universe
9032000	9034000	Women get cramps
9034000	9036000	We get bitchy
9036000	9038000	Fucking deal with it
9038000	9040000	Don't use it as an excuse for every time we get bitchy
9040000	9042000	My brain has a cramp now
9042000	9044000	Good
9046000	9048000	Good
9048000	9050000	Now you know a degree of my suffering
9050000	9052000	My job has been done
9054000	9056000	Alright Loki
9056000	9058000	Uh F you too
9058000	9060000	Thanks to YouTube's content ID service
9060000	9062000	Which is so fantastic
9062000	9064000	That they- Hey did you know that you're using
9064000	9066000	Licensed music in your stuff
9066000	9068000	Accept this copyright claim
9068000	9070000	Or deny it
9070000	9072000	Or contest it I will choose option 3
9072000	9074000	Do nothing is what I will do
9074000	9076000	But it's great though because on one of the
9076000	9078000	Videos I did get that on
9078000	9080000	Or that flag on
9080000	9082000	Was one of the ones I used an audio swap
9082000	9084000	Thanks to YouTube You know YouTube allows you to
9084000	9086000	Audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve
9087000	9089000	Yeah I know it's licensed music because
9089000	9091000	You told me to use that music
9091000	9093000	Instead of the licensed music
9093000	9095000	They had in that before
9095000	9097000	Our pal Travis from understation live
9097000	9099000	Unfortunately deals with this a lot
9099000	9101000	Like if he
9101000	9103000	Even uses like a little bit of a song
9103000	9105000	In his like hour and a half long
9105000	9107000	Understation live that goes up on YouTube
9107000	9109000	They flag it that's why he had to change the intro
9109000	9111000	Of the show and I'm like come on
9111000	9113000	It's ridiculous
9113000	9115000	It's ridiculous and they scam that
9115000	9117000	So what would they do? They scan all these videos
9117000	9119000	And they just send it to these music people
9119000	9121000	So that they can just complain out
9121000	9123000	What they should do is just have a service that
9123000	9125000	You know if these lawyers
9125000	9127000	Or whoever find these videos that infringe
9127000	9129000	Upon it then yes they can do a copyright thing
9129000	9131000	The thing is I don't believe the copyright
9131000	9133000	That
9133000	9135000	Content ID thing is actually
9135000	9137000	A copyright claim by them
9137000	9139000	But it does sometimes block it
9139000	9141000	From mobile apps and stuff like I tried watching
9141000	9143000	My video on a mobile app and
9143000	9145000	You can't see it
9145000	9147000	There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that
9147000	9149000	Because YouTube pulled one of his videos
9149000	9151000	Where he was using a copyrighted thing
9151000	9153000	But it was under fair use
9153000	9155000	And he's like I'm a copyright lawyer
9155000	9157000	This was fair for me to do
9157000	9159000	So he's suing YouTube
9159000	9161000	It's a real pain in the ass
9161000	9163000	Seriously
9163000	9165000	Why should we keep catering to these media companies
9165000	9167000	And stuff I mean the stuff that people are doing
9167000	9169000	On YouTube for the most part is pretty harmless
9169000	9171000	And they're just making it fucking difficult
9171000	9173000	For everybody
9173000	9175000	That's it that's all I've got
9175000	9177000	So I don't know
9177000	9179000	Also
9179000	9181000	I'm a pretty sure F you for
9181000	9183000	Trying to figure out how to make this case for my
9183000	9185000	Controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard
9185000	9187000	And I'm thinking I may need to do
9187000	9189000	Vacuum forming plastic which is
9189000	9191000	Going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig
9191000	9193000	To cook it basically
9193000	9195000	I have to build an oven and then
9195000	9197000	Some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff so
9197000	9199000	Alright that's all I got
9201000	9203000	My F you of the week just goes to the
9203000	9205000	Fact that there's a show in two weeks
9205000	9207000	Even though it'll be great I'm just like
9207000	9209000	Stress
9209000	9211000	Ah
9211000	9213000	But you know that'll pass like things
9213000	9215000	Usually do
9215000	9217000	Alright let's go back to
9217000	9219000	A few more news stories for you guys
9219000	9221000	Before we open up the Skype line
9221000	9223000	Loki
9223000	9225000	Alright so
9225000	9227000	We know that Sony is preparing their Gaikai
9227000	9229000	Service for the Playstation 4 to
9229000	9231000	Stream older Playstation
9231000	9233000	Games to the console since they don't
9233000	9235000	Have any sort of backwards compatibility
9235000	9237000	That's hardware based
9237000	9239000	But they're saying that hey you know what
9239000	9241000	We can actually use this to stream these games
9241000	9243000	To other consoles or other
9243000	9245000	Devices like PCs
9245000	9247000	TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones
9247000	9249000	Tablets so
9249000	9251000	You know their ultimate goal
9251000	9253000	Is to be able to stream those
9253000	9255000	Things to other devices
9255000	9257000	It'd be kind of funny if you could play a
9257000	9259000	Playstation 4 game with an Xbox One
9259000	9261000	If they had some sort of website or something
9261000	9263000	You can go to the stream this stuff
9263000	9265000	That would just be
9265000	9267000	Ridiculous
9267000	9269000	Although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through
9269000	9271000	The Xbox One's HDMI
9271000	9273000	In
9273000	9275000	Create some sort of black hole of death
9275000	9277000	With that
9277000	9279000	I don't know
9279000	9281000	It'll be neat but once again we'll have to see
9281000	9283000	How this Gaikai service works once it
9283000	9285000	Does launch next year for at least
9285000	9287000	America
9287000	9289000	We can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy
9289000	9291000	Indeed
9291000	9293000	Indeed
9293000	9295000	Alright one more story for you guys and we'll open up the
9295000	9297000	Skyline and this is about actually I think
9297000	9299000	Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show but that's alright
9299000	9301000	I'll recap it for y'all
9301000	9303000	Anyway this is of course
9303000	9305000	Out of Orlando, Florida
9305000	9307000	Only in Florida people
9307000	9309000	Only in Florida
9309000	9311000	A nine year old boy made a court appearance
9311000	9313000	On school weapon charges
9313000	9315000	And was sentenced to home confinement
9315000	9317000	Officials said that the boy
9317000	9319000	Brought multiple weapons to the school
9319000	9321000	At Hunter's Creek Wednesday
9321000	9323000	And of course this is
9323000	9325000	Going to tie into video games eventually folks
9325000	9327000	Bear with me here
9327000	9329000	Officer searched the bag and found the handgun
9329000	9331000	Six bullets, a steak knife and a sledge hammer
9331000	9333000	The guns all came from the father's home
9333000	9335000	And the boy is ordered to
9335000	9337000	Home confinement and said the parents
9337000	9339000	Need to keep any and all weapons away from him
9339000	9341000	The boy's father
9341000	9343000	Said he was playing a character
9343000	9345000	He learned from a video game
9345000	9347000	Of course he was
9347000	9349000	Let's see
9349000	9351000	The nine year old boy told three friends before school
9351000	9353000	That he had the weapons
9353000	9355000	Those three reported the information to a school resource officer
9355000	9357000	Who found the student and isolated him
9357000	9359000	School officials said
9359000	9361000	Protocols were followed and authorities were called
9361000	9363000	In to investigate
9363000	9365000	Now nowhere in this original story does it say what the game
9365000	9367000	Actually was that he was trying to emulate
9367000	9369000	But it was Minecraft
9369000	9371000	Yes
9371000	9373000	Minecraft
9373000	9375000	Not Grand Theft Auto people
9375000	9377000	Minecraft
9377000	9379000	Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game
9379000	9381000	And there really is no story to Minecraft
9381000	9383000	Aside from there's a guy named Steve
9383000	9385000	And there's zombies
9385000	9387000	I mean so
9387000	9389000	Yeah I don't know
9389000	9391000	It's
9391000	9393000	It's dumb
9393000	9395000	And there's no guns even in that
9395000	9397000	And I like how the boy's father
9397000	9399000	Oh he's just
9399000	9401000	He's just pretending
9401000	9403000	He's pretending to be in the game
9403000	9405000	Not oh why do I have all these guns available
9405000	9407000	So my nine year old can pick up a gun
9407000	9409000	You know and bring it to school
9409000	9411000	Yeah PacDeft in the chat room says
9411000	9413000	Irresponsible parents
9413000	9415000	We're not to blame it's the video game that teaches them
9415000	9417000	All the bad stuff
9417000	9419000	Yeah
9419000	9421000	And even so
9421000	9423000	Even if
9423000	9425000	They've allowed their child exposure to the game
9425000	9427000	They've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons
9427000	9429000	I want to know why CPS isn't involved
9431000	9433000	Okay
9433000	9435000	Um let's see
9435000	9437000	SSJ100Matt says please please
9437000	9439000	Someone hijack a horse and blame it on
9439000	9441000	Barbie's horse adventure
9441000	9443000	I'll do it
9443000	9445000	Or imagine horses
9445000	9447000	Amazing
9447000	9449000	I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club
9449000	9451000	And I'll name it Politary
9451000	9453000	And beat her
9453000	9455000	It's stupid though
9455000	9457000	It's like why do we even allow these excuses to
9457000	9459000	You know that's about as valid
9459000	9461000	Excuses like the voices in my head
9461000	9463000	Told me to do it
9463000	9465000	I mean come on if someone said that you're gonna be like okay that's ridiculous
9465000	9467000	But if like you know
9467000	9469000	Oh the video game told them to do it
9469000	9471000	Oh well that makes sense
9471000	9473000	Seriously what is wrong with people
9473000	9475000	He was a witch
9475000	9477000	Okay must be
9477000	9479000	Alright
9479000	9481000	That is it for our stories tonight
9481000	9483000	Please go to the skype line and open it up
9483000	9485000	1877 game OLR or our username on skype

9487000	9489000	And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight
9489000	9491000	Or maybe there's something we missed
9491000	9493000	That you would like to bring up
9493000	9495000	Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain
9495000	9497000	That is
9497000	9499000	I think the most recent Milli Vanilli
9499000	9501000	Reference I have seen
9501000	9503000	In the last
9503000	9505000	I know the first reference to them I've seen
9505000	9507000	In maybe the last five years
9507000	9509000	Ever since that guy passed away probably
9509000	9511000	So there you go
9511000	9513000	Not even from this country
9513000	9515000	We do have a couple tweets
9515000	9517000	Not a whole lot of them but we do have a few
9517000	9519000	From I thought we had some earlier in the week
9519000	9521000	I can't remember
9521000	9523000	Alright sorry if I missed yours
9523000	9525000	Cause it was too early in the week
9525000	9527000	But we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight
9527000	9529000	One of them is that China will be ending
9529000	9531000	A decade long ban on game consoles
9531000	9533000	I had no idea that they have this ban in place
9533000	9535000	Cause I thought there were like knock off consoles
9535000	9537000	And stuff that they sold in Japan
9537000	9539000	Wasn't the V
9539000	9541000	Wasn't the V something they sold in China?
9541000	9543000	It was some sort of weird TV
9543000	9545000	Console things
9545000	9547000	I don't know what the restrictions were exactly
9547000	9549000	Well that in Hong Kong was
9549000	9551000	Not under Chinese authority
9551000	9553000	For the longest time
9553000	9555000	And why was the ban in place in China?
9555000	9557000	Communism!
9557000	9559000	Well there was concern for the effects that games
9559000	9561000	Might have on young people
9561000	9563000	But the group was persuaded
9563000	9565000	Because gaming on computers
9565000	9567000	And internet cafes has taken off across
9567000	9569000	China or whatever so
9569000	9571000	There will soon be consoles sold
9571000	9573000	As part of new rules in a free trade
9573000	9575000	Zone in Shanghai
9575000	9577000	Don't know when the consoles will go on sale
9577000	9579000	But there you go so
9579000	9581000	I don't know if that means
9581000	9583000	Xbox and Playstation 3
9583000	9585000	Necessarily but probably some
9585000	9587000	Like local gaming devices
9587000	9589000	There
9589000	9591000	They're talking about something called
9591000	9593000	Something based on the Xbox
9593000	9595000	But not called the best pad
9595000	9597000	That again from a tweet that
9597000	9599000	Tigerclaw sent us
9599000	9601000	And one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls
9601000	9603000	At 1877 Game OLR
9603000	9605000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
9605000	9607000	One other article here from Tigerclaw
9607000	9609000	Says Nintendo teaming up with
9609000	9611000	Tesco for a Wii U
9611000	9613000	Fightback
9613000	9615000	Ah so
9615000	9617000	Let's see, Nintendo said
9617000	9619000	In an interview with MCV that too many people
9619000	9621000	Are unaware that the Wii U is a new
9621000	9623000	Console and they're going to do a
9623000	9625000	Giant campaign to educate people
9625000	9627000	Including Wii owners about this console
9627000	9629000	They've booked in-store space at
9629000	9631000	Tesco which is in the UK
9631000	9633000	Sending out a 5 page leaflet
9633000	9635000	To 300,000 Tesco customers
9635000	9637000	That have bought a Wii but haven't bought another
9637000	9639000	Console and give vouchers away
9639000	9641000	That will allow money off of games
9641000	9643000	There will also be TV ads for Mario
9643000	9645000	Donkey Kong and Zelda
9645000	9647000	Which will run continuously from half term
9647000	9649000	Until Christmas
9649000	9651000	I think they know, I just think they don't care
9651000	9653000	Yeah I don't think they really see
9653000	9655000	That must have game, but then there's
9655000	9657000	Mario and... I'm still irritated at
9657000	9659000	Tesco for selling fresh and easy
9659000	9661000	Yeah isn't that crazy?
9661000	9663000	I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed
9663000	9665000	So mad
9665000	9667000	Aren't they all closed now though?
9667000	9669000	No I think certain ones
9669000	9671000	Alright well that's... The one here is gone
9671000	9673000	That's it for Twitter topics, again I'll put
9673000	9675000	One more call out there for calls
9675000	9677000	1877 Game OLR
9677000	9679000	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call
9679000	9681000	Loki do we have any last minute stories?
9681000	9683000	There's just a quick mod
9683000	9685000	That someone's working on
9685000	9687000	Right now for Team Fortress 2
9687000	9689000	That you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer
9689000	9691000	That sounds kind of fun
9691000	9693000	Yeah it's called Star Fortress
9693000	9695000	And it's in pre-alpha
9695000	9697000	And if you want to check it out
9697000	9699000	It's...
9699000	9701000	I think Greyman Gaming
9701000	9703000	Is the Steam community
9703000	9705000	Group that they have
9705000	9707000	With man of course two ends
9707000	9709000	Like Team Fortress game
9709000	9711000	So
9711000	9713000	That's it
9713000	9715000	That's it huh? Slow news week
9715000	9717000	Um
9717000	9719000	No calls coming in either
9719000	9721000	I don't know
9721000	9723000	What do we do guys?
9723000	9725000	Let's have a poker party

9739000	9741000	1877 Game OLR

9757000	9759000	Or Twitter tweets help as well
9759000	9761000	Looks like someone's going to be trying
9761000	9765000	I can't think of anything else video game related
9765000	9767000	Except
9767000	9769000	Blah
9769000	9771000	Hey look
9771000	9773000	Oh there it is it's lighting up
9773000	9775000	Let's go to the phones
9775000	9777000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
9777000	9779000	It is Ron but the one who has come to save the day
9779000	9781000	Apparently what's up with that?
9781000	9783000	Well what's on your mind Rama?
9783000	9785000	Oh you don't want to know
9785000	9787000	But um
9787000	9789000	Here's a question I've been meaning to call about
9789000	9791000	Let me get your opinions on this
9791000	9793000	Now we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes
9793000	9795000	And reboots and stuff like that
9795000	9797000	But this is something they haven't done
9797000	9801000	Why is it they haven't taken
9801000	9803000	Wario and Waluigi
9803000	9805000	And put them in a game and call it
9805000	9807000	Super Wario Brothers
9809000	9811000	I'm also surprised that hasn't happened
9811000	9813000	But wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?
9813000	9815000	Well they have that Wario Land shake it
9815000	9817000	Which was a hand drawn game that looked fantastic
9817000	9819000	And it was pretty fun
9819000	9821000	But no one bought it and it was on the Wii
9821000	9823000	Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends almost
9825000	9827000	Who wants to play the bad guy?
9827000	9829000	Exactly you know
9829000	9831000	Me!
9831000	9833000	I want to be the villain
9833000	9835000	And if you think about Wario and Waluigi
9835000	9837000	Their abilities are different
9837000	9839000	So the game mechanics would be slightly different
9839000	9841000	But a little bit more fun to play
9841000	9843000	You know what actually on that token
9843000	9845000	If they really wanted to introduce
9845000	9847000	A Wario and Waluigi into a good platformer game
9847000	9849000	Why don't they do another one like
9849000	9851000	What we got a Super Mario 2
9851000	9855000	With Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi
9855000	9857000	I like the sound of that
9857000	9859000	Nintendo call me
9859000	9861000	We'll talk
9861000	9863000	Your people can call me and pay me
9865000	9867000	What other dream Nintendo games do you have
9867000	9869000	Rama?
9869000	9871000	That was the only one
9871000	9873000	I don't know it just popped in my head
9873000	9875000	They have
9875000	9877000	Wario series of games
9877000	9879000	I guess at the time I was thinking about
9879000	9881000	One of my favorite Game Boy games
9881000	9883000	Which was Super Mario Land 3
9883000	9885000	And I'm like
9885000	9887000	Why haven't he done that?
9889000	9891000	You know what I think you just need your own
9891000	9893000	Mario is missing game except
9893000	9895000	In the sequel Luigi is like I know
9897000	9899000	Exactly
9899000	9901000	And also I really think they should
9901000	9903000	Put the Wii U out without the gamepad
9903000	9905000	Because honestly
9905000	9907000	Maybe three out of the four games
9907000	9909000	That are out on the Wii U doesn't even use
9909000	9911000	The gamepad
9911000	9913000	Some of them use it really well though
9913000	9915000	Zombie U is a great example of a game
9915000	9917000	That's really enhanced for that gamepad
9917000	9919000	So
9919000	9921000	I like the gamepad but
9921000	9923000	Honest to god
9923000	9925000	For me the gamepad
9925000	9927000	And all that thing that's less of a concern
9927000	9929000	Than I still feel there's a lot of
9929000	9931000	Clunky shit on Nintendo's online
9931000	9933000	And although I like
9933000	9935000	Miiverse I don't think it's
9935000	9937000	Particularly convenient it's kind of
9937000	9939000	Slow and the internet on Nintendo's system
9939000	9941000	Can still be clunky
9941000	9943000	I just still feel like where Nintendo
9943000	9945000	Is going online isn't really
9945000	9947000	Like where they need to be
9947000	9949000	And I just you know I still remain really
9949000	9951000	Irritated that Virtual Console
9951000	9953000	Isn't
9953000	9955000	What we ought to see on a modern gaming
9955000	9957000	Console you know what I mean
9957000	9959000	Exactly
9959000	9961000	So but those are just you know
9961000	9963000	What do I know I still have a Wii U
9963000	9965000	And you know there are the games I do have on it
9965000	9967000	I enjoy and I know I will like the
9967000	9969000	New Mario game and I know I'll love the new
9969000	9971000	Mario Kart and you know what whatever they continue
9971000	9973000	To do in 2014 that will you know
9973000	9975000	Justify owning the system but
9975000	9977000	It is a little frustrating to see all the third parties
9977000	9979000	Abandoning ship I just I think a lot of them
9979000	9981000	Are being dicks
9981000	9983000	You know you're
9983000	9985000	Right cause even though the Wii U isn't
9985000	9987000	As powerful I mean
9987000	9989000	You can get somebody else to take like a top tier
9989000	9991000	Title and shove it into that
9991000	9993000	Little hardware and somehow make it work
9993000	9995000	They make shitty little
9995000	9997000	Computers for kids that will play
9997000	9999000	Games and I see ports of games
9999000	10001000	From big companies that end
10001000	10003000	Up on these things so
10003000	10005000	LeapFrog is just a little device
10005000	10007000	That's powered by
10007000	10009000	Flash that's a Shockwave
10009000	10011000	Flash Console
10015000	10017000	Alrighty well Rama if that's it
10017000	10019000	I'm gonna let you go and see if anybody else wants to call
10019000	10021000	Awesome. Alright have a good one buddy
10021000	10023000	You too. Alright bye bye now
10023000	10025000	Alright
10025000	10027000	We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else
10027000	10029000	Wants to call in 1877 Game OLR
10029000	10031000	Or username on Skype
10031000	10033000	OrangeLoungeRadio
10037000	10039000	I just I just considered something
10039000	10041000	During that phone call so I was asking
10041000	10043000	Ikuma-san if he'd clear it up for me
10043000	10045000	Yeah
10045000	10047000	Waluigi I wonder if it would be
10047000	10049000	If it's supposed to be the name as a pun
10049000	10051000	For Warui which is bad
10051000	10053000	Probably
10053000	10055000	Probably
10055000	10057000	I would think that the wa part and Wario
10057000	10059000	And Waluigi definitely would
10059000	10061000	Have to do with things being bad
10061000	10063000	There's a lot of little puns that don't always
10063000	10065000	Necessarily transfer over
10065000	10067000	But anyway let's go to the phones
10067000	10069000	Cause we got another call coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
10069000	10071000	Who's this?
10071000	10073000	Obi Wan Jibroni calling from the
10073000	10075000	United Kingdom
10075000	10077000	Oh my gosh
10077000	10079000	You are up late sir
10079000	10081000	I love your icon
10081000	10083000	Thank you very much
10083000	10085000	Also I want to say numero uno
10085000	10087000	On the leaderboard
10087000	10089000	Look at you yeah
10089000	10091000	You and Tigerclaw fighting to the death
10091000	10093000	On the VOG network leaderboards
10093000	10095000	Well you know what Sky I heard Tigerclaw
10095000	10097000	Likes being on top and that's okay
10097000	10099000	I think that was a little bit
10099000	10101000	That was a little bit of shade throwing here live
10101000	10103000	At OrangeLoungeRadio
10103000	10105000	All I can say is that Bobby and I are also tossing around
10105000	10107000	Some ideas to make the VOG game
10107000	10109000	Just a little bit sweeter in the future
10109000	10111000	But that's all I'll say for now
10111000	10113000	Awesome
10113000	10115000	Yeah my max has told me it's five
10115000	10117000	Hours
10117000	10119000	So what's on your mind buddy?
10119000	10121000	Well you know
10121000	10123000	There's been a lot of free to play
10123000	10125000	Games out there lately
10125000	10127000	There's been more free to play games than
10127000	10129000	They've fucked you know
10129000	10131000	So
10131000	10133000	I think this is a great thing because I'm 35 years old
10133000	10135000	Old gamer
10135000	10137000	Not that old
10137000	10139000	You're not that old
10139000	10141000	I'm older
10141000	10143000	You're a young lady
10143000	10145000	Oh I love you
10145000	10147000	I love you too
10147000	10149000	So
10149000	10151000	As we get older
10151000	10153000	As older gamers
10153000	10155000	I think we become more cheap
10155000	10157000	I mean
10157000	10159000	The 2DS
10159000	10161000	That's cool to me because
10161000	10163000	It's going to be cheap
10163000	10165000	It kind of looks kind of shitty
10165000	10167000	But I mean
10167000	10169000	The price
10169000	10171000	I think is going to appeal to a lot of older people
10171000	10173000	For cheap people
10173000	10175000	Like myself
10175000	10177000	I've got a 3DS at the minute
10177000	10179000	The original one
10179000	10181000	I've got a lot of friends
10181000	10183000	Who would be into that
10183000	10185000	The 2DS
10185000	10187000	Just because they don't want to spend the money
10187000	10189000	On the regular 3DS
10189000	10191000	But
10191000	10193000	I went off on a tangent
10193000	10195000	But yeah
10195000	10197000	Free to play is what I was going to mention
10197000	10199000	Sorry
10199000	10201000	This is my first time calling you guys
10201000	10203000	And as they say your first time is
10203000	10205000	That's alright
10205000	10207000	We'll go easy on you on your first time
10207000	10209000	The first time is a little rough
10209000	10211000	It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train
10211000	10213000	We're just all sitting here listening to your accent
10213000	10215000	So by all means talk away
10215000	10217000	And for the record I have several friends who've
10217000	10219000	Expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason
10219000	10221000	Especially one of them that has problems with 3D
10221000	10223000	So just saying
10223000	10225000	Yeah exactly
10225000	10227000	And if anyone's out there
10227000	10229000	If I've been to my accent and whatever
10229000	10231000	Feel free to let me know on Twitter
10231000	10233000	Or the comments on VOG
10235000	10237000	So free to play games
10237000	10239000	Do you play any of them?
10239000	10241000	Oh yeah
10241000	10243000	I've been pimping the shit
10243000	10245000	Out of Tekken Revolution
10245000	10247000	That's right
10247000	10249000	That was your comment that got me to play that game
10249000	10251000	Yeah I've been pimping the crap out of it
10251000	10253000	And yeah I love it
10253000	10255000	And I don't know if you've played
10255000	10257000	The latest one
10257000	10259000	Of course
10259000	10261000	Is it Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate
10261000	10263000	Call of Fighters or some shit
10263000	10265000	I saw that but I haven't played it
10265000	10267000	But I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one
10267000	10269000	Yeah yeah
10269000	10271000	Because I'm a huge fighting game fan
10271000	10273000	But the Dead or Alive one is kind of cool
10273000	10275000	It's free gigs I will say that
10275000	10277000	But it doesn't have
10277000	10279000	The token system
10279000	10281000	So you can play how much you want
10281000	10283000	It's one of those games where
10283000	10285000	If you want the story part of it
10285000	10287000	You've got to pay for it
10287000	10289000	So it's kind of like one of those games where
10289000	10291000	It unlocks
10291000	10293000	Pay to unlock is what I mean
10293000	10295000	Yeah but it's cool
10295000	10297000	I mean you can play online too
10297000	10299000	So that's kind of fun
10299000	10301000	You don't have to pay to unlock
10301000	10303000	Booby mechanics though do you
10303000	10305000	Because it is Dead or Alive
10305000	10307000	I'm not sure
10307000	10309000	Tekken Revolution's
10309000	10311000	Kind of been taking over
10311000	10313000	I think
10313000	10315000	Pay to unlock is better
10315000	10317000	When you have the expectation that it's going to be
10317000	10319000	Pay to unlock
10319000	10321000	Instead of just
10321000	10323000	Oh well we have this DLC
10323000	10325000	No you just gave us a code
10325000	10327000	Yeah at least it's not double dipping
10327000	10329000	Yeah when you know that you've got to unlock it
10329000	10331000	Pay a little bit more then I think it lessens the blow
10331000	10333000	Yeah
10333000	10335000	And I think the story portion
10335000	10337000	Of that Dead or Alive is kind of expensive
10337000	10339000	So you might as well just go out
10339000	10341000	And buy the full game
10341000	10343000	Also I wanted to mention
10343000	10345000	That Ridge Racer game
10345000	10347000	Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever
10347000	10349000	That's kind of
10349000	10351000	It's okay but like
10351000	10353000	I said in one of the comments before
10353000	10355000	I said when you crash
10355000	10357000	On the game it's like it's not game over
10357000	10359000	But you can keep carrying on playing
10359000	10361000	It's okay
10361000	10363000	But you know with that game
10363000	10365000	Every time I put it up now
10365000	10367000	It says server error
10367000	10369000	And I know you guys love this word
10369000	10371000	It's a beta
10371000	10373000	Or a beta wherever you live
10373000	10375000	We say beta obviously
10375000	10377000	I've heard beta
10377000	10379000	Yeah
10379000	10381000	This is okay it's not traditional Ridge Racer
10381000	10383000	In my opinion so I can't hear it
10383000	10385000	But it does have trophies
10385000	10387000	I keep forgetting there really are
10387000	10389000	A ton of free to play options on PlayStation
10389000	10391000	Right now
10391000	10393000	You mentioned one last week Rob called
10393000	10395000	You played a pinball free to play
10395000	10397000	That was called pinball stick
10397000	10399000	I was shouting at my pinball stick
10399000	10401000	I mentioned it again earlier tonight
10401000	10403000	Pinball is stick or something like that
10403000	10405000	Yeah I mentioned it again tonight
10405000	10407000	It's free
10407000	10409000	Hey
10409000	10411000	Yeah free is good
10411000	10413000	I mean you know
10413000	10415000	You gotta pay for handjobs or whatever these days
10415000	10417000	But I mean free
10417000	10419000	Free is good love it
10419000	10421000	I wish tech and stuff
10421000	10423000	On the Dead or Alive game was on
10423000	10425000	Xbox
10425000	10427000	But probably not gonna happen
10427000	10429000	But PS3 is okay I like the controller
10429000	10431000	I'm the minority who
10431000	10433000	Likes the PS3 controller
10433000	10435000	I love the PS3 controller
10435000	10437000	Need I remind everyone that Yaris
10437000	10439000	Was also free
10439000	10441000	Brad from
10441000	10443000	PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe
10443000	10445000	Is the best free to play on PS3
10445000	10447000	He's our DC fanboy
10447000	10449000	As far as MMOs go
10449000	10451000	It's way better than that free realms
10451000	10453000	Marvel Heroes is pretty good for
10453000	10455000	Steam
10455000	10457000	But it's Marvel and there's Jessica Jones in it
10457000	10459000	And I'm happy
10459000	10461000	I did try DC Universe
10461000	10463000	Took forever to download
10463000	10465000	My PS3 is on wireless
10465000	10467000	It took
10467000	10469000	Just like three days
10469000	10471000	It was a terrible experience
10471000	10473000	It took up so much space
10473000	10475000	I mean
10475000	10477000	The PS3 is a great system
10477000	10479000	But there's annoyances
10479000	10481000	It's really ridiculous
10481000	10483000	I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy
10483000	10485000	Some of my files over to that
10485000	10487000	I can copy save games
10487000	10489000	But I'm not getting any space by copying
10489000	10491000	Save games to my drive
10491000	10493000	Or send over
10493000	10495000	Some of these really large games
10495000	10497000	To play off the drive
10497000	10499000	Anyway Obi-Wan, Jabroni
10499000	10501000	It's so good to hear from you
10501000	10503000	That icon you have
10503000	10505000	That Dark Soccer loves
10505000	10507000	I just want to make sure all the listeners hear this
10507000	10509000	It says keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis
10509000	10511000	With a PlayStation 1 console
10511000	10513000	Well thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice
10513000	10515000	Yes
10515000	10517000	It's a PlayStation 1 console
10517000	10519000	Plugged into the port 2
10519000	10521000	If anyone gets that reference
10521000	10523000	Also can I say one quick thing
10523000	10525000	Before I go
10525000	10527000	Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection
10527000	10529000	Bye bye bye
10529000	10531000	For everyone
10531000	10533000	Because I'm a huge MGS fan
10533000	10535000	Everyone knows I follow me on Twitter
10535000	10537000	Basically
10537000	10539000	Please stay super exclusive
10539000	10541000	But holy shit, value for money
10541000	10543000	It's awesome
10543000	10545000	One more thing if that's ok before I go
10545000	10547000	Queen Elizabeth
10547000	10549000	Can suck my motherfucking nuts
10549000	10551000	Because that's why
10551000	10553000	Everything is so fucking expensive
10553000	10555000	That's why I'm paying $429
10555000	10557000	For an Xbox One
10557000	10559000	We need to all just move to our own island
10559000	10561000	And call it fuck everyone else
10563000	10565000	We are the island nation of awesome
10565000	10567000	Fuck the rest of you
10567000	10569000	This is probably the only
10569000	10571000	Internet video gaming show where people will call in
10571000	10573000	To tell off the Queen of England
10573000	10575000	Alright
10575000	10577000	Have a good one my friend
10577000	10579000	Bye
10579000	10581000	That was a great call
10581000	10583000	I love hearing from the overseas people
10583000	10585000	It's great
10585000	10587000	You are up way early or late
10587000	10589000	I have a feeling he's up early
10589000	10591000	Because he missed me talking about the pinball game
10591000	10593000	He's 8 hours ahead of us
10593000	10595000	I'm going to close up
10595000	10597000	Skype
10597000	10599000	I know Act F was trying to ring in
10599000	10601000	But I think he was just trying to be nice
10601000	10603000	I'm going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show
10603000	10605000	I'm out of here for the night
10605000	10607000	But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts
10607000	10609000	I just want to say once again
10609000	10611000	Thank you so much for tuning into

10635000	10637000	And I just want to let you know we so appreciate you guys
10637000	10639000	Thank you, thank you, thank you

10643000	10645000	For us to do this show for 11
10645000	10647000	Plus years going
10647000	10649000	You know what? I'm going to make my
10649000	10651000	Dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight
10651000	10653000	I'm installing WoW
10653000	10655000	Oh my gosh
10655000	10657000	You know what reminded me that I still had
10657000	10659000	WoW installed?
10659000	10661000	First
10661000	10663000	You're starting to sound like Gimmet
10663000	10665000	Which we'll hear about on Wednesdays Hoard House
10665000	10667000	Plug, plug, plug
10667000	10669000	It's already replaced WoW in my heart
10669000	10671000	And besides that I watched the fuckery that was
10671000	10673000	The end of the Orgrimmar thing
10673000	10675000	And fuck that I'm glad I quit
10675000	10677000	Alright
10677000	10679000	That is it
10679000	10681000	We're done
10681000	10683000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in
10683000	10685000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night
10685000	10687000	Loki, your final thought tonight
10687000	10689000	Hope to see you there
10689000	10691000	Sounds good
10691000	10693000	My final thought is Final Fantasy XIV this week
10693000	10695000	End of line, free company
10695000	10697000	On the Midgarcimer server, hope to see you there
10697000	10699000	Dark Sakura
10699000	10701000	Fucking wasps
